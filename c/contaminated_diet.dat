A 4 week experimental period corresponding to a daily intake in the range of 132. 2 - 146. 1 mugOTA/kg bw decreased the rat body weight gains, as compared to the controls. The adsorbents did not significantly alleviate the growth depression caused by the <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet.</b> However, a significant protective effect of MWF was observed in terms of OTA concentration in plasma (40. 5 % decrease), kidney (28. 1 % decrease) and liver (38. 8 % decrease). Mixing this sorbent with the YCW did not significantly improve its protective activity against OTA. The faecal OTA concentrations were higher for the MWF and MWF+YCW treated animals, as compared to the positive control (group II). Taken together, these results suggest that MWF are a promising tool to counteract the toxic effects of OTA naturally contaminated diets...|$|E

In two feeding trials using a total of 220 weaner pigs the hypothesis was tested that apple pomace alleviates the negative effects of Fusarium toxins. The two experiments had a 2 x 2 factorial design: Fusarium contaminated and uncontaminated wheat, and 8 % apple pomace and no pomace in the diet. In both trials, the animals receiving the mycotoxin <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> without pomace gained less weight than the pigs receiving either uncontaminated diets without pomace (p = 0. 03 and = 0. 11) or <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> with pomace (p = 0. 07 and = 0. 03). In the second trial, female piglets receiving the <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> which contained zearalenone as well as DON had heavier uteri than those on uncontaminated diets (p = 0. 003), regardless of apple pomace supplementation.

Pregnant sows were fed with naturally <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> from days 35 to 70 (experiment 1), or from days 75 to 110 (experiment 2), or with control diets. Fetal hepatic IGF transcripts were determined at days 70 and 110, maternal transcripts at day 70 by qPCR. Highest levels of IGF-I transcripts were found in sows. Contrary, IGF-II was predominantly expressed in fetuses at day 70. Expression of IGF-IR and IGFBP- 3 decreased, whereas that of IGFBP- 2 increased towards term. IGF-IIR and IGFBP- 1 expression was similar in both, fetuses and full-term piglets. IGF-IIR showed reduced levels in the maternal liver. Exposure of pregnant sows to DON and ZON <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> significantly reduced the maternal and tended to reduce the weight gain of piglets in experiment 2 but had no effects on hepatic levels of IGF transcripts in both experiments.

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} different dose of aflatoxins, secondary toxic metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus, on some biochemical parameters in kidney of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Methods: This study was done in Aquaculture and Biology Laboratory of Behbahn Khatam Alanbia University of Technology, Behbahan, Iran in 2015. Fishes were distributed into five groups: Group I-III was fed <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> with 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 4 mg kg- 1 feed, respectively. Group IV was fed <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> with extraction solution (methanol, acetone, and diluted water) as a positive control. Control group received normal feed (Group V). After 21 d of experiment, activities of cellular enzymes and oxidative stress biomarker were evaluated. Results: Aflatoxins (0. 7 and 1. 4 mg kg- 1) caused {{a significant increase in}} ALT activity. Although, significant increase of LDH activity (P< 0. 05) were found in kidney of fish fed <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with 0. 5 mg kg- 1 of aflatoxins, LDH activity was significantly decreased in kidney of fish fed <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with 0. 7 and 1. 4 mg kg- 1 of aflatoxins.

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of these feed contaminants on the intestinal morphology and microbiota composition, and to evaluate whether FBs predispose broilers to necrotic enteritis. One-day-old broiler chicks were divided into a group fed a control diet, and a group fed a FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> (18. 6 mg FB 1 +FB 2 /kg feed). A significant increase in the plasma sphinganine/sphingosine ratio in the FBs-treated group (0. 21 ± 0. 016) compared to the control (0. 14 ± 0. 014) indicated disturbance of the sphingolipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, villus height and crypt depth of the ileum was significantly reduced by FBs. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed a shift in the microbiota composition in the ileum in the FBs group compared to the control. A reduced presence of low-GC containing operational taxonomic units in ileal digesta of birds exposed to FBs was demonstrated, and identified as a reduced abundance of Candidatus Savagella and Lactobaccilus spp. Quantification of total Clostridium perfringens in these ileal samples, previous to experimental infection, using cpa gene (alpha toxin) quantification by qPCR showed an increase in C. perfringens in chickens fed a FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> compared to control (7. 5 ± 0. 30 versus 6. 3 ± 0. 24 log 10 copies/g intestinal content).

40|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} fungal metabolites, which frequently contaminate {{feed and}} food raw materials. The Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FBs) {{are the most}} frequently detected mycotoxins on a worldwide basis. The majority of feed samples however comply with European Union (EU) maximum guidance levels. The EU maximum guidance level for poultry feed is set at 5 mg DON/kg feed and 20 mg fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) + fumonisin B 2 (FB 2) /kg feed. Although these low to moderate contamination levels do not result in obvious clinical symptoms of intoxication, they may impair intestinal health, immune function and/or pathogen fitness, resulting in altered host pathogen interactions and thus a different outcome of eventual infections. Necrotic enteritis (NE) {{is one of the}} economically most important enteric diseases in poultry production. NE in broiler chickens may arise when changes in the gut microbial homeostasis allow colonization of the virulent Clostridium perfringens strains expressing the NetB toxin gene. The presence of predisposing factors such as coccidiosis and fishmeal is required in the pathogenesis of NE, allowing the proliferation of C. perfringens by either providing nutrients and/or favorable ecological niches. The general aim of this thesis was to examine whether DON and FBs, at concentrations in the feed approaching EU maximum guidance levels, predispose for NE in broiler chickens; and to gain insights in the mechanisms responsible for this interaction. Chapter 1 describes an experimental C. perfringens infection study in order to evaluate the predisposing effect of DON exposure to the development of NE in broiler chickens. After C. perfringens challenge, DON significantly increased the percentage of birds developing subclinical NE compared to the control group (47 ± 3. 0 % vs. 20 ± 2. 6 %). A negative impact of DON was demonstrated on intestinal morphology and the intrinsic component of the intestinal barrier, which is composed of the epithelial cell layer and the tight junctions that interconnect these epithelial cells. Consequently, this intestinal damage led to an increased luminal protein content by leakage of plasma proteins or altered absorption of dietary proteins, which stimulate clostridial proliferation and subsequently the development of NE. In Chapter 2 the impact of feeding a FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> on the intestinal morphology and microbiota composition was studied. The uptake of FBs contaminated feed also induced a negative impact on the intrinsic component of the intestinal barrier, and on the intestinal microbiota as well. A reduced abundance of the immunomodulating bacteria Candidatus Savagella and Lactobacillus spp. such as L. johnsonii, and an increased number of C. perfringens were observed in the ileum of birds fed a FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet.</b> Subsequently, an experimental C. perfringens infection study was performed investigating the predisposing effect of FBs exposure to the development of NE in broiler chickens. After C. perfringens challenge, a significant higher percentage of birds developed subclinical NE in the group fed a FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> compared to the control group (45 ± 2. 2 % vs. 30 ± 5. 5 %). In Chapter 3, the impact of DON and FBs on the intestinal barrier was further examined for selected functional and structural extrinsic components of the intestinal barrier, to gain insights in the associated consequences for intestinal colonization and nutrient availability for C. perfringens. In the first part (Chapter 3. 1), a negative impact of feeding broiler chickens a DON and/or FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> on intestinal mucus layer integrity was observed and induction of oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells. The last study (Chapter 3. 2) investigated whether DON-induced intestinal damage influences the intestinal absorption of FBs, which may lead to an altered systemic exposure and increased toxic effects of the latter mycotoxin in broiler chickens. Although, no differences in toxicokinetic parameters of FB 1 could be demonstrated between chickens fed a DON <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> compared to birds fed a control diet. This doctoral thesis demonstrates {{for the first time that}} feeding a DON or FBs <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> is a predisposing factor for the development of C. perfringens induced NE in broiler chickens. This coincides with negative effects on selected components of the intrinsic and extrinsic intestinal barrier of the chicken host, i. e. villus height, tight junctions, mucus, oxidative stress, and microbiota homeostasis. Consequently, exposure to DON and/or FBs at concentrations approaching the EU maximum guidance level in feed provides both nutrients and a favorable ecological niche for clostridial proliferation. Therefore, this doctoral thesis demonstrates that in addition to the best-known predisposing factors, DON and/or FBs contaminated feed should be included as major risk factor for the development of C. perfringens induced NE in broiler chickens...|$|E

The effect of nine experimental treatments was assessed using 216 one-d-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks in a randomized complete design with 4 replicates of 6 birds each from one to 21 days of age. The effects of dietary AFB 1 and MTS on serum biochemistry factors, antibody titer against Newcastle disease (ND) and influenza disease (ID) in broilers were evaluated {{at the end of this}} period.

The gastrointestinal tract represents the first barrier met by exogenous food/feed compounds. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate the effects of DON and FB, alone and in combination, on some intestinal parameters, including morphology, histology, expression of cytokines and junction proteins. A total of twenty-four 5 -week-old piglets were randomly assigned to four different groups, receiving separate diets for 5 weeks: a control diet; a <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with either DON (3 mg/kg) or FB (6 mg/kg); or both toxins. Chronic ingestion of these <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> induced morphological and histological changes, as shown by the atrophy and fusion of villi, the decreased villi height and cell proliferation in the jejunum, and by the reduced number of goblet cells and lymphocytes. At the end of the experiment, the expression levels of several cytokines were measured by RT-PCR and some of them (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IFN-γ, IL- 6 and IL- 10) were significantly up-regulated in the ileum or the jejunum. In addition, the ingestion of <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> reduced the expression of the adherent junction protein E-cadherin and the tight junction protein occludin in the intestine. When animals were fed with a co-contaminated diet (DON+FB), several types of interactions were observed depending on the parameters and segments assessed: synergistic (immune cells); additive (cytokines and junction protein expression); less than additive (histological lesions and cytokine expression); antagonistic (immune cells and cytokine expression). Taken together, the present data provide strong evidence that chronic ingestion of low doses of mycotoxins alters the intestine, and thus may predispose animals to infections by enteric pathogens...|$|R

In this study, 200 one day old Arian 386 broiler chickens were used in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments, 4 replications and 10 chicks per each treatment. Experimental groups were as follows: negative control fed basal diet; positive control fed basal diet plus 1 mg aflatoxin B 1 kg- 1 diet; and three other groups fed 25 g/kg Milbond-TX, Polysorb and Zeolite with 1 mg/kg aflatoxin B 1, respectively. Feed intake did not significantly differ between the groups. The body weight gain and feed conversion ratio of birds fed <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> were significantly decreased and increased, respectively but adding of the absorbent materials to contaminated feed caused a significant improvement in body weight gain and feed conversion. Among the internal organs, the spleen relative weights increased by consumption of aflatoxin B 1 contaminated feed.

40|$|Introduction The {{occurrence}} of mycotoxins in foods and feeds {{is a problem}} of major concern in all over the world. Profitability of poultry production can be greatly affected due to the frequency of feed contamination and the detrimental effects of these toxins on the performance. Aflatoxins, a group of closely related and biologically active mycotoxins, are produced by strains of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. They commonly occur as natural contaminant of poultry feeds. Domestic animal species such as chickens, ducks, cattle and turkeys consuming sublethal doses of aflatoxins for several days developed a toxic syndrome in which liver damage was the most significant change. The biological effects of aflatoxins could be categorized into two groups, long term and short term effects. Long term effects included chronic toxicity, cancer, birth defects and genetic alterations. Aflatoxins affected all poultry species, although they generally take relatively high levels to cause mortality, low levels can be detrimental if continually fed. Material and Methods This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of mineral, organic toxin absorbents, humic acid and yeast cell wall on performance and internal organs weight of broilers in experimental aflatoxicosis. This study was conducted in a completely randomize design with 432 Ross- 308 broilers with 9 treatments, 4 replicates and 12 broilers in each replicate. Treatments included diet without aflatoxin, 2 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin, 3 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 20 Humic acid, 4 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 40 Humic acid, 5 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 60 Humic acid, 5 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 80 Humic acid, 6 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 80 Humic acid, 7 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 1. 00 Humic acid, 8 : <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 50 sodium bentonite, 9 : diet with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 10 yeast cell wall.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of necrotic enteritis (NE) {{is a complex}} process requiring one or a number of predisposing factors rather than just the presence of pathogenic Clostridium perfringens. Examples are dietary influences, such as high levels of non-starch polysaccharides and fishmeal, and factors that evoke epithelial cell damage, such as Fusarium mycotoxins in feed and Eimeria infections. Recent {{studies have shown that}} different predisposing factors induce similar shifts in the intestinal microbiota composition. Butyrate-producing-strains of the Ruminococcaceae family are decreased in abundance by both fishmeal and Eimeria. Similarly, a decreased abundance of butyrate-producing-strains belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family has been induced by fishmeal. Also shifts are observed in the lactic acid-producing bacteria, such as decreased abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii or Weissella confusa, when broilers were fed a fishmeal-based diet or a Fusarium mycotoxin <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet.</b> Finally, the abundance of Candidatus Savagella was decreased in broilers following Eimeria challenge or feeding a fumonisins <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet.</b> The nature of the microbiota shifts indicate that immune modulatory actions of the intestinal microbiota may {{play a critical role in}} the effect on the necrosis inducing activity of C. perfringens. Indeed, colonization with butyrateproducing bacteria plays a key role in counteracting inflammation in the gut and preserving intestinal integrity, while Candidatus Savagella is involved in stimulating Th 17 and immunoglobulin A responses. Lactic acid bacteria stimulate colonization of lactate-utilizing and butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae.

Therefore the ability of Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) to alleviate hepatotoxicity induced by organophosphate pesticide dimethoate was investigated. Albino male rats were divided randomly into 4 groups and kept at 7 animals per group in an environmentally controlled condition for 6 weeks. The first group was served as a control group (basal diet), the second group fed on basal diet supplemented with 5 % freeze dried pomegranate seeds, the third group fed on 20 ppm dimethoate <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> and the last group fed on dimethoate <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> supplemented with 5 % freeze dried pomegranate seeds. The results revealed that administration of dimethoate caused high significant increased in liver functions: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities as well as lipid peroxide (malonaldhyde, MDA); on the other hand high significant decreased on glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), albumin and total protein were observed. However addition of 5 % freeze dried pomegranate seeds significantly improved all previously mentioned parameters. These results indicate the dimethoate induced hepatotoxicity and highlight the protective effect of pomegranate seeds as a potential protective agent against dimethoate induced hepatotoxicity. This may be attributed to the powerful antioxidants (polyphenols, total phenols, and total flavonoids) which present in high levels in pomegranate as well as improving the immunity by activation of antioxidant enzymes GSH and GPx...|$|E

Acetamiprid, deltamethrin, and cartap chloride were most toxic when directly sprayed on the bees. Cyromazin and pyriproxyfen caused low mortality rates to A. mellifera, whereas flufenoxuron caused moderate mortality when fed to adult bees...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologySteven S. DritzCassandra K. JonesBiological hazards {{in animal}} feed are {{a growing concern}} for the feed industry. Porcine {{epidemic}} diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be transmissible in swine feed and feed ingredients. This led to investigations identifying the magnitude of transmissible risk PEDV imposes and strategies to mitigate infectivity in <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets.</b> The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate the minimum infectious dose of PEDV in virus-inoculated feed. Pigs became infected when PEDV concentrations at or above 5. 6 × 10 ¹ 50 % tissue culture infectious dose/g (TCID₅₀/g); corresponding feed cycle threshold (Ct) of 37 or below was utilized. Evaluation of a mitigation strategy for PEDV <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> is also important since cross-contamination during feed manufacturing is possible. Therefore, the objective of the second experiment was to determine the effectiveness of feed batch sequencing as a method to minimize the risk of PEDV cross-contamination. This method was effective to reduce but not eliminate infectious PEDV carryover risk. Furthermore, feed that lacked detectible PEDV RNA as analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (qPCR) was infectious. The third study was an observational study complementary to the previous experiment where the magnitude of virus contamination in the feed manufacturing facility was characterized during feed batch sequencing. Widespread contamination of the facility occurred and surfaces remained contaminated until chemically cleaned. The final experiment was conducted to assess PEDV RNA detection in feed and spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) when analyzed by qPCR across 5 diagnostic laboratories. Overall, it appears qPCR PEDV RNA detection in feed and SDPP was precise as quantified by low coefficient of variation across laboratories, {{with the exception of one}} %CV from SDPP inoculated with low virus load from one laboratory. Although the magnitude of the Ct value difference was large in only 1 of 5 laboratories, comparisons of Ct values across laboratories should be interpreted cautiously. Finally, qPCR can be a useful surveillance tool for detection of PEDV RNA in non-clinical samples such as feed and SDPP...|$|R

Healthy larvae were randomly selected and used for the bioassay. Twenty-five grams of freshly prepared artificial diet (for diet ingredients and rearing conditions (Fukova et al. 2005)) was inoculated with 1  ml of the bacterial suspension prepared as described above for each isolate. For the control group, 25  g of the artificial diet had 1  ml of the sterile PBS added. The <b>contaminated</b> artificial <b>diets</b> were separately placed into plastic boxes (20 [*]×[*] 10 [*]×[*] 8  mm) with ventilated lids to permit airflow. After that, ten third instar C. pomonella larvae were placed into the box for each replicate and allowed to feed on the <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets.</b> A total of ten larvae were used for each replicate, and all experiments were repeated three times. Finally, the plastic boxes were incubated at 25  °C under 16 : 8 (day:night) light regime. After 10  days, the boxes were checked for larval mortality, and the number of dead larvae was recorded. Mortality data were corrected based on Abbott’s formula (Abbott 1925). To determine the differences among the isolates and the control group, the data were subjected to ANOVA and subsequently to the LSD multiple comparison test. Before performing ANOVA, all data were tested for homogeneity of variance using Levene’s statistic. All tests were performed with SPSS 16.0 statistical software.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe insect growth {{regulators}} (IGRs) are ecdysone or {{juvenile hormone}} mimics, or chitin synthesis inhibitors. They {{are more likely}} to be hazardous to larval insects than to adults. Application of JH mimics to adult honey bees may affect foraging behaviour and some physiological traits. Topical and feeding tests revealed that application of IGRs to larvae may result in death and larval ejection by workers, malformed larvae and pupae with typical rimmed eyes, or malformed adults. Several laboratory "larvae tests" using artificially <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> have been described for honey bees and bumble bees. Field and cage methods have also been published for honey bees and bumble bees respectively.

40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg) is an aquatic pollutant. It is {{produced}} from HgS by {{the action of}} sulphate-reducing bacteria and is released in fresh waters. MeHg is bioaccumulated through the trophic chain and is known to cause different health troubles (trembling, memory loss, anemia and kidney deficiency). Toxic exogenous substances, such as MeHg, are transformed by liver’s metabolic pathway, making this the starting point of vertebrate detoxication. Almost 50 % of MeHg assimilated in hepatocytes is accumulated in mitochondria (Ware et al., 1975) and It has been suggested that it may uncouples OXPHOS (Mori et al., 2007).

However, there is a paucity of research investigating the effects of contaminated sediment on native Australian benthic teleosts. As part of an ecotoxicological assessment of contaminated marine sediments in northern Tasmania, CYP 1 A induction, histological and growth response of the greenback flounder, Rhombosolea tapirina, exposed to contaminated marine sediments were examined. Hatchery reared flounder were exposed to reference sediment, contaminated sediment or <b>contaminated</b> sediment and <b>diet</b> for 6 weeks. CYP 1 A induction, using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, and the histological and growth response in the flounder were examined on cessation of the exposure trial. Significant {{differences were found between}} treatments in histological, growth and EROD response. Exposure to <b>contaminated</b> sediment and <b>diet</b> elicited a multi-organ histological response: principally partial and total epidermal erosion and multifocal necrosis of the liver. The prevalence of total epidermal erosion was greatest with exposure to disturbed contaminated sediment (66. 65 ± 16. 65 %). The prevalence of multifocal necrosis of the liver was greatest with exposure to contaminanted sediment and diet (66. 65 ± 16. 65 %). Growth reduction, measured as percentage growth inhibition, was evident in flounder exposed to <b>contaminated</b> sediment and <b>diet</b> (18. 2 ± 11. 99 %).

Multiplication of faecal coliforms occurred when there was a delay of more than 4 h between preparation and consumption of food. All samples were more contaminated in the rainy than in the dry season. Strategies to reduce contamination should therefore focus on 'wet' foods, early consumption after preparation, and re-heating of left-over foods. Understanding the reasons for the faulty practices is also essential to the formulation of effective measures...|$|E

The third group also received the <b>contaminated</b> <b>diet</b> but with corn starch. The fourth group was fed on a common non-contaminated diet. The experiment lasted for four weeks. Chicks fed the fungi-contaminated diet were characterised by a considerable reduction in body weight gain and relative growth rate, an increased feed conversion and a mortality rate of 33 %. The addition of the proteinrich supplement improved all parameters of growth performance and decreased mortality rate.

Animals were sacrificed after 0. 33, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 18, 36 and 63 days following access to contaminated food. At each time point, chemical concentrations in blood, liver, brain, gonad, adipose and remaining whole carcass was determined. Whole body concentrations of PCB 153 increased linearly with time over the experiment indicating that the birds did not reach steady state with their food after 63 days. Tissue/plasma concentration ratios were plotted as a function of time to determine time to inter-tissue steady state for fast and slowly perfused tissues. Liver, brain and gonad achieved steady state concentrations with plasma in less than 3 days, whereas fat and carcass tissues required 9. 7 and 11. 5 days, respectively.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the effects of feeding barley naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins on growth performance, vulva swelling, and digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein of gilts and the recovery of gilts fed normal diets immediately after the exposure to <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> by measuring growth performance and vulva swelling. In Exp. 1, four diets were prepared to contain 0 %, 15 %, 30 %, or 45 % contaminated barley containing 25. 7 mg/kg deoxynivalenol and 26. 0 μg/kg zearalenone. Sixteen gilts with an initial body weight (BW) of 33. 3 kg (standard deviation = 3. 0) were individually housed in a metabolism crate and assigned to 4 diets with 4 replicates in a randomized complete block design based on BW. During the 14 -d feeding trial, individual BW and feed consumption were measured weekly and the vertical and horizontal lengths of vulva were measured every 3 d. From d 10, feces were collected by the maker-to-marker method for 4 d. Blood samples were collected on d 14. During the overall period, the average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and gain:feed of pigs linearly decreased (p< 0. 01) as the dietary concentration of contaminated barley increased. However, the digestibility of crude protein was linearly increased (p = 0. 011) with the increasing amounts of contaminated barley. Increasing dietary Fusarium mycotoxin concentrations did not influence vulva size, blood characteristic as well as immunoglobulin level of pigs. In the Exp. 2, a corn-soybean meal-based diet was formulated as a recovery diet. Pigs were fed the recovery diet immediately after completion of the Exp. 1. During the 14 -d of recovery period, the individual BW and feed consumption were measured weekly and the vertical and horizontal length of vulva were measured every 3 d from d 0. On d 7, the feed intake of pigs previously fed <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> already reached that of pigs fed a diet with 0 % contaminated barley and no significant difference in growth performance among treatments was observed during d 7 to 14 of the recovery period. In conclusion, increasing levels of mycotoxins in diets linearly decreased the growth performance of pigs, and these damages can be recovered in 7 d after the diet was replaced with a normal diet. The vulva size, blood characteristic, immune responses were not affected by increasing level of contaminated barley in the diets fed to pigs...|$|R

"May 2012 "In 2007, melamine (MEL) and cyanuric acid (CYA) were added to feed ingredients in an attempt to artificially increase their crude protein and thus their momentary value. However, once ingested MEL and CYA can form insoluble compounds and precipitate in the kidneys, leading to decreased renal function and in some cases death. To determine the effects of MEL and CYA alone and in combination three experiments were conducted. Two experiments involved young Pekin ducks while the other involved weanling barrows fed <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> for 21 consecutive days. Results indicate that ≥ 1. 00 % MEL is needed to cause reduced performance in Pekin ducks and decreased body weight gain in barrows. In ducks ≥ 0. 75 % MEL resulted in renal lesions that were similar to those documented in cats and dogs from the 2007 incident. However, the kidney of pigs was unaffected when up to 1. 25 % MEL was included in their diet. Inclusion of CYA to a <b>diet</b> <b>contaminated</b> with MEL was able to alleviate the negative effects of MEL in ducks but caused increased toxicity in pigs. It was also determined that up to 1. 50 % CYA in the diet of a Pekin ducks does not cause changes in performance, serum chemistry values, or microscopic renal appearance. Data also suggest that bile is used as a route to eliminate MEL from the body in both ducks and pigs. Finally, it was determined that MEL can be deposited in the muscle of pigs and ducks that consumed <b>diets</b> <b>contaminated</b> with MEL...|$|R

Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with 4 replications and 14 birds per repetition. The {{results showed that the}} lowest weight gain and feed intake and the highest feed conversion ratio were related to diet containing 500 ppb AF without NZ (AFNZ 0 diet). The birds were fed AFNZ 0 showed lower weight gain in 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th weeks in comparison with control diet (p< 0. 05). AF led to reduce feed intake and increase feed conversion ratio in 3 rd week (p< 0. 05). No significant differences observed between control <b>diet</b> and <b>contaminated</b> <b>diets</b> containing different levels of NZ for body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio at all weeks.
