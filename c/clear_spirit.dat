2500|$|Early {{reactions}} to the single noted similarities to the earlier work of Green Day. In a track-by-track guide of the album, the band's drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained that [...] "Drill it in My Brain" [...] is a [...] "pretty rhythmic song with a nice steady beat," [...] while [...] "Summer Thing, Don't Mean a Thing" [...] contains [...] "absurd amounts of percussion {{going on in the}} background of the verses", and [...] "Map of Your Body" [...] features a bridge that has almost a [...] "punk rock prom vibe." [...] Upon hearing an advance copy of the full album, AbsolutePunk CEO Jason Tate was of the opinion that the album was similar in style to the band's self-titled second album, while Thomas Nassiff expressed that [...] "throughout the album, Gilbert and Klein combine for even more crunching, downward-aiming, dominating guitar riffs than ever." [...] Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press suggested that musically, the album often recalls classic punk rock. [...] "The jagged riffs of [...] "Summer Fling, Don't Mean a Thing" [...] echoes Cheap Trick's late 70s golden years. [...] "Ready, Aim, Fire!" [...] wouldn't be out of place on a Dropkick Murphys disc, while the speedy [...] "Memories and Battle Scars" [...] conjures the aggression of the Descendents." [...] Tom Williams, writer for UK magazine Big Cheese, stated how he felt the album sounded like [...] "millennium era NFG with nods to ulterior influences." [...] Kerrang! journalist David McLaughlin thought the album contained a [...] "familiar but mint-fresh sound." [...] He explained how [...] "eighth track [...] "Caught in the Act" [...] sways and grooves like a long-lost Weezer gem. Elsewhere, having gone back to their musical roots and digging out their favorite Green Day, Ramones, and Descendents records – a <b>clear</b> <b>spirit</b> of nostalgia has reignited their spark." [...] The Boston Globe correspondent Scott McLennan described [...] "Drill it in My Brain" [...] as [...] "a tangled mess of relationship rights and wrongs, all made palatable with a cool pop swagger and murky keyboard riff." [...] While album closer [...] "Map of Your Body" [...] draws [...] "a nice punk-rock-to-doo-wop connection." [...] Andy Ritchie of Rock Sound noted that [...] "the album's focus is [...] "very much on back-to-basics pop punk. This is how the Ramones pioneered it, and how Green Day perfected it during their early days." ...|$|E

That priests, by the prescription of fifteen centuries, should have persuaded themselves of their own power to damn men's souls to hell, cut them off from the Christian community, and hand them over to the devil, is a painful circumstance. But Knox, from Perth, asserts that the same awful privilege is vested in the six or seven preachers of the nascent Kirk with the fire-new doctrine! Addressing the signers of the godly Band and other sympathisers who have not yet come in, he (if he wrote these fiery appeals) observes, that if they do not come in, [...] "ye shall be excommunicated from our Society, and from all participation with us in the administration of the Sacraments [...] .

Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed, He roamed, content alike with man and beast. Where darkness found him he lay glad at night; There the red morning touched him with its light. Three moons his great heart him a hermit made, So long he roved at will the boundless shade. The timid it concerns to ask their way, And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray, To make no step until the event is known, And ills to come as evils past bemoan.

60|$|I went on Sunday, by invitation, {{to see a}} {{collection}} of shells and fish made by a gentleman of Amboyna. The fishes are perhaps unrivalled for variety and beauty by those of any one spot on the earth. The celebrated Dutch ichthyologist, Dr. Blecker, has given a catalogue of seven hundred and eighty species found at Amboyna, a number almost equal to those of all the seas and rivers of Europe. A large proportion of them are of the most brilliant colours, being marked with bands and spots of the purest yellows, reds, and blues; while their forms present all that strange and endless variety so characteristic of {{the inhabitants of the}} ocean. The shells are also very numerous, and comprise a number of the finest species in the world. The Mactras and Ostreas in particular struck me by the variety and beauty of their colours. Shells have long been an object of traffic in Amboyna; many of the natives get their living by collecting and cleaning them, and almost every visitor takes away a small collection. The result {{is that many of the}} commoner-sorts have lost all value in the eyes of the amateur, numbers of the handsome but very common cones, cowries, and olives sold in the streets of London for a penny each, being natives of the distant isle of Amboyna, where they cannot be bought so cheaply. The fishes in the collection were all well preserved in <b>clear</b> <b>spirit</b> in hundreds of glass jars, and the shells were arranged in large shallow pith boxes lined with paper, every specimen being fastened down with thread. I roughly estimated that there were nearly a thousand different kinds of shells, and perhaps ten thousand specimens, while the collection of Amboyna fishes was nearly perfect.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Crawley {{had been}} almost in good spirits since the last visit which Mr. Thumble had made to him. It seemed as though the loss of {{everything}} in the world was in some way satisfactory to him. He had now given up his living by his own doing, and had after a fashion acknowledged his guilt by this act. He had proclaimed to all around him that he did not think himself to be any longer fit to perform the sacred functions of his office. He spoke of his trial as though a verdict against him must be the result. He knew that in going into prison he would leave his wife and children dependent on the charity of their friends,--on charity which they must condescend to accept, though he could not condescend to ask it. And yet he was able to carry himself now with a greater show of fortitude than had been within his power when the extent of his calamity was more doubtful. I must not ask the reader to suppose that he was cheerful. To have been cheerful under such circumstances would have been inhuman. But he carried his head on high, and walked firmly, and gave his orders at home with a clear voice. His wife, who was necessarily more despondent than ever, wondered at him,--but wondered in silence. It certainly seemed as though the very extremity of ill-fortune was good for him. And he was very diligent with his school, passing the greater part of the morning with the children. Mr. Thumble had told him that he would come on Sunday, and that he would then take charge of the parish.
