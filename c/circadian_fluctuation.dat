A <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the AC activity evoked by an A 2 a adenosine-selective agonist was also observed. Intrastriatal injection of an A 2 a-selective adenosine agonist or antagonist during the interval in which the Ca 2 +-inhibitable AC activity was at its peak resulted in a more significant alteration of locomotor activity than those observed at a later interval. The marked circadian variation in the Ca 2 +-inhibitable AC activity in the striatum appears to cause a <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the action {{of at least one}} neuromodulator...|$|E

The circadian secretion pattern of melatonin is well known. <b>Circadian</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in pineal gland (“central”) concentrations of 5 -HT {{have already been}} reported in literature.

While CXCL 12 gradients are typically studied in organized, defined environments, the tumor microenvironment is disorganized. In vivo, CXCL 12 gradients depend on many factors: the number and arrangement of cells secreting and degrading CXCL 12, isoform-dependent binding to the extracellular matrix, diffusion, and <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> We developed a computational model of the tumor microenvironment to simulate CXCL 12 gradient dynamics in disorganized tissue. There are four major findings from the model. First, CXCL 12 -β and -γ form higher magnitude (steeper) gradients compared to CXCL 12 -α. Second, endothelial CXCR 7 + cells regulate CXCL 12 gradient direction by controlling concentrations near but {{not far from the}} vasculature. Third, the magnitude and direction of CXCL 12 gradients are dependent on the local composition of secreting and scavenging cells within the tumor. We theorize that "micro-regions" of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor are responsible for forming strong gradients directed into the blood. Fourth, CXCL 12 <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuations</b> influence gradient magnitude but not direction. Our simulations provide predictions for future experiments in animal models.

40|$|Hair follicles undergo {{recurrent}} cycling {{of controlled}} growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, {{in addition to}} <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> CLOCK–regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal 1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p 21 in Bmal 1 mutant skin.

40|$|The {{level of}} mRNAs {{derived from the}} plastid-encoded psbD light-responsive {{promoter}} (LRP) is controlled by a circadian clock(s) in wheat (Triticum aestivum).

In vitro transcription in chloroplast extracts revealed that the circadian cycles in the psbD LRP mRNA level were dominantly attributed to the circadian-regulated transcription of the psbD LRP. The effects of various mutations introduced into the promoter region on the psbD LRP activity in vitro suggest the existence of two positive elements located between − 54 and − 36, which generally enhance the transcription activity, and an anomalous core promoter structure lacking the functional “− 35 ” element, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and light dependency of psbD LRP transcription activity...|$|E

The same <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of LHCP mRNA is observed upon illuminating etiolated tobacco seedlings, demonstrating that the circadian rhythm is not dependent on the presence of mature chloroplasts.

On the other hand, prolonged inflammatory response during critical illness may induce an immune-suppressed state where melatonin and cortisol rhythm profiles might exhibit different patterns of change during an adverse event, such as development of septic shock [27].|$|R

40|$|Transcription factor cAMP-responsive element {{modulator}} (CREM) {{plays a key}} {{physiological and}} developmental role within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The use of an alternative, intronic promoter within the CREM gene {{is responsible for the}} production of a cAMP-inducible repressor, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). ICER negatively autoregulates the ICER promoter, thus generating a feedback loop. We have previously documented a striking, clock-driven <b>circadian</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of CREM expression in the pineal gland. Oscillating ICER levels tightly correlate with fluctuations in the synthesis of the pineal hormone melatonin, whose production is also driven by the endogenous clock. Melatonin in turn regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) catalyzes the rate limiting step in melatonin synthesis. Thus, oscillations in NAT levels determine the circadian synthesis of melatonin. Here we demonstrate that NAT expression is dramatically increased in CREM-deficient mice that we have generated by homologous recombination. Characterization of the NAT promoter shows the presence of a ICER binding site. In addition, transfection studies show that ICER powerfully represses NAT transcription.
