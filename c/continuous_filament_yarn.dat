5000|$|Little {{expansion}} occurred {{until the}} Industrial Revolution when {{in common with}} other Lancashire settlements in the 19th century, Tottington saw a large industrial presence develop, largely {{under the influence of}} John Gorton. Nine mills were listed in an 1891 directory producing calico, cotton cloth and yarn. In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet, a French chemist, came to the area to work on a cellulose-based fabric that became known as 'Chardonnay silk'. A forerunner of rayon it was an attractive cloth, Chardonnet displayed it in the Paris Exhibition of 1889. However, like celluloid it was very flammable, following several publicly reported accidents, it was discontinued. The site on Royds Street South reverted to typical Lancashire textile production until 1925, when the Kirklees Rayon Company began producing viscose <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> at the mill. This continued until 1955 when viscose production ceased. Courtaulds took over the mill in 1962 and converted it into a dye-house, this work continued until 1980.

The process is simply feeding a bundle of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> into a small jet nozzle with various amounts of slack (overfeed). High pressure air ( [...] > 100 PSI [...] ) creates a suction and a turbulent airstream which tangles any slack into a yarn with a similar hand as a spun yarn.

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> {{comprised}} of organic fibers {{are widely used}} in fabrics as flexible protective materials because of their superior specific tensile properties. Numerical simulations {{of the impact of}} these fabrics using finite element codes provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of deformation, interactions, and energy absorption. However in much of the numerical simulation work to date, yarn failure is based on a single deterministic strength rather than the statistical distribution of strength based on the presence of defects. In this study, a first attempt is made to implement statistical based criteria for the prediction of yarn failure in a finite element analysis. A Weibull distribution based on the experimental testing of yarns is used to characterize the strength. This distribution is then mapped onto the finite element model of the fabric.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, <b>continuous</b> synthetic <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more <b>filaments</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R

Please note that this version does not contain the published papers and that where publisher permission has been given, the published papers {{are available from the}} Institutional Repository. This thesis describes original engineering research which aimed to establish fundamental understanding of various textile processes and to search for solutions to the associated problems. First, the particulars of the candidate are given, followed by a list of the publications included in the submission and the summary of each paper detailing the aims and achievements of the work. In this thesis, contributions in the following areas are described: 1. Air-jet texturing and intermingling: this section, which contains nearly half of the papers, reports the research in the field of air-jet texturing of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> and intermingling of false-twist textured yarns. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the supersonic air flow, its interaction with the <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> and the effect of process parameters on the properties of the textured yarn are reported. This research established a clear understanding of the mechanism of the loop and entanglement formation in the air-jet texturing and the air-intermingling processes. Improvements to both processes have been suggested and more efficient and cost effective nozzles have been designed and evaluated. 2. Yarn characterisation: development of digital image processing and analysis techniques for objective, non-invasive and accurate assessment of the structural properties of the air-jet textured yarns is reported. The research has been extended to include the measurement of nip frequency and regularity of the air-intermingled yarns, as well as the yarn hairiness, evenness and twist of the conventional spun yarns. 3. 	Water-jet and thermal bonding of nonwovens: experimental research into the nonwoven fabric formation using very fine high-pressure water jets and modelling of the thermal bonding of fibrous webs by passing hot-air flow through them, mostly in collaboration with North Carolina State University, are reported. Models developed provide an essential tool for more efficient process, product and machine design. 4. 	Finally, this short section reports various other textile engineering research including the use of pulse lasers to fuse false-twist textured yarns to impart fused nodes (nips), the fibre opening, straightening and transportation using high-speed air flow in the open-end spinning process, and the design, development and construction of a novel circular warp knitting machine. The interrelationship between the publications is explained and reference to the work of the others in the field is given where appropriate. The contributions that the publications have made and the role that they played in advancing the knowledge in the research field and the impact they have made on other researchers are stated.

30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>yarns,</b> while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the <b>filament</b> flexibility. Feeder <b>yarn</b> wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of hollow glass fibers in laminates used in today's printed circuit boards, chip carrier substrates, and plastic {{ball grid arrays}} can {{have a significant impact}} on reliability. In the manufacture of laminates used for the electronic industry, glass fibers are used for reinforcement. Laminates are composed of several plies of glass fabrics encapsulated with a polymeric resin. The most common fabric fiber material used today in laminate manufacture is E-glass, a <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> glass <b>yarn</b> with a chemical composition by weight of mostly SiO 2, but also containing various amounts of CaO, Al 2 O 3 and other materials. Advantages of E-glass lie in its high tensile strength, water resistance, bond stability with resins, and relatively low cost. The dielectric constant (6. 3 at 23 oC and 1 MHz) is high, but acceptable for most low frequency applications. The manufacture of glass fiber begins with the dry mixing of silicas, limestone, clay, and boric acid in appropriate proportions. In the direct-melt process, the mixture is melted in a refractory furnace at temperatures between 2600 and 2800 oF and fed directly into bushings, which are platinum alloy plates with nozzles. Alternatively, the melt can be formed into marbles, cooled to room temperature and stored for future use. Additional information about this process is supplied by Loewenstein [1983]. A homogeneous melt composition with negligible impurities is necessary for the successful manufactur...|$|R
50|$|Heat {{setting is}} a term used in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> (BCF) <b>yarns.</b> Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|R

Typical gauze specifications are in weaves of between 29 (commodity) to 44 or more (commercial/professional) yarns per square inch, with the cloth weights, wiping properties and overall cost varying accordingly. Gauze may be bleached and scoured (like medical quality) or unbleached quality that contains more contaminants. A standard {{size of the}} cotton gauze varieties is 18 in. &times; 36 in. in North America (other standards are found in other countries, such as 50 cm &times; 80 cm). Other textiles used in tack cloths are made from <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> (non-fibrous) synthetic <b>yarns</b> to eliminate linting or from various non-woven fabrics that can reduce cost.

This is achievable by extrusion of a preprocessed filament feedstock material along a predetermined path. However if fabrication of a multifunctional part relies only on conventional filament materials, it will require a different material for each unique functionality printed into the part. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive material for many applications due to their high specific strength as well as good electrical and thermal conductivity. The presence of this set of properties in a single material presents an opportunity to use one material to achieve multifunctionality in an additively manufactured part.

In this research, the devices with electrodes of pure stainless steel <b>filaments</b> <b>yarns</b> performed better than the devices with silver coated yarns; this outcome has been reported as standard by various researchers...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to growing}} demand for {{comfortable}} clothes, elastane <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> are being used in fabrics for several garments. In this study, core spun yarns were produced with cotton fibres and PBT/elastane <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> (cotton as sheath material, PBT yarn and elastane as core yarns). Twill woven (1 / 3 Z) fabrics were produced by using core spun yarns (30 tex) and cotton yarns (30 tex) as weft, and 100 % cotton yarn (59 tex) as warp yarns. The fabrics consisting of PBT were washed at 100 °C for 30 minutes to gain the elasticity. The woven fabrics’ weight, thickness, elongation, permanent elongation, dimensional stability, air permeability, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity characteristics were tested and statistically evaluated. According to the results, the fabrics containing PBT and elastane filaments had similar elongation and shrinkage values. PBT <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> have a great potential to produce lightweight elastic fabrics...|$|R
