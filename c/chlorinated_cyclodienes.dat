50|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodienes</b> include aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, chlordane and endosulfan. A 2- to 8-hour {{exposure}} {{leads to}} depressed {{central nervous system}} (CNS) activity, followed by hyperexcitability, tremors, and then seizures. The mechanism of action is the insecticide binding at the GABAA site in the gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) chloride ionophore complex, which inhibits chloride flow into the nerve.|$|E
5000|$|The name Chlordane, or chlordan, is {{commonly}} used as both a specific chemical (with trans-and cis- isomers) and as a mixture of compounds (main components- heptachlor, chlordane, and nonachlor). This mixture, more specifically called technical chlordane, was first produced in the 1940s by Julius Hyman. Technical chlordane development was by chance, during a search for possible uses of a by-product of synthetic rubber manufacturing. By chlorinating this by-product, persistent and potent insecticides were easily and cheaply produced. The chlorine atoms, 7 {{in the case of}} heptachlor and 8 in chlordane, and 9 in the case of nonachlor, surround and stabilize the cyclodiene ring and thus these compounds are referred to as cyclodienes. Other members of the cyclodiene family of organochorine insecticides are aldrin and its epoxide, dieldrin, as well as endrin, which is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. These highly <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodienes</b> are both resistant to degradation in the environment and in humans/animals and readily accumulate in lipids (fats) of human/animals.

5000|$|When used in polymers, {{whether as}} a curing agent or as a flame retardant, it bonds covalently to the polymer matrix, which reduces its {{leaching}} to the environment. It may, however, be released when such materials {{are subjected to}} hydrolysis, and can be formed by oxidation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> insecticides (e.g. endosulfan, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and isodrin). Its half-life in soil is 140-280 days.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> pesticides on the adipocyte differentiation process were examined using the 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocyte model in vitro. Endrin {{was found to}} cause a dose-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Aldrin and dieldrin were less potent than endrin in interfering with the adipogenic process. Endrin’s inhibitory ef-fect was effective only when the pesticide was present in the medium during the first 48 h after exposure of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells to adipogenic inducers. Immunoblots analysis revealed that en-drin caused a dose-dependent, selective inhibition of the intra-cellular levels of CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) a without altering the expression patterns of C/EBPb or C/EBPd along the differentiation. Supershift analysis showed that DNA-binding capacity of C/EBPa was affected most by endrin treat...|$|R
40|$|Activities of hepatic microsomal and cytosolic epoxide hydro-lases, {{accumulation}} of dieldrin in liver, and in vivo metabolism and {{disposition of the}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo-[a]pyrene (BP), were examined in rainbow trout pretreated with dieldrin, a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> insecticide. Rainbow trout were fed 0. 3 mg dieldrin/kg/day for 9 weeks and the same dose of dieldrin for 9 weeks, followed by 3 weeks on control diet (12 weeks). Fish then received an intraperitoneal (ip) challenge dose of 14 C-BP (10 mol/kg). Dieldrin pretreatment significantly elevated the concentration of 14 C-BP in bile (142 % and 200 % at 9 and 12 weeks, respectively), but not liver or fat. Extraction of bile sub-samples confirmed dieldrin pretreatment significantly stimulated total biliary excretion of 14 C-BP polar metabolites (244 % and 221 % at week 9 and 12, respectively). The complex metabolism of BP characterized the in vivo state of the CYP system, UDP-glucuro...|$|R
40|$|Over 250 {{adults and}} {{children}} were exposed to chlordane when the wooden building surfaces and soil around an apartment complex were sprayed in 1987. Two hundred-sixteen adults had neurobehavioral functions measured and completed questionnaires for symptom frequency, mood status, confounding factors, and medical, rheumatic, and respiratory disorders in 1994. Measurements included simple and choice reaction time, balance, blink reflex latency, color vision, cognitive, perceptual motor, memory, and recall functions. We analyzed 216 exposed and 174 referent adults. Age, educational level, weight, height, and gender ratio were similar for the exposed and referent groups. Performance of balance, reaction times, Culture Fair, digit symbol, verbal recall, and trail-making were significantly impaired in exposed persons compared to referents. Mood-state scores were elevated, as were the frequencies of respiratory, neurobehavioral, and rheumatic symptoms. In contrast, long-term memory function was similar in both groups, consistent with its status before exposure. There was no identified bias or confounding factors. Chlordane exposure was associated with protracted impairment of neurophysiological and psychological functions.

40|$|Chlordane is an {{insecticide}} first {{registered in}} the United States in 1948 (1). In 1988, all uses of chlordane, except its use for fire ant control in power transformers, were voluntarily canceled in the United States (2). $ Chlordane was used on food and non-food agricultural crops, residential lawns and gardens, and against structural pests, particularly termites (2, 3). $ Chlordane is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> that {{is a mixture of}} closely related chemicals including chlordene, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, heptachlor, and nonachlor (2). Technical grade chlordane consists of over 50 compounds (4). $ Chlordane manufactured prior to 1950 was sometimes referred to as “early chlordane, ” due to variable concentrations of the unreacted intermediate hexachlorocyclopentadiene. After 1951, the percentage of this intermediate was kept below 1 %, resulting in lower toxicity (3). $ Technical chlordane is a thick clear to amber liquid. It may be odorless or exhibit a mildly irritating odor (2). $ Chlordane can still be legally manufactured in the United States, but it can only be sold to, or used by, foreign countries. Although chlordane can be used to control fire ants in the United States, no products are currently registered for this use (5, 6). Why were uses of chlordane canceled...|$|R
40|$|Endosulfan is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> broad-spectrum insecticide. It is {{well-established}} {{that the}} mechanism of action for mammalian toxicity is related to effects of the chemical that lead to stimulation of the central nervous system. For example, high dose intentional, or unintentional, exposures of humans to endosulfan {{has been associated with}} convulsions. The mechanism of action of endosulfan has been linked to inhibition of calcium and magnesium ATPase and antagonism of chloride ion transport in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. As a result, it is not unexpected that neurotoxicity would be en endpoint of concern in endosulfan risk assessment, although it is understood that exposure to low levels of endosulfan in the environment is a different assessment than examination of higher dose occupational exposures and risks, or risks due to ingestion of high doses intentionally (suicide). There are several sources of data that can be reviewed and analyzed that relate to the potential neurotoxic effects of endosulfan. These sources include the published, peer-reviewed literature, as well as studies submitted as part of the endosulfan pesticide registration process and unpublished. The following is a review of the studies from each source, focusing on the relevancy of the study findings to assessing the risk to human health that may be related to any endosulfan-induced neurotoxicity when exposure is due to low levels of endosulfan encountered in food, soil, and/or water.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine a number of physical constants for the crystals of two commonly used insecticide compounds. The compounds chosen were Aldrin and Dieldrin, which are <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> compounds. These compounds are in considerable use today, and show promise of heavy continued use. The data collected includes crystal system and structure, unit cell dimensions, refractive indices, optical directions, and fusion data. This data should allow determination of the identity of these compounds by use of the techniques of chemical microscopy, although admittedly, the work reported here does not include the complete amount of crystallographic and optical information possible. The two compounds were investigated and the following information was obtained. Dieldrin crystallizes into two forms, depending presumably upon the polarity of the solvent used. One form (benzene) is tetragonal, and was found to be uniaxial negative in character. The other was orthorhombic and biaxial positive. Aldrin crystallizes in the monoclinic system and is also biaxial positive. Both Aldrin and Dieldrin have rather large unit cells. The author had considerable difficulty in obtaining the proper sized crystals for analysis. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the commercial and rather crude product could be recrystallized a few times using ordinary techniques, and the crystals obtained could be used to provide a fairly specific identification...|$|R

Dieldrin-resistance {{is shown to}} be dependent on a single, semi-dominant, genetic factor and imparts cross-resistance to other <b>cyclodiene</b> <b>chlorinated</b> hydrocarbons and to γ-BHC. DDT-resistance imparts cross-resistance to DDT-analogues and is dependent on a single, recessive, genetic factor. The two resistances are separate entities and can, in fact, be separated.

40|$|Five {{established}} hepatoma cell lines, 1 of rat {{origin and}} 4 derived from human liver carcinoma, were compared for {{their capacity to}} perform metabolic activation of one polycyclic hydrocarbon, benzo[a]pyrene (BP), and one <b>cyclodiene</b> <b>chlorinated</b> insecticide, aldrin. The results of these investigations indicated both species and individual differences among these cell lines. Aldrin {{was found to be}} converted into dieldrin much more efficiently by the rat hepatoma cell line than by any human cell lines, whereas 2 human lines displayed the highest BP-metabolizing activity whether measured as the amounts of water-soluble products or estimated b cytotoxic cell-mediated assays. Results also showed that one particular human cell line can replace, advantageously, V 79 hamster cells as target in a cell-mediated assay owing to its incapability to metabolize BP and its high sensitivity to BP metabolites.

40|$|The Mekong delta is {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} region of Vietnam. To meet the food demand for the local inhabitants and export, intensive crop cultivation results in a steady increase in application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Diverse chemical classes of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides {{have been used in}} the delta resulting in contamination of surface water and sediments. However, the fate of residual pesticides and capacity for microbial degradation in soils of the Mekong delta are largely unknown. It was hypothesized that the continuous selection pressure of pesticides in agricultural fields in the Mekong delta has resulted into an adapted community that is able to degrade and/or mineralize intensively used pesticides. Therefore, the overall objective {{of the study was to}} gain knowledge on the biodegradation of some currently used pesticides in the delta and the genetics involved in the catabolism of these compounds. Biodegradation and mineralization of four currently used pesticides were examined in a pristine soil and in agricultural soil samples that had a history of pesticide treatment and that were collected from two distant provinces in the Mekong delta. The examined pesticides included one herbicide, i. e., the chlorinated phenoxyacetic acid 2, 4 -D, and three insecticides, i. e., the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>cyclodiene</b> endosulfan, the synthetic pyrethroid cypermethrin and the methylcarbamate carbofuran. 2, 4 -D and cypermethrin were degraded/mineralized in all soil samples including the control soil while endosulfan was not mineralized in any of the soil samples. Carbofuran was only mineralized in soils that had been exposed to the compound. From soils showing 2, 4 -D degradation or carbofuran mineralization activity, ten distinct strains that use 2, 4 -D as sole source of carbon and energy and one strain that uses carbofuran as sole source of nitrogen, carbon and energy were isolated. The 2, 4 -D-degrading isolates were identified as members of the ß-proteobacterial genera Burkholderia, Cupriavidus and Ralstonia while the carbofuran-degrading strain belongs to the alfa-proteobacterial genus Novosphingobium. 2, 4 -D degradation in the 2, 4 -D-degrading isolates was plasmid encoded and the phenotype could be transferred by conjugation to a plasmid-free derivative of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH 34. The plasmids were sequenced and the sequences analyzed. All plasmids contained homologues of the previously described tfd genes that code for the biodegradation of 2, 4 -D. Eight of the nine plasmids analyzed were identified as IncP- 1 ß plasmids with backbone sequences that are highly similar to those of the prototype 2, 4 -D-catabolic plasmid pJP 4. These plasmids show minor differences in structure between each other indicating that they are variants of a similar ancestor. In one strain, the tfd genes were located on a plasmid, designated as pPO 4, which appears to be a member of a poorly characterized plasmid group. The tfd genes on the IncP- 1 ß plasmids are highly similar in organization and sequence to the tfd genes identified on pJP 4 although minor differences were detected. As on pJP 4, the tfd genes are organized in two isofunctional catabolic clusters (tfd-I and tfd-II) that determine the conversion of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol into ß-ketoadipate and a separated tfdA gene that determines the conversion of 2, 4 -D to 2, 4 -dichlorophenol. Plasmid pPO 4 carries a tfdA homologue and only one of the dichlorophenol catabolic gene modules. However, the strong similarity in sequence and organization of the tfd genes on pPO 4 and the IncP- 1 ß plasmids suggest that the inter-plasmid exchange of tfd genes has taken place in the rice field bacterial community where the plasmids originated from. Moreover, the occurrence of the genes primarily on conjugative genetic elements with broad host range features shows the mobile character of the 2, 4 -D-catabolic phenotype in the examined soil community which can contribute to adaptation of its populations towards recruiting 2, 4 -D biodegradation genotypes. Novosphingobium sp. KN 65. 2 has the capability to use carbofuran as sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth that is accompanied by the mineralization of the aromatic ring structure of the compound. The genes involved in carbofuran degradation as well as the corresponding metabolic pathway in Novosphingobium sp. KN 65. 2 were analyzed. A collection of plasposon mutants impaired in carbofuran degradation and mineralization was isolated and representative mutants were subjected to proteomic and metabolite analyses. Metabolic profiling revealed several new metabolic intermediates, in addition to the initial hydrolysis product carbofuran phenol. The promiscuous carbofuran-hydrolyzing enzyme Mcd, which is present in several bacteria partially degrading carbofuran but lacking ring mineralization capacity, is not encoded by the KN 65. 2 genome. An alternative hydrolase gene required for this step was not yet identified, but the constitutively expressed genes of the unique cfd operon, including the oxygenase genes cfdC and cfdE, could be linked to further degradation of the phenolic metabolite. A third oxygenase gene cfdI and the transporter gene cftA encoding a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor with potential regulatory function are located outside the cfd cluster, but appear also to be involved in carbofuran mineralization. The study has revealed the first dedicated carbofuran-catabolic genes and provides insight in the early steps of benzofuran ring degradation. The isolation of a carbofuran-mineralizing Novosphingobium sp. KN 65. 2 only from a carbofuran-treated field and the unique genetic make-up of carbofuran degradation genes in the strain supports the proposed hypothesis that continuously applied selection pressure of carbofuran in agricultural fields in the Mekong delta has resulted into a genetically adapted bacterial community that is able to degrade this intensively used insecticide. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|R
