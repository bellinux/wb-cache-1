5|$|Whether secret trusts are express or <b>constructive</b> trusts is unclear. Snell's Equity {{includes}} them in its {{section on}} express trusts, as does Underhill and Hayton, although both opine {{that they are}} better classified as express trust with <b>constructive</b> elements.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the triumph of}} the <b>constructive</b> method to be essential for our present. We find it not only in the new economy and {{in the development of the}} industry, but also in the psychology of our contemporaries of art. Veshch will champion <b>constructive</b> art, whose mission is not, after all, to embellish life, but to organize it.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the fraud}} theory, secret trusts are {{sometimes}} classified as <b>constructive</b> trusts; {{the reason they}} do not have to follow the Wills Act 1837 is because they are created by the courts.|$|E
5|$|In November 1993, Jackson {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} the remaining Dangerous Tour due to an addiction to painkillers which had been prescribed after a recent <b>constructive</b> scalp surgery.|$|E
5|$|Scouting or the Scout Movement is a {{movement}} that aims to support young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, that they may play <b>constructive</b> roles in society, with a strong focus on the outdoors and survival skills.|$|E
5|$|She was {{subsequently}} refloated on 5 July and towed {{back to the}} UK. The subsequent survey declared her a <b>constructive</b> total loss, and the ship was sold to Thos W Ward by BISCO. Fury was towed Briton Ferry to be scrapped, arriving there on 18 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples {{recognized}} {{the urgent need}} to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other <b>constructive</b> arrangements with States. It {{also noted that the}} rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other <b>constructive</b> arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the Commission of National Education, the Commonwealth's and Europe's first ministry of education, {{is seen as the}} proudest and most <b>constructive</b> achievement of the otherwise often-deplored Partition Sejm.|$|E
5|$|The final {{tally of}} {{financial}} loss included US$2,332,000 for vessels totally lost, $830,900 for vessels that became <b>constructive</b> total losses, $620,000 for vessels stranded but returned to service, and approximately $1,000,000 in lost cargoes. This figure {{did not include}} financial losses in coastal cities.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{separate}} {{mens rea}} element from the assault or battery, {{making this a}} crime of <b>constructive</b> liability. This has been defended by John Gardner, a proponent of the moral threshold theory. However, this is opposed by Simester and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|This act must be causally {{linked to}} the death. In {{the case of an}} offence against the person, it is usually obvious; however, rather more {{controversial}} cases have founded <b>constructive</b> manslaughter on drug possession crimes involving the subsequent injection of the drug into another.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either <b>constructive</b> or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to consider them <b>constructive.</b> Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the text, she {{contrasts}} the <b>constructive,</b> creative imagination with destructive commerce. By associating commercialism {{with the}} anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who she believed cared more for his business speculations than {{for her and}} their child.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very {{hazardous waste}} piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for <b>constructive</b> re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine {{and created a}} county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally <b>constructive</b> and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as <b>constructive</b> {{criticism}} or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|For the sejm of 1606 {{the royal}} faction, hoping to take {{advantage}} of the glorious Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive <b>constructive</b> reform program. Instead the sejm had become preoccupied with the dissident postulate of prosecuting instigators of religious disturbances directed against non-Catholics; advised by Skarga, the King refused his assent to the proposed statute.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm. It is believed by old Hawaiians today that had he lived he would have become a real and <b>constructive</b> leader of the Hawaiian people. He had a splendid physique and a magnetic personality. The glance of his eyes made him friends everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Process {{philosophy}} {{is even more}} difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in <b>constructive</b> postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|To enact these views, Russell {{advises the}} reader to {{discourage}} cruel temperaments which arise out {{of a lack of}} opportunities. Moreover, the reader should encourage the growth of <b>constructive</b> skills, which provide the person with an alternative to easier and more destructive alternatives. Finally, they should encourage cooperative feeling, and curb competitive desires (Russell 1938:219–220, 222).|$|E
5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a <b>constructive</b> trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|While some of Piłsudski's {{political}} moves remain controversial — {{particularly the}} May 1926 Coup d'état, the Brest trials (1931–32), the 1934 {{establishment of the}} Bereza Kartuska detention camp, and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, <b>constructive</b> policies toward the national minorities — Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.|$|E
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} <b>constructive</b> {{metabolic}} processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of <b>constructive</b> interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} a <b>constructive</b> {{reform program}} during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness to move toward the implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Constructive</b> {{mathematics}} is {{a branch of}} mathematics that insists that proofs {{of the existence of}} a number, function, or other mathematical object should give a construction of the object. As such <b>constructive</b> mathematics also rejects the law of excluded middle. Reformulations of calculus in a <b>constructive</b> framework are generally part of the subject of <b>constructive</b> analysis.|$|E
25|$|Separability is {{especially}} important in numerical analysis and <b>constructive</b> mathematics, since many theorems that can be proved for nonseparable spaces have <b>constructive</b> proofs only for separable spaces. Such <b>constructive</b> proofs {{can be turned into}} algorithms for use in numerical analysis, and they are the only sorts of proofs acceptable in <b>constructive</b> analysis. A famous example of a theorem of this sort is the Hahn–Banach theorem.|$|E
25|$|Some {{results in}} <b>constructive</b> set theory use the axiom of {{countable}} choice or the axiom of dependent choice, {{which do not}} imply {{the law of the}} excluded middle in <b>constructive</b> set theory. Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in <b>constructive</b> mathematics, its use has also been questioned.|$|E
25|$|Leaders need {{to ensure}} that {{conflict}} remains <b>constructive.</b> That is, they must stimulate task-oriented disagreement and debate while trying to minimize interpersonal conflict. Eilerman (2006) claims that the way conflict is handled will determine whether the outcome is <b>constructive</b> or destructive. According to Roberto (2005) leaders can create <b>constructive</b> conflict by taking concrete steps before, during, and after a critical decision process.|$|E
25|$|In <b>constructive</b> set theory, however, Diaconescu's theorem {{shows that}} the axiom of choice implies the law of {{excluded}} middle (unlike in Martin-Löf type theory, where it does not). Thus the axiom of choice is not generally available in <b>constructive</b> set theory. A cause for this {{difference is that the}} axiom of choice in type theory does not have the extensionality properties that the axiom of choice in <b>constructive</b> set theory does.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{service members}} who make <b>constructive</b> {{use of the}} Dissent Channel may be {{eligible}} to receive the American Foreign Service Association's <b>Constructive</b> Dissent Awards (although use of the channel {{is not required to}} be eligible).|$|E
25|$|Definition: Demolishing for any <b>constructive</b> purpose.|$|E
25|$|A suffix (ek) is {{attached}} to a stem (gövde). A stem may be a root (kök) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: <b>constructive</b> suffixes (yapım ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (çekim ekleri). A <b>constructive</b> suffix makes a new word from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the <b>constructive</b> suffixes.|$|E

25|$|Euclid's axiomatic {{approach}} and <b>constructive</b> methods were widely influential.|$|E
25|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} is seen {{to underlie}} a final group of <b>constructive</b> trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a <b>constructive</b> trust. Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a <b>constructive</b> trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a <b>constructive</b> trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any <b>constructive</b> trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.|$|E
