30|$|Activated sludge {{system for}} {{biological}} wastewater treatment consists essentially of an activated sludge reactor <b>and</b> a <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Reports on {{the analysis of}} the performance of the activated sludge plants based on reactor- settler interaction are rather scarce. Sherrard and Kincannon (1974) proposed a correlation among the mean solid retention time, sludge recycle ratio and sludge concentration factor in secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Riddell et al. (1983) combined the functions of the reactor <b>and</b> the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in order to choose permissible flow rate of an activated sludge plant. Sheintuch (1987) introduced the concept of system response for analyzing the interactions of the functions of the reactor <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> But it was Cho et al. (1996) who described the reactor-settling tank interaction in very comprehensive way. They used the sludge recycle ratio and sludge waste ratio as the operating parameters and obtained the responses of the output variables such as biomass concentration in aerator, dissolved pollutant and solid concentration in the effluent. Diehl and Jeppsson (1998) presented a dynamic simulation model of an activated sludge plant. For describing the continuous sedimentation in the secondary clarifier, a one-dimensional model based on non-linear partial differential equation was proposed. The analysis of the settling process lied on vigorous mathematical treatment of the equation. The Diehl-Jeppsson model, however, does not correlate the dynamics of the reactor to that of the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in a comprehensive way.|$|R

30|$|In this analysis, the {{activated}} sludge plant {{is considered to be}} consisted of two units: {{activated sludge}} reactor <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> The design parameter of the reactor is volume and that of the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> is the area. Assuming a definite height for the activated sludge reactor, the design parameter of both the units has been reduced to area. Thus the optimization criterion is accepted to be the minimum total area (footprint) of the units. It is assumed that the Monod equation fully describes the growth kinetics of microorganism <b>and</b> the <b>settling</b> characteristics of the sludge follows some power law. It is found that in the designing of the interacting reactor-settler system, three variables such the activated sludge concentration X in the reactor, the sludge recycle ratio α and the sludge waste ratio β determine the total area of the plant. For diminishing the number of variables, the value of β was kept constant at 0.01. Contradicting the popular perception that ‘an increase in α results in an increase in the biodegradation rate and the overall space required for the plant decreases’, it is found that with an increase in α, the total area of the plant monotonously increases. With the sludge waste ratio β kept at constant, the sludge recycle ratio α, however, appears to be the only controllable parameter to maintain the desired level of treatment in the plant when the feed parameters differ from those assumed {{in the design of the}} plant. A procedure has been developed for simultaneous design of a reactor <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank,</b> ensuring minimum area (footprint) for an {{activated sludge plant}}, and also a methodology has been worked out to recalculate the operating sludge recycled ratio in cases when influent parameters differ from those in design.|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is: (1) to develop a method for {{simultaneous}} design of a reactor <b>and</b> a <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> constituting an activated sludge plant for an assigned performance level, (2) to develop an analytical and also graphical method for determining the range of recycle ratio and activated sludge concentration to achieve certain treatment level, (3) to work out a design method, which will ensure minimum footprint for the plant and (4) also to find the conditions of operation of an already functioning plant in the event the input parameters (influent flow rate and substrate concentration) differ from those assumed in designing. The fundamental work of Cho et al. (1996) will be taken as the basis for analysis, in which the authors studied the coupled system of reactor <b>and</b> the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> using Monod’s simple reaction kinetic model and limit flux theory. In the meantime, Pholchan et al. (2010) reported that the diversity of the microbial communities in the reactors was affected by changes in the operating parameters of the bioreactor. Tench (1994) showed that the biological treatment processes were ‘complex systems’ where many different kinds of microbes grew and interacted in a dynamic manner. The author concluded that the analysis of the treatment process would be more precise, if all the complexities concerning microorganism activities were taken into account. This paper, however, aims at describing the performance and design of the activated sludge plant in principle, when the operation of the reactor <b>and</b> the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> are described by simple equations. Thus, for the simplicity of the present analysis, it is considered that whatever changes may take place with the diversity of the microbial communities in the reactors, the microbiological <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> parameters of the sludge do not change.|$|R

In situ properties of the aggregates in a coagulation–flocculation process were obtained using a non-intrusive image analysis technique. Derived properties, including density, porosity and the number of primary particles in a floc, were estimated from aggregate structure using a fractal approach, which better represents the distribution of mass in an aggregate, compared with a conventional Euclidean approach which considers uniform mass distribution in an assumed spherical shape. A spherical particle assumption overlooks the highly porous nature of real aggregates and underestimates volume, which subsequently influences <b>coagulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> estimates in solid–liquid separation processes. The present results illustrate a strong inverse relationship between the fractal dimension and aggregate length, consistent with the idea that larger aggregates in general are more porous.

There are also reports proving the positive impact of the static {{magnetic field}} on the <b>coagulation</b> <b>and</b> sedimentation, {{as well as the}} conditioning and dewatering of sludge. In order to be applied in larger scale the published results should be verified and confirmed. In the studies, the enhancement of sedimentation by the {{static magnetic field}} was observed. The best sedimentation was noted in the experiment, where magnetizers were placed on activated sludge bioreactor <b>and</b> secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> No effect of the static magnetic field on coagulation with the utilization of PIX 113 was observed. However, the static magnetic field enhanced coagulation with the utilization of PAX-XL 9. The results suggest that increased sedimentation of colloids and activated sludge, can in practice mean a reduction {{in the size of the}} necessary equipment for sedimentation with an unchanged efficiency of the process...|$|R
40|$|A semi-empirical {{model is}} presented, which {{describes}} {{the processes of}} formation, migration, and accumulation of radiogenic lead (PbRn) in opals deposited in open cavities. In contrast to lead that forms in situ through radioactive decay of uranium trapped by opal, PbRn is produced from uranium disseminated in the rock enclosing the cavities. Its incorporation into the opal is described by the following chain of processes: decay of parental uranium to yield radon — emanation and diffusion migration of radon from the rock into the cavity — decay of radon to yield lead — diffusion migration of lead in the cavity — adsorption of lead on colloidal silica particles — <b>coagulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> of the colloidal particles — formation of opal. Besides the colloidal adsorption, PbRn can also {{be incorporated into the}} growing opal through direct diffusion flow onto its surface. The latter mechanism is also relevant to minerals crystallizing from ionic solutions; it is less efficient than the mechanism of colloidal adsorption. Distribution of PbRn isotopes throughout a cavity depends on the cavity geometry and the half-life of the parental Rn isotope. In cavity filled with stagnant water, the concentration profiles of PbRn show maxima at some distance from the cavity wall. The movement o...|$|R
40|$|Although {{lightning}} has not {{yet been}} observed in Titan's atmosphere, the presence of condensable vapors and the deposition of a significant amount of solar energy at the surface suggest the possibility of lightning activity. Based on an understanding of the relationship of lightning activity to the amount of convective energy available on Titan, a lightning energy dissipation rate of 4 x 10 to the - 6 th W/sq m can be expected. This value is much lower than that for earth or Jupiter, and is a result of both the reduced solar flux at Titan and the absorption of sunlight by the aerosols that lie above the convective layer. For this dissipation rate, the amount of HCN and C 2 N 2 produced by lightning should be greater than that by solar UV, but could be less than that produced by electron precipitation and galactic cosmic rays. Equilibrium calculations indicate that large mole fractions of elemental solid phase carbon will also be produced. Using a simplified model of aerosol formation, <b>coagulation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>settling,</b> it is estimated that a lightning-produced aerosol could have a typical optical depth of 0. 01, with values as high as 0. 1. The accumulation of soot over geological time might reach a meter or more in depth...|$|R
