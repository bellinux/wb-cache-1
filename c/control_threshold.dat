5000|$|Threshold {{tracking}} {{allows for}} {{the strength of a}} test stimulus to be adjusted by a computer in order to activate a defined fraction of the maximal nerve or muscle potential. A threshold tracking experiment consists of a 1-ms stimulus being applied to a nerve in regular intervals. The action potential is recorded downstream from the triggering impulse.The stimulus is automatically decreased in steps of a set percentage until the response falls below the target (generation of an action potential). Thereafter, the stimulus is stepped up or down depending on whether the previous response was lesser or greater than the target response until a resting (or <b>control)</b> <b>threshold</b> has been established. Nerve excitability can then be changed by altering the nerve environment or applying additional currents. Since the value of a single threshold current provides little valuable information because it varies within and between subjects, pairs of threshold measurements, comparing the <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> to thresholds produced by refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant or [...] "threshold electrotonus" [...] are more useful in scientific and clinical study.|$|E
50|$|Threshold {{tracking}} techniques test nerve excitability, and {{depend on}} the properties of axonal membranes and sites of stimulation. They are extremely sensitive to the membrane potential and changes in this potential. These tests can measure and compare a <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> (or resting threshold) to a threshold produced by {{a change in the}} environment, by a preceding single impulse, an impulse train, or a subthreshold current. Measuring changes in threshold can indicate changes in membrane potential, axonal properties, and/or the integrity of the myelin sheath.|$|E
40|$|Approaches for the {{analysis}} of statistical parametric maps (SPMs) can be crudely grouped into three main categories in which different philosophies are applied to delineate activated regions. These being type I error <b>control</b> <b>thresholding,</b> false discovery rate (FDR) <b>control</b> <b>thresholding</b> and posterior probability thresholding. To better understand the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data sets. Using default settings, we find that posterior probability thresholding is the most powerful approach, and type I error <b>control</b> <b>thresholding</b> provides the lowest levels of type I error. False discovery rate <b>control</b> <b>thresholding</b> performs in between the other approaches for both these criteria, although for some parameter settings this approach can approximate the performance of posterior probability thresholding. Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal approach. We conclude that viewing the problem of delineating areas of activation as a classification problem provides a highly interpretable framework for comparing the methods. Within this framework, we highlight the role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of errors that may occur in a given analysis...|$|R

40|$|Significant shifts have {{occurred}} {{during the past three}} years in the <b>control</b> <b>thresholds</b> that determine whether an acquisition of a minority shareholding will be subject to one or more EEC competition laws. The scope and effects of these shifts are neither clear nor necessarily consistent. The Commission appears on the one hand to have expanded the Merger Regulation 2 ̆ 7 s concept of decisive influence to reach a variety of minority shareholdings previously falling within the Philip Morris influence standard, while on the other hand to have expanded the Philip Morris influence standard to reach not only transactions previously thought to be passive (i. e. no influence), but perhaps also concentrations that are normally subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Merger Regulation, vis-à-vis Articles 85 and 86. Whether these <b>control</b> <b>thresholds</b> will continue to shift is critically important to firms contemplating the legal certainty of their future investments. Eventually, the Commission may conclude that the potential benefits of “flexible” <b>control</b> <b>thresholds</b> are outweighed by the costs, such as reduced legal certainty, higher transaction costs (both public and private) and slower decisionmaking capabilities. Simpler, albeit less flexible, thresholds may ultimately be required to control these shifting sands...|$|R

These equations indicate that a VM will be nominated for migration if it produces lower CPU usage than the migration <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> and possesses highest fuzzy output value. If all VMs of an overloaded host produce more CPU usage than the migration <b>control</b> <b>threshold,</b> then the VM that produces highest fuzzy output value will be migrated. It is described in detail below.|$|E
30|$|To {{take into}} account {{practical}} aspects, buffers of finite size for both two classes of customers are assumed in this paper. Furthermore, a proposed queue includes a congestion control mechanism. Once the number of low-priority customers in the system reaches the first <b>control</b> <b>threshold,</b> the arrival rate of low-priority customers is reduced to a guarantee arrival rate. If the number of low-priority customers is above the second <b>control</b> <b>threshold,</b> each arriving batch of low-priority customers will be discarded with a certain probability. Therefore, the proposed queue {{can be used to}} model Differentiated Service Architecture [14] in IP networks.|$|E

40|$|In The Netherlands, a {{computerized}} advisory system (called Gaby) for {{integrated pest management}} (IPM) in apple has been developed to support the decision making of individual fruit growers. Gaby provides clear monitoring recommendations when this is appropriate for a particular pest in (a defined area of) the orchard by using information concerning orchard characteristics, phenology of pests, previous field observations and insecticide applications. It recommends treatments only if <b>control</b> <b>thresholds</b> are exceeded, while indicating the most appropriate type and concentration of insecticide and the optimal time for control. Advice is accompanied by information on pest insects, damage symptoms, natural enemies, <b>control</b> <b>thresholds,</b> side-effects of insecticides and integrated fruit production guidelines. Gaby contains actual knowledge on the IPM of all major pests in Dutch apple orchards. In this paper we give a working description of Gaby and describe the separate decision schemes for each pest.

40|$|Helopeltis pernicialis {{damage to}} a cashew crop was very serious in each of two years, {{resulting}} in no harvest unless the trees were protected either by pesticides or biological control agents. A <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> was determined {{by a combination of}} the net income from increased yield and the frequency of insecticide use. A damage level of 1 ± 5 % achieved the highest net profit. A damage level of 6 ± 10 % resulted in yield that was over 73 % of the yield of the 1 ± 5 % damage level, but required one third less pesticide application. Therefore, it appears that 6 ± 10 % damage level can be regarded as a <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> for H. pernicialis. The pre-flowering flush appeared to be the most appropriate time to carry out the monitoring and spray programme to control H. pernicialis. Preliminary results showed that at the time when H. pernicialis caused serious {{damage to a}} tree without O. smaragdina nests, a tree with a constant ant population was only slightly damaged, and the damage level never exceeded the <b>control</b> <b>threshold</b> of 6 ± 10 %.

Simulations of the bandwidth are presented together with measurements of the control currents to indicate the threshold adjustment capability. A bandwidth above 80 GHz in a 0. 13 µm SiGe BiCMOS technology and a threshold tunable between ± 160 mV in steps of 0. 6 mV is achieved, allowing very precise <b>control</b> of the <b>threshold</b> level.

The most abundant fruit fly species was Ceratitis capitata, comprising almost 99 % of the fruit flies captured, of which 80 % were females. The largest captures of C. capitata were found in traps baited with Milhocina® and borax at pH 8. 5. Captures per trap for the four densities were similar, indicating that the population can be estimated with one trap per hectare in areas with high populations. It was found positive relationships between captures of C. capitata and the number of Hamlin oranges damaged, 2 and 3 weeks after capture. It was obtained equations that correlate captures and damage levels which can be used to estimate <b>control</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The average loss caused in Hamlin orange fruits by C. capitata was 2. 5 tons per hectare or 7. 5 % of production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{simulation}} model for fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV) power train in parallel configuration based on MATLAB/Simulink has been constructed {{with the power}} control strategy using logic threshold approach achieved by the hybrid control unit (HCU). Using accelerator /decelerator pedal positions generated by the driver model as the system primary input, the simulation implements difference power distribution under six vehicle operating modes. The control strategy also incorporates regenerative braking and recharge for battery capacity recovery. Main control variables in HCU and their three group threshold values are evaluated for the vehicle driven under different driving cycle schedules. The {{results indicate that the}} configuration of the FCHV model has capability for drive power request while meeting vehicle speed and battery state of charge recovery.

After <b>controlling</b> for <b>threshold</b> effects the relationship between savings and investment is found to be statistically insignificant. Additionally, <b>controlling</b> for the <b>thresholds</b> effects in a dynamic model of the current account allows for direct comparison between the savings-investment coefficient and adjustments to a country’s external balance. ...|$|R

30|$|Bishop and Rodgers (2012) found copper {{formulations}} elicited {{significantly different}} responses independent of total sorbed copper amounts. Copper sulfate has a sorption and depuration profile {{that is expected}} to rapidly move to the algae but not effectively internalize for algaecidal effects (Bishop 2016). The sorption kinetics observed by Bishop et al. (2017) in short exposures indicate Captain XTR to have increased ability to penetrate into nuisance algae and achieve internal <b>control</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and are not solely driven by active transport from externally sorbed copper. Interactivity of copper from copper sulfate with water chemistry (e.g., alkalinity; Meyer 1999) and algal cells (Crist et al. 1990) is predicted to rapidly remove copper mass. This would limit the travel distance down a canal, and copper sulfate may not continue to enter the cell to attain internal <b>control</b> <b>thresholds</b> (Bishop et al. 2018). Murray-Gulde et al. (2002) found copper half-lives to be lower with copper sulfate than chelated copper in some natural waters. Masuda and Boyd (1993) also found lower half-lives of copper sulfate than chelated copper under elevated pH conditions and presence of different sediment types. Therefore, algaecidal efficacy and distance of control is predicted to decrease with copper sulfate compared with chelated copper, even at shorter distances. Understanding the activity of different copper formulations can be valuable and highly applicable in achieving desired management objectives while complying with regulatory standards.|$|R
