2500|$|Orthodontists were {{resistant}} to adopting Invisalign at first, in particular because the founders had no orthodontic credentials or expertise, but the product became popular among consumers. In 2000 Align Technology planned a $31 million television advertising campaign that The New York Times said would be [...] "the most aggressive <b>consumer</b> <b>advertising</b> plan the dental profession has ever seen". The company raised about $140 million in funding over four rounds from 1997 to 2000. $130 million in additional funding {{was raised in}} 2001 through {{an initial public offering}} on NASDAQ. By 2001, 75 percent of the 8,500 orthodontists in North America had been trained on the Invisalign system. That same year, Align Technology made Invisalign available to general dentists following a class-action lawsuit that alleged making the system available only to orthodontists resulted in unfair competition for dentists.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides some}} empirical {{findings of the}} relationships between the antecedents as well as the outcomes variables of <b>consumers?</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising.</b> <b>Consumer</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising</b> is defined as the tendency toward disbelief of advertising claims (Obermiller and Spangenberg, 1998). The beauty product industry is used as a context of study, due to the proliferation of manipulative ad claims in the industry. For the purpose of a preliminary study, this paper will employ one product category and a fictitious brand to examine <b>consumers?</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising.</b> The fictitious brand choice and product category choice has been derived from a focus group study. Analysis has revealed that self-esteem, consumers? susceptibility to interpersonal influences to informational factors and marketplace knowledge does not have a significant relationship with <b>consumers?</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising</b> as hypothesized. However, cynicism and consumer susceptibility of interpersonal influences to normative factors are found to be strong predictors of <b>consumers?</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising.</b> <b>Consumers?</b> skepticism toward <b>advertising</b> is also found to influence inferences of manipulative intent positively; this finding empirically supports the gap in Campbell?s (1995) study on inferences of manipulative intent. Inferences of manipulative intent also have significant relationships with attitude toward the advertisement and product judgment. The implications and recommendations are also discussed...|$|R
