5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine <b>chutes.</b> UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when the bases in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E
5|$|Splash dams, greased <b>chutes,</b> {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

50|$|The {{throw-out}} pilot <b>chute</b> is {{the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot <b>chute</b> is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot <b>chute.</b> When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot <b>chute</b> into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the pilot <b>chute</b> continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out pilot <b>chute</b> and the throw-out pilot <b>chute</b> were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|R
5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the <b>chutes</b> to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E
5|$|Over the Type UBIs' {{first year}} of service, UB-4 and UB-13 were both lost, and UB-2 and UB-5 were {{transferred}} to the Baltic Flotilla. In March 1917, UB-6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned {{for the rest of}} the war, along with her crew. The four remaining Type UBIs in Flanders—UB-10, UB-12, UB-16, UB-17—were all converted to minelayers by 1918, having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with <b>chutes</b> to carry up to eight mines. All but UB-10 were lost in 1918; UB-10, in poor repair and out of service, was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash <b>chutes</b> or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E

40|$|IN MANY FACTORIES, {{the feed}} <b>chute</b> {{of the first}} mill is {{operated}} with a high <b>chute</b> level {{for the purpose of}} maximising the cane rate through the mill. There is a trend towards trying to control <b>chute</b> level within a small control range near the top of a <b>chute</b> that can result in rapid changes in cane feeding rate to maintain the <b>chute</b> level set point. This paper reviews the theory that predicts higher cane rate with higher <b>chute</b> level and discusses the main weakness in the theory that it does not consider the beneficial effect on capacity of cane falling {{from the top of the}} <b>chute</b> to the top surface of the cane mat. An extension to the <b>chute</b> theory model is described that predicts higher capacity with lower <b>chute</b> level because of the effect of the falling cane. The original model and this extended model are believed to be the upper and lower limits to the true effect. The paper reports an experiment that measured the real effect of <b>chute</b> level on capacity and finds that increasing <b>chute</b> level does lead to higher capacity but that the trend is only about one-third as strong as the original theory predicted. The paper questions whether the benefits of slightly greater capacity outweigh the costs of operating with the small control range near the top of the <b>chute...</b>|$|R

5|$|The major {{trade was}} salt. The {{arrival of the}} Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was {{detrimental}} to the salt trade at first, but ultimately beneficial, as salt was tipped down <b>chutes</b> from the canal into barges on the river navigation. Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal, which provided a link to Weston Point, where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide, as the water was deeper. The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900, with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks, capable of handling 1000-tonne coasters. With {{the opening of the}} Manchester Ship Canal, a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point. All water from the river entered the canal nearby, and any surplus was released into the Mersey through the Weaver sluices, which were located just upstream of the junction.|$|E
5|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} that Native Americans {{had been using}} the area for at least 8,500 years before present, and had been present at Cascade Pass for at least 9,600 years. Wild game was apparently utilized by Native Americans, and obsidian was exploited since at least 5,000 years before present. They used several routes that passed through the region, and may have used its natural resources during the summer. Some tribes personified the mountains and incorporated them into their religions. Many of these routes followed ridge tops {{in order to avoid}} the dense brush and avalanche <b>chutes</b> of the valley bottoms. Horses were also used in the eighteenth century. There was a trail used by Native Americans as a route between Lake Chelan and the Suiattle River valley. The trail apparently traversed Cloudy Pass, which is some distance east of the lake. It was later used by miners and shepherds in the early 1900s. Shepherding was banned on Miners Ridge in 1940, but the popularity of the area continued to grow. Due to the area's popularity, the surrounding meadows deteriorated as a result of livestock grazing and off-trail hiking. As a result, livestock were allocated to the nearby Lady Camp Basin and hardier plants were introduced to the area surrounding the lake.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency <b>chutes</b> to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc <b>chutes,</b> a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc.
