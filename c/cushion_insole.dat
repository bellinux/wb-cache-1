40|$|Studies of foot orthoses {{suggest that}} they can improve foot pain and function, {{although}} the precise mode of action of foot orthoses is poorly understood. It is proposed that they may act through the modification of abnormal stresses or motions occurring within the foot. The central aim of this thesis is to explore whether functional foot orthoses can systematically modify bone stress in the midfoot as measured on magnetic resonance imaging. Bone marrow lesion patterns quantified on magnetic resonance imaging was proposed as a surrogate measure of bone stress in the foot. A reliable method of bone segmentation and BML volume measurement was developed and applied in this thesis. In the interventional study of this thesis, the effect of functional foot orthoses on mechanical medial midfoot pain, foot impairment, patterns of bone marrow lesions and foot kinematics were investigated. Thirty seven participants with mechanical midfoot pain and medial midfoot bone marrow lesions {{participated in the study}} and were allocated to wear either functional foot orthoses (n= 21) or a <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> (n= 16). The effect of the orthosis intervention on foot pain, impairment and volumes of magnetic resonance bone marrow lesions was compared in each group. In addition, the gait parameters and foot kinematics were assessed in a subset of 20 participants (functional foot orthoses n= 10 and <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> n= 10). Foot pain and foot impairment outcomes improved more in the functional foot orthoses group than the control group wearing <b>cushioning</b> <b>insoles.</b> The results suggest that the volumes of bone marrow lesions in the medial foot bones were reduced systematically in the functional foot orthoses group. In comparison, those wearing the <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> showed no change greater than measurement error. There was no evidence in the small subset of 7 participants, that foot kinematics were systematically altered when wearing either the <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> or functional foot orthoses compared to in-shoe only analyses. The results reported in this thesis suggest that the biomechanical mechanism of functional foot orthoses in treating foot pain could be the modification of internal forces rather than their systematically influencing magnitudes of foot motion. This new data indicates that functional foot orthoses appear to have the potential to reduce foot pain and alter patterns of bone marrow lesions (a surrogate measure of bone stress) in the medial midfoot bones and further work is now required to explore this formally in larger studies...|$|R
40|$|Insoles {{represent}} a mean by which humans can improve postural comfort or existence and manifestation of posture static and dynamic. The {{variety of materials}} and sizes for different kinds of foot insoles are for manufacturers a challenge {{in terms of getting}} products flexible, versatile and easily adaptable to a larger range of subjects. Biomechanical foot dysfunction influences plantar load distribution and mechanical tissue stress. Greater influence over plantar loads and tissue stress may lead to optimize the insole design to improve foot biomechanics. Some investigations founded that the use of <b>cushioned</b> <b>insoles</b> reduces the risk of stress fractures and injuries; other research has shown no protective effect. The use of <b>cushioned</b> or shock-absorbing <b>insoles</b> invoked reducing the impact forces associated with running, protecting against injuries. The paper emphasizes a new method for analysis of the insoles materials behavior in different alkalis and acids, similar to those encountered in real situations when walking and standing. The behavior study of composite structure insoles started to establish constructive variants and the modality of exposure of these samples at different degrees of softening in simple water, in water with salinity and under negative and positive temperature, also to mechanical stress...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} explored how shock-pad {{density and}} footwear cushioning influences soccer players' biomechanics. Ten participants (20. 9 ? 2. 5 yrs, 83. 2 ? 7. 1 kg, UK footwear size 10 - 11) wore three footwear cushioning conditions (soccer boot, soccer boot with <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> and soccer boot with heel insert). Each footwear condition was tested on two shock-pad densities (55 g/litre and 65 g/litre) beneath a third generation carpet. For each footwear-shock-pad combination, eight running trials (3. 81 m/s) and eight turning trials (consistent self-selected speeds) were collected. Pressure insole {{data were collected}} to provide a measure of player loading at impact and propulsion. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated no main effects of footwear. The greater surface density did however, significantly increase (p < 0. 05) measurements associated with loading during running (first metatarsal peak pressure) and turning (peak impact force, lateral heel and first metatarsal peak pressure). These findings suggest that shock-pad density {{is important in the}} regulation of player loading. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{fractures}} {{and back}} pain are common for gymnasts {{due to the}} impact of landing. When a gymnast performs a back tuck, the vertical impact force experienced during landings can be very high and is a major cause of injuries. Landing forces can range from 3. 9 to 14. 4 times the gymnast 2 ̆ 7 s body weight (Panzer, 1987; McNitt Gray, 1993). How much impact force affects the body during a back tuck, and can shoe inserts reduce the amount of impact force? Two portable force plates were secured on a gym floor, surrounded with mats, and covered with a thin mat to provide cushion. Forty gymnasts performed back tucks onto the force plates, and the results were transmitted to a computer using PASCO software for data collection and analysis. Each gymnasts performed the back tucks in four ways: barefoot, wearing athletic shoes, inserting low-impact <b>cushioned</b> <b>insoles,</b> and inserting high-impact performance insoles. A total of 160 impact events were used for analysis. Results from this study revealed that vertical impact force can be reduced with shoe insoles. By understanding repetitive impact force, gymnasts will be able to reduce the stress and strain that affect their bodies...|$|R
40|$|Foot orthoses are {{commonly}} prescribed by health professionals {{as a form}} of intervention for the symptomatic foot in rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is a limited evidence base to support the use of foot orthoses in this patient group. This article provides a critical review of the use of foot orthoses in the management of rheumatoid arthritic foot pathologies. A search was conducted in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (current issue of the Cochrane Library), Physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro), Medline, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) and from reference lists in journal articles. The language was restricted to English. Searching of the databases was undertaken between December 2004 and March 2005. The results indicated there is no consensus of opinion on the choice of foot orthoses used for the management of pathology in the rheumatoid foot, although there is strong evidence that foot orthoses do reduce pain and improve functional ability. The type of foot orthoses used ranged from simple <b>cushioned</b> <b>insoles</b> to custom-made rigid cast devices. Methodological issues raised included small sample size and poor use of valid and reliable outcome measures. There is limited evidence pertaining to cost-effectiveness. The results indicated a need for further investigation into the most clinically and cost-effective foot orthoses to prescribe in the management of the rheumatoid arthritic foot. This review highlights the need to identify the various types of foot orthoses that are most effective in the management of the established rheumatoid arthritic foot...|$|R
40|$|A forefoot-offloading shoes has a negative-heel rocker outsole {{and is used}} {{to treat}} {{diabetic}} plantar forefoot ulcers, but its mechanisms of action and their association with offloading and gait stability are not sufficiently clear. Ten neuropathic diabetic patients were tested in a forefoot-offloading shoe and subsequently in a control shoe with no specific offloading construction, both worn on the right foot (control shoe on left), while walking at 1. 2 m/s. 3 D-instrumented gait analysis and simultaneous in-shoe plantar pressure measurements were used to explain the shoe's offloading efficacy and to define centre-of-pressure profiles and left-to-right symmetry in ankle joint dynamics (0 - 1, 1 :maximum symmetry), as indicators for gait stability. Compared to the control shoe, peak forefoot pressures, vertical ground reaction force, plantar flexion angle, and ankle joint moment, all in terminal stance, and the proximal-to-distal centre-of-pressure trajectory were significantly reduced in the forefoot-offloading shoe (P < 0. 01). Peak ankle joint power was 51 % lower in the forefoot-offloading shoe compared to the control shoe: 1. 61 (0. 35) versus 3. 30 (0. 84) W/kg (mean (SD), P < 0. 001), and {{was significantly associated with}} forefoot peak pressure (R(2) = 0. 72, P < 0. 001). Left-to-right symmetry in the forefoot-offloading shoe was 0. 39 for peak ankle joint power. By virtue to their negative-heel rocker-outsole design, forefoot-offloading shoes significantly alter a neuropathic diabetic patient's gait towards a reduced push-off power that explains the shoe's offloading efficacy. However, gait symmetry and stability are compromised, and may be factors in the low perceived walking discomfort and limited use of these shoes in clinical practice. Shoe modifications (e. g. less negative heel, a more <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole)</b> may resolve this trade-off between efficacy and usabilit...|$|R
40|$|Background There are {{few studies}} to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of orthoses on foot function and pain whilst playing golf. Objectives The study aimed {{to evaluate the}} capacity of three different types of orthoses to alleviate levels of pain, whilst playing golf. Method Over a period of 3 months, 32 amateur golfers took part in a Randomised Control Trial which looked at a prefabricated over-the-counter golf orthosis against a placebo and a <b>cushioning</b> Poron <b>insole</b> using two validated tools—the Foot Health Status Questionnaire and the Foot Posture Index. Results Of the 27 golfers that completed the trial, the results showed that the use of orthoses whilst playing golf reduced the levels of pain experienced, with equally positive responses in the placebo group. Of statistical significance (where p > 0. 05) was the improvement in foot posture of the right foot (p = 0. 053), for those using the Golf Orthaheel. A visual analogue scale showed statistically significant pain reduction (p = 0. 007) when using the Poron insole. The results from this trial suggest that orthoses may have an effect in reducing pain and improving foot posture by controlling pronatory movements in golfers. ...|$|R
40|$|Plantar loading may {{influence}} comfort, performance and injury risk in soccer boots. This {{study investigated the}} effect of cleat configuration and <b>insole</b> <b>cushioning</b> levels on perception of comfort and in-shoe plantar pressures at the heel and fifth metatarsal head region. Nine soccer academy players (age 15. 7  ±  1. 6  years; height 1. 80  ±  0. 40  m; body mass 71. 9  ±  6. 1  kg) {{took part in the}} study. Two boot models (8 and 6 cleats) and two insoles (Poron and Poron/gel) provided four footwear combinations assessed using pressure insoles during running and 180 ° turning. Mechanical and comfort perception tests differentiated boot and insole conditions. During biomechanical testing, the Poron insole generally provided lower peak pressures than the Poron/gel insole, particularly during the braking step of the turn. The boot model did not independently influence peak pressures at the fifth metatarsal, and had minimal influence on heel loads. Specific boot-insole combinations performed differently (P <  0. 05). The 8 -cleat boot and the Poron insole performed best biomechanically and perceptually, but the combined condition did not. Inclusion of kinematic data and improved control of the turning technique are recommended to strengthen future research. The mechanical, perception and biomechanical results highlight the need for a multi-faceted approach in the assessment of footwear...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{three studies}} investigating biomechanical responses {{to changes in}} shoe-surface combinations in soccer. In the first study, six male participants (21. 7 [S. D. 2. 2] yrs, 74. 0 [S. D. 6. 9] kg [March], 74. 6 [S. D. 6. 9] kg (May), footwear size 10 - 11) performed running and turning movements on natural and third generation artificial surfaces whilst wearing different soccer specific footwear. This was performed at two {{times of the year}} where contrasting weather conditions were experienced. It was observed that there were significant differences when the natural and third generation artificial turf surfaces were compared. These differences however, were dependent on the type of movement, time of year and biomechanical measurement used. Each surface was also compared between the two test occasions. The main finding was that for both running and turning peak pressures and peak pressure loading rates were significantly greater in May (when the surfaces were mechanically hard) compared with the same surface in March. It was concluded that comparisons of third generation surfaces with natural turf are dependent on the specific properties of the surfaces and cannot be generalized for all such surfaces. A critical design feature of third generation surfaces that will influence biomechanical comparisons with other playing surfaces is the shock pad layer. In the second experimental chapter, ten male participants (20. 9 yrs [S. D. 2. 5], 83. 2 kg [S. D. 7. 1], footwear size 10 - 11) were used to assess the effect of two different shock pad densities (55 g and 65 g) (Arpro® Expanded polypropylene BF 2455 W, 24 mm S. D. 0. 5 mm thick, Brock International) on the lower extremity loading. These participants were also used to assess the biomechanical adaptations that occur with the inclusion of a 10 mm Sorbothane® heel insert or a Sorbothane® <b>cushioning</b> <b>insole</b> (Sorbo products division, Lancashire, UK), which have been associated with reducing overuse injury including that to the Achilles tendon. The footwear was also assessed for the risk of sustaining lateral ankle ligament damage. It was shown that whilst turning, peak impact force (taken using in-shoe pressure system) was significantly lower on the more cushioned shock pad as was peak pressure at the first metatarsal. Likewise, the time to peak impact force was significantly longer with the heel insert. However, despite the association between the heel insert and reduced dorsi-flexion, no significant differences were observed for this measurement between the footwear conditions. Peak plantar flexion was significantly greater with the heel insert whilst turning suggesting an increased loading of the lateral ankle ligaments, although rearfoot inversion was not significantly different. This study demonstrated the potential role of shock pad cushioning in providing protection from impact related injury in soccer, whilst cushioning inserts were not found to provide a protective effect. For heel inserts, the possibility of a negative influence on rearfoot stability was highlighted. It was suggested that the estimation of internal loads may reveal more regarding the specific role of cushioning interfaces and heel inserts in protecting from injury. In the final research chapter, nine male soccer players (83. 4 kg [S. D. 5. 8], 23 yrs [S. D. 3. 7]) performed running and turning movements for the same conditions described in study two. The peak plantar flexion moment, Achilles tendon force and average loading rate of these measurements, were used to assess Achilles tendon loading. Likewise, peak dorsi-flexion and eversion moments were collected to assess the lateral ankle loading. Group analysis did not reveal any significant differences in these variables. Individual data showed that the response to heel insert intervention was specific to the participant. Some participants exhibited a reduced Achilles tendon force or average loading rate, suggesting a reduced risk of injury with the heel insert. However, it was observed that eversion and dorsi-flexion moment and average loading rates increased in some participants, suggesting that these participants were at an increased risk of lateral ankle ligament injury with the heel insert. Likewise, one participant experienced significantly greater peak Achilles tendon force, also indicating a greater risk of injury to this structure. The overall conclusions gained from these studies are that the design of the footwear and playing surfaces are worth considering in the quest to reduce injury risk. It was also highlighted that the choice of shock pad density for a third generation artificial surface can be influential in the protection of the athlete even when the surface is new, particularly when turning. Finally, although the use of heel inserts has proven successful in the reduction the Achilles tendon injury, the lack of significant differences for group comparisons suggests that the mechanisms behind the success is still unclear. However, although heel inserts may prove useful in the reduction of Achilles tendon injury, the observation that significant increases in the measurements associated with acute ankle ligament damage and chronic Achilles tendon injury, suggests that heel lift may not be suitable for some individuals.

40|$|Custom-made {{footwear}} is used {{to offload}} the diabetic foot to prevent plantar foot ulcers. This prospective study evaluates the offloading effects of modifying custom-made footwear and aims to provide data-driven directions {{for the provision of}} effectively offloading footwear in clinical practice. Eighty-five people with diabetic neuropathy and a recently healed plantar foot ulcer, who participated in a clinical trial on footwear effectiveness, had their custom-made footwear evaluated with in-shoe plantar pressure measurements at three-monthly intervals. Footwear was modified when peak pressure was ≥ 200 kPa. The effect of single and combined footwear modifications on in-shoe peak pressure at these high-pressure target locations was assessed. All footwear modifications significantly reduced peak pressure at the target locations compared with pre-modification levels (range - 6. 7 % to - 24. 0 %, P < 0. 001). The metatarsal heads were most frequently targeted. Repositioning an existing (trans-) metatarsal pad in the shoe insole (- 15. 9 % peak pressure relief), applying local <b>cushioning</b> to the <b>insole</b> (- 15. 0 %) and replacing the insole top cover with Plastazote (- 14. 2 %) were the most effective single modifications. Combining a new Plastazote top cover with a trans-metatarsal bar (- 24. 0 % peak pressure relief) or with local cushioning (- 22. 0 %) were the most effective combined modifications. In people with diabetic neuropathy and a recently healed plantar foot ulcer, significant offloading can be achieved at high-risk foot regions by modifying custom-made footwear. These results provide data-driven directions for the design and evaluation of custom-made footwear for high-risk people with diabetes, and essentially mean that each shoe prescribed should incorporate those design features that effectively offload the foo...|$|R
40|$|Welfare of dogs housed on {{concrete}} versus mesh floor with plastic coating {{in a commercial}} breeding facility Van Impe, Isabelle, Depauw Sarah, Vervaecke, Hilde Odisee University College, Agro-& Biotechnology, Animal Welfare and Behaviour, Sint-Niklaas, Belgium; isabelle. vanimpe@odisee. be An important aspect of a dogs’ health and behavioural and affective wellbeing {{is determined by the}} choice of floor substrate. The Belgian law prescribes that the floor should not wound the feet, it should be flat, easy to keep dry and clean. A wooden floor is excluded and maximally half of the floor can consist of a mesh, only of a type that sufficiently supports the soles. We evaluated the effect of mesh floor with plastic coating versus concrete floors on the welfare of dogs in a commercial dog breeding facility. In 14 individually housed dogs, behavioural observations were carried out {{on concrete}} as well as on mesh floor, during four times 15 minutes, to score activity, positive and abnormal behaviours. The dogs had been housed several months on either of these floors. We found that they were significantly longer (p< 0. 036) and more frequently active (p< 0. 036) on concrete floor (paired-samples test), irrespective of the floor type they were previously habituated to. Similarly, the dogs showed longer resting behavior on the mesh floor (p< 0. 039). Results with regard to positive and abnormal behaviours were less conclusive. We carried out a preference test offering a choice between concrete and mesh floor during one hour, for 17 individuals. The dogs spent significantly more time on the mesh floor, irrespective of their previous habituation to either floor type (p< 0. 015, paired samples test). In a sample of 14 new dogs interdigital rubor, redness of <b>insole</b> <b>cushions,</b> or digital alopecia was often observed. However, their prevalence was not significantly different between floor types (chi-square, p< 0. 690). The difficulty of interpreting the behavioural results with regard to welfare will be discussed. By combining the results with a thorough literature study and by comparing the international legislation, lessons were drawn to improve current legislation. status: publishe...|$|R
