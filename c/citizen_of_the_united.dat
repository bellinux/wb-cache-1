Richardson, beginning in 1806, he edited and published a newspaper titled the Fredonian. Fredonian was a sonorous name for 'a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.' In later years it was applied to an American-inspired rebellion to separate Texas from Mexico.|$|E

5|$|After Homer sees how devastated Apu {{was about}} being deported, he changes {{his mind about}} the {{immigration}} proposition and vows {{that he and his}} family will help Apu.

After Lisa intervenes, Apu goes to take the test; he passes and becomes a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it would be if immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot is passed, the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle {{to the children of}} foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} native-born <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and {{did not come to}} the United States until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E

5|$|To become {{governor}} of Indiana, a candidate {{must be a}} <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and {{must have been a}} resident of the state in which they are running for the period of five consecutive years before the election. The candidate must also be at least 30 years old when sworn into office. The governor may not hold any other state or federal office during his term and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as governor. Before taking the office, the candidate must swear an oath of office administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana, promising to uphold the Constitution and laws of the state.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as long as one who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E
