40|$|COllide is a single-player puzzle {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls two characters simultaneously. The objective of each level is to bring the two characters together anywhere in the level with just the left, right, and up keys. The up key will allow both characters to jump. However, while one character will move according to {{the direction of the}} arrow key, the other will move in the opposite direction. Obstacles that appear in the levels include spikes, <b>crushing</b> <b>blocks</b> and doors and buttons. Get through all the levels to beat the game...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the start}} of each round, a certain number of eggs hatch into Sno-Bees, while other blocks flash to {{indicate}} that they contain eggs. As the player destroys active Sno-Bees, new ones hatch from the eggs to replace them. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees with one block awards extra points. The Sno-Bees can <b>crush</b> <b>blocks</b> in an attempt to reach Pengo. Pushing against a wall causes it to vibrate and temporarily stuns any Sno-Bees in contact with it; the player may then crush them with a block or simply run over them to destroy them. Contact with a Sno-Bee costs the player one life.|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{strength}} development and lechability aspects of metal-contaminated soil treated with {{ordinary portland cement}} (OPC) were investigated. The soil was collected from a scrap metal yard within the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Metal composition analysis indicated that the predominant metals present in the soil were iron (42, 194 mg/kg), aluminium (8874 mg/kg), zinc (690 mg/kg), lead (428 mg/kg), copper (107 mg/kg) and chromium (52 mg/kg). The contaminated soil was treated with OPC using cement-to-dry soil (C/Sd) ratios of 0. 5, 1 and 2. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by performing unconfined compressive strength (UCS) as well as <b>crushed</b> and whole <b>block</b> leaching (WBL) tests on the treated soil. The treatment results were compared to the solidified waste acceptance criteria which were compiled based on the regulatory waste disposal limit at a disposal site in the United Kingdom and the maximum concentration of contaminants for toxicity characteristic of solid wastes from United States Environmental Protection Agency. Results indicated that chemical stabilization of metal-contaminated soils using OPC was effective for prevention of metal leaching from both disintegrated samples subsequent to years of weathering (<b>crushed</b> <b>block)</b> and intact samples (whole block) into the environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{large amount}} of powder {{by-product}} is generated when Al 2 O 3 is extracted from fly ash. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the properties of the powder and find an effective method to reuse it. XRF, XRD, and SEM were used to analysis its compositions and microstructures. The powder was then compressed at the pressure of from 20 to 100 MPa. Results show that the powder was disordered calcium silicate hydrate with an average Ca/Si molar ratio of 1. 08. It becomes hardened blocks by compressing. The bulk density of the hardened blocks is between 500 and 800 kg m- 3 corresponding to the pressure of 20 to 60 MPa. Their flexible strength is from 1. 60 to 5. 35 MPa, and compressive strength from 8. 50 to 30. 50 MPa.

40|$|Commercial ß-tricalcium {{phosphate}} (ß-TCP) is commercialy {{available in}} granules manufactured by sintering of powders. We have evaluated the different {{steps of the}} manufacturing process of ß-TCP ceramics granules prepared from blocks obtained with the polyurethane foam technology. Three types of slurry were prepared with 10, 15 and 25 g of ß-TCP per gram of polyurethane foam. Analysis was done by scanning electron microscopy, EDX, Raman spectroscopy and microcomputed tomography combined with image analysis. A special algorithm was used to identify the internal microporosity (created by the calcination of the foam) from the internal macroporosity due to the spatial repartition of the material. The low ß-TCP dosages readily infiltrated the foam and the slurry was deposited along the polymer rods. On the contrary, the highest concentration produced inhomogeneous infiltrated blocks and foam cavities appeared completely filled in some areas. 2 D microcomputed sections and reconstructed 3 D models evidenced this phenomenon and the frequency distribution of the thickness and separation of material trabeculae confirmed the heterogeneity of the distribution.

40|$|Visual {{sensitivity}} of optic tectum-ablated goldfish was investigated using a classical conditioning technique. Intact fish were screened to obtain individuals which showed suppression of breathing movements {{in response to}} the visual conditioned stimulus (CS) in {{the presence or absence of}} adapting illumination. Following bilateral optic tectum ablation, responding was blocked in light-adapted but not dark-adapted fish. Response threshold testing revealed no significant postoperative changes in visual sensitivity. Small remnants of tectal tissue containing cellular elements of the periventricular gray zone and optic axon terminals were detected in some ablates but there was no evident relationship to response threshold. Optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>blocked</b> responding in ablates and recovery occurred within 2 - 3 weeks postaxotomy confirming that the response was mediated by retinal as opposed to extraretinal photostimulation. The experiments support the findings by others that tectum ablation results in decreased visual sensitivity and that conditioned visual responding can be obtained. However, we find no support for the suggestion that visual sensitivity in the ablates depends on functional recovery of regenerating optic axons which innervate non-tectal visual nuclei. Instead, the results indicate that the normal retinal projections to the non-tectal nuclei can mediate visual responding and, in addition, that postoperative conditioning experience facilitates recovery of response in ablates which initially appear to be blind to the CS...|$|R

50|$|Throat clamp is {{method of}} subduing {{often seen in}} predatory felids and {{occasionally}} canids and hyaenids.

It's more often used than the muzzle clamp and is generally safer, though slower. It is usually and most effective when positioned as near to the mandible as the carnivore can get. Between the larynx and the jaw, the windpipe is surrounded with less cartilage and is more malleable, while lower down, near the chest, the passageway would be increasingly harder to collapse, so the throat clamp is usually positioned {{high up on the}} animal's neck.|$|R
