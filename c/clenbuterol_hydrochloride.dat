40|$|<b>Clenbuterol</b> <b>Hydrochloride</b> is a {{bronchodilator}} {{marketed as}} Spirospent® for Human Pharmaceuticals and as Ventipulmin® for Veterinary Pharmaceuticals by Boehringer Ingelheim. 1 This research investigates {{formation of the}} 4 -amino-α,α-dihydroxy- 3, 5 -dichloroacetophenone impurity (Dihydroxy Impurity) in the synthesis of <b>Clenbuterol</b> <b>Hydrochloride.</b> The Dihydroxy Impurity has increased three-fold since the process was transferred to Boehringer Ingelheim Chemicals, Inc. in 1999. 1 The Dihydroxy Impurity is proposed to be produced during an amination/reduction step from a reaction of water with the starting material. 2 Additionally, the Dihydroxy Impurity can be formed by the reaction of water with an impurity, 4 -amino-α,α-didibromo- 3, 5 -dichloroacetophenone (Dibromo Impurity), that is generated in the previous step. 2 The formation of the Dibromo Impurity was investigated {{through a series of}} Design of Experiments (DoE) analyses. The results from these analyses, presented within, determined the optimum bromination conditions to reduce the Dibromo Impurity. These conditions were able to reduce the Dibromo Impurity by 75 %. A series of water spiking experiments with both the starting material of the amination/reduction step and the Dibromo Impurity were performed to investigate the formation of the Dihydroxy Impurity. Based on the results, a mechanism for the formation of the Dihydroxy Impurity is presented. The three-fold increase of the Dihydroxy Impurity was concluded to be due to ≥ 15 % water in the amination reaction mixture reacting with the starting material. REFERENCES 1. Powner, T. H.

Acetylshikonin (AS) is the main ingredient of Zicao, Xinjiang, China. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) efficacy of AS in a model of spontaneous obese db/db mice. Mice were divided into Wild Type (WT) groups and db/db groups, which received no treatment or treatment with 100 mg/kg/day <b>clenbuterol</b> (CL) <b>hydrochloride</b> or 540 mg/kg/day AS by oral gavage for eight weeks. The results provided the evidence that AS prevented obesity and NAFLD including reduction in body weight, food efficiency ratio, serum triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in db/db mice. Administration of AS markedly suppressed the levels of hepatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in treated groups when compared with that of db/db groups. Further investigation of the lipid synthesis-related protein using Western blotting revealed that hepatic protein expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein- 1 (SREBP- 1), fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) were significantly downregulated by AS treatment. These findings suggest that AS exerts anti-obesity and anti-NAFLD effects through the regulation of lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory effects...|$|R

40|$|A surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) immunoassay with an immobilization of self-assembled molecular identification membrane for {{the detection}} of residual <b>Clenbuterol</b> <b>Hydrochloride</b> (CLB) in pork liver was systematically investigated and experimentally validated for its high performance. SPR immunoassay with a regular competitive inhibition assay cannot be directly verified to detect CLB residuals. In this study, the binding of Au film with mercaptopropionic acid was investigated using the known form of the strong S-Au covalent bonds formed by the chemical radical of the mercaptopropionic acid and the Au film. After that, the immunoglobulin IgG of swine (SwIgG-CLB) was bonded with the mercaptopropionic acid by covalent -CO-NH- amide bonding. The modified comprehensive analysis of how the membrane structure works was introduced together with the customized SPR bioanalyzer. In order to evaluate the performance of this biomembrane structure, the concentrations of CLB-contained solutions of 0 ng · mL(- 1), 10 ng · mL(- 1), 20 ng · mL(- 1), 33. 3 ng · mL(- 1), and 40 ng · mL(- 1) were prepared by adding CLB reagents into the solutions of CLB antibody (<b>Clenbuterol</b> <b>Hydrochloride</b> Antibody, CLB-Ab), successively and then the response unit (RU) was measured individually. Using the data collected from the linear CCD array, the fitting curve was established with the R-Square value of 0. 9929. Correspondingly, the recovery rate ranged from 88. 48 % to 103. 21 % was experimented and the limit of detection of CLB in 1. 26 ng · mL(- 1) was obtained efficiently. It was concluded that the detection method associated with biomembrane properties is expected to contribute much to the determination of residual CLB in pork liver quantitatively by using the customized SPR bioanalyzer...|$|E

The detection wavelength and the flow rate were set at 254  nm and 0. 7  mL/min, respectively. The effects of proportion of organic additives, alcohol displacer and temperature on the separation were investigated. The results indicated that eight chiral drugs were separated on chiral stationary phase of amylase ramification in normal phase chromatographic system. The chromatographic retention and resolution of enantiomers were adjusted by factors, including the changes of the concentration of alcohol displacer in mobile phase, organic alkaline modifier and column temperature. It was shown that the resolution was improved with reducing concentration of alcohol displacer. When the concentration of organic alkaline modifier was 0. 2 %, the resolution and the peak shape were fairly good.

40|$|The {{population}} {{of patients with}} Parkinson's disease, already {{the second most common}} neurodegenerative disorder, is continuing to grow. Despite years of research, no cure or clear pathogenic pathway has been discovered. However, the SNCA gene and its protein product, α-synuclein, have emerged as an important focus in both inherited and sporadic Parkinson's disease. Dosage effects created by duplication and triplication of the SNCA locus can cause the death of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Naturally occurring overexpression of α-synuclein has been found to have the same devastating consequences. Most current drug development has focused on alleviating the overproduction of α-synuclein, instead of stopping it. We have hypothesized that by repressing endogenous SNCA gene expression at the transcription level we can prevent overexpression of α-synuclein and its associated toxicity. The discovery that β 2 -agonists, specifically <b>clenbuterol</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> can reduce SNCA mRNA abundance and protein expression has implicated the β 2 -adrenergic receptor pathway as a potential regulatory target. We have further found that clenbuterol causes hypoaceytlation of histone H 3 that may downregulate SNCA expression. Although, the precise mechanism by which β 2 -agonists are regulating SNCA expression needs to be further explained, our findings present exciting data that could potentially lead to a novel treatment for not just Parkinson's disease, but other synucleinopathies as well...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and evaluates {{information about}} the characteristics and risks of using <b>Clenbuterol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (CCL) for their potential toxic effects, due to its inclusion in animal food (cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry) to improve productive-reproductive parameters, but neglecting food safety. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} reassess the potential dangers that may result when used in both human and veterinary medicine. The β-adrenergic synthetic CCL, white powder, anhydrous, highly water soluble and highly stable at room temperature is used in a clandestine manner to fatten animals for human consumption. Therapeutically, it is used as a bronchodilator drug (asthma patients); its illegal use (doping) has been detected in sports competitions, and it is used for bodybuilding due to its anabolic effect. Its use in cattle for slaughter modifies and increases the growth of muscle mass and reduces fat accumulation, which accumulates in different organs. In people with a history of bovine liver consumption contaminated with CCL, there has been registration of: tremor, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, and tachycardia. In Mexico, in an illegal and clandestine manner, there is distribution, marketing and use of CCL; however, the work of livestock organizations in registering production units free of this substance will ensure the consumption of meat products. Moreover, to propose the use of other substances which so far have no signs of toxicity will lead to a sustainable, secure and safe productivity in livestock units...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine whether}} β 2 -adrenergic agonist-induced {{hypertrophy}} of the quadriceps skeletal muscle can modulate {{the severity of}} osteoarthritis (OA) in the rodent meniscectomy (MNX) model. MethodsMale Lewis rats were subcutaneously administered with 1. 5 mg/kg/day <b>clenbuterol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (n= 15) or saline vehicle (n= 20) for 14 days. Following pre-treatment, five animals from each group were sacrificed to assess the immediate effects of clenbuterol. The remaining animals underwent either invasive knee surgery (clenbuterol pre-treated n= 10; saline pre-treated n= 10) or a sham control surgical procedure (saline pre-treated n= 5). During disease initiation and progression, weight bearing was assessed by hindlimb loading. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein isoforms were quantified by silver stained SDS PAGE. OA severity was graded by assessment of toluidine blue stained step coronal sections of the total knee joint. ResultsClenbuterol treatment resulted {{in an increase in}} total bodyweight, growth rate and in quadriceps skeletal muscle mass. Meniscal surgery resulted in the development of OA-like lesions, changes to weight bearing, and changes in MHC protein expression in the quadriceps. Clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy had no effect on either weight bearing or articular pathology following MNX surgery. ConclusionsOur data reveal that clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is unable to mimic the beneficial clinical effects of increased musculature derived through targeted strength training in humans, in a rodent model of MNX-induced OA. In addition we observed fibre-type switching to “slow twitch” in the quadriceps muscle during the induction of OA that warrants further investigation as to its relationship to joint stability...|$|E

Cysteinyl {{leukotriene}} receptor antagonists {{have been shown to}} be effective in CVA, but there are no reports on their effectiveness in AC. To evaluate the antitussive effect of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in CVA and AC. MethodsSeventy-five patients with chronic cough received diagnostic bronchodilator therapy with oral <b>clenbuterol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> for 6 days. Of the 75 patients, 48 and 27 met the simplified diagnostic criteria for CVA and AC, respectively. Patients with CVA were randomly divided into 3 groups: montelukast, clenbuterol, and montelukast plus clenbuterol. Patients with AC were randomly divided into 2 groups: montelukast and placebo. The efficacy of cough treatment was assessed with a subjective cough symptom scale (0 meant “no cough” and 10 denoted “cough as bad as at first visit”). The cough scale, pulmonary function test, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) were evaluated before and after 2 weeks of treatment. ResultsIn patients with CVA, 2 -week treatment with montelukast, clenbuterol, and montelukast plus clenbuterol all significantly decreased cough scores and treatment with montelukast plus clenbuterol was superior to treatment with montelukast alone. In the montelukast plus clenbuterol group, PEF values in the morning and evening significantly increased after 2 weeks compared with values before treatment. In patients with AC, scores on the cough scale did not differ significantly between the montelukast group and the placebo group. ConclusionsMontelukast was confirmed to suppress chronic non-productive cough in CVA, whereas it was not effective in non-productive cough in AC...|$|E

40|$|Transcervical AI was {{attempted}} in 178 mixed age Romney ewes. AI {{was performed}} between 48 and 52 h after synchronisation of oestrus with progesterone impregnated CIDRs. Fresh or frozen-thawed semen was used and each insemination dose contained approximately 100 million spermatozoa. Half of these ewes were treated prior to AI with <b>clenbuterol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (PanipartTM) {{in an attempt}} to cause cervical softening to allow insertion of an inseminating pipette through the cervix. Reproductive tracts were recovered from 32 ewes in which transcervical insemination was achieved. After flushing each tract the spermatozoa were counted from the cervix and from the left uterine segment. 94 % of ewes showed oestrus within 48 h of CIDR withdrawal. Variation in time of onset of oestrus prior to AI did not affect conception rate (P> 0. 05). The conception rate based on non-return to oestrus was 34 %. A greater percentage of ewes conceived to insemination with fresh semen (42 %) than that for frozen-thawed (24 %) (P< 0. 05). Clenbuterol did not affect depth of cervical penetration but it did reduce bleeding at the cervical os observed at AI (P< 0. 01). Parity/age of ewe significantly affected depth of cervical penetration (P< 0. 001) and the time taken to inseminate (P< 0. 01), with few two tooth ewes successfully transcervically inseminated (76 % were vaginally inseminated). Sperm numbers were significantly higher in the cervices of ewes that were inseminated with fresh rather than frozen-thawed semen (P< 0. 05). Numbers of spermatozoa recovered were low in comparison to similar studies and were related to the extent of cervical damage (recorded at dissection of reproductive tracts). Uterine sperm counts were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) for those ewes where cervical damage was observed. The depth of insemination was estimated at the time of AI, and full cervical penetration was recorded in 68 % of the mature ewes. However examination of the ewe cervices at dissection suggested that this figure was misleading. Anatomical evidence suggested that the inseminating needle had frequently lodged in the cervical wall and successful passage had not been achieved. Therefore it was likely that semen was deposited frequently in areas of damaged cervical tissue which would have been detrimental to survival of spermatozoa. This was probably the main reason for the low sperm numbers in the reproductive tracts and consequently the low conception rate. For those ewes where full cervical penetration was recorded at AI, only 28 % conceived...|$|E
