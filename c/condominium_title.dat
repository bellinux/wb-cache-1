2500|$|Regina's second {{multi-story}} {{office block}} after the venerable and now-demolished McCallum & Hill Building was the Motherwell Building {{at the corner}} of Victoria Avenue and Rose Street. It was constructed in 1954–56 to a design by local Regina architects in the typical [...] "international style," [...] with its outer service being Tyndall stone. Its purpose was to house, inter alia, Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA) and Western Canadian Engineering Projects. It has official heritage status in recognition of its architectural significance and has now been converted to <b>condominium</b> <b>title</b> and residential use.|$|E

Many problems have arisen {{with the process}} of managing high rise multiple ownership property resulting in dilapidated, unsafe buildings. The Government is considering changing the ownership method to a statutory system, such as a strata or <b>condominium</b> <b>title</b> system as a way of resolving some of the management difficulties. Using an institutional economic framework this paper considers whether changing the ownership system will alter people's behaviour and reduce management problems. The framework draws on theory developed from the problems of collective choice action and the management of common pool resources. The paper concludes that the existing common law system fails to take account of the innate difficulty of rational self-interested individuals acting for their collective good, without some central authority to provide management. This would be provided in a statutory system such as a condominium or strata title system. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of mass tourism, destinations are constantly {{faced with the challenge}} of providing an adequate supply of suitable accommodation. The introduction of condominium style accommodation seemed to be the answer to the problem of meeting the increasing tourism demand at some popular destinations, although in some destinations investment in property development has increasingly become a supply driven activity. However, the resulting complexities brought about by the many stakeholders involved in managing the <b>condominiums</b> (including strata <b>title</b> legislation, investment incentives, and long-term maintenance of condominium developments) have introduced previously unforeseen problems to destinations reaching maturity. This study investigates the impacts of the growth of condominium developments and their potential for inhibiting destination rejuvenation. The study was conducted on Australia&# 039;s Gold Coast, a classic example of a mass tourism resort where ironically, the growth of condominium style accommodation was a major factor in attracting large numbers of tourists, but may, in fact, prevent successful rejuvenation in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} field study data {{to provide an}} {{examination}} of the condominium owner / manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, 1990). The study specifically focuses on strata <b>title</b> <b>condominiums</b> located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

40|$|In late January 2013, the Third District Court of Appeal sent shockwaves {{throughout}} {{the real estate}} community with regards to condominium associations’ rights as unit owners. In AventuraManagement, LLC v. Spiaggia Ocean Condominium Association (Spiaggia), the appellate court interpreted Florida Statute § 718. 1162 in an unprecedented way. The court held that if a <b>condominium</b> association takes <b>title</b> to a unit before the bank forecloses on a defaulting unit owner, the association is {{jointly and severally liable}} for all past due assessments with the previous owner that came due, up to the time of transfer of <b>title.</b> 3 <b>Condominium</b> associations across Florida became worried that the Spiaggia decision could spark a judicial trend that limits associations’ ability to recoup delinquent assessment fees. Although the Spiaggia court likely ruled correctly from an appellate perspective, the outcome of the case is contrary to the legislative intent of § 718. 116 and could have disastrous consequences for Florida condominium associations. This Comment begins by explaining in great detail the facts and procedural posture of Spiaggia from the trial court to the appellate court level. Following the factual analysis, this Comment discusses the potential and actual effects of Spiaggia and looks to the legislative intent of § 718. 116 to attempt to resolve the existing conflict. Finally, this Comment raises various issues that the Florida Legislature should address in reaction to the Spiaggia decision...|$|R
