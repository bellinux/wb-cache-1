50|$|Although <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> {{has very}} {{specific}} parameters of diagnosis, its causes {{on the other}} hand can vary tremendously. The following are three case studies with different reasons for <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> {{is caused}} by {{bilateral}} cortical lesions in the primary auditory cortex located in the temporal lobes of the brain. The ascending auditory pathways are damaged, causing a loss of perception of sound. Inner ear functions, however, remains intact. <b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> is most often cause by stroke, but can also result from brain injury or birth defects. More specifically, a common cause is bilateral embolic stroke {{to the area of}} Heschl's gyri. <b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> is extremely rare, with only twelve reported cases. Each case has a distinct context and different rates of recovery.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> could {{be a part of}} a {{spectrum}} of an overall cortical hearing disorder. In some cases, patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> have had recovery of some hearing function, resulting in partial auditory deficits such as auditory verbal agnosia. This syndrome might be difficult to distinguish from a bilateral temporal lesion such as described above.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{extent to}} which the {{auditory}} system, like the visual system, processes spatial stimulus characteristics such as location and motion in separate specialized neuronal modules or in one homogenously distributed network is unresolved. Here we present a patient with a selective deficit for the perception and discrimination of auditory motion following resection of the right anterior temporal lobe and the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). Analysis of stimulus identity and location within the auditory scene remained intact. In addition, intracranial auditory evoked potentials, recorded preoperatively, revealed motion-specific responses selectively over the resected right posterior STG, and electrical cortical stimulation of this region was experienced by the patient as incoming moving sounds. Collectively, these data present a patient with <b>cortical</b> motion <b>deafness,</b> providing evidence that cortical processing of auditory motion is performed in a specialized module within the posterior STG...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{cochlear}} implant {{is the most}} successful of all neural prostheses developed to date. It {{is the most effective}} prosthesis in terms of restoration of function, and the people who have received a {{cochlear implant}} outnumber the recipients of other types of neural prostheses by orders of magnitude. The primary {{purpose of this article is}} to provide an overview of contemporary cochlear implants from the perspective of two designers of implant systems. That perspective includes the anatomical situation presented by the deaf cochlea and how the different parts of an implant system (including the user’s brain) must work together to produce the best results. In particular, we present the design considerations just mentioned and then describe in detail how the current levels of performance have been achieved. We also describe two recent advances in implant design and performance. In concluding sections, we first present strengths and limitations of present systems and then offer some possibilities for further improvements in this technology. In all, remarkable progress has been made in the development of cochlear implants but much room still remains for improvements, especially for patients presently at the low end of the performance spectrum. Key words: auditory prosthesis, cochlea, cochlear implant, <b>cortical</b> plasticity, <b>deafness,</b> hearing, neural prosthesis, rehabil-itation, speech perception, speech processor. processing and multiple sites of stimulation in the cochlea were developed and these systems supported significantly higher levels of speech reception than their single-channel and single-site predecessors.

Indeed, a principa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile many {{individuals}} can benefit substantially from cochlear implantation, {{the ability to}} perceive and understand auditory speech with a cochlear implant (CI) remains highly variable amongst adult recipients. Importantly, auditory performance with a CI cannot be reliably predicted based solely on routinely obtained information regarding clinical characteristics of the CI candidate. This review argues that central factors, notably cortical function and plasticity, should also be considered as important contributors to the observed individual variability in CI outcome. Superior temporal cortex (STC), including auditory association areas, {{plays a crucial role}} in the processing of auditory and visual speech information. The current review considers evidence of cortical plasticity within bilateral STC, and how these effects may explain variability in CI outcome. Furthermore, evidence of audio-visual interactions in temporal and occipital cortices is examined, and relation to CI outcome is discussed. To date, longitudinal examination of changes in cortical function and plasticity over the period of rehabilitation with a CI has been restricted by methodological challenges. The application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in studying cortical function in CI users is becoming increasingly recognised as a potential solution to these problems. Here we suggest that fNIRS offers a powerful neuroimaging tool to elucidate the relationship between audio-visual interactions, <b>cortical</b> plasticity during <b>deafness</b> and following cochlear implantation, and individual variability in auditory performance with a CI...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> {{is a rare}} form of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss caused by damage to the primary {{auditory}} cortex. <b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> is an auditory disorder where the patient is unable to hear sounds but has no apparent damage to the anatomy of the ear (see auditory system), which {{can be thought of}} as the combination of auditory verbal agnosia and auditory agnosia. Patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> cannot hear any sounds, that is, they are not aware of sounds including non-speech, voices, and speech sounds. Although patients appear and feel completely deaf, they can still exhibit some reflex responses such as turning their head towards a loud sound.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> and {{auditory}} agnosia have many similarities, diagnosing the disorder {{proves to be}} difficult. Bilateral lesions near the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are important criteria. <b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> requires demonstration that brainstem auditory responses arenormal, but cortical evoked potentials are impaired. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), {{also referred to as}} brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) show the neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt. The latency of the responses gives critical information: if <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> is applicable, LLR (long-latency responses) are completely abolished and MLR (middle latency responses) are either abolished or significantly impaired. In auditory agnosia, LLRs and MLRs are preserved.|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{stimulation}} {{during childhood}} {{is critical for}} the development of the auditory cortex in humans and with that for hearing in adulthood. Age-related changes in morphology and peak latencies of the cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) have led to the use of this cortical response as a biomarker of auditory cortical maturation including studies of <b>cortical</b> development after <b>deafness</b> and subsequent cochlear implantation. To date, it is unknown whether prelingually deaf adults, with early onset deafness (before the age of 2 years) and who received a cochlear implant (CI) only during adulthood, would display absent or aberrant CAEP waveforms as predicted from CAEP studies in late implanted prelingually deaf children. In the current study, CAEP waveforms were recorded in response to electric stimuli in prelingually deaf adults, who received their CI after the age of 21 years. Waveform morphology and peak latencies were compared to the CAEP responses obtained in postlingually deaf adults, who became deaf after the age of 16. Unexpectedly, typical CAEP waveforms with adult-like P 1 -N 1 -P 2 morphology could be recorded in the prelingually deaf adult CI users. On visual inspection, waveform morphology was comparable to the CAEP waveforms recorded in the postlingually deaf CI users. Interestingly, however, latencies of the N 1 peak were significantly shorter and amplitudes were significantly larger in the prelingual group than in the postlingual group. The presence of the CAEP together with an early and large N 1 peak might represent activation of the more innate and less complex components of the auditory cortex of the prelingually deaf CI user, whereas the CAEP in postlingually deaf CI users might reflect activation of the mature neural network still present in these patients. The CAEPs may therefore be helpful in the assessment of developmental state of the auditory cortex...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> that is often overlooked is that patients feel deaf. They are aware of their inability to hear environmental sounds, non-speech and speech sounds. Patients with auditory agnosia can be unaware of their deficit, and insist {{that they are not}} deaf. Verbal deafness and auditory agnosia are disorders of a selective, perceptive and associative nature whereas <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> relies on the anatomic and functional disconnection of the auditory cortex from acoustic impulses.|$|E

50|$|Early reports, {{published}} in the late 19th century, describe patients with acute onset of deafness after experiencing symptoms described as apoplexy. The only means of definitive diagnosis in these reports were postmortem dissections. Subsequent cases throughout the 20th century reflect advancements in diagnoses of both hearing loss and stroke. With the advent of audiometric and electrophysiologic studies, investigators could diagnose <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> with increasing precision. Advances in imaging techniques, such as MRI, greatly improved the diagnosis and localization of cerebral infarcts that coincide with primary or secondary auditory centers.

Audiologic and related test results in concurrence with MRI confirmed bilateral absence of considerable portions of her temporal lobes resulting in <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> Although physiologic measures demonstrate normal peripheral hearing sensitivity, this patient's speech has the inflection and prosodic characteristics associated with profound peripheral hearing loss, and she is unable to understand spoken communication. Behaviorally obtained pure-tone thresholds were variable, ranging from normal to moderate hearing loss with normal middle ear muscle reflexes and normal ABRs to high- and low-intensity stimuli. Auditory middle latency and cortical evoked potentials were grossly abnormal, consistent with the central nature of <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> Because of her inability to communicate auditorily, this patient was ultimately taught American Sign Language and educated at the Louisiana School for the Deaf.

Phonagnosia is an auditory agnosia, an acquired auditory processing disorder resulting from brain damage, other auditory agnosias include <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> and auditory verbal agnosia also known as pure word deafness.|$|E
50|$|Cochlear or {{auditory}} brainstem implantation {{could also}} be treatment options. Electrical stimulation of the peripheral auditory system may result in improved sound perception or cortical remapping in patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> However, hearing aids are an inappropriate answer for cases like these. Any auditory signal, regardless if has been amplified to normal or high intensities, is useless to a system unable to complete its processing. Ideally, patients should be directed toward resources to aid them in lip-reading, learning American Sign Language, as well as speech and occupational therapy. Patients should follow-up regularly to evaluate for any long-term recovery.|$|E
5000|$|A case {{published}} in 2001 describes the patient as 20-year-old man referred for cochlear implants because of bilateral deafness following a motorcycle accident two years earlier. His CT shows hemorrhagic lesions involving both internal capsules. He was comatose {{for several weeks}} and awoke quadriparetic, cognitively impaired and completely deaf. He exhibited a response towards the occasional sudden, loud sound, however, by turning his head. Reading and writing capabilities were maintained, {{and he was able}} to communicate by lip-reading. His own speech was dysarthric, but comprehensible. Normal tympanograms and stapedial reflexes imply that the middle and inner ear remained functioning and the auditory nerve was intact. His auditory nerve was tested by evoking responses with normal auditory nerve potentials at 10 dB bilaterally. The results of the BAER waves were normal, but an abnormal complex IV-V suggested that the pathways were functioning through the brainstem, but there was a lesion present in the mid-brain. With these findings, it was determined the patient had <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> due to bilateral interruption of the ascending auditory pathway associated with hemorrhagic lesions of both internal capsules.

40|$|Background: <b>Cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> {{is a rare}} symptom that is {{associated}} with bilateral lesions of the auditory cortex. To date, <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> has been reported in only three cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Case Description: This 55 -year-old female was admitted to our hospital with SAH caused by a ruptured left internal carotid artery (ICA) paraclinoid aneurysm. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed diffuse thick SAH with no other lesions such as an old infarction or hemorrhage. Emergent stent-assisted coil embolization was performed successfully and subsequent cisternal irrigation with urokinase almost completely washed out the thick SAH. During follow-up, she was alert and without any neurological deficits, however, she developed acute bilateral deafness on day 7 even though she had no history of hearing impairment. Because of the deafness, verbal communication was difficult. She became almost completely unable to hear and communication was confined to writing. Immediate diffusion-weighted (DW) image showed high intensities in bilateral superior temporal gyri due to severe vasospasm of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). Immediate angiography showed severe vasospasm especially right MCA. A microcatheter was advanced to the right M 1 and papaverine was administered. Soon after that, her hearing impairment dramatically improved. Our simple audiometry showed a hearing threshold average for both 1000 and 4000 Hz at 25 dB in both ears. She was discharged without any deficits in 2 weeks. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pure <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> due to bilateral vasospasm, which was immediately resolved by intraarterial administration of papaverine...|$|E

40|$|Auditory {{dysfunction}} is {{a common}} clinical symptom that can induce profound effects {{on the quality of}} life of those affected. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the most prevalent neurological disorder today, but it has generally been considered a rare cause of auditory dysfunction. However, a substantial proportion of patients with stroke might have auditory dysfunction that has been underestimated due to difficulties with evaluation. The present study reviews relationships between auditory dysfunction and types of CVD including cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrovascular malformation, moyamoya disease, and superficial siderosis. Recent advances in the etiology, anatomy, and strategies to diagnose and treat these conditions are described. The numbers of patients with CVD accompanied by auditory dysfunction will increase as the population ages. Cerebrovascular diseases often include the auditory system, resulting in various types of auditory dysfunctions, such as unilateral or bilateral deafness, <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness,</b> pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and auditory hallucinations, some of which are subtle and can only be detected by precise psychoacoustic and electrophysiological testing. The contribution of CVD to auditory dysfunction needs to be understood because CVD can be fatal if overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Conscious sensory {{perception}} and its modulation by volition are integral to human mental life. Functional neuroimaging techniques provide a direct means of identifying and characterizing in vivo the systems-level patterns of brain activity {{associated with such}} mental functions. In a series of positron emission tomography activation experiments, we and our colleagues have examined a range of normal and abnormal auditory states that, when contrasted, provide dissociations relevant {{to the question of}} the neural substrates of sensory awareness. These dissociations include sensory awareness in the presence and absence of external sensory stimuli, the transition from sensory unawareness to awareness (or vice versa) in the presence of sensory stimuli, and sensory awareness with and without volition. The auditory states studied include hallucinations, mental imagery, <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> modulated by attention, and hearing modulated by sedation. The results of these studies highlight the distributed nature of the functional neuroanatomy that is sufficient, if not necessary, for sensory awareness. The probable roles of unimodal association (as compared with primary) cortices, heteromodal cortices, limbic/paralimbic regions and subcortical structures (such as the thalamus) are discussed. In addition, interactions between pre- and post-rolandic regions are examined in the context of top-down, volitional modulation of sensory awareness...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{original}} description {{the diagnosis of}} word deafness has been greatly expanded. Confusion has arisen {{with regard to the}} usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term "word deafness" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits. Impairment of musical abilities parallels the severity of the auditory disorder...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a rare case of central auditory dysfunction induced by cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 55 -year-old {{woman who was}} admitted after aneurysmal SAH developed cerebral vasospasm on Day 3 affecting mainly the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and partly the left MCA. The vasospasm became refractory to conventional therapy and was ultimately improved by intraarterial infusion of nimodipine in the right MCA and angioplasty. Severe auditory dysfunction was apparent from Day 10 as the patient was not reactive to speech or environmental sounds. Brain MRI on Day 17 demonstrated infarcted areas mainly in the right hippocampus, medial occipital lobe, and thalamus. The patient underwent further examination using audiometry, speech testing, auditory evoked potentials, functional MRI, and cerebral PET. The initial diagnosis was extended nonverbal agnosia and total pure word deafness. The central auditory dysfunction improved over 6 months, with persisting hyperacusis, tinnitus, and amusia. Central auditory dysfunction is a rare complication after SAH. While <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> {{may be associated with}} bilateral lesions of the temporal cortex, partly reversible central auditory dysfunction was observed in this patient after prominently unilateral right temporal lesions. The role of the interthalamic connections can be discussed, as well as the possibility that a less severe vasospasm on the left MCA could have transiently impaired the left thalamocortical auditory pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of blindsight {{has been largely}} studied and refers to residual abilities of blind patients without an acknowledged visual awareness. Similarly, "deaf hearing" might represent a further example of dissociation between detection and perception of sounds. Here we report the rare case of a patient with a persistent and complete <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness</b> caused by damage to the bilateral temporo-parietal lobes who occasionally showed unexpected reactions to environmental sounds despite she denied hearing. We applied {{for the first time}} electrophysiological techniques to better understand auditory processing and perceptual awareness of the patient. While auditory brainstem responses were within normal limits, no middle- and long-latency waveforms could be identified. However, event-related potentials showed conflicting results. While the Mismatch Negativity could not be evoked, robust P 3 -like waveforms were surprisingly found in the latency range of 600 - 700 ms. The generation of P 3 -like potentials, despite extensive destruction of the auditory cortex, might imply the integrity of independent circuits necessary to process auditory stimuli {{even in the absence of}} consciousness of sound. Our results support the reverse hierarchy theory that asserts that the higher levels of the hierarchy are immediately available for perception, while low-level information requires more specific conditions. The accurate characterization in terms of anatomy and neurophysiology of the auditory lesions might facilitate understanding of the neural substrates involved in deaf-hearing...|$|E
40|$|A {{person with}} aphasia, DRG, showed a severe phonological/neologistic jargon when reading aloud {{but in a}} lesser degree in naming and {{spontaneous}} speech. Reading digits was free of phonological errors. 	Case report: DRG, 58 y. o.; education = 8 years. Vascular lesion: left occipito-temporal and right temporo-parietal (CT). No auditory cortical ERP were found. 	Neuropsychological examination: DRG showed the typical pattern of <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> He could not perceive any verbal and non-verbal sound. He did not blink to very loud sounds. His spontaneous speech was relatively understandable, fluent and loud, with phonemic paraphasias and a few neologisms. He had no problems in visual recognition and written calculation showed only occasional errors in complex operations. His reading comprehension was preserved while reading aloud was severely neologistic (Table 1). 	Experimental investigation: DRG's naming and reading aloud of words were compared at an interval of nine months. The amount of correct items and of non target-recognizable neologisms is reported in Table 1. A worse performance in reading aloud was consistent over time and tasks. 	Reading aloud of numbers, up to six digits long, presented in the Arabic code (e. g., " 9 ", " 267 ") and in the alphabetic code (e. g., "nine", "two hundred sixty seven"), resulted in a different performance. Reading aloud of alphabetically presented words was successful in only 28 / 110 items (25 %), with neologisms being the most frequent error type. Reading Arabic numbers was successful in 25 / 55 items (45 %); no phonological/neologistic error was produced, errors being of the "lexical" type, thus numbers were substituted by other phonologically correct numbers. 	Discussion: DRG showed a previously unreported dissociation in speech output: naming and connected spontaneous speech were less affected by phonological disturbances than reading aloud. The opposite dissociation, reading aloud superior to naming, was described by Semenza et al. (1992), also {{in a case of}} <b>cortical</b> <b>deafness.</b> These authors explained their case suggesting a difficulty in activating the speech output lexicon from the semantic system and by a disturbed print to sound conversion (sublexical route). Reading aloud could be performed either via the direct, lexical, non semantic, route or by summation of residual capacities of disturbed access to speech output lexicon from the semantic system and disturbed print to sound conversion. In contrast, DRG would be disturbed in the direct lexical route and in print to sound conversion: lexical activation of the speech output lexicon from the semantic system would not be sufficient to read correctly aloud without the help of the other two routes. Lack of phonological errors in reading Arabic numbers would be {{explained by the fact that}} Arabic numbers, consistently with recent literature (Bencini et al., 2011; Semenza et al., 2014; Dotan and Friedmann, 2015), would directly activate the whole phonological form rather than needing grapheme to phoneme conversion. This case provides insights about the processing dynamics among the three reading routes...|$|E
