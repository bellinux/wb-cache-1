The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination.

2500|$|The deal faced {{criticism}} {{for the possibility}} that it would result in a higher <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Due to the market positioning of MTS as a fourth major wireless carrier in the region, the three major national carriers have historically offered lower prices in Manitoba to remain competitive. As such, with the removal of a competitor, there would no longer be an incentive to do so. A similar business climate exists in Saskatchewan, where the three national carriers must compete against the dominant, government-owned regional carrier SaskTel. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 61% of those surveyed moderately or strongly disapproved of the deal.|$|E
2500|$|Wasteful {{contract}} spending {{also became}} {{a problem in the}} second Barry administration. In his first term Barry had made a point of insisting that any firm wishing to do business with the city have minority partners, and shepherding legislation requiring 35% of all contracts to go to minority-owned firms. The policy was modified in his second term such that the administration gave contracts to Barry's political connections and high-end campaign contributors to the tune of $856 million. The city did not exercise sufficient oversight. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> such as heating oil for the public schools inflated 40 percent, without any guarantee that the goods and services were being provided. City councilman John A. Wilson commented that [...] "What started out to benefit the minority community at large has meant some politically influential blacks can move out to posh suburbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Marshall {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issue first. The majority agreed with Commonwealth Edison's claim that, {{even though a}} tax is imposed before the goods become interstate commerce, {{this does not mean}} the tax evades constitutional analysis. Rejecting the reasoning in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U.S. 245 (1922), the majority [...] "disapproved" [...] of any distinction between intrastate and interstate commerce {{based on the idea that}} the Commerce Clause denies states the right to burden interstate commerce, and concluded that state severance taxes came under the jurisdiction of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. The respondents argued that the appropriate test for evaluating a tax under the Commerce Clause should be the four-prong test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), and that the Montana tax violated the third prong of the Complete Auto Transit test by discriminating against out-of-state consumers of Montana's coal. But the majority concluded no discrimination existed, because the tax burden was borne equally by all out-of-state consumers. The appellants also argued the tax violated the fourth prong of the test because it was not [...] "fairly related to the services provided by the State" [...] (e.g., the amount of the tax collected exceeds the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provided). But the majority disagreed: Commonwealth Edison had fundamentally misconstrued the Court's test in Complete Auto. The Montana Supreme Court had characterized the severance tax as intended for general government purposes, a finding the U.S. Supreme Court refused to dispute. Thus, there could be no [...] "excessiveness" [...] test. Nor was there any question that the state of Montana had the right to levy the tax for the purposes it did. Justice Marshall next identified how the fourth prong of the Complete Auto test should be interpreted: ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, several organisations provide {{services}} on the Internet with similar functionality but different price and pricing schemes. Since these services {{are used in}} service compositions, the providers <b>of</b> composed <b>services</b> {{have to face the}} challenge <b>of</b> managing the <b>services</b> they use, in order to decrease the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> compositions without compromising their quality. Several techniques to compute the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions are currently available, but none of them take into account all classes <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> behaviour. This paper proposes an approach to service composition that consists of algorithms and an architecture to support the <b>cost</b> management <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions by considering several classes <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> behaviour. We developed a prototype in order to evaluate our approach with experiments that show that it properly supports <b>cost</b> management <b>of</b> <b>service</b> compositions throughout the service composition life-cycle.
