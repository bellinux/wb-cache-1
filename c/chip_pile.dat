The bases for the experiment were nine experimental <b>chips</b> <b>piles</b> produced from wood species: European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European aspen (Populus tremula) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). From each tree species for producing of chips fresh biomass was used, biomass stored in half-shade and in opened area. The greatest number of fungi was found in piles 3 - spruce wood chips produced from biomass stored on the meadow, 7 – chips from aspen stored in half-shade and 8 - beech wood chips produced from biomass stored in half-shade. The most represented species were Aspergillus niger and Mucor spinosus. These two species were recorded in seven of nine piles.

60|$|When {{the spring}} sun melted {{the snow in}} the woods the big pile remained, {{settling}} slowly as the days warmed.

In nature, thermophilic fungi are typically found in compost, wood <b>chip</b> <b>piles,</b> stored grains, animal dung and other environments that are self-heating due to degradation of plant materials (Johri et al. 1999). Although such material often contains high concentrations of cellulose some thermophilic fungi are poor cellulose-degraders and seem to utilize sugars released by cellulolytic species in the biotope (Maheshwari et al. 2000).

40|$|The {{research}} undertaken met {{the expectations}} of the author by demonstrating that use of tracked machines increased the damage of wood chip quality distribution specification. It was clearly evident through field trials with both the Wagner CHD 24 S and the CAT D 8 R that the rubber wheeled machine (Wagner) has less impact on wood chip damage than a tracked dozer. The key findings are as follows: The average difference between a wheel dozer and tracked machine was a 1. 75 % increase in defects using a tracked machine There is less than a 1 % chance of being no difference between wheeled and tracked machines. The data concluded that it was therefore highly likely to be some machine damage from tracked machines The over thick wood chips decreased with the wheeled machine, this is an unexpected outcome, but shows the effect of rubber wheels on large chip that breaks the chip and increasing the "accepts" Compaction versus "fluffing" were very notable during the field trials, one would suspect that more compaction would improve not only the storage utilization of a wood <b>chip</b> <b>pile</b> but also easy chip management when pushing and carrying with machine Formation of a commercial view, per actual cost benefit of rubber wheeled versus tracked machine, has not been achieved. The reason is that the author {{has not been able to}} obtain accurate information on the cost or impact of wood chip quality on the pulping process. Pins and fines are either used for fuel or taken off site, or in the Kraft pulp production process, they will increase the amount of chemicals used to compensate. There is scope to advance this current research to expand it over an entire wood <b>chip</b> <b>pile</b> as the expectation is that the damage by tracked dozers is actually understated. This statement is made based on the visual observations of the field trials conducted within this research paper.

40|$|U. S. A. Biopulping, {{defined as}} the {{treatment}} of ligoncellulosic materials with lignin-degrading fungi prior to pulping, is an environmentally friendly process that can increase mill throughput by 30 %. The process reduces the electrical energy requirement by at least 30 %. and also improves paper strength properties during mechanical pulping. Over a period of ten years, we established the economic feasibility of biopulping at a pilot scale after meeting both biological and engineering challenges. We identified a fungus, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora that performs biopulping very effectively on different types of wood and reduced its amount of inoculum to a Commercially attractive range. We also established that a brief atmospheric steaming decontaminates the wood chip surfaces, and allows the fungus to perform biopulping. Methods for decontaminating wood chip surfaces, cooling the chips after steaming, and inoculating them with the fungus on a continuous basis were developed. Methods were developed to maintain the optimum growth temperature and moisture in the <b>chip</b> <b>pile</b> so that the fungus could perform biopulping effectively and uniformly.

40|$|Biopulping, as {{developed}} at Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), involves treating wood chips {{from a common}} pulpwood species with a white-rot fungus prior to pulping.

Fifty-ton <b>chip</b> <b>pile</b> trials have shown biopulping to be commercially feasible. Current technology is based on using specialized equipment to steam chips for surface sterilization, inoculating with a lignin-degrading (white-rot) fungus, and aerating the chips during a two-week incubation prior to pulping.

The results show that emissions into air increases when the temperature directly above the pile increases. The temperature above the pile decrease with the ambient temperature, up until September for the forest residue and October for the bark and root reducing wood chips, when the temperature above the pile suddenly increases. This could be due to the ambient temperature, the storage time or microbial activity.

40|$|Biopulping fundamentals, {{technology}} and mechanisms are reviewed in this article. Mill evaluation of Eucalyptus grandis wood chips biotreated by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora on a 50 -tonne pilot-plant demonstrated that equivalent energy savings {{can be obtained}} in lab- and mill-scale biopulping. Some drawbacks concerning limited improvements in pulp strength and contamination of the <b>chip</b> <b>pile</b> with opportunist fungi have been observed. The use of pre-cultured wood chips as inoculum seed for the biotreatment process minimized contamination problems related {{to the use of}} blended mycelium and corn-steep liquor in the inoculation step. Alkaline wash restored part of the brightness in biopulps and marketable brightness values were obtained by one-stage bleaching with 5 % H 2 O 2 when bio-TMP pulps were under evaluation. Considering the current scenario, the understanding of biopulping mechanisms has gained renewed attention because more resistant and competitive fungal species could be selected with basis on a function-directed screening project. A series of studies aimed to elucidate structural changes in lignin during wood biodegradation by C. subvermispora had indicated that lignin depolymerization occurs during initial stages of wood biotreatment. Aromatic hydroxyls did not increase with the split of aryl-ether linkages, suggesting that the ether-cleavage-products remain as quitione-type structures. On the other hand, cellulose is more resistant to the attack by C subvermispora. MnP-initiated lipid peroxidation reactions have been proposed to explain degradation of non-phenolic lignin substructures by C subvermispora, while the lack of cellobiohydrolases and the occurrence of systems able to suppress Fenton`s reaction in the cultures have explained non-efficient cellulose degradation by this biopulping fungus.

40|$|An {{integral}} part of proper wood chip inventory management {{is the ability to}} accurately monitor wood chip quantities. This thesis examines the use of a new method of capturing the volume of mill yard wood chip piles through the utilization of aerial drones. The drones are used to capture images and the images are converted into digital 3 D models, which are then capable of measuring pile volume. This process allows for conversion of the volume into an accurate mass estimate by compensating for compression factors within the <b>chip</b> <b>pile.</b> These factors can change the volume by a maximum of 9. 46 %, but on average during simulations and real world applications, most piles exhibit a change in volume in the range of 1 % to 6 % difference. By performing the estimation procedure multiple times and averaging the results this method is able to generate a result that is more precise, timely and less labour intensive than the previous methods of using a ground survey to determine volume and applying a linear volume to mass conversion for the quantity of wood chips. The results suggest that this averaging technique can improve the standard deviation spread from over 5 % variation in the measurement to less than 2 %. This new method combines multiple techniques to improve both overall accuracy and precision. Each stage of the new method was examined to determine the accumulated degree of error. This included looking at operator error of about 2. 4 %, considering the precision of 3 D volume capture, which adds on average of 5 % to 10 % error, understanding the variation in bulk density due to pile shape, and size, which adds 1 % to 6 % error, using different 3 D software modeling for measuring pile volume, which adds about 4 % error. Combined together in extreme cases, these errors can skew the results by over 20 %. The results of this examination provides research-based recommendations as to how to collect the images, generate the models, and process the data for mass estimation and improve error reduction at all stages...|$|E

Research-led development over a sustained period since 2002 included substantial public and community consultation. Taking its formal inspiration from three fat <b>chips</b> <b>piled</b> on top of one another, the building is clad in a composite wall faced with a cladding covered in newspaper print with text that echoes the industrial heritage of the Ancoats area. The project defines a quality of living by combining high design values with technological innovation while embracing sustainability, integration into the urban landscape and the provision of inspirational and sensational spaces. The building's apartment types range from studio to three-bedroom, each of which is planned internally around a central 'pod' unit, housing the bathroom and kitchen areas. This approach means that the apartments can be open plan or sub-divided by the use of large folding screens. Combined with differing external balconies, these design features serve to differentiate and afford the personalisation of domestic spaces, valued by the building’s inhabitants. In addition to offering an innovative, contemporary design solution, CHIPS achieved a BREEAM Eco-Homes 'Excellent' rating, and conforms to the Manchester Methodist Housing Trust scheme's stringent development standards. It also meets the Sustainability guidelines as set out by the UK Homes and Communities agency as part of the Millennium Community Programme.
