500|$|While on the {{run from}} the law, Kate goes to Miami, where under the name [...] "Monica" [...] she meets and gets engaged to a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion). Before their wedding, Kevin's mother, Suzanne, gives Kate a gold locket that had been passed down on the female side of the family at weddings. A while after the ceremony, Kate <b>calls</b> <b>U.S.</b> Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane). She does not want to run any more and pleads for him to stop chasing her. Mars guesses that Kate has gotten {{involved}} with a man, and tells her that if Kate can really stay put, settle down, he will stop chasing her, but that they both know it is unlikely that Kate will ever stop running. Later, Kate shows signs of relief after getting a negative pregnancy test, and decides to reveal the truth about her life to her husband. She drugs Kevin, places her mother-in-law's locket in his hands and leaves.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor <b>calls</b> <b>us</b> rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E

[...] While {{in an interview with}} Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said [...] "You know, I really hate that term.

2500|$|Philosopher and {{ecologist}} David Abram articulates and elaborates {{a form of}} hylozoism {{grounded in}} the phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books Becoming Animal and The Spell of the Sensuous, Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively [...] "solicit our attention" [...] or [...] "call our focus," [...] coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science {{as well as the}} perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it <b>calls</b> <b>us</b> back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, [...] enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.|$|E

2500|$|Peloquin wrote {{more than}} 150 scores. Most {{of his music}} is written for SATB choir and soloists {{as well as for}} women's voices (SSA), men's voices (3 parts) and {{involves}} a combination of piano, organ and orchestra. Peloquin also made a point of composing melodies with simple refrains to encourage participation of the congregation. [...] "A lot of religious music today is boring," [...] he once said, [...] "and I don't think worship <b>calls</b> <b>us</b> to boredom." [...] His music combines traditional music written for the church with elements of Gregorian chant, jazz-like rhythms and harmonies reminiscent of George Gershwin, Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein. Alex was also interested in incorporating syncopated rhythms into several of his compositions. An example of this can be found in his Lord of Life Mass commissioned by Terence Cardinal Cooke Archbishop of New York in 1980. Titled [...] "People Matter" [...] the composition is an arrangement based on a hymn by Dutch composer Fred Kaan (1929–2009). It is intended to be performed during Offertory and it begins with the syncopated rhythms of percussion and double bass where after two measures the altos are joined by trumpet [...] "con sordino".|$|E

'Wherefore we must depart from iniquity that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorify him for his call.' (1 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:1) He has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to the {{fellowship}} of his Son Jesus Christ; that is, to partake of all that good that is in him, as Mediator, and {{to be done by}} him for those that trust in him. Nor had we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condition, to Christ, for life and blessedness, but by the call of the Father; 'For it is not of works, but of him that calleth.' (Rom. 9:11) Now since he has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to this privilege--even us whom he has called--and left others in their sins to perish by his judgments, it is meet we should depart from iniquity.
