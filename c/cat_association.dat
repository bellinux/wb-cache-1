The GCCF, meanwhile, has banned the registration of all Burmese imported from America in order to preserve the [...] "traditional" [...] bloodlines. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognize these dual standards as representing separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese.
