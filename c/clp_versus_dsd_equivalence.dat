40|$|Mixed model {{production}} lines consider {{more than one}} model being processed on the same production line in an arbitrary sequence. Nevertheless, the majority of publications {{in this area are}} limited to solutions which determine the job sequence before the jobs enter the line and maintains it without interchanging jobs {{until the end of the}} production line, which is known as permutation flowshop. This paper considers a non-permutation flowshop. Resequencing is permitted where stations have access to intermediate or centralized resequencing buffers. The access to the buffers is restricted by the number of available buffer places and the physical size of the products. Two conceptually different approaches are presented in order to solve the problem. The fi rst approach is a hybrid approach, using Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), whereas the second one is a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Improvements that come with the introduction of constrained resequencing buffers are highlighted. Characteristics such as the difference between the intermediate and the centralized case are analyzed, and the special case of semi dynamic demand is studied. Finally, recommendations are presented for the applicability of the hybrid approach, using <b>CLP,</b> <b>versus</b> the Genetic Algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} caries prevalence in non-syndromic {{patients with}} cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) {{in comparison with}} a matched non-CLP population. Methods: A literature search was conducted {{in order to identify}} articles reporting on the prevalence of caries in <b>CLP</b> <b>versus</b> non-CLP individuals. The related citations function in PubMed and reference lists of retrieved articles were used to expand the search. Only studies with a suitable matched control group were included. From each included study, study and sample characteristics were extracted, as were results. The main outcome was the score given for caries prevalence in each study, using a well-defined index. The data were entered into meta-analysis software and a meta-analysis performed using the random-effects model. Results: From the 592 articles initially identified, 7 were chosen according to preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. All of the studies were cross-sectional in nature, and used the decayed, missing, and filled (DMF/dmf) indices as the final outcomes. The included studies involved a total of 474 CLP patients aged 1. 5 - 29 years. When looking at permanent teeth, data from 5 studies suggest that CLP patients have a higher number of DMF teeth than the controls (mean difference 1. 38; p = 0. 003). For deciduous teeth, data from 4 studies suggest that CLP patients have a higher number of dmf teeth than the controls (mean difference 1. 51; p = 0. 03). Conclusion: Non-syndromic patients with CLP tend to have higher caries prevalence, both in the permanent and the deciduous dentition, in comparison with matched non-CLP controls...|$|R

For this purpose, psychosocial screening instruments can be a valuable addition to routine clinical practice. Aims: To determine differences on a psychosocial screener concerning distress and everyday problems in parents of young adolescents (YAs) with <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> control parents and in mothers of YAs with <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> fathers. Methods and procedures: We compared outcomes of the Distress Thermometer for Parents in 76 mothers and 44 fathers of 11 - 13 -year-olds with <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> 64 mothers and 52 fathers of age matched children without DS (comparing mothers and fathers separately). Additionally, we compared mothers and fathers within 34 parent couples of YAs with DS. Outcomes and results: Clinical distress was not more frequent than in control parents. Mothers further did not report more everyday problems and only differed from their controls on one problem domain and some problem items. Fathers, however, reported more problems than their controls across most domains and wished to talk to a professional about their situation more frequently. Outcomes in mothers and fathers within parent couples did not differ significantly. Conclusions and implications: This is one of few studies to report on the use of psychosocial screening instruments in {{parents of children with}} DS. Our results suggested that attention for fathers of YAs with DS is required.

Natural T regulatory cells (nT reg) {{have been considered}} to be primary {{in the role of}} controlling the intensity and targets of the immune response. We have investigated the phenotypical and functional alteration of nT reg in a group of DS people. The phenotypical characteristic of T reg cells of 29 DS was analysed and compared with an age-matched healthy control group. The inhibitory potential of CD 4 +CD 25 highCD 127 low T regulatory cells was evaluated on autologous CD 4 +CD 25 - T cell proliferation in response to activation with a mytogenic pan-stimulus (anti-CD 2, anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 antibodies). The CD 4 +CD 25 high cells in the DS and control groups were 2 · 692 ± 0 · 3808 %, n= 29 and 1 · 246 ± 0 · 119, n= 29 %, respectively (P= 0. 0007), with a percentage of forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP 3) -expressing cells of 79 · 21 ± 3 · 376 %, n= 29 and 59 · 75 ± 4 · 496 %, respectively (P= 0. 0015). CD 4 +CD 25 +FoxP 3 + cells were increased in peripheral blood from DS subjects (DS mean 5 · 231 ± 0 · 6065 % n= 29, control mean 3 · 076 ± 0 · 3140 % n= 29). The majority of CD 4 +CD 25 high were CD 127 low and expressed a high percentage of FoxP 3 (natural T reg phenotype). While the proliferative capacity of DS T cells was not altered significantly compared to normal individuals, a reduced inhibitory potential of T reg compared to healthy controls was clearly observed (mean healthy control inhibition in T eff:T reg 1 : 1 co-culture: 58 · 9 %± 4 · 157 %, n= 10 <b>versus</b> mean <b>DS</b> inhibition in T eff:T reg 1 : 1 co-culture: 39 · 8 ± 4 · 788 %, n= 10, P= 0. 0075; mean healthy control inhibition in T eff:T reg 1 : 0 · 5 co-culture: 45 · 10 ± 5 · 858 %, n= 10 <b>versus</b> <b>DS</b> inhibition in T eff:T reg 1 : 0 · 5 co-culture: 24 · 10 ± 5 · 517 %, n= 10, P= 0. 0177).

40|$|The {{properties}} of films of carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC, of different degree of substitution, DS, {{have been examined}} {{by the use of}} perichromic indicators (probes). The film properties that have been determined are: empirical polarity, E-T(33); "acidity", alpha; "basicity", beta; and dipolarity/polarizability, pi*. This has been achieved by employing the following perichromic probes: 4 -nitroaniline, 4 -nitroanisole, 4 -nitro-N,N-dimethylaniline, and 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -(2, 4, 6 -triphenyl-pyridinium- 1 -yl) phenolate, WB. The correlations between both E-T(33) - or pi* and DS were found to be linear; that between beta and DS is a second order polynomial; no obvious correlation was found between alpha and DS. The polarities of CMC films are in the range of those of butyl alcohols. As models for CMC, we have employed cellulose plus CMC of high DS; oxidized cellulose with degree of oxidation = 0. 5; sodium glucuronate. The former model behaved akin to CMC, but the plots of the perichromic properties <b>versus</b> <b>DS</b> showed different slopes/intercepts. FTIR data and molecular dynamics simulations on the solvation of WB have shown that this difference can be traced to more efficient hydrogen bonding between the film of the model and the probe. This affects the intra-molecular charge-transfer energy of the latter, leading to different responses to the variation of DS. Based on the excellent linear correlation between E-T(33) and DS, for CMC from different origins, we suggest that perichromism is a simple, accurate, and expedient alternative for the determination of DS of the biopolymer derivative.

40|$|Introduction Sepsis {{originates}} from an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Despite intensive research, sepsis {{remains a}} major cause of death in ICUs. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are mandatory. Taking into account that during sepsis progression cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are activated in an autoimmune fashion contributing to multiorgan damage, it remains unclear whether CTL are activated towards alloantigenic cells as well. This is especially important for patients receiving an immune suppressive therapy to permit organ transplantation and thus known to be at high risk for developing sepsis. Therefore, we analyzed whether sepsis activates CTL towards alloantigenic target cells and whether this can be inhibited by PPARγ activation, known to block T-helper cell responses. Methods To characterize whether sepsis activates CTL and whether this can be inhibited by PPARγ activation, we used an ex vivo cytotoxicity assay to analyze CD 8 + T-cell-dependent cytotoxicity. Responder CD 8 + T cells were isolated from C 57 Bl/ 6 N PPARγ wildtype (PPARγfl/fl) and T-cell specific knockout (Tc-PPARγ-/-) mice (haplotype H 2 Kb) following cecal ligation and puncture (<b>CLP)</b> <b>versus</b> sham treatment. P 815 mastocytoma cells, a cell line originally derived from DBA/ 2 mice (haplotype H 2 Kd), were used as alloantigenic target cells. Pharmacological inhibition and/or activation of PPARγ in vivo and ex vivo was performed to clarify the impact of PPARγ in blocking CTL-dependent cytotoxicity. In vivo, PPARγ activity in wildtype mice was pharmacologically inhibited by the irreversible antagonist GW 9662 or induced by the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone. Systemic application of both compounds was performed intraperitoneally. A classic splenocyte-driven stimulation protocol to activate CTL was carried out as control. Results CTL isolated from septic mice showed enhanced cytotoxicity towards alloantigenic P 815 target cells. Enhanced cytotoxicity was effectively reduced by both PPARγ activation in vivo and ex vivo. In line, in CTL isolated from T-cell-specific PPARγ knockout (Tc-PPARγ-/-) mice PPARγ activation was ineffective, strengthening a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. At the molecular level in vivo and ex vivo activation of PPARγ reduced Fas and granzyme B expression in activated CTL, which might explain reduced cytotoxicity. Conclusion Our study therefore suggests PPARγ activation in vivo to attenuate CTL-dependent alloantigenic cytotoxicity to possibly inhibit acute organ rejection...|$|R

40|$|Although studies {{blocking}} the Fas pathway indicate it can decrease organ damage while improving septic (cecal ligation and puncture, CLP) mouse survival, {{little is known}} about how Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interactions mediate this protection at the tissue level. Here, we report that although Fas expression on splenocytes and hepatocytes is up-regulated by CLP and is inhibited by in vivo short interfering RNA, FasL as well as the frequency of CD 8 + T cells are differentially altered by sepsis in the spleen (no change in FasL, decreased percentage of CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells) versus the liver (increased FasL expression on CD 8 + T cells and increase in percentage/number). Adoptive transfer of <b>CLP</b> FasL+/+ <b>versus</b> FasL−/− mouse liver CD 8 + T cells to severe combined immunodeficient or RAG 1 −/− recipient mice indicated that these cells could induce inflammation. The FasL-mediated cytotoxic capacity of these septic mouse liver CD 8 + T cells was shown by their ability to damage directly cultured hepatocytes. Finally, although CD 8 −/− mice exhibited a reduction in both CLP-induced liver active caspase- 3 staining and blood interleukin- 6 levels, only FasL−/− (but not CD 8 −/−) protected the septic mouse spleen from increasing apoptosis. Thus, although truncating Fas-FasL signaling ameliorates many untoward effects of sepsis, the pathological mode of action is distinct at the tissue level...|$|R

We report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of laparoscopic re-SG <b>versus</b> <b>DS</b> in patients presenting with insufficient weight loss or weight regain after ISG. Methods From November 2003 to December 2009, 7 and 19 patients underwent laparoscopic re-SG and DS, respectively, mainly because of the patients' dietary habits: volume eating (hyperphagia) was treated by re-SG and eating meals too frequently (polyphagia) by DS. Results At ISG, the mean weight and BMI was 127. 7 ± 31. 4 kg, and 45. 1 ± 11. 8 kg/m 2 for the re-SG group and 119. 8 ± 20. 9 kg and 41. 2 ± 5. 5 kg/m 2 for the DS group, respectively. The mean interval between ISG and reoperation was 37. 1 ± 20. 3 months for the re-SG group and 29. 8 ± 24. 9 months for the DS group. At reoperation, the mean weight, BMI, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 109. 7 ± 21 kg, 38. 9 ± 8. 7 kg/m 2, 24. 3 ± 16. 6 % for the re-SG group and 107. 6 ± 19. 6 kg, 36. 9 ± 4. 2 kg/m 2, and 19. 5 ± 19. 9 % for the DS group, respectively. The mean operative time was 137. 5 ± 75. 5 minutes for the re-SG group and 152. 6 ± 54. 3 minutes for the DS group. No conversion to open surgery was required, and no mortality occurred. One patient in the re-SG group developed a leak at the angle of His. In the DS group, 1 patient presented with bleeding, 1 patient with a duodenoileostomy leak, and 1 patient with a duodenoileostomy stenosis. The mean hospital stay was 11. 5 ± 20. 5 days for the re-SG group and 4. 7 ± 2. 7 days for the DS group. The mean follow-up was 23. 2 ± 11. 1 months for the re-SG group and 24. 9 ± 20. 1 months for the DS group. The mean weight, BMI, and %EWL was 100 ± 21. 1 kg, 35. 3 ± 8. 3 kg/m 2, 43. 7 ± 24. 9 % for the re-SG group and 80. 7 ± 22. 5 kg, 27. 3 ± 5. 2 kg/m 2, 73. 7 ± 27. 7 % for the DS group, respectively. During follow-up, 3 patients in the DS group required corrective surgery for late complications. Conclusion The {{results of the present study}} have shown that laparoscopic re-SG is feasible but carries the risk of fistula development, which is difficult to treat. Laparoscopic DS was also shown to be feasible at a cost of not negligible complications, which are easier to manage than with re-SG.

Around 50 % of spontaneous abortions until 15 weeks of gestational age are chromosomally aneuploid, with trisomies accounting for 50 % of the abnormal abortions. Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosome abnormality in liveborns and is usually the result of nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in meiosis in either oogenesis or spermatogenesis. To investigate the relationship between folate metabolism and Down syndrome (DS) in a Danish population, we analyzed the common 677 C>T genetic polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene.

To address this question, {{we developed a}} novel cocaine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement paradigm that exposed the same rats to distinct cocaine-associated CR and DS. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in separate sessions. In one, a DS signaled cocaine availability; in the other, cocaine delivery was paired with a different CR. After extinction training and reinstatement testing, where both cues were presented in separate sessions, rats were sacrificed and processed for cellular analysis of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (CatFISH) for activity regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA and for radioactive in situ hybridization for Arc and zif 268 mRNAs. CatFISH did not reveal significant changes in Arc mRNA expression. Similar results were obtained with radioactive in situ hybridization. We have shown that while rats reinstate drug seeking in response to temporally discrete presentations of distinct drug-associated cues, such reinstatement is not associated with increased transcriptional activation of Arc or zif 268 mRNAs, suggesting that expression of these genes may not be necessary for cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior...|$|R

We used Dahl rats that are sensitive (DS) or resistant (DR) to the hypertensinogenic effect of salt to examine changes in renal size and composition caused by a high salt diet. Renal index, deoxyribonudeic add (DNA), protein, water content, protein/DNA ratio, and cell number and size were measured in age-matched DR and DS on a high salt diet for 7, 14, or 28 days. The results were compared with those obtained from respective rats on a low salt diet. High salt diet elevated renal index and protein hi DR and DS rats at each time point. After 7 days of a high salt diet, DNA increased in DS only. Protein/DNA ratio was progressively decreased by a high salt diet in DS and remained unchanged in DR rats. Cell number was increased 35 % in <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> only 13 % in DR rats at 4 weeks. Cell size decreased 24 % in DS and only 11 % in DR rats.

Growing studies demonstrated that increased oxidative damage, accumulation of unfolded/damaged protein aggregates and dysfunction of intracellular degradative system are key players in neurodegenerative processes. In this study, redox proteomics approach was used to analyze the frontal cortex from DS subjects under the age of 40 compared with age-matched controls, and proteins found to be increasingly carbonylated were identified. Interestingly, our results showed that oxidative damage targets specifically different components of the intracellular quality control system such as GRP 78, UCH-L 1, V 0 -ATPase, cathepsin D and GFAP that couples with decreased activity of the proteasome and autophagosome formation observed. We also reported a slight but consistent increase of Aβ 1 – 42 SDS- and PBS-soluble form and tau phosphorylation in <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> CTR. We suggest that disturbance in the proteostasis network could contribute to the accumulation of protein aggregates, such as amyloid deposits and NFTs, which occur very early in DS. It is likely that a sub-optimal functioning of degradative systems occur in DS neurons, which in turn provide the basis for further accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.

Participants were 32 4 th- and 33 6 th-graders who had received extensive instruction in the mastery of DS, but no instruction in SBA, for mentally solving multi-digit subtractions. All participants solved multi-digit subtractions up to 1000 in one choice condition (choice between DS or SBA on each item) and two no-choice conditions (obligatory use of either DS or SBA on all items). We distinguished between two types of subtractions, i. e., subtractions with a very small (e. g., 504 - 476 =__) versus very large difference (e. g., 616 - 28 =__) between the minuend and the subtrahend. Although mathematics instruction focused on the mastery of only DS, most 4 th- and 6 th-graders reported SBA to solve the items in the choice condition. In both grades, SBA use was more accurate and faster in the no-choice conditions than DS, particularly on small-difference problems. Furthermore, 4 th- and 6 th-graders flexibly fitted their strategy choices to both numerical item characteristics and individual strategy efficiency characteristics. These findings add to our theoretical understanding of children’s acquisition of explicitly taught versus self-invented mental computation strategies in view of developing adaptive expertise and challenge current mathematics instruction practices focusing heavily on DS. status: publishe...|$|R

We sought to confirm whether a delayed stenting (DS) approach (24 - 48 hours) improves myocardial reperfusion, versus immediate stenting, in patients with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In the prospective, randomized, open-label minimalist immediate mechanical intervention (MIMI) trial, patients (n= 140) with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction ≤ 12 hours were randomized to immediate stenting (n= 73) or DS (n= 67) after Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow restoration by thrombus aspiration. Patients in the DS group underwent a second coronary arteriography for stent implantation a median of 36 hours (interquartile range 29 - 46) after randomization. The primary end point was microvascular obstruction (% left ventricular mass) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed 5 days (interquartile range 4 - 6) after the first procedure. There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower microvascular obstruction in the immediate stenting group compared with DS group (1. 88 % versus 3. 96 %; P= 0. 051), which became significant after adjustment for the area at risk (P= 0. 049). Median infarct weight, left ventricular ejection fraction, and infarct size did not differ between groups. No difference in 6 -month outcomes was apparent for the rate of major cardiovascular and cerebral events. The present findings do not support a strategy of <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> immediate stenting in patients with ST-segment-elevation infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention and even suggested a deleterious effect of DS on microvascular obstruction size.

Ten participants (five men, five women) participated in four interventions [DS with WBV (DS+), DS without WBV (DS-), SS with WBV (SS+), SS without WBV (SS-) ] 48 h apart, in a randomized order. The interventions were preceded by a approximately 20 -min rest period, consisted of 10 mins with or without WBV (26 or 0 Hz) with SS (40 degrees of knee flexion) or DS (55 degrees of knee flexion, at a cadence of 50 bpm) where SS+ and DS- were metabolically matched. Muscle (T(m)), core (T(c)), skin temperature (T(sk)), HR and VO(2) were recorded during each intervention. For T(m), there was a time (P< 0. 01) and WBV (P< 0. 01) effect but no squat effect was evident, and there was time xWBV interaction effect (P< 0. 01). In all four interventions, the work load was too low to cause cardiovascular stress. Instead normal, moderate physiological effects of exercise on autonomic control were observed as indicated by HR; there were no significant increases in T(sk) or T(c). There appears to be no benefit in performing an unloaded, shallow DS+ at a tempo of 50 bpm as T(m,) HR, VO(2) are likely to be increased by the same amount and rate without WBV. However, combining SS with WBV could be advantageous to rapidly increasing soft tissue temperature prior to performing rehabilitation exercises when dynamic exercise cannot be performed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} repeat deep sclerectomy (<b>DS)</b> <b>versus</b> Baerveldt shunt (BS) implantation as second line surgery following failed primary DS. Methods: Fifty one patients were prospectively recruited to undergo BS implantation following failed DS and 51 patients underwent repeat DS, for which data was collected retrospectively. All eyes {{had at least one}} failed DS. Surgical success was defined as IOP≤ 21 mmHg and 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline. Success rates, number of glaucoma medications (GMs), IOP, and complication rates were compared between the two groups at year 1, post-operatively. Results: Mean age, sex and the proportion of glaucoma subtypes were similar between groups. Preoperatively IOP was significantly lower in DS group vs BS group (18. 8 mmHg vs 23. 8 mmHg, p< 0. 01, two sample t-test). Postoperatively IOP was significantly higher in DS group than BS group (14. 6 mmHg vs 12. 0 mmHg, p< 0. 01, two-sample t-test). In the DS group, 47 % of eyes did not achieve 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline, as a result the success rates were significantly lower in eyes with DS (51 %) than in eyes with BS (88 %) (p= 0. 02, log-rank test). Preoperatively the number of GMs used in DS and BS groups were similar (2. 2 vs 2. 7 p= 0. 02, two sample t-test). Postoperatively there remained no significant difference in GMs between groups (0. 9 vs 1. 1, p= 0. 58, two sample t-test). Complication rates were similar between the two groups (12 % vs 10 %). Conclusions: Baerveldt tube implantation was more effective in lowering IOP than repeat deep sclerectomy in eyes with failed primary DS, at year one.

Independent predictors of ischaemic stroke were identified with a Cox proportional hazard model by stepwise backward selection. The c-index assessed the discriminative ability of the risk schemes. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) assessed net correct risk reclassification using ATRIA <b>versus</b> CHA 2 <b>DS</b> 2 -VASc, using published point score cut-offs. As correct stroke risk thresholds for low/moderate/high risk, 1 % and 2 % per year were used. Results: We included 60, 594 patients. The overall stroke rate was 2. 45 % per year. Age and previous stroke were the strongest predictors of ischaemic stroke. Other independent predictors were hypertension (HR 1. 25 CI 95 %, 1. 15 - 1. 35) and diabetes (HR 1. 27 CI 95 %, 1. 14 - 1. 41). Vascular disease and heart failure were not significant predictors. For the full point scores, the c-index was 0. 71 (CI 95 %, 0. 70 - 0. 72) for the ATRIA score and 0. 69 (CI 95 %, 0. 68 - 0. 70) for the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score.

40|$|The Down {{syndrome}} (DS) immune phenotype {{is characterized}} by thymus hypotrophy, higher propensity to organ-specific autoimmune disorders, and higher susceptibility to infections, among other features. Considering that AIRE (autoimmune regulator) is located on 21 q 22. 3, we analyzed protein and gene expression in surgically removed thymuses from 14 DS patients with congenital heart defects, who were compared with 42 age-matched controls with heart anomaly as an isolated malformation. Immunohistochemistry revealed 70. 48 +/- 49. 59 AIRE-positive cells/mm(2) in <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> 154. 70 +/- 61. 16 AIRE-positive cells/mm(2) in controls (p < 0. 0001), and quantitative PCR as well as DNA microarray data confirmed those results. The number of FOXP 3 -positive cells/mm(2) was equivalent in both groups. Thymus transcriptome analysis showed 407 genes significantly hypoexpressed in DS, {{most of which were}} related, according to network transcriptional analysis (FunNet), to cell division and to immunity. Immune response-related genes included those involved in 1) Ag processing and presentation (HLA-DQB 1, HLA-DRB 3, CD 1 A, CD 1 B, CD 1 C, ERAP) and 2) thymic T cell differentiation (IL 2 RG, RAG 2, CD 3 D, CD 3 E, PRDX 2, CDK 6) and selection (SH 2 D 1 A, CD 74). It is noteworthy that relevant AIRE-partner genes, such as TOP 2 A, LAMNB 1, and NUP 93, were found hypoexpressed in DNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. These findings on global thymic hypofunction in DS revealed molecular mechanisms underlying DS immune phenotype and strongly suggest that DS immune abnormalities are present since early development, rather than being a consequence of precocious aging, as widely hypothesized. Thus, DS should be considered as a non-monogenic primary immunodeficiency. The Journal of Immunology, 2011, 187 : 3422 - 3430.

We aimed to assess the incidence of perceived peritonism in a contemporary ED and to make a comparable characterization on specified endpoints, including hospital stay, performed acute surgery, and ordered imaging. Methods: A single-center study was performed during 2010 in a contemporary Danish ED. We evaluated 1, 270 patients consecutively admitted to the ED and focused on the patients with abdominal pain. Following a physical examination, the patients with abdominal pain were divided into those who had clinical signs of peritonism and those who did not. Results: Among the 1, 270 patients admitted to the ED, 10 % had abdominal pain. In addition, 41 % of these patients were found to have signs indicative of peritonism, and 90 % were admitted to the Department of Surgery (DS). Also, 24 % of those patients with signs of peritonism and admission to the DS underwent surgical intervention in terms of laparotomy/laparoscopy. Five of the patients without peritonism underwent surgery. The patients perceived to have peritonism were younger at 34 ± 3. 0 years (mean ± standard error of the mean) than the {{patients who}} were not perceived to have peritonism, 52 ± 2. 8 years (P< 0. 05). They also had a shorter length of stay of 38. 2 ± 6. 0 hours at the <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> 95. 3 ± 18. 2 hours (P< 0. 05). No differences with statistical significance were found regarding a stay in the emergency room (ER) or ordered imaging from the ER. Conclusion: Peritonism was a common finding in our setting. Peritonism did not require more acute surgery or imaging. The duration of the patient’s stay in the ER was not influenced by a finding of peritonism.

This study is aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau 181) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. Methods: We have developed a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay to quantify plasma p-tau 181, and measured the levels of plasma p-tau 181 in three cohorts. Results: In the first cohort composed of 20 AD patients and 15 age-matched controls, the plasma levels of p-tau 181 were significantly higher in the AD patients {{than those in the}} controls (0. 171 ± 0. 166 pg/ml in AD versus 0. 0405 ± 0. 0756 pg/ml in controls, p = 0. 0039). The percentage of the subjects whose levels of plasma p-tau 181 exceeded the cut-off value (0. 0921 pg/ml) was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the control group (60 % in AD versus 16. 7 % in controls, p = 0. 0090). In the second cohort composed of 20 patients with Down syndrome (DS) and 22 age-matched controls, the plasma concentrations of p-tau 181 were significantly higher in the DS group (0. 767 ± 1. 26 pg/ml in <b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> 0. 0415 ± 0. 0710 pg/ml in controls, p = 0. 0313). There was a significant correlation between the plasma levels of p-tau 181 and age in the DS group (R 2 = 0. 4451, p = 0. 0013). All of the DS individuals showing an extremely high concentration of plasma p-tau 181 (> 1. 0 pg/ml) were older than the age of 40. In the third cohort composed of 8 AD patients and 3 patients with other neurological diseases, the levels of plasma p-tau 181 significantly correlated with those of CSF p-tau 181 (R 2 = 0. 4525, p = 0. 023). Conclusions: We report for the first time quantitative data on the plasma levels of p-tau 181 in controls and patients with AD and DS, and these data suggest that the plasma p-tau 181 is a promising blood biomarker for brain AD pathology. This exploratory pilot study warrants further large-scale and well-controlled studies to validate the usefulness of plasma p-tau 181 as an urgently needed surrogate marker for the diagnosis and disease progression of AD...|$|R

Browse species were harvested during the dry season (DS) and rainy season (RS) and incubated with three different ruminal inoculums: cow, goats previously adapted (AG) or not adapted (UG) to browse species fed in their daily diet. Chemical composition, total condensed tannin (TCT), free-condensed tannin (free-CT), protein-bound condensed tannin (PCT), fiber-bound condensed tannin (FCT) as well as in vitro assaying of ruminal gas production kinetics was determined, while the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and metabolizable energy (ME) were estimated. Crude protein (CP) was considerably higher (season×browse; P< 0. 001) during RS. P. dulce had the lowest neutral detergent fiber (NDFom) and acid detergent fiber (ADFom) in both seasons, while L. acapulcencis had the highest values and Q. laeta values were intermediate, with an overall increase in fiber fractions in DS browse foliages (season×browse; P< 0. 001). TCT content in tree species revealed differences (P< 0. 01). FCT and PCT were lower in Q. laeta and P. dulce during the RS than in DS, lower (P< 0. 01) Free-CT fractions were observed in L. acapulcencis and Q. Laeta than in P. dulce, during both seasons. in vitro gas production parameters was increased (P< 0. 05) in DS than in RS in browses with low and medium tannins contents (i. e., P. dulce and Q. laeta); consequently, browses energy utilization (i. e., SCFA and ME) and organic matter degradability (OMD) as well as fermentation efficiency (i. e., partition factor; PF) were improved (P< 0. 05). Generally, P. dulce had the highest (P< 0. 001) ruminal fermentation parameters and energy utilization values (more in DS than RS), while lowest values were founded in L. acapulcencis.

40|$|Trabulsi, Jillian C. Children with Down {{syndrome}} (DS) {{have different}} growth patterns {{compared to their}} healthy counterparts and have {{a higher incidence of}} overweight (body mass index (BMI) at or above the 85 th percentile and below the 95 th percentile) and obesity (BMI at or above the 95 th percentile) by age three to four years. The factors that contribute of overweight and obesity in this population are not fully understood, although weight gain typically results from positive energy balance, where energy intake exceeds energy requirements. Limited evidence has investigated energy intake (EI), resting energy expenditure (REE), total energy expenditure (TEE), and the ratio of energy intake to total energy expenditure (EI:TEE) in prepubescent children with DS compared to healthy children of similar age. A better understanding of the components of energy balance in this population is needed to inform intervention strategies and prevent children with DS from becoming overweight/obese in childhood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether TEE or EI:TEE differs in children with DS compared to healthy sibling controls at baseline, and whether there was an association between TEE or the EI:TEE ratio and changes in adiposity in the subsequent three year period in children. This study enrolled a total of 72 children, 36 children with DS and 36 healthy sibling controls. Sixty-one children (29 DS and 32 controls) had successful TEE measures. At baseline, TEE (with adjustment for fat free mass) was significantly lower (p< 0. 001) in children with DS (1466. 7 ± 38. 4 kcal/d) compared to controls (1593. 0 ± 35. 2 kcal/d); however, the EI:TEE ratio (1. 07 ± 0. 0 and 101 ± 0. 0 for DS and healthy controls, respectively) was not statistically vii significantly different (p= 0. 4229) between groups. Consequently, children with DS had a stronger positive association between baseline TEE and change in adiposity over three years compared to their healthy control siblings (p= 0. 032), but there was no difference in the relationship between EI:TEE ratio and changes in adiposity over time by health status (<b>DS</b> <b>versus</b> healthy controls) (p= 0. 568). Post-hoc power calculations found that this study was underpowered to detect differences in EI:TEE outcomes between groups, and as such these results should be interpreted with caution. Further analysis with a larger sample size is needed to confirm TEE and EI:TEE associations with changes in adiposity in children with DS.
