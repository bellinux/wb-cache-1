50|$|A surety is {{entitled}} to contribution from a <b>co-surety</b> in respect of their common liability. This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor {{in the case of a}} surety for a surety; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a <b>co-surety</b> for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.|$|E
5000|$|The surety's {{principal}} right {{against the}} creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, {{to the benefit}} of all securities which the creditor held against the principal debtor. If the creditor has lost these securities by default or laches or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged pro tanto. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not. [...] "Every person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in equity, in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any <b>co-surety,</b> co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no <b>co-surety,</b> co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other <b>co-surety,</b> co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable". The right of the surety to be subrogated on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in America and many other countries.|$|E
50|$|Chisholm {{had long}} and active {{involvement}} in the colonial court system of NSW (1822-37): {{he was one of}} two members of the Governor’s Court, appointed by Governor Macquarie (1822-23); {{and a member of the}} ‘grand juries’ and juries of the Quarter Sessions courts (1823-36), being their first Foreman (1824). He was prominent in initiatives for political change through his association with the reforms of William Charles Wentworth (1790-1872). He supported Wentworth in his campaigns for trial by jury, taxation reform and representative government in the form of an elected Legislative Assembly, being a founding member of the Australian Patriotic Association (1835). Although aligned with Lang and Wentworth, Chisholm was not a radical - his politics would appear conservative to modern observers - but in the context of colonial NSW they were democratic and reformist. Throughout his public service, he maintained his family and business interests, and remained loyal to his friends: as an example, along with his friend John Dickson, he provided <b>co-surety</b> of £6,000 for William Douglas Campbell in his legal suit against the estate of his former business partner, Garnham Blaxcell (1823-27).|$|E
40|$|Ong on Contribution is Professor Denis SK Ong’s sixth {{treatise}} in {{the field}} of equity. With its rigorous, yet accessible, approach to this complex area of law Ong on Contribution is a perfect supplement to his earlier acclaimed works: Trusts Law in Australia (now in its 4 th edition), Ong on Equity, Ong on Specific Performance, Ong on Subrogation, and Ong on Rescission. The text offers a thorough study of the doctrine of contribution at common law and in Equity (though it does not deal with contribution between tortfeasors). Topics addressed include: an exploration of the fact that co-ordinate liabilities are essential to the right of contribution; the right of contribution between co-sureties; the right of contribution between co-insurers; and the right to contribution in relation to bills of exchange. As in his earlier works, the book offers a succinct exposition of all the key relevant principles of law, facilitated by a careful analysis of all the leading authorities. To assist the reader, the essential passages of judgments under consideration are reproduced. CONTENTS View Detailed Table of Contents Preface Table of Cases Table of Statutes 1.

50|$|The usual mode in England of {{enforcing}} liability under a guarantee is by {{action in the}} High Court or a County Court. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress {{by means of a}} set-off or counterclaim, in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his <b>co-sureties</b> towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial. The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.|$|R
