30|$|As {{shown in}} FT-IR spectra (Figure  3 b) the {{broad peak at}} 3, 410  cm- 1 {{originates}} from the stretching vibration of OH groups, and a peak at 1, 727  cm- 1 {{is due to the}} C[*]=[*]O stretching vibrations of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The C[*]=[*]C of an un-oxidized graphitic domain gives a skeletal vibration at 1, 590  cm- 1. The peaks at 1, 230 and 1, 050  cm- 1 are characteristics of carboxyl C-O deformation and alkoxy C-O stretching vibrations, respectively. As seen in the figure, the peak intensities of RGO- 24 and RCMGO- 24 were lower than those of GO, suggesting effective removal of functional groups by hydrazine. However, these graphene samples still have some surface functional groups over the basal and edge planes of the graphene sheets, which were observed at 3, 400, 1, 560, and <b>1,</b> <b>205</b>  cm- <b>1</b> for residual -OH, C[*]=[*]C, and C-O groups, respectively. The broad peak observed at <b>1,</b> <b>205</b>  cm- <b>1</b> for RCMGO- 24 denotes the greater presence of residual oxygen functional groups.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPDP 1 {{is a basic}} {{leucine zipper}} (bZip) {{transcription}} factor that is expressed at high levels in the muscle, epidermis, gut and fat body of the developing Drosophila embryo. We have identified three mutant alleles of Pdp 1, each having a similar phenotype. Here, we describe in detail the Pdp 1 mutant allele, Pdp <b>1</b> p <b>205,</b> which is null for both Pdp 1 RNA and protein. Interestingly, homozygous Pdp <b>1</b> p <b>205</b> embryos develop normally, hatch and become viable larvae. Analyses of Pdp 1 null mutant embryos reveal that the overall muscle pattern is normal as is the patterning of the gut and fat body. Pdp <b>1</b> p <b>205</b> larvae also appear to have normal muscle and gut function and respond to ecdysone. These larvae, however, are severely growth delayed and arrested. Furthermore, although Pdp 1 null larvae {{live a normal life}} span, they do not form pupae and thus do not give rise to eclosed flies. The stunted growth of Pdp <b>1</b> p <b>205</b> larvae is accompanied by defects in mitosis and endoreplication similar to that associated with nutritional deprivation. The cellular defects resulting from the Pdp <b>1</b> p <b>205</b> mutation are not cell autonomous. Moreover, PDP 1 expression is sensitive to nutritional conditions, suggesting a link between nutrition, PDP 1 isotype expression and growth. These results indicate that Pdp 1 has a critical role in coordinating growth and DNA replication...|$|R

40|$|A {{monotone}} {{drawing of}} a graph G is a straight-line drawing of G such that, for every pair of vertices u,w in G, there exists abpath P_{uw} in G that is monotone in some direction l_{uw}. (Namely, {{the order of the}} orthogonal projections of the vertices of P_{uw} on l_{uw} {{is the same as the}} order they appear in P_{uw}.) The problem of finding monotone drawings for trees has been studied in several recent papers. The main focus is to reduce the size of the drawing. Currently, the smallest drawing size is O(n^{ <b>1.</b> <b>205</b> }) x O(n^{ <b>1.</b> <b>205</b> }). In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing monotone drawings of trees on a grid of size at most 12 n x 12 n. The smaller drawing size is achieved by a new simple Path Draw algorithm, and a procedure that carefully assigns primitive vectors to the paths of the input tree T. We also show that there exists a tree T_ 0 such that any monotone drawing of T_ 0 must use a grid of size Omega(n) x Omega(n). So the size of our monotone drawing of trees is asymptotically optimal...|$|R
