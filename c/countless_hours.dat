His father, Hans Erik Ødegaard, a former {{football}}er, co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team. In 2005, when Ødegaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field, Kjappen, with artificial turf.

Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 {{when she moved}} to New York City (Brooklyn), {{she would never have}} been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent <b>countless</b> <b>hours</b> on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.|$|E

Lisch scored in double figures in all but nine games during the regular season, as he scored over 20 points three times. The Wildcats were hit by numerous long-term injuries during the 2010–11 season that derailed their chances at defending their title. They finished the regular season in fourth place with a 16–12 record, and faced the first-placed New Zealand Breakers in the Semi Finals. Behind a 29-point effort, Lisch helped the Wildcats take Game 1 of the series in Auckland, before the Breakers came back to win Games 2 and 3. Lisch appeared in all 31 games for the Wildcats in 2010–11, averaging 13.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.

500|$|On 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he {{had first}} met in 1962. By this time the stress and {{pressure}} that went along with Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically {{in an attempt to}} provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame affected their live performances; Starr commented: [...] "We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it." [...] He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent <b>countless</b> <b>hours</b> playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him.

Their first performances outside the South came on May 30 and 31 in Boston, opening for The Velvet Underground. In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers such as [...] "Trouble No More" [...] and [...] "One Way Out", in addition to improvised jams such as [...] "Mountain Jam". Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's sole songwriter, composing songs such as [...] "Whipping Post" [...] and [...] "Black-Hearted Woman". [...] The band was originally set to record their first album in Miami with Cream and John Coltrane producer Tom Dowd, who proved unavailable. Instead, they headed off for New York City in August 1969 to work with Atlantic house engineer Adrian Barber in his first producer credit. The Allman Brothers Band was recorded and mixed in two weeks, and proved a positive experience for the ensemble. New York came to be regarded within the group as their [...] "second home." [...] The Allman Brothers Band was released in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records, but received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release.|$|E
500|$|While on tour as Mos Def's in-concert DJ, Preservation {{began to}} remix some of The Ecstatics songs for their live routine. He {{challenged}} himself to remix {{the rest of}} the record, taking more than a year, as a project called The REcstatic, working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's mixing engineer. Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes. He wanted them to be sample-based and consistent in key, pitch, and tone to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. [...] "It's the result of <b>countless</b> <b>hours</b> of digging through records to sample", he recalled. [...] "Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on". The REcstatic was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's imprint label, Mon Dieu Music. Reviewing the remix album in Tiny Mix Tapes, Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a [...] "slightly rougher texture" [...] on what he deemed [...] "a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that can be said for very few modern rap 'remixes'".|$|E

50|$|The Ohio Wing grew rapidly {{following}} {{the onset of}} the war. Under Johnson and later wing commander CAP Colonel George A. Stone, Jr., the wing recruited men and women throughout the state. Governor Bricker joined CAP in May 1942, as did Congressman John M. Vorys, himself a World War I naval aviator and former director of the Ohio Bureau of Aeronautics. By July 1942, the wing numbered 3,282 men and women organized in nine groups and 39 squadrons, making the Ohio Wing the third largest CAP wing in the nation; over 4,200 members served in the Ohio Wing by 31 October 1942. Ohio squadrons undertook a variety of missions on behalf of the war effort. The wing conducted statewide searches for scrap metal in response to OCD scrap drives for metal, tires, and other resources, saving <b>countless</b> <b>hour</b> of ground searches and locating well over a quarter million pounds of scrap metal. CAP squadrons also maintained constant aerial patrol over the state’s valuable timber resources. The eagle eyes of Ohio CAP members prevented large forest fires from erupting in 1942. CAP personnel provided further surveillance of coal, oil, and gas resources in the state vital to the war effort and defense industries. Ohio wing members in 1943 volunteered to patrol flood-stricken areas across the state, radioing flood information to state and local authorities on the ground to help in responding to the emergencies. Other Ohio wing members served as aerial couriers during the war. The small light aircraft of CAP could ferry supplies vital for war effort into areas and through conditions when no other options remained viable.|$|R

To counter component identification methods we utilize boundary blurring techniques which are either semantic preserving or semantic changing in order to prevent component iden-tification methods.

50|$|In June 1915 Captain Clock, {{along with}} Thompson, planned {{to build a}} 1000-foot pier into the ocean and {{establish}} the Fire Island Fishing Company there. The idea of the venture was to unload fish from commercial fishing boats, along with fish caught {{with the use of}} large fishing nets which were strung out some 1600 feet from the pier and reeled in daily. The catch would then be loaded onto a small railroad system and then run across the island to another pier extending 500 feet on the bayside. The fish would then be loaded into other boats and then sailed to the mainland. This avoided the long and tricky passage through Fire Island Inlet thus saving <b>countless</b> travel <b>hours</b> for the fishermen.
