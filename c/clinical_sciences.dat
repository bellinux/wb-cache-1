40|$|As {{changes in}} health-care {{delivery}} impel us to refine <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> training, the opportunity arises to reconceptualize internship training to align {{more closely with}} <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> values and outcomes. We present observations {{on the evolution of}} internship training with a focus on the following issues. First, we highlight the significance of a publichealth perspective for <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> as a basis for refining training goals and practices. Second, we briefly review how internship training evolved (where it has come from) to set the context for continuing evolution (where it might go). Third, we discuss the need for an expanded definition of clinical competence for <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> training to better align with innovations in health care and to prepare graduates for new career opportunities. Finally, we present examples of new models for internship training that might accommodate the continuing redefinition of internship training in <b>clinical</b> <b>science.</b> © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R

25|$|In Kenya, {{medical school}} is a faculty of a university. Medical {{education}} lasts for 5 years after which the student graduates with an undergraduate (MBChB) degree. This {{is followed by a}} mandatory 12-month full-time internship at an approved hospital after which one applies for registration with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board if they intend to practice medicine in the country.

25|$|In most institutions, medical {{education}} lasts for four years. Basic subjects are {{taken up in}} the first and second years, while <b>clinical</b> <b>sciences</b> are studied {{in the second and third}} years. In their fourth year, students rotate in the various hospital departments, spending up to two months each in the fields of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, and several weeks in the other specialties. After this, students graduate with a Doctorate in Medicine and apply for postgraduate internship (PGI) in an accredited hospital of their choice. After PGI, the student is eligible to take the Medical Licensure Examination. Passing the examinations confers the right to practice medicine as well as to apply in a Residency Training Program.|$|E

25|$|With over 400 medical {{research}} facilities and 76 medical magazine indexes {{available in the}} country, Iran is the 19th country in {{medical research}} and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012). <b>Clinical</b> <b>sciences</b> are invested in highly in Iran. In areas such as rheumatology, hematology, and bone marrow trasplantation, Iranian medical scientists publish regularly. The Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center (HORC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Shariati Hospital was established in 1991. Internationally, this center {{is one of the}} largest bone marrow transplantation centers and has carried out a large number of successful transplantations. According to a study conducted in 2005, associated specialized pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) services exist in almost all major cities throughout the country, where 43 board-certified or eligible pediatric hematologist–oncologists are giving care to children suffering from cancer or hematological disorders. Three children's medical centers at universities have approved PHO fellowship programs. Besides hematology, gastroenterology has recently attracted many talented medical students. The gasteroenterology research center based at Tehran University has produced increasing numbers of scientific publications since its establishment.|$|E
25|$|Requirements vary between countries. In the U.S. chiropractors {{obtain a}} first {{professional}} {{degree in the}} field of chiropractic. Chiropractic education in the U.S. have been criticized for failing to meet generally accepted standards of evidence-based medicine. The curriculum content of North American chiropractic and medical colleges with regard to basic and <b>clinical</b> <b>sciences</b> has been more similar than not, both in the kinds of subjects offered and in the time assigned to each subject. Accredited chiropractic programs in the U.S. require that applicants have 90 semester hours of undergraduate education with a grade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Many programs require at least three years of undergraduate education, and more are requiring a bachelor's degree. Canada requires a minimum three years of undergraduate education for applicants, and at least 4200 instructional hours (or the equivalent) of full‐time chiropractic education for matriculation through an accredited chiropractic program. Graduates of the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) are formally recognized to have at least 7–8 years of university level education. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines suggest three major full-time educational paths culminating in either a DC, DCM, BSc, or MSc degree. Besides the full-time paths, they also suggest a conversion program for people with other health care education and limited training programs for regions where no legislation governs chiropractic.|$|E

30|$|Globally, {{the most}} common fields of medical student {{research}} publications (sequentially ordered) include: psychiatry, general medicine, medical education, oncology and community medicine (Wickramasinghe et al. 2013). In our study, the number of <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> publications was roughly 2 {{times the number of}} basic science publications. A study by Druss and Marcus (2005) reports {{that there has been a}} movement from basic <b>science</b> to <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> research over the course of the past two decades. Moreover, similar reports were also made in a different study, which underscored minimal (9  %) basic science research involvement compared to the increased affinity for <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> related research such as retrospective chart reviews and case reports (Siemens et al. 2010). In our study, one plausible reason for the high number of publications in <b>clinical</b> <b>science</b> (particularly surgical oncology) could be related to the tertiary healthcare nature of the students’ clerkship training institute; the vast majority of patient cases are oncology-related referrals from the other local hospitals across the country.|$|R
