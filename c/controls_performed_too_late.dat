This is a hernia of abdominal wall with partial entrapment of bowel wall (antimesenteric site) through a small ring. The incidence increased {{in the last years}} because of diffusion of laparoscopic techniques. Richter's hernia could be asymptomatic for a long time or show vanish sign.

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years the {{incidence}} of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) presented a progressive increase, showing an association with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 50 - 70 % of the cases. Nowadays, however, the prevalence of PSC is still unknown, mainly because of its difficult identification. In contrast to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which is strongly associated with the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in serum, a similar reliable diagnostic marker has not yet been demonstrated in PSC. In this review we tried to investigate the controversial diagnostic aspects which may interfere with the initial assessment of PSC syndrome. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) are actually the two cornerstones of the clinical setting, but if alone, they do not seem to provide sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, liver biopsy, perhaps more sensitive but not always specific, is generally <b>performed</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> In our opinion, epidemiologic studies are needed in Italy and elsewhere in order to evaluate PSC prevalence.

Our goal was to test this perception, using radiologic parameters as a marker of the degree of OA. Our study involved 130 consecutive patients who underwent TKA for OA. The radiographs of each patient were graded according to the Ahlback classification. Outcome was measured prospectively using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), which was recorded both preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. The degree of radiologic OA changes preoperatively was not found to influence the outcome of surgery at 1 year, with all patient groups improving to a similar extent. In addition, as has been seen in previous studies, no correlation was found between symptoms of OA and radiologic appearances. The results of this study would support a re-evaluation of traditional orthopaedic practice.

Diagnostic tools currently available are therefore either <b>performed</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> or {{are not able to}} detect early disease stage. Imaging procedures for diagnosis and staging are ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreaticography, intravenous bolus-enhanced spiral computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography.

To assess resectability, additional diagnostic methods like angiography, positron emission tomography, cholangioscopy, endoscopic or intraluminal ultrasonography and finally even explorative laparoscopy may be required. At time of diagnosis {{only a small percentage of}} Klatskin tumors is curative resectable. Therefore, palliative treatment options play an important role. Endoprostheses insertion is the method of choice to relieve jaundice. Although it improves quality of life, it does not seem to improve survival time. Definitive evidence for a benefit of additional radio and/or chemotherapy is still missing.

A 16 -year-old girl was referred to the hospital due to the non-specific symptoms over period of a few months and pain acutization in the right infraumbilical region lasting for two days. Complete laboratory analyses were normal. Ultrasound examination revealed a round mass (23 Ч 14 mm) within the right fallopian tube with color Doppler whirlpool sign, normal ovary, and a simple ipsilateral paratubal cyst (50 x 40 mm). Laparoscopy showed a dilated and two times torquated right fallopian tube, as well as signs of chronic appendicitis. The tube was twisted about its longitudinal axis and it was livid, but not gangrenous. After appendectomy, fallopian tube was detorquated, cyst extracted and preservation of the tube was performed. Postoperatively, antibiotic therapy was administered based on antibiogram. On follow-up examinations within the next four months postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion. Since there are no pathognomonic symptoms, clinical or laboratory findings, diagnosis of this condition is challenging. Familiarity with Doppler whirlpool sign can enable a timely {{diagnosis and treatment of}} isolated fallopian tube torsions. However, the diagnosis is rarely made before operation.

40|$|In marine systems, {{there is}} a need to {{characterize}} the system-level dynamic response of physical hardware components, such as critical mechanical equipment and vibration control devices. Pure numerical simulation of these components can be challenging and in many cases require full-system testing to characterize. However, full-system testing is often <b>performed</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> in the development process. In this dissertation, real-time hybrid substructuring (RTHS) is extended and demonstrated for marine systems to provide a cost-effective laboratory platform that combines physical testing and numerical simulation. RTHS is a relatively new method of vibration testing that allows a dynamic system to be partitioned into separate physical and numerical components or substructures. The substructures are interfaced together as a cyber-physical system using control actuation and sensing similar to hardware-in-the-loop testing. This research specifically addresses the unique challenges posed by the real-time constraints of RTHS and its application to marine systems. These challenges include: 1) stability and performance analysis for both single and multi-actuator RTHS, 2) effective compensation of multi-actuator dynamics to ensure closed-loop stability and performance, and 3) efficient real-time solution of complex numerical substructures with acoustic fluid-structure-interaction (FSI). Since RTHS involves a feedback loop, a control systems approach is employed in the development of improved techniques to deal with these challenges. To demonstrate RTHS, several laboratory experiments were conducted at the University of Connecticut Structures Research Laboratory. RTHS was used to experimentally verify a new application of the connected control method (CCM) for adjacent base isolation systems using physical damper hardware. RTHS was then demonstrated for marine structural acoustics using a physical mass-spring system coupled to different analytical fluid-loaded substructures of increasing model complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTHS accurately captures the system-level response and allows for repeatable tests of various dynamic conditions and potential system improvements to be efficiently examined...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{usefulness}} of the tuberculin skin test (TST) for HIV-infected subjects may be questioned because false-negative results are increasingly common with advanced immune deficiency. The objectives of this research were thus to describe the use {{and the results of}} TST among patients with HIV infection in Switzerland and to measure the {{usefulness of}} isoniazid preventive chemotherapy and the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) relative to TST and CD 4 cell count at the time of TST. DESIGN: Prospective multicentric cohort study of HIV infected patients; comparison of patients tested and non-tested, and of those with positive and negative TST. Multivariate comparison (Cox model) of TB incidence taking into account TST results and CD 4 cell count at the time of TST. RESULTS: Out of 5802 patients followed up in the Swiss HIV cohort study as of September 1994, 34. 6 % were tested. Native Swiss {{were more likely to be}} tested than patients from high TB prevalence countries (36 % vs 21 % of native Africans). Patients registered after 1990 were more often tested than before (50 % vs 26 %). Of 2010 tested patients, 6. 8 % had a > 5 mm induration. African patients were more frequently TST positive (26 %) than Swiss nationals (6 %). Among patients with CD 4 > 500 per mm 3 at the time of the test, 16 % were TST positive compared to 1 % of those with CD 4 or = 200 per mm 3 at the time of the test was 0. 3 per person-year. In comparison, the adjusted relative risk of tuberculosis among TST-positive patients with CD 4 > or = 200 per mm 3 was 5. 5 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 2 - 23. 9) and 6. 6 (CI: 2. 3 - 19. 0) among TST-negative patients with CD 4 < 200 per mm 3. CONCLUSION: Despite its usefulness, TST is often <b>performed</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> and is therefore difficult to interpret. TST should be done as early as possible. TST should be done as early as possible.

However, the acute effects of delayed reperfusion are not known. Twenty-two dogs underwent 3 (n = 8), 4 (n = 8) or 6 h (n = 6) of circumflex artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Effects of reperfusion on diastolic expansion were assessed in two ways: 1) change in mean {{radius of curvature}} of the infarct segment, and 2) change in {{the ratio of the}} length of the diameter {{from the center of the}} infarct zone to the opposite wall (septal-lateral diameter) to the length of the diameter perpendicular to this (anteroposterior diameter). Effects on systolic expansion were examined with quantitative two-dimensional echocardiographic systolic thickening analysis. Delayed reperfusion produced an immediate decrease in diastolic infarct expansion. The ratio of septal-lateral/anteroposterior diameters, which had increased with occlusion from a preocclusion baseline of 0. 98 ± 0. 06 to 1. 13 ± 0. 08 (p < 0. 001), decreased with reperfusion to 1. 02 ± 0. 07 at 15 min and 1. 03 ± 0. 08 at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0. 001). This was due solely to a decrease in the septal-lateral diameter. The radius of curvature of the infarcted segment increased from 2. 1 ± 0. 5 cm before reperfusion to 2. 74 ± 0. 8 cm at 15 min and 2. 6 ± 0. 85 cm at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0. 009). This occurred despite a significant (13. 6 %) decline in end-diastolic cavity area and is compatible with flattening of the reperfused infarct region. Systolic infarct expansion also improved slightly. The length of the abnormally contracting segment decreased by 13 ± 20 % (p = 0. 02), and systolic thinning was abolished (− 5 ± 5 %, 1 ± 5 % and 1 ± 3 % respectively, at the three time points, p = 0. 05). Globally, cavity area shrinkage increased from 27 ± 7. 5 % before reperfusion to 33 ± 7 % at 15 min (p = 0. 02) and 30 ± 6 % (p = NS) at 3 h. In conclusion, late coronary reperfusion leads to an acute reduction in diastolic infarct expansion. Although this reduces end-diastolic cavity area (and thus preload), global systolic function is preserved because systolic infarct expansion is reduced, and the decline in preload is regional, involving primarily the noncontractile infarcted segment. Late reperfusion has potentially important applications to the acute as well as to the chronic stages of myocardial infarction...|$|R
