40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the effects <b>of</b> contrasting <b>composted</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> cattle <b>manure</b> (SCM) ondry matter (DM) yield and crop apparent N recovery (ANR) following manure application to maize land. Fresh SCM was stored as stockpiled, roofed, covered and composted heaps. After storage, the manures were incorporated in a sandy soil, and maize ANR both {{as a proportion of}} field applied N (ANRF) and collected N from the barn (ANRB),and DM yield was established at three successive growth stages: end of juvenile phase, start of grain filling, and physiological maturity. During the storage period, on average 6 % of the initial Ntotal was lost from covered, whereas this fraction was 12, 21 and 33 % from roofed, stockpiled, and composted heaps, respectively. DM yield of maize increased with the application of all the manure types as compared to the unfertilized control, at the end of Juvenile (2. 2 vs. 3. 1 - 3. 4 Mg ha- 1), grain filling (11. 2 vs. 13. 6 - 16. 4 Mg ha- 1) and physiological maturity stages (13. 9 vs. 15. 3 - 15. 9 Mg ha- 1). At a given growth stage, the greatest value was obtained from covered than roofed, stockpiled and composted manures. Maize ANRF was the highest at start of grain filling (20, 29, 31, and 39 % of the applied N for composted, stockpiled, roofed and covered treatments, respectively) but lower values were obtained at physiological maturity (12 - 21 %). The respective values in case of maize ANRB were 13, 23, 27 and 37 % of total N taken from barn at the start of grain filling while it was also lower (8 - 20 %) at physiological maturity. It is concluded thatstorage of SCM under an impermeable plastic cover reduce N losses, increased DM yield and ANR thereby improves on-farm N cycling as compared to traditional stockpiling or composting. <br/...|$|R
30|$|Composting is {{a natural}} aerobic process that stabilizes a variety of organic matter and {{livestock}} manure. Well-composted manure has the odor of humus. Because of the heat produced during composting, well-controlled composting results {{in the destruction of}} both pathogens and weed seeds. The dead animals also can be effectively recycled via composting; however, feathers, teeth, and bone fragments may resist composting, which can be removed by mechanical screening if necessary. The poultry industry in the United States found a solution to its dead bird disposal problem by composting them by special procedure (Morrow and Ferket 1993). The success of the poultry industry in this area has stimulated a growing interest in the pig industry in the US to begin composting their mortalities (Kashmanian and Rynk 1995). The <b>composting</b> <b>of</b> pig carcasses may be carried out in bins built from treated wood, concrete or bales of hay, over a concrete floor (McCaskey et al. 1996). A layer of carcasses is placed over 1 feet layer of sawdust and then covered on all sides with 1 feet of sawdust. Add other layers until bin is full. Carcasses may be composted, whole or dismembered in case of large sows (Morrow et al. 1995). After 3  months, the compost may be turned manually or mechanically, and then allowed to stand another 3  months for the process to be completed (Fulhage 1993). If static-pile composting is being used, the compost is not turned for the whole period. Animal dead bodies can be buried into compost pile within 24  h of death and covered with thick layer <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> or soil. <b>Composting</b> is done {{in such a way that}} it will control odors, flies, rodents and other vermin (Morrow 2001). Dead animals with history of neurological disease, anthrax or other diseases and conditions kept under quarantine should not be composted (Belay et al. 2002). The pile composting is most common in India. Another method <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> used in India is NADEP method which is found to produce better nutrients than the conventional composting (Yadav 2012). Livestock wastes in Japan are mainly by subjecting to composting. About 50 and 25  % <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> waste from piggery and cattle, respectively, were subjected to composting. The liquid composting was also practiced in 2.1 and 6.9  % of cattle and pig waste, respectively, in Japan (Haga 1999). The composting systems used in Japan are mainly of five types, i.e., pile, box, rotary kiln, enclosed vertical type and open elongated type with turning device. For large ruminants the pile type and the open elongated type are mainly in use. The open elongated type and the enclosed vertical type are popular compost type for swine and poultry wastes. The pig manure is collected with much of water in developed countries, hence, difficult to be processed with <b>composting.</b> Separation <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> <b>solids</b> will improve its composting characteristics. Separated pig <b>manure</b> <b>solids</b> containing up to 79  % moisture have been composted successfully (Liao et al. 1993). It was suggested to use low-moisture bulking agents such as straw, sawdust, peat, peanut shells, rice hull, etc. for composting high-moisture manure (Georgacakis et al. 1996).|$|R

The qualitative analysis of the pyrograms allowed us to discriminate between four main families of compounds: aromatic compounds, lipids, polysaccharides and nitrogen-containing substances. The quantitative data revealed some variations in the chemical composition of the macromolecular content. Lipids are the most transformed fraction during the composting process. Animal and plant fatty acids showed a sensible decrease. Fungal fatty acids mainly increased during the thermophilic phase whereas bacterial fatty acids increased when the growth of fungi is repressed. During <b>composting</b> <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> wastes from traditional tanneries an adapted microbial community has been developed. Various lignin-derived units during composting showed a strong increase in p-hydroxyphenyl type-compounds in comparison with the other aromatic structures due to high decomposition of grass cuttings. Tannin derived compounds also increased throughout the composting. Lignin and condensed tannins polymers are partially degraded and stabilized by covalent linkage to more complex organic molecules such as humic substances. Nitrogen containing compounds increased during composting {{as a consequence of the}} high rate of degradation of the other fractions and/or their combination with polyphenolic structure leading to the formation of humic substances.

The study {{aimed to}} evaluate the influence <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> (MBR 34) and leaf (AX) based on shale in the production and quality of strawberry cultivars Camarosa and Camino Real. The experiment was conducted in a private property located at Estrada da Gama, 9 th District of Pelotas / RS in the period from May to December 2009. The cultivars were Camarosa and Camino Real, conducted in three rows, spaced 0. 30 mx 0. 30 m under low tunnels and drip irrigation. For each cultivar experiment was performed with a split-plot design by block, with four replications. The <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> factor (S) with two levels: presence and absence of 500 kg ha- 1 in MBR 34 (particle size 100 % < 0. 3 mm) was allocated in the plot. In the subplot factor was allocated foliar fertilizer (F) with three levels: 0, 12 and 24 L ha- 1 water shale + 10 % Ca (calcium nitrate, 14 % N and 18 % Ca) + 2 % B (boric acid, 17 % B). Were also employed two additional treatments (control). The experimental unit of the factor plot consisted of 12 plants. The variables analyzed were number of fruits per plant, fruit weight (yield) per plant, weight per fruit, leaf chlorophyll content, soluble solids, total acidity and herbal compounds, which are, anthocyanins, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Was also performed chemical analysis of soil and foliar. Data were subjected to analysis of variance followed by comparison tests of means or polynomial regression analysis. To cultivate Camarosa, concluded that: the leaf <b>manuring</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> did not influence the variables of production and chlorophyll content, {{it is possible that}} under the experimental conditions, the high levels of nutrients in the soil did not permit the performance expected for the treatments, the antioxidant activity of fruits was higher in the presence <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure,</b> the concentrations <b>of</b> phenolic compounds were reduced according to foliar and anthocyanin contents were not affected by treatments, the content <b>of</b> soluble <b>solids</b> was higher in the presence <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> (MBR 34), while the acidity of this variety was not affected by treatments.

This co-digestion <b>of</b> high <b>solids</b> raw <b>manure</b> were conducted with a ratio <b>of</b> total <b>solid</b> <b>of</b> chicken <b>manure</b> to co digested material of 90 : 10 for both co-digestion. The result shows that, the anaerobic digestion of 10 % TS w/v of chicken manure (without co-digestion) have 3 major phases that is the phase 1 or the lagging phase, that was believed to be the hydrolysis phase of the manure, which occurred in about 14 days, phase 2, the exponential phase that was believed to be the methanogenesis phase of the manure, which occurred about 49 days later, and phase 3, the end phase, that was believed to shows the last phase that is usually inhibited by ammonia and VFA concentration. The result shows that the co digestion with bran is more feasible which produce high yield of methane and lowest yield of hydrogen sulphide in biogas produce. The recommendation have been made to optimize the methane production by two stages of anaerobic digestion and also by inoculate to start the proces...|$|R

40|$|Composting {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular {{in the past decade}} as a biological treatment process <b>of</b> organic <b>solid</b> wastes, generated from different sources, with the purpose of recovery, stabilization and volume reduction of waste material in the form <b>of</b> <b>compost.</b> In this study, the effect of different modes <b>of</b> aeration on <b>composting</b> <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> waste using two heat insulated closed pilot-scale reactors was investigated. The modes of aeration studied were upflow, downflow, alternate upflow/downflow, and internal recirculation in a single-reactor system as well as reuse of spent air in a two-reactor system in series. Composting tests were performed in two stages of 20 - 30 days duration each. Temperature at different heights <b>of</b> the <b>composting</b> mass as well as air velocity were continuously monitored by a datalogger. Air flow was continuous or intermittent depending on temperature. Oxygen content in the spent air was regularly measured. The results show that (i) the application of unidirectional upflow or downflow aeration creates significant vertical distribution of temperature in the composting mass; and (ii) internal recirculation of air in a single-reactor system and reuse of spent air in a two-reactor system appeared to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution and thereby accelerated degradation of the organic matter. Practical applications in composting plants are discussed. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Microbial C and N {{dynamics}} during <b>composting</b> process <b>of</b> urban <b>solid</b> waste Microbial characterization <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> is <b>of</b> {{importance for}} the optimization {{of the process and}} the quality of the end product. The aim of this work was to follow microbial biomass C and N dynamics during the <b>composting</b> process <b>of</b> urban <b>solid</b> waste. Microbial biomass C (BC) ranged from 4. 06 to 1 µg kg– 1 <b>of</b> dry <b>compost</b> from day 5 to day 62 and decreased to reach 0. 44 mg kg– 1 in mature compost. Microbial biomass N (BN) showed the same trend as BC, ranging from 1. 472 to 0. 443 µg kg– 1 <b>of</b> dry <b>compost</b> from day 5 to day 62. This behav-iour is probably related to the decreasing availability of readily decomposable substrates with the ongoing of the process. BC and BN showed a strong correlation (r = 0. 78).

40|$|The {{concentration}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) during the <b>composting</b> <b>of</b> kitchen waste and pruning residues, and the abatement of VOCs by different compost biofilters was studied. VOCs removal efficiencies greater than 90 % were obtained using <b>composts</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>solid</b> waste (MSW) or MSW-pruning residue as biofilter material. An electronic nose identified qualitative differences among the biofilter output gases at very low concentrations of VOCs. These differences were related to compost constituents, compost particle size (2 - 7 or 7 - 20. mm), and {{a combination of both}} factors. The total {{concentration of}} VOCs determined by a photoionization analyser and inferred from electronic nose data sets were correlated over an ample range of concentrations of VOCs, showing that these techniques could be specially adapted for the monitoring of these processes.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, Dry Anaerobic Digestion (DAD) <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> has {{acquired}} increasing interest {{because of its}} robustness, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness over conventional anaerobic digestion system. A laboratory scale DAD system was fabricated, used with feedlot manure and inoculum mix {{at a ratio of}} 2 : 1, and was evaluated for a 40 day hydraulic retention time (HRT) under a 35 ± 2 ˚C digestion temperature. The main constituents of biogas identified and quantified were CH 4, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The share of CH 4, CO 2, and other gases including N 2 O were 62. 3, 36. 3, and 0. 41 % of the total biogas produced, respectively. Average daily biogas yield was 0. 575 L per day over a 40 day hydraulic retention time (HRT). Biogas gas production from feedlot manure also found to be varied with digestion temperature fluctuations. Initially, CO 2 amount produced was higher than CH 4. Later on, amount of CH 4 gas production was increased over CO 2 as the experiment was continued. Average concentrations of CH 4 and CO 2 over a period 40 day HRT were 49 %, and 44 %respectively. Average daily CH 4 yield was 0. 359 L per day based on 40 day HRT. The feedlot manure showed a VS removal of 27. 4 % over 40 day HRT. Estimated specific biogas and CH 4 yield were 0. 053 and yield of 0. 0337 L...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> to arable land, rapid incorporation has been recognised {{as a successful}} technique to reduce ammonia emissions. There is, however, the potential for nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to increase. FYM was generated from groups of pigs and cattle using conventional amounts of straw or additional straw in the buildings. Emissions of N 2 O were monitored at 2 sites; a loamy sand soil in central England (ADAS Gleadthorpe) and a coarse sandy loam soil in south west England (IGER North Wyke). Emissions were measured following a target application of 250 kg N ha- 1 of either pig (ADAS) or cattle (IGER) FYM. The FYM was spread fresh (pig only) or had been stored for 12 months. The manure was then either left on the surface, incorporated within 4 hours using a disc (IGER only) or plough. No consistent effect of incorporation on N 2 O emissions was evident. Ploughed, fresh pig FYM resulted in significantly (P 0. 05) effect of storage conditions or incorporation technique. The results do, however indicate that cattle FYM left on the soil surface resulted in greater N 2 O emissions than from the incorporation techniques. The % of total N applied lost as N 2 O was small (generally < 0. 20 %) probably {{as a result of}} the low NH 4 -N content of the stored manure, suggesting that storage may be used as a technique to reduce N 2 O emissions...|$|R
