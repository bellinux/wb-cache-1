5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for <b>compliant</b> USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. <b>Compliant</b> devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a <b>compliant</b> extension cable that does.|$|E

5|$|PyPy is a fast, <b>compliant</b> {{interpreter}} of Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython. A version {{taking advantage of}} multi-core processors using software transactional memory is being created.|$|E
5|$|Accession to EU {{required}} {{a new law}} <b>compliant</b> with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the regime}} {{leadership}} intended to remold Solidarity into a <b>compliant</b> union, {{stripped of its}} intelligentsia advisers and compatible with the state socialist system. The failure to incite most ranking Solidarity leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any cooperation along this course of action, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.|$|E
5|$|Located at the Hatfield Government Center {{station is}} {{a parking garage}} for {{park-and-ride}} passengers. The garage includes 250 parking spaces accessible 24-hours a day. The stop is <b>compliant</b> with the Americans with Disabilities Act, contains bike racks and bike lockers, and has an electronic reader board listing up-to-date arrivals of trains.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} do {{not believe}} that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to <b>compliant</b> behaviour. Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} remedy (e.g. {{financial}} penalties, criminal imprisonment) {{imposed by the}} regulator becomes increasingly severe higher up the pyramid – with the view of creating an incentive for entities to move towards more <b>compliant</b> behaviours. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) uses a compliance pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The scatterplot risk matrix to {{the left}} shows that most {{entities}} are <b>compliant</b> {{most of the time}} – in other words, assessed as both lower consequence and lower likelihood of their not complying with the law.|$|E
5|$|This allows more {{resources}} to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities {{to want to be}} seen to be <b>compliant.</b> The robustness of the risk assessments, {{and the quality of the}} data on which the assessments rely, are therefore very important.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD DVD players which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD video or refused to play outright unless an HDCP <b>compliant</b> chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations {{that would have allowed}} high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were exceptionally rare.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, it kept her in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, <b>compliant</b> and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF <b>compliant.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the USB Promoters Group {{announced}} the finalization of the USB Power Delivery (PD) Specification (USB PD rev. 1), an extension that specifies using certified PD aware USB cables with standard USB Type-A and Type-B connectors to deliver increased power (more than 7.5W) to devices with larger power demand. Devices can request higher currents and supply voltages from <b>compliant</b> hosts up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption {{of up to}} 10W), and optionally up to 3A or 5A at either 12V (36W or 60W) or 20V (60W or 100W). In all cases, both host-to-device and device-to-host configurations are supported.|$|E
5|$|Materials used in {{the station}} are {{expected}} to last at least 100 years; include granite tile, ceramic tile, stainless steel panels on the walls, painted steel panels on the ceilings, energy-efficient fluorescent lamps and LEDs, and mesh; and are supposed to conform to New York City Transit criteria, including slip-resistance. The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also <b>compliant</b> with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai's bus {{services}} {{carried over}} 5.5 million passengers {{per day in}} 2008, which dropped to 2.8 million in 2015. Public buses run by BEST cover almost {{all parts of the}} metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane. The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5million passengers daily over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III <b>compliant</b> diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses. BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998. BEST buses are red in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.|$|E
5|$|Only the Dongan Hills, Saint George, Great Kills and Tottenville {{stations}} of the Staten Island Railway have been renovated to be {{in compliance with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; these stations feature elevators and/or ramps. The new Arthur Kill station, which opened on January 21, 2017, is <b>compliant</b> with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA. There are Park and Ride facilities at the Prince's Bay, Huguenot, Annadale, Great Kills, and Dongan Hills stations.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{along with}} the other Phase 1 {{stations}} along the Second Avenue Subway, contains features not found in most New York City Subway stations. It is fully <b>compliant</b> with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, containing two elevators for disabled access. Additionally, the station contains air conditioning and is waterproofed, a feature only found in newer stations. The artwork at 86th Street is Subway Portraits, a selection of twelve face portraits by painter Chuck Close.|$|E
5|$|There are radio {{stations}} broadcasting via Satellite to the United Kingdom, however these {{are aimed at}} home users for playback through their televisions since these same satellites are also used for television broadcast and usually use SES' Astra series of satellites at 28.2° east or the Eutelsat 28A satellite at 28.5° east. Radio stations broadcast free-to-air via the Sky Digital, Freesat from Sky platforms and any DVB-S <b>compliant</b> set-top box. The Freesat platform has all the BBC's national and regional digital {{radio stations}} as well as BBC London 94.9 from the launch on 6 May 2008 on the EPG.|$|E
5|$|Election {{reform is}} {{a focus of}} the Wildrose Alliance. The party proposes to set fixed {{election}} dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time. It would allow more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province's Senators rather than have them appointed by the Prime Minister. The party also plans to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA. The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care, which it claims will remain <b>compliant</b> with the Canada Health Act, as well as controls on government spending. Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties, believing climate change science remains inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily <b>compliant</b> with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less <b>compliant</b> over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E

25|$|Marine plywood can be graded {{as being}} <b>compliant</b> with BS 1088, {{which is a}} British Standard for marine plywood. There are few {{international}} standards for grading marine plywood {{and most of the}} standards are voluntary. Some marine plywood has a Lloyd's of London stamp that certifies it to be BS 1088 <b>compliant.</b> Some plywood is also labeled based on the wood used to manufacture it. Examples of this are Okoumé or Meranti.|$|E
