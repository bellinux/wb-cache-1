She was routed back to Pearl Harbor {{and attached to}} the 3d Fleet as a carrier of replacement aircraft. Seventy-two planes were loaded on board; and the ship steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, on 21 August. During the next two and one-half months, the <b>carrier</b> <b>supplied</b> replacement aircraft and pilots to Task Force (TF) 38 which was supporting the operations in the Palau and Philippine Islands.

40|$|AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with {{different}} <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layers {{are fabricated on}} Si substrate, using MOVPE growth technique. The influence of the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping concentration on the HEMT properties is investigated by Hall measurements and by electrical DC and RF characterisation of transistor devices. Hall mobility is found to decrease with increasing sheet concentration, while the gate leakage current increases. The device with the highest <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping concentration of 10 (19) cm(- 3) is provided with a GaN cap layer to reduce gate leakage. The transistors based on modulation doped layer structures show much higher DC performance than the undoped device. Best RF properties are obtained for a doping level of 5 x 10 (18) cm(- 3). High frequency measurements exhibit f(T) and f(MAX) values of 35 GHz and 37 GHz, respectively, for devices with 300 nm gate length. (C) 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{electrical}} properties of flame resistant polyethylene insulating systems, the electric conduction of chlorinated polyethylene(CPE), chlorinated paraffin(CPA), decabromodiphnylether(DBDPE) and their blends with low density polythylene(LDPE) is studied. The electric conductivity σ of CPE decreases as the halogen content ■ increases from 30 wt% to 40 wt%. This is likely due to {{a decrease in the}} mobility of ion because of an increase in internal viscosity. In CPE-LDPE blends, σ sharply increases with increasing ■ and the dielectric relaxation is observed in the ultra low frequency region, being due to an interfacial polarization of CPE and LDPE. These results can be understood by the proposed model where the blend has a two phase structure of CPE and LDPE and a part of CPE forms a conduction path. In CPA-LDPE blends, σ decreases with increasing ■. DBDPE-LDPE blends show a slight increase in σ with increasing ■. The electric conduction of CPA-LDPE and DBDPE-LDPE blends is likely due to the transport of the <b>carrier</b> <b>supplied</b> from CPA and DBDPE through LDPE, respectively. This is supported by an observation of distribution of CPA or DBDPE with an X-ray scanning microanalyser. All the data is replotted against ■ and a comparison is made between various polyethlene insulating systems...|$|E
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} undoped {{as well as}} modulation-doped AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on SiC substrate. The {{influence of}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layer on device performance is investigated by Hall, channel conductivity, small signal RF and delay time evaluation. While the doping layer improves the DC performance it degrades the RF behaviour of the device with the highest <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping of 5 x 1018 cm– 3. The channel conductivity measurements show identical dependence of the mobility on carrier concentration for all samples. The saturation velocity, extracted by evaluation of the total delay time as function of the inverse drain current, decreases from 0. 86 x 107 cm/s for the undoped device to 0. 7 x 107 cm/s for the highest doped HEMT. This result shows that the degradation of RF performance {{is due to the}} reduction of the effective saturation velocity caused by the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Excessive {{depth of}} {{optically}} active quantum wells (QWs) in III-nitride light emitters of visible range {{is one of}} the main causes of inhomogeneous carrier injection in multiplequantum-well (MQW) device active region. Deeper QWs imply stronger inhomogeneity of carrier distribution across the active region and support large residual charges of marginally located N-side and P-side QWs. Drift-diffusion transport approximation underestimates the minority <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> to marginal QWs which results in higher degree of injection inhomogeneity in transport simulation. We show that electron ballistic overshoot of narrow III-N QWs notably improves the carrier transport in MQW active region but has controversial effect on QW population uniformity.

40|$|When a thin oxide is {{subjected}} to heavy ion irradiation, a large leakage current similar to the soft breakdown can be produced. In this work, we have studied the radiation soft breakdown (RSB) after 257 MeV Ag and I irradiation by using a quantum point contact (QPC) model, which also applies to hard and soft breakdown produced by electrical stresses.
