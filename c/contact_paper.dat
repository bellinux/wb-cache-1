25|$|PFOA is also {{formed as}} an {{unintended}} byproduct {{in the production}} of fluorotelomers and is present in finished goods treated with fluorotelomers, including those intended for food contact. Fluorotelomers are applied to food contact papers because they are lipophobic: they prevent oil from soaking into the paper from fatty foods. Also, fluorotelomers can be metabolized into PFOA. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) study, lipophobic fluorotelomer-based paper coatings (which can be applied to food <b>contact</b> <b>paper</b> in the concentration range of 0.4%) were found to contain 88,000–160,000 parts per billion PFOA, while microwave popcorn bags contained 6–290 parts per billion PFOA. Toxicologists estimate that microwave popcorn could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{toxicity}} of PFOA, major U.S. manufacturers volunteered {{to phase out}} production of PFOA {{by the end of}} 2015. In addition, the use of perfluoroalkyl ethyl-containing food-contact substances are no longer allowed by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in January 2016. However, although the production of PFOA and PFOS was reduced, the production of fluorotelomer-based chemicals applied to food <b>contact</b> <b>papers</b> is still increasing. Some compounds, such as polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants (PAPs) or fluorotelomers (FTOH), have been used in some brands of microwave popcorn bags. Those compounds are precursors of PFCAs, and evidence shows that they are more toxic than PFCAs themselves. Furthermore, they may also be degraded to PFCAs, and therefore leading to the increase of PFCAs concentrations in the environment and generating adverse effects.|$|R

Before European contact, the most common media were wood (often Western red cedar), stone, and copper; since European <b>contact,</b> <b>paper,</b> canvas, glass, and precious metals have also been used. If paint is used, the most common colours are red and black, but yellow is also often used, particularly among Kwakwaka'wakw artists. Chilkat weaving applies formline designs to textiles. Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian have traditionally produced Chilkat woven regalia, from wool and yellow cedar bark, that is important for civic and ceremonial events, including potlatches.|$|E

5000|$|Tools {{used to make}} {{marks in}} the glass include diamond point scribers, a {{flexible}} shaft power tool with a diamond bit and a sandblaster. Littleton Studios printer Sandy Willcox and her husband David Lewis, a painter, are credited with discovering that white lithograph ink is a versatile resist for sandblasting intaglio glass plates. They found that the viscous white ink, applied to the plate freely with a brush or evenly with a roller, can be drawn into by removing ink with wooden styluses, needles, or paintbrushes. When the drawing is complete, the plate is taken to the sandblasting booth wet. There, the initial onslaught of sand sticks to those areas of the image where ink remains (forming an even more resistant barrier) while etching {{those parts of the}} glass revealed by the hand of the artist. After the plate is cleaned of ink, the parts of the plate that received the blast can be seen to have minute pits that hold ink; the areas that were protected by the white litho ink remain smooth and are wiped clean before printing. <b>Contact</b> <b>paper</b> and tape are also used on the plates as a sandblasting resist; those materials create imagery with a hard-edged, stencil effect. Diluted hydrofluoric acid can be brushed onto the plate to create areas of very delicate tone.|$|E

There was a good attendance of members. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year:—President, the Hon A. C. Gregory; vice-presidents, Professor Pepper, and Mr. J. W. Sutton secretary, Mr. J. R. Hall; committee, Messrs.Rickardo, Lyons, and Service." [...] From the beginning Sutton was often availing his steamers to be used to take members along the Brisbane river for photo shoots, as seen from The Brisbane Courier 17 Feb 1885: [...] "The chairman (Sutton on this occasion) notified his intention of taking the members down the Bay, probably on Saturday next, for the purpose of giving them an opportunity to exhibit their skill in [...] "snapping" [...] pretty glimpses of river scenery." [...] In these early days many of the society meetings were held at the Sutton household: Brisbane Courier 25 Jan 1886. [...] "A MEETING of the Queensland Photographic Society was held on Saturday evening at Mr. J.W. Sutton's house. Mr. Sutton, who is vice-president, took the chair..... Mr Sutton very kindly placed his large veranda at the disposal of the members, together with the use of his dark-room for practical demonstrations on the nights of meeting, and also his optical lanterns for exhibitions of transparencies, which generous offer was accepted with a hearty vote of thanks." [...] The Telegraph 17 Mar 1886: [...] "The monthly meeting of the Queensland Photographic Society was held at Mr. J. W.Sutton's house on Monday evening. That gentleman presided....... Mr. Sutton exhibited specimens of prints done with Morgan and Kidd's <b>contact</b> <b>paper,</b> and promised to give a practical demonstration of the process on the next meeting night."The Brisbane Courier 27 July 1886: [...] "A CONVERSAZIONE was held last night at the School of Arts by the Queensland Photographic Society to celebrate the first anniversary of their formation..... The society, which had just completed its first year, at first encountered great difficulties, but through the kindness of several of their members - notably Mr. J. W. Sutton, who had placed many facilities they could not otherwise have obtained at their disposal, they had been very successful. The society now numbered 133 members, and had a satisfactory balance at the bank at its disposal."The Brisbane Courier 1887: The second annual conversazione of the Queensland Photographic Society was held lastnight in the lecture hall of the Y.M.C.A. with great success...At 9 o'clock Mr J.
