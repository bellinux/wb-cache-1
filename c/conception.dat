40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{categorize}} 35 Ethiopian undergraduate physics students’ alternative <b>conceptions</b> in the concepts of electric potential and energy. A descriptive qualitative research design was used to categorize the students’ alternative <b>conceptions.</b> Four independently homogeneous ability focus groups were formed to elicit the students’ conceptual perceptions. A five stage thematic (categorical) framework analysis – familiarization, identifying a thematic framework, coding, charting and interpretation – was made to analyze data of the focus group discussions. The categories of alternative <b>conceptions</b> were based on the students’ epistemological and ontological descriptions of the concepts investigated. Consequently, the following categories were diagnosed: naive physics, lateral alternative <b>conceptions,</b> ontological alternative <b>conceptions,</b> Ohm’s p-primes, mixed <b>conceptions</b> and loose ideas. The extensiveness of the alternative <b>conceptions</b> from the epistemological and ontological perspectives was comparable and considerable. The naïve physics and lateral alternative <b>conceptions</b> were more extensive than the others. The alternative <b>conceptions</b> were less frequently and inconsistently revealed within and across the categories. In general, it was concluded that the categories have common characteristics of diversified distribution of alternative <b>conceptions</b> and multiple alternative <b>conceptions</b> of specific concepts within and across the categories. Finally, instructional and theoretical implications are forwarded...|$|R

40|$|Effectiveness of {{teaching}} reflects interplay {{among a number}} of teacher-variables prominent among which is the teacher’s <b>conceptions</b> {{of teaching}} and learning. In educational institutions where teachers are educated, the influence of these <b>conceptions</b> on effectiveness is geometric. This is because teacher educators are teachers of teachers and most teachers teach the way they were taught. Two major <b>conceptions</b> of teaching (traditionalist/transmissive and contemporary/constructivist) have been delineated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a majority of teacher educators in Colleges of Education, Delta State Nigeria have contemporary/constructivist <b>conceptions</b> of teaching, and if teacher variables (qualification, discipline and experience) would influence their <b>conceptions.</b> A customized instrument was administered to 179 teacher educators selected through the use of cluster sampling technique.

40|$|As a concept, {{heritage}} {{building is}} young and previously undefined in Finnish scientific literature. Earlier studies {{about the very}} notions of heritage building are also nonexistent in Finland. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the <b>conceptions</b> of students in teacher training about heritage building before and after a study module on heritage building, which constitutes a part of their subject studies in didactics of crafts. The lack of previous studies about <b>conceptions</b> of heritage building in Finland led to the selection of these <b>conceptions</b> as a research target. The study uses two different approaches for achieving its purpose. In order to find answers to the research problem, the students' common <b>conceptions</b> about heritage building were examined first. Secondly, it was considered how structured these <b>conceptions</b> were. Therefore, the research process included a conceptual review of heritage building to provide a baseline for comparing the student's <b>conceptions</b> and their structuredness. The research results indicate that even though students in didactics of handicrafts have <b>conceptions</b> about heritage building that are parallel with the definition formulated for the purposes of the study, they are superficial on average. The review of structuredness of <b>conceptions</b> supported the results achieved in the phenomenographical analysis of <b>conceptions.</b> It was observed that completing the study module had an impact on the structuredness of <b>conceptions.</b> Furthermore, the students' personal background was found to have some implications on how structured their <b>conceptions</b> of heritage building were, which was evidenced by notable differences in structuredness of <b>conceptions</b> on an individual level.

This study was undertaken to gain knowledge of the relation between children's <b>conceptions</b> and their representation of these <b>conceptions</b> in drawings. A theory of contextualization was the basis for finding out how children related their contextualization of <b>conceptions</b> in conceptual frameworks to their contextualization of drawings in pictorial convention. Eighteen children were interviewed in a semi-structured method while they were drawing the Earth. Audio-recorded interviews, drawings and notes were analysed to find the cognitive and cultural intentions behind the drawings. Also, even children who demonstrated alternative <b>conceptions</b> of the Earth in the interviews still followed cultural conventions in their drawings. Thus, these alternative <b>conceptions</b> could not be deduced from the drawings. The results indicate that children's drawings can be used to grasp children's <b>conceptions</b> only by considering the meaning the children themselves give to their own drawings...|$|R

Because of {{students}} {{wide variety of}} experiences, each concept will hold a somewhat different meaning for each student. The general meaning of some <b>conceptions</b> will be shared, while others will be unique. Many of the <b>conceptions</b> are scientific misconceptions associated with intuitive ideas or preconceptions acquired prior to school (Driver, 1987).

We constructed a Learning Inventory, and administered this to teachers in Dutch senior secondary education, where an innovation is heading for more independent learning.

Tolerance of uncertainty explained the other four dimensions in <b>conceptions</b> of student learning, but not in teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of their own learning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Prospective {{teachers}} enter {{teacher education}} programs with previously formed <b>conceptions</b> of geometry and its teaching. These <b>conceptions</b> help them make sense of new information about teaching, their roles as teachers, and their translation of mathematics into learning activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationships among preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry, <b>conceptions</b> of teaching geometry and classroom practices. Ten preservice mathematics teachers completed a card sort task with an interview. They also participated in a videotape task which consisted of viewing three experienced geometry teachers on videotape. Four of these preservice teachers were observed eight times each during their professional internship experience. All interviews and observations were videotaped and transcribed for data analysis. Results of this study indicated a complex relationship between the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry and <b>conceptions</b> of teaching geometry. The preservice teachers could not discuss their <b>conceptions</b> of geometry without discussing the teaching of geometry. Their <b>conceptions</b> about geometry and their belief that geometry was linear, in nature were so strong that these views became connected with their views of teaching geometry. Clearly, the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry influenced their <b>conceptions</b> of teaching geometry and the teaching of subject matter influenced the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry as well. The relationship between the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry and their classroom practices was directly influenced by the textbooks used. They believed geometry was ordered according to the textbook and their classroom practices also followed the textbook. The relationship of the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> of geometry teaching to classroom practices indicated that what the preservice teachers said they believed and what they did in the classroom were not always consistent. Their beliefs about teaching geometry rarely emerged in their classroom practices. Finally, these preservice teachers had an overwhelming concern with classroom management.

However, specific relationships between teachers’ research <b>conceptions</b> and research integration practices have not been fully documented. This paper focuses on teachers’ contextualized research <b>conceptions</b> as a mediator between teachers’ general research <b>conceptions</b> and teaching practices. Contextualized research <b>conceptions</b> are teachers’ interpretations of their general research <b>conceptions,</b> taking into account their teaching context. In particular, the paper focuses on teachers’ contextualized research <b>conceptions</b> of ‘Critical Thinking’ (CT), as this is a prominent attribute of teachers’ general research <b>conceptions.</b> Participants were 79 teachers from five teaching-intensive institutions in higher education. From their teaching context, teachers interpreted CT in four different manners: (1) Critical attitude towards oneself, (2) Critical attitude towards information, (3) Conscious of the perspective of others, and (4) Able to handle uncertainty. This diversity in interpretations of CT highlights the difficulties in finding relationships between teachers’ general research <b>conceptions</b> and research integration practices when a general definition of CT is started from and teachers’ contextualized understanding of CTs are not includedstatus: publishe...|$|R
