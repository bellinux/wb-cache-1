50|$|To prevent <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>flutter</b> (aeroelastic flutter), {{the center}} of lift of the control surface should be behind {{the center of}} gravity of that surface. To achieve this, lead weights may be added {{to the front of the}} aileron. In some {{aircraft}} the aileron construction may be too heavy to allow this system to work without huge weight increases. In this case, the weight may be added to a lever arm to move the weight well out in front to the aileron body. These balance weights are tear drop shaped (to reduce drag), which make them appear quite different from spades, although both project forward and below the aileron. In addition to reducing flutter, mass balances also reduce the stick forces required to move the control surface in flight.|$|E

50|$|In total, twenty-four Tipsy B and Bc {{aircraft}} {{were built}} at Avions Fairey {{before the invasion}} of Belgium by Germany in World War II. About eight had open cockpits (Tipsy B) and the rest were enclosed (Tipsy Bc). The Tipsy {{seems to have been}} mostly nice to fly but, as with other aircraft with pointed wing tips, its low speed behaviour could be unforgiving, dropping a wing at the stall without much warning. During the British production run, some of these issues were addressed.The fourth British aircraft was the first to be modified. To improve the stalling behaviour, it had a strengthened wing with washout at the tips, so that this part of the wing should not stall first, and camber-changing flaps were added to the straight centre section to delay the stall. To meet British airworthiness concerns about <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>flutter,</b> all were mass-balanced. The rudder balance was external, projecting from its leading edge just above the tip of the fin. The elevator was also revised to a single unit with a straight hinge and trailing edge, and the bottom of the rudder slightly cropped to allow it to move. Subsequent British Tipsys included these changes, and from the sixth aircraft onwards also featured fixed letter box slots. In August 1938, during the Certificate of Airworthiness tests at Martlesham Heath, there were concerns about rudder authority, so Tipsy Light Aircraft added 18% to the rudder area, leading to successful certification. At that point, the name of the aircraft changed from Tipsy B to Tipsy Trainer. The ninth aircraft was approved at an increased all up-weight of 1,200 lb (544 kg), and from then on the name was revised to Tipsy Trainer 1.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design tool based on computational methods for the aerostructural analysis and optimization of aircraft layouts at the conceptual design stage. The whole methodology {{is based upon}} the integration of geometry construction and aerodynamic and structural analysis codes that combine depictive, computational, analytical, and semiempirical methods validated in an aircraft design environment. The main module for structural sizing and numerical aeroelastic analysis, named NeoCASS (next-generation conceptual aerostructural sizing suite), is presented here. The numerical kernel handling the aerostructural interaction enables the creation of efficient low-order high-fidelity models that are particularly suitable within a multidisciplinary design optimization framework to drive the optimization tool in the most appropriate direction. This makes it possible to address adverse aeroelastic issues, such as divergence, <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> reversal, <b>flutter,</b> and increased drag at cruise speed due to structural deformation. All of these issues generally lead to considerable changes in the structural design, which in turn might pose limitations on the flight envelope or weight penalties. The late discovery of these types of issues may result in significant cost increases and, in some cases, it may lead to the termination of the project. To overcome and remove these issues, the influence of structural deformation on flight and handling performances, of weight, and of design costs needs {{to be taken into account}} as early as possible in the design process...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of Synthetic Jet Actuators (SJAs) on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provides a safe test-bed {{for analysis of}} improved performance, {{in the hope of}} certification of this technology on commercial aircraft in the future. The use of high resolution numerical methods (i. e. CFD) to capture the details of the effects of SJAs on flows and on the hosting lifting surface are computationally expensive and time-consuming, which renders them ineffective for use in real-time flow control implementations. Suitable alternatives include the use of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to capture the lower resolution overall effects of the jets on the flow and the hosting structure. This research paper analyses the effects of SJAs on aircraft wings using a ROM for the purpose of determining the unsteady aerodynamic forces modified by the presence of the SJAs. The model developed is a 3 D unsteady panel code where the jets are represented by source panels. This code has the ability to model thick 3 D trapezoidal wings with sweep and dihedral, accepting any aerofoil coordinate file. Multiple rows of SJAs can also be applied where desired. In order to validate the panel code, comparisons are made with past experimental data and other numerical methods like the vortex lattice method and CFD. There is avenue for further work in implementing a robust control architecture around SJA technologies, which in the future could serve as replacements for traditional hinged flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and <b>flutter</b> suppression solutions...|$|R

40|$|Systems {{to provide}} {{improved}} tactile feedback to aircraft pilots {{are being developed}} to help the pilots maintain harmony between their control actions and the positions of aircraft <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> thereby helping to prevent loss of control. A system of this type, denoted a loss-of-control-inhibitor system (LOCIS) can be implemented as a relatively simple addition to almost any pre-existing flight-control system. The LOCIS concept offers at least a partial {{solution to the problem}} of (1) keeping a pilot aware of the state of the control system and the aircraft and (2) maintaining sufficient control under conditions that, as described below, have been known to lead to loss of control. Current commercial aircraft exhibit uneven responses of primary flight-control surfaces to aggressive pilot control commands, leading to deterioration of pilots ability to control their aircraft. In severe cases, this phenomenon can result in loss of control and consequent loss of aircraft. For an older aircraft equipped with a purely mechanical control system, the loss of harmony between a pilot s command action and the control- surface response can be attributed to compliance in the control system (caused, for example, by stretching of control cables, flexing of push rods, or servo-valve distortion). In a newer aircraft equipped with a fly-by-wire control system, the major contributions to loss of harmony between the pilot and the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> are delays attributable to computer cycle time, control shaping, filtering, aliasing, servo-valve distortion, and actuator rate limiting. In addition, a fly-by-wire control system provides no tactile feedback that would enable the pilot to sense such features of the <b>control</b> state as <b>surface</b> <b>flutter,</b> <b>surface</b> jam, position limiting, actuator rate limiting, and control limiting imposed by the aircraft operational envelope. Hence, for example, when a pilot is involved in aggressive closed-loop maneuvering, as when encountering a wake-vortex upset on final landing approach, the control-surface delay can lead to loss of control. Aggressive piloting can be triggered and exacerbated by control-system anomalies, which the pilot cannot diagnose because of the lack of symptoms caused by the absence of feedback through the controls. The purpose served by a LOCIS is to counteract these adverse effects by providing real-time feedback that notifies the pilot that the aircraft is tending to lag the pilot s commands. A LOCIS (see figure) includes cockpit control input-position sensors, control-surface output-position sensors, variable dampers (for example, shock absorbers containing magneto-rheological fluids such that the damping forces can be varied within times of the order of milliseconds by varying applied magnetic fields) attached to the cockpit control levers, electromagnet coils to apply the magnetic fields, and feedback control circuits to drive the electromagnet coils. The feedback control gains are chosen so that the current applied to each electromagnet coil results in a damping force that increases in a suitable nonlinear manner (e. g., exponentially) with the difference between the actual and commanded positions of the affected <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The increasing damping force both alerts the pilot to the onset of a potentially dangerous situation and resists the pilot s effort to command a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> to change position at an excessive rat...|$|R
40|$|As {{a portion}} of the Benchmark Models Program at NASA Langley, a simple generic model was {{developed}} for active controls research and was called BACT for Benchmark Active Controls Technology model. This model was based on the previously-tested Benchmark Models rectangular wing with the NACA 0012 airfoil section that was mounted on the Pitch and Plunge Apparatus (PAPA) for flutter testing. The BACT model had an upper surface spoiler, a lower surface spoiler, and a trailing edge <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> for use in flutter suppression and dynamic response excitation. Previous experience with flutter suppression indicated a need for measured <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> aerodynamics for accurate control law design. Three different types of flutter instability boundaries had also been determined for the NACA 0012 /PAPA model, a classical flutter boundary, a transonic stall flutter boundary at angle of attack, and a plunge instability near M = 0. 9. Therefore an extensive set of steady and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> oscillation data was generated spanning the range of the three types of instabilities. This information was subsequently used to design control laws to suppress each flutter instability. There have been three tests of the BACT model. The objective of the first test, TDT Test 485, was to generate a data set of steady and unsteady <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> effectiveness data, and to determine the open loop dynamic characteristics of the control systems including the actuators. Unsteady pressures, loads, and transfer functions were measured. The other two tests, TDT Test 502 and TDT Test 5 18, were primarily oriented towards active controls research, but some data supplementary to the first test were obtained. Dynamic response of the flexible system to <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> excitation and open loop flutter characteristics were determined during Test 502. Loads were not measured during the last two tests. During these tests, a database of over 3000 data sets was obtained. A reasonably extensive subset of the data sets from the first two tests have been chosen for Test Cases for computational comparisons concentrating on static conditions and cases with harmonically oscillating <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Several <b>flutter</b> Test Cases from both tests have also been included. Some aerodynamic comparisons with the BACT data have been made using computational fluid dynamics codes at the Navier-Stokes level (and in the accompanying chapter SC). Some mechanical and active control studies have been presented. In this report several Test Cases are selected to illustrate trends for a variety of different conditions with emphasis on transonic flow effects. Cases for static angles of attack, static trailing-edge and upper-surface spoiler deflections are included for a range of conditions near those for the oscillation cases. Cases for trailing-edge control and upper-surface spoiler oscillations for a range of Mach numbers, angle of attack, and static control deflections are included. Cases for all three types of flutter instability are selected. In addition some cases are included for dynamic response measurements during forced oscillations of the controls on the flexible mount. An overview of the model and tests is given, and the standard formulary for these data is listed. Some sample data and sample results of calculations are presented. Only the static pressures and the first harmonic real and imaginary parts of the pressures are included in the data for the Test Cases, but digitized time histories have been archived.
