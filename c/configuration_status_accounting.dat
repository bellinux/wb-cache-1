Shortridge, Doctor of Education, 2015 Dissertation {{directed}} by: 	Dr. William Strein Department of Counseling, Higher Education, and Special Education As accountability {{efforts in}} education have increased, {{there has been}} an increased interest in the significance of effective instructional leadership. Policymakers have looked toward school-based leadership as a means to positively impact student achievement and to close the achievement gap. This political reliance on school-based leadership to accomplish the goals of school improvement can be seen in No Child Left Behind. The present research was {{based on the premise that}} specific leadership behaviors have been found to impact students' academic outcomes. The academic literature supports the view that school-based leadership influences student achievement. The purpose of the research was to examine the impact of middle school principals' leadership styles on students' academic achievement. Particularly, the study analyzed the leadership styles of middle schools principals that headed schools that have met or not met their school achievement indicators (AMO). Employing MLQ survey, the researcher examined principals' leadership styles. Moreover, the study examined whether AMO outcomes differed based on the principals' self-identifying characteristics of: age, gender, totals years of experience as principal, and years of experience in education. Transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leadership styles were singled out for investigation and these specific leadership styles were analyzed within the content of student achievement outcomes. Consequently, it was found that AMO <b>status</b> <b>accounted</b> for 22. 4 % of the variability in leadership style taken together; while AMO <b>status</b> <b>accounted</b> for 7. 6 % of the variability related to transformational leadership; and AMO <b>status</b> <b>accounted</b> for 5. 7 % of the variability on transactional leadership, laissez-faire had nearly no relationship...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} within {{philosophy}} that the ontology of institutions can be captured {{in terms of}} constitutive rules. What exactly such rules are, however, is not well understood. They are usually contrasted to regulative rules: constitutive rules (such as the rules of chess) make institutional actions possible, whereas regulative rules (such as the rules of etiquette) pertain to actions that can be performed independently of such rules. Some, however, maintain that the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules is merely a linguistic one. In this paper I present the <b>status</b> <b>account</b> of constitutive rules {{in order to address}} this criticism. According to the <b>status</b> <b>account</b> constitutive rules pertain to institutional statuses and statuses are to be understood in terms of status rules. Status rules concern the enabling and constraining roles of institutions, and constitutive rules specify the preconditions that have to be met {{in order for them to}} play these roles. Even though I end up endorsing the claim that the distinction mentioned is a linguistic one, I go on to argue that there is an underlying reality that constitutive rules serve to make apparent...|$|R
40|$|The Configuration Management Plan for the Tank Farm Contractor {{describes}} {{configuration management}} the contractor uses {{to manage and}} integrate its technical baseline with the programmatic and functional operations to perform work. The Configuration Management Plan for the Tank Farm Contractor supports {{the management of the}} project baseline by providing the mechanisms to identify, document, and control the technical characteristics of the products, processes, and structures, systems, and components (SSC). This plan is one of the tools used to identify and provide controls for the technical baseline of the Tank Farm Contractor (TFC). The configuration management plan is listed in the management process documents for TFC as depicted in Attachment 1, TFC Document Structure. The configuration management plan is an integrated approach for control of technical, schedule, cost, and administrative processes necessary to manage the mission of the TFC.

Thus, the details of data management and storage methods for the project were reviewed and proposed as follows. (1) Source codes: all the programs are stored in a server. The researchers back up the storage once a month. One copy will be delivered to the project manager, and one will be kept by the researchers. (2)Electronic files and execution files: Electronic files and execution files are stored in removable disks. The researchers back up the files once a month. Both the project manager and the researchers will keep one backup copy of the files. (3) Emails related to the project: The name of the project is added to each email related to the project. A carbon copy (cc) of each email related to the project will be forwarded to the project computer technician for backup. (4) Paper document: The paper document is kept by the researchers. Secondly, the goal of configuration management is to “build” and “maintain” consistency in works. To achieve this goal, we suggested taking the following measures: Configuration identification, Configuration control, <b>Configuration</b> <b>status</b> <b>accounting,</b> and Configuration audits. In this research, these measures were assisted by free open source CVS tool (Concurrent Versions System 2012).|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{the forest}} site survey data were {{evaluated}} {{in order to}} compare the average water and nutrient supply status of the whole study areas with the water and nutrient supply status at the charcoal kiln sites. Concerning the water supply status, we found significant differences when conducting these comparisons. In the Reinhardswald, most of the charcoal kiln sites are located both on fresh (57  %) and markedly fresh (26  %) soils, while fresh (49  %) and markedly fresh (14  %) soils are much less common throughout the whole Reinhardswald area. On the contrary, periodically moist soils, which occupy 23  % of the whole Reinhardswald area, are significantly under-represented at charcoal kiln sites with a portion of 6  %. Comparable patterns {{were found in the}} Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, where fresh (30  %) and particularly fresh (13  %) soils are significantly over-represented at charcoal kiln sites. Throughout the whole National Park area, these water supply <b>statuses</b> <b>account</b> for 18 and 6  %, respectively. Moderately fresh (42  %) and moderately dry (11  %) soils are also relatively common at charcoal kiln sites.
