5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority <b>candidates</b> as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority <b>candidates</b> resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority <b>candidates</b> believing that minority <b>candidates</b> have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority <b>candidates,</b> and only vote for <b>candidates</b> with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which platforms are partially binding: a <b>candidate</b> who implements a policy different from his platform must pay a cost of betrayal that increases {{with the size of}} the discrepancy. I also suppose that voters are uncertain about <b>candidate</b> preferences for policies. If voters believe that a <b>candidate</b> is likely to be extreme, there exists a semi-separating equilibrium: an extreme <b>candidate</b> mimics a moderate <b>candidate</b> with some probability, and with the remaining probability, he announces a platform that is more moderate than a moderate <b>candidate’s</b> platform. Although an extreme <b>candidate</b> will implement a more extreme policy than a moderate <b>candidate</b> in equilibrium, partial pooling ensures that voters prefer an extreme <b>candidate</b> who does not pretend to be moderate over an uncertain <b>candidate</b> announcing a moderate <b>candidate’s</b> platform. As a result, an extreme <b>candidate</b> may have a higher probability of winning than a moderate one...|$|R

5|$|The {{agreement}} between the Navy and the USCG (noted earlier), required the initial classes of SPAR officer <b>candidates</b> to receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts; officially known as the United States Naval Reserve (WR) Midshipmen's School.
