A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> considered legal checks, substitute <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> {{subject to}} existing check {{laws and regulations}}. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
30|$|Yamanouchi et al. [11] {{reported}} that the total widths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among the six sugi cultivars, {{but they did not}} discuss the factors affecting the differences. In this study, the total lengths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among cultivars (Fig.  2; Table  3). The total length of the surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> positively correlated with the tangential shrinkage when all surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> included, and was correlated with tangential and radial shrinkage when the short-end <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> excluded. On the other hand, the total length of surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio or the BD. This result suggests that the surface-check variation among cultivars is affected by tangential shrinkage, which varies among cultivars due to the variation in MFA [7].|$|R

25|$|The chief {{difference}} between women's and men's ice hockey <b>is</b> that body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed in}} women's hockey.

5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{reasons of}} efficiency, {{in almost all}} {{implementations}} of Prolog the occur <b>check</b> <b>is</b> left out. This a mechanism should protect the program against introducing circular bindings of variables.

In this paper a semantics of Prolog without occur <b>check</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The new kind of resolution, i. e. SLD-resolution without occur <b>check,</b> <b>is</b> referred to as CSLD-resolution. Important theorems such as soundness and completeness of both CSLD-resolution and the “negation as failure” rule, are established...|$|R

Sometimes the term is extended to cover cases in which the king moves out of check and reveals a discovered check from another piece (this is also known as a royal check); it does not generally apply to cases where the original <b>checking</b> piece <b>is</b> captured, but it does apply to cases where the <b>check</b> <b>is</b> actually a checkmate (since there's no term [...] "cross-checkmate").|$|R
