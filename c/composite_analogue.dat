The current study simulated a laboratory torsional fracture test of a <b>composite</b> <b>analogue</b> tibia with vacant screw holes by using a finite element (FE) model, and {{the results from the}} simulation were compared to those obtained experimentally. Variations of the FE model were also analyzed to investigate the effects of failure model, screw holes, element size, rotation direction, and simplification of the model's geometry. This FE model was set up the same as the experimental torsion test, with a section from the distal portion of the tibia. The proximal end of the section was subjected to an axial load and rotated, while the distal end was fixed. The FE model contained 102, 126 first order tetrahedral elements and 24, 817 nodes, and it utilized an isotropic linear elastic material law with material properties obtained from the <b>composite</b> <b>analogue</b> manufacturer. Comparisons between the FE model variations considered the fracture torque, fracture angle, torsional stiffness, principal stress contour, and maximum shear stress contour.

40|$|Background: Newer {{generation}} intramedullary (IM) tibial nails provide several distal interlocking screw options. The {{objectives were}} to determine: 1) {{if the new}} oblique interlocking option provides superior stability, 2) which screw orientation/ configuration is the most biomechanically stable, and 3) if three distal interlocking screws provide better stability. Methods: A preliminary experiment was performed in torsion, compression, and bending tests with four different screw configurations: (I) one medial-to-lateral and one oblique, (II) two me-dial-to-lateral, (III) one medial-to-lateral and one anterior-to-posterior, and (IV) one medial-to-lateral, one anterior-to-posterior and one oblique in simu-lated distal metaphyseal fracture tibiae. Twenty- four Synthes EXPERT tibial IM nails were used for six specimens of each screw configuration. Parts I and II, tibial IM nails were locked with 5. 0 mm in-terlocking screws into simulated distal tibiae (PVC and <b>composite</b> <b>analogue</b> tibia). Part III, the two most stable configurations were tested using five pairs of simulated cadaveric distal tibiae metaphy-seal fractures.

50|$|However, {{this color}} space {{conversion}} is lossy, particularly obvious in crosstalk from the luma to the chroma-carrying wire, and vice versa, in analogue equipment (including RCA connectors to transfer a digital signal, as all they carry is <b>analogue</b> <b>composite</b> video, which is either YUV, YIQ, or even CVBS).

The major solid components of human bone are collagen (a natural polymer, also found in skin and tendons) and a substituted hydroxyapatite (a natural ceramic, also found in teeth).

A finite element analysis model of the proximal femur subjected to gait loading was generated from a CT scan of an <b>analogue</b> <b>composite</b> femur, and its predicted mechanical behaviour was compared to an experimental model. Where previous studies have employed strain gauging to obtain discreet point data for validation, in this study DIC was used for full field quantified comparison of the predicted and experimentally measured strains.

The sensitivity and repeatability of the strain measurements were comparable to or better than values reported in the literature for other DIC tests on tissue specimens. The experimental-model correlation was in the same range as values obtained from strain gauging, but the DIC technique produced more detailed, full field data and is potentially easier to use. As such, the findings supported the validity of the model generation process, giving greater confidence in the model’s predictions, and Digital Image Correlation was demonstrated as a useful tool for validation of biomechanical models...|$|R
40|$|Cacti (Cactaceae) {{represent}} {{a family of}} highly specialized angiosperm plants with a native range of distribution restricted to the American continents. Columnar cacti of the sub-family Cactoideae evolved in adaptation to their arid or semi-arid habitats characteristics that distinguish them from most other dicot plants, e. g. the stem succulence with a strongly vascularized storage parenchyma {{and the presence of}} the spine wearing areoles. Although cacti have been in cultivation since the discovery of America, some studies even suggest the agricultural use in pre-colombian times, and many scientific investigations were carried out on the functional morphology and anatomy with regard to biomechanical adaptations of the found structures, no research focused on the branch-stem attachment. The most conspicuous features of such a ramification are the pronounced constrictions at the branch-stem junctions that are also present in the lignified vascular structures within the succulent cortex. Based on Finite Element Analyses of ramification models it could be demonstrated that these indentations in the region of high flexural and torsional stresses are not regions of structural weakness, e. g. allowing vegetative propagation. On the contrary, they can be regarded as anatomical adaptations to increase the stability by fine-tuning the stress state and stress directions in the junction along prevalent fiber directions. The development of the woody support structure within the succulent cortex of the parental shoot {{can be traced back to}} the leaf and bud traces of the dormant axillary buds. Surprisingly, these initials also develop into another woody structure supporting the flowers of the cacti. As these two support structures differ significantly in their macroscopic and microscopic anatomy and as they develop from the same initial state as leaf/bud traces, another objective of this work was to analyze the secondary growth of the two structures with traditional botanic investigation methods. The results of these investigations reveal a wood dimorphism consisting of an early parenchymatous phase followed later by fibrous wood in both kind of support structure. In vegetative branches, the woody support structures have the typical ringlike arrangement as found in the stele of the parental shoot, whereas the flower support structures have a reticular arrangement of interconnected woody strands. This fundamentally different anatomy of the support structures results from the formation of an interfascicular cambium between the leaf/bud traces when a vegetative branch forms or its absence in the case of a flower. After shedding light on the functional morphology and anatomy of the cactus ramification and their development the question arises if the found load adaptation strategies may serve to improve technical fiber <b>composite</b> structures <b>analogue</b> to the design recommendation developed from the biomechanical analyses of tree ramifications. Such a biomimetic transfer from the cactus ramification as biological role model to a technical implementation and the adaptation of the fine-tuned geometric shape and arrangement of lignified strengthening tissues might contribute to the development of alternative concepts for branched fiber-reinforced composite structures within a limited design space...|$|R

A dc tie line is asynchronous {{in that the}} power transfer over it is not inherently dependent upon {{the relationship between the}} frequencies at the two ends of the line. Auxiliary control is required to control the power flow over a dc line. This control can be made to initiate required power flow charges over the line in response t a number of system operating conditions including tie line power, tie line current, receiving and/or sending end frequency. The purpose of this thesis is to illustrate the application of some analytical techniques which can be used to study the small signal control characteristics of ac systems interconnected by a dc line, the power level of which is controlled as a function of sending and receiving end frequency deviations. The required analytical models are given for the sending and receiving end ac systems. The analytical model for the dc line and its controller are derived. These models are then expressed in transfer function and state variable form.

40|$|Mesoporous silica {{supported}} {{cobalt oxide}} composites have attracted enormous attention {{due to their}} wide range of applications, especially in the catalysis field. The focus of this thesis concerns the preparation of mesoporous silica SBA- 15 supported cobalt oxide species and the evaluation of their catalytic activities for liquid phase oxidation of various alcohols and olefins. The impact of different variables such as preparation method, metal precursor, metal loading and dopant was investigated on the morphology and dispersion of the active particles, the overall structure of the resulting composite materials and their catalytic activity. The first section of the thesis concerns the use of Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O as a precursor. Various amounts of Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O were deposited on SBA- 15 using the “two-solvent” method. This method accommodates cobalt oxide species exclusively inside the pores of SBA- 15. Analogous composite materials were also prepared using the more conventional methods of impregnation and adsorption. Irrespective of preparation method, all the composite materials were black. The two-solvent method resulted {{in the formation of}} crystalline cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4) nanorods which filled adjacent mesopores to form patches incorporating all the cobalt available. In the case of composites prepared via impregnation cobalt oxide particles formed both on the external and internal surfaces of the SBA- 15, also incorporating all the available cobalt. When adsorption was used as a preparation method, cobalt oxide species were predominantly formed inside the pores of SBA- 15, however not all the cobalt available in solution was incorporated. All the composites were characterised by N 2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, TPR, ICP-MS, FTIR, DR UV-vis, SEM, TEM, STEM and elemental mapping. The size of the crystalline Co 3 O 4 patches was measured using the XRD diffraction patterns and Scherrer equation. The lattice fringes of Co 3 O 4 were also observed in HRTEM images. The catalytic activity of the composite materials in liquid phase oxidation of various substrates was determined by GC and GC-MS. It was found that for the composite materials prepared by the “two-solvent” method, the catalytic activity varied in reverse proportion to the cobalt loading and that the composite with the lowest amount of cobalt exhibited the highest catalytic activity. This was attributed to the morphology of the cobalt oxide species and the way they were dispersed throughout the SBA- 15. As the cobalt loading increased, more pores became blocked due to the elongation of the Co 3 O 4 nanorods inside the pores and, thus, a lower proportion of the cobalt was accessible by the reactants. The composite prepared via adsorption also demonstrated high catalytic activity {{as a result of the}} relatively good dispersion of Co 3 O 4 and, hence, its accessibility by the reactants. The composite prepared via impregnation exhibited the lowest catalytic activity compared to the <b>analogue</b> <b>composites</b> with the same cobalt loading prepared either by the two-solvent method or adsorption. This is attributed to the formation of large cobalt clusters (poor dispersion) mostly on the external surfaces of SBA- 15 on the aperture of the pores. The composites prepared via the two-solvent method could be reused up to at least three times without significant changes in their catalytic activities. In the second section of the thesis SBA- 15 was loaded with various amounts of CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O via the two-solvent method, impregnation and adsorption. Regardless of the preparation method a blue coloration with intensity proportional to the cobalt loading was observed for the composites. The suite of characterisation techniques (see above) was applied to investigate the morphology, dispersion and chemistry of the incorporated cobalt as well as the structure of the composites. The cobalt oxide species were found to exist as an amorphous phase which was highly dispersed throughout the SBA- 15, presumably due to the interaction between Co 2 + ions and the silica surface. A comparison of composites shows that the micropores became progressively more blocked as the cobalt loading was increased, but the mesopore volume was reduced only marginally. For the series of composites prepared via the two-solvent method, an unexpected morphological transformation was observed when the cobalt loading was 30 wt% or beyond. This transformation happened during the calcination step of the preparation and resulted in the collapse of the highly ordered mesoporous channels of SBA- 15. It is suggested that the interaction between incorporated Co 2 + ions and the oxygen of the silica walls at high cobalt loadings, is what leads to this transformation during calcination. The catalytic activity of these composite materials was evaluated for liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexanol. For the series prepared by the two-solvent method, it was found that the composite with lowest cobalt loading again showed the highest catalytic activity. However, the composite which experienced the morphological transformation (Co 30 wt%) showed only slightly lower catalytic activity compared to other composites. This suggests that although the surface area decreased substantially, the catalytically active species remained accessible to the reactants. It was confirmed that the oxidation reaction did not occur in the absence of either cobalt or oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide, TBHP. With this series of catalysts, it was found that a small amount of cobalt could ‘leak’ into solution, indicating that the catalytic activity for this series of composites might best be thought of as a mixed ‘heterogeneous-homogeneous’ system. Since ceria has been widely employed as a dopant, both for bulk and supported metal oxides with promising results on their catalytic activity, the main objective of the third section was to investigate the effect of ceria as a promoter on the morphology, dispersion, crystallinity, leakage and catalytic activity of the SBA- 15 supported cobalt oxide species. Two series of composites were prepared via the two-solvent method using Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O and CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O with 5 wt% loading as cobalt precursors and Ce(NO 3) 3. 6 H 2 O with 0. 5 wt% loading as a dopant. It was found that the ceria-doped composite prepared from Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O exhibited better dispersion of cobalt oxide species, with both Co 3 O 4 single nanorods and less extensive Co 3 O 4 patches, than its non-doped analogue. Here the better dispersion of the Co 3 O 4 nanorods, the synergistic effect between cobalt oxide and ceria and the improvement in redox properties result in higher catalytic activity of the composite in liquid phase oxidation of various alcohols and olefins. Ceria-doped composites prepared from Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O was reusable up to four times without significant change in its catalytic activity. However for the composites prepared from CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O (5 wt%) and Ce(NO 3) 3. 6 H 2 O (0. 5 wt%), the addition of the dopant did not improve the crystallinity of the cobalt oxide phase. The XRD patterns did not indicate any trace of phase separated cobalt-cerium mixed metal oxide. The dispersion of the cobalt oxide species in this specific case appeared to be the same as for the undoped analogue. However the ceria-doped composites demonstrated better catalytic activity. This can be attributed to the improvement in the redox properties of Co 2 +/Co 3 + due to the presence of ceria. Ceria-doped composites prepared from CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O still exhibited some slight ‘leakage’. The effect of the Co:Ce ratio on the morphology and catalytic activity of the composites was also investigated. These composites were prepared via the two-solvent method using CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O (5 wt%) and Ce(NO 3) 3. 6 H 2 O (0. 5 - 2 wt%) as metal precursors. The highest catalytic activity was obtained from composites with 0. 5 wt% and 1. 5 wt% cerium loadings. It is speculated that these two compositions facilitate better synergy between cobalt oxide species and ceria. An in-depth study on the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out to investigate the mechanism of the oxidation reaction. The amount of TBHP added was not stoichiometrically sufficient to facilitate the ‘double oxidation’ of the substrate through benzaldehyde and then to benzoic acid. Moreover, after the completion of the reaction TBHP was still observed (by GC) to be present. This suggests that aerial oxygen was also behaving as an oxidant and that TBHP behaved more as an initiator to the catalytic reaction. This was confirmed by carrying out the reaction under an inert atmosphere (N 2) and also in the absence of the TBHP with negligible conversion in both cases. In summary, it was found that various preparation methods result in the formation of cobalt oxide species with different morphology and dispersion. The two-solvent method clearly facilitates the formation of the cobalt oxide species inside the pores of the SBA- 15 and prevents their aggregation into inactive clusters on the external surface of the support. The nature of the cobalt precursor, more specifically the nature of the counter ion, determines the nature of the cobalt oxide species, its crystallinity and its interaction with the support. This, in turn, impacts the overall structure of the composite. The amount of cobalt loading also affects the morphology of the active species, the overall structure of the composite, the degree of pore blockage and thus the availability of the active sites. Ceria, as a dopant, was found to improve the dispersion of the Co 3 O 4 nanorods prepared from Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O) and the redox properties of the cobalt oxide species (prepared using either Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O or CoCl 2. 6 H 2 O as cobalt precursor) supported on SBA- 15. The Co:Ce ratio was also shown to be important in improving the catalytic activity and is attributed to a synergistic effect between the cobalt oxide species and ceria. It is suggested that the extent to which ceria covered the surface of cobalt oxide species and the boundary between these two phases are important in determining the catalytic activity. In conclusion there are many factors that were shown to play critical roles in determining the catalytic activity of the composites prepared in this study...|$|R
