5|$|Reception for {{the medal}} was mixed, with {{veterans}} criticizing {{the placement of}} the medal in the order of precedence. Production of the medal was halted on 12 March 2013, pending a review of its precedence as ordered by Secretary of Defense, <b>Chuck</b> <b>Hagel.</b> It was subsequently cancelled by Secretary Hagel on 15 April 2013 who made the decision to instead create and offer a new distinguishing device to existing medals.

5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary <b>Chuck</b> <b>Hagel</b> outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
