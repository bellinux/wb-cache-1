5|$|Filming {{began on}} February 12, 2007 in Auckland. The scene where the Pevensies {{return to the}} ruined Cair Paravel was shot at Cathedral Cove. The filmmakers chose the {{location}} because it had a tunnel-like arch, which echoed the train tunnel the <b>children</b> <b>go</b> into before being summoned back into Narnia. Henderson Valley Studios {{was used for the}} Pevensies' ancient treasure room and the Underground station.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the same {{neighborhood}} as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their <b>children</b> <b>go</b> {{back and forth between the}} two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the <b>children</b> <b>go</b> from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|The Jordanian {{educational}} system {{consists of a}} two-year cycle of pre-school education, 10 years of compulsory basic education, and two years of secondary academic or vocational education, after which the students sit for the Tawjihi exams. 79% of <b>children</b> <b>go</b> through primary education, while secondary school enrollment has increased from 63% to 97% of high school aged students in Jordan. Between 79% and 85% {{of high school students}} in Jordan move on to higher education. According to the CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in 2015 was 95.4%. UNESCO ranked Jordan's education system 18th out of 94 nations for providing gender equality in education. Education is not free in Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped <b>children</b> <b>go</b> wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E

25|$|During school-aged years, {{academic}} achievement {{is a significant}} contributor to self-esteem development. A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As <b>children</b> <b>go</b> through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons {{play an important role}} in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves. As <b>children</b> <b>go</b> through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{anatomical}} {{and physiological}} differences, injuries in {{children need to}} be approached differently from those in adults. Accidents are {{the leading cause of}} death in children between 1 and 14 years old. In the United States, approximately sixteen million <b>children</b> <b>go</b> to an emergency department due to some form of injury every year, with boys being more frequently injured than girls by a ratio of 2:1. The world's five most common unintentional injuries in children as of 2008 are road crashes, drowning, burns, falls, and poisoning.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} {{transition from}} early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition {{in which they}} become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads {{to an increase in}} their eagerness to participate and belong. As <b>children</b> <b>go</b> through this transition, they often develop a sense of identity within their family and community.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiences}} <b>children</b> <b>go</b> through {{during times}} of armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school. Many middle and upper-class <b>children</b> <b>go</b> to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala). USAC was the first university in Guatemala {{and one of the}} first Universities of America.|$|E

25|$|An ethnic-based {{war that}} lasted {{for over a decade}} {{resulted}} in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two <b>children</b> <b>go</b> to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine and electricity remain in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006–12. Political stability {{and the end of the}} civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses – a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transport network, overburdened utilities and low administrative capacity – risk undermining planned economic reforms.|$|E
25|$|The Infant and Junior schools {{today have}} over 750 pupils, until as {{recently}} as 1955 there were no schools in Dorridge, with pupils travelling to Bentley Heath, Hockley Heath, Knowle or Packwood to get an education. In 1955 Dorridge Junior School was built and by 1963 an Infant School was built. These were joined by the Catholic School of St. George and Teresa. The secondary education is mainly provided by Arden School in nearby Knowle, which now also has a sixth form centre. The sixth form buildings were completed in 2007 with additions being made every year. A considerable number of <b>children</b> <b>go</b> to private schools in Solihull, Warwick or Birmingham or to grammar schools in Birmingham or Stratford.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of <b>children</b> <b>go</b> from house to house of their {{neighborhood}} and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E
