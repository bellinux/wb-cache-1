The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.

Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

6000|$|Of {{course the}} <b>community</b> <b>supports</b> all its {{children}} now--the only {{point is that}} it does not support them in its collective character as a State [...] "as a whole." [...] All the children in the world are supported by all the people in the world, but very unfairly and irregularly, through the intervention of that great multitude of small private proprietors, the parents. When the parents fail, Charity and the Parish step in. If the reader will refer to those ten cases from Edinburgh I have already quoted in Chapter III., § 1, he will note that in eight out of the ten there comes in the eleemosynary element; in the seventh case especially he will get an inkling of its waste. A change in the system that diminished (though it by no means abolished) this separate dependence of children upon parents, each child depending upon those [...] "pieces" [...] from its particular parental feast, need not necessarily diminish the amount of wheat, or leather, or milk in the world; the children would still get the bread and milk and boots, but through different channels and in a different spirit. They might even get more. The method of making and distribution will evidently have to be a different one and run counter to currently accepted notions; that is all. Not only is it true that a change of system need not diminish the amount of food in the world; it might even increase it. The Socialist declares that his system would increase it. He proposes a method of making and distribution, a change in industrial conditions and in the conventions of property, that he declares will not only not diminish but greatly increase the production of the world, and changes in the administration that he is equally convinced will insure a far juster and better use of all that is produced.|$|E
6000|$|I thus {{found that}} the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a {{lifetime}} at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually. If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity rather than for myself; and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement. Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy--chaff which I {{find it difficult to}} separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any man--I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil's attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the mere rent of a student's room, which is only a little larger than my own, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then, following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its extreme--a principle which should never be followed but with circumspection--to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I {{think that it would be}} better than this, for the students, or those who desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful. [...] "But," [...] says one, [...] "you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?" [...] I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the <b>community</b> <b>supports</b> them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practised but the art of life;--to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month--the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this--or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rodgers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied navigation!--why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the poor student studies and is taught only political economy, while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Support {{for early}} {{detection}} and intervention for developmental disorders in {{children as well as}} support that provides assistance for their families is vital for the establishment of <b>community</b> <b>support</b> systems for children with developmental disorders. We investigated the structure of a <b>community</b> <b>support</b> system in Miyake Town, Nara Prefecture, based on these two perspectives and examined the needs that may arise in future. Methoas Using a participatory action research framework, we interviewed community health nurses involved in establishing <b>community</b> <b>support</b> systems for children with developmental disorders, collected records of past <b>community</b> <b>support</b> activities and observed participants. Results The conrmunity support system for children with developmental disorders in Miyake Town included the following 4 phases: 1) health examinations for infants; 2) first-stage intervention classes; 3) second-stage intervention classes, and 4) a network of people {{as a part of the}} <b>community</b> <b>support</b> system. Infants specifically suspected of a developmental disorder were screened during medical examinations when aged 1. 5 years. Children subsequently participating in first-stage intervention classes were observed in second-stage intervention classes during kindergarten, if needed, and received continual support after entering elementary school. Of the children who participated in second- stage intervention classes, 75 % were found or suspected to have developmental disorders when aged 1. 5 years, and 62 % had participated in first-stage intervention classes. Families of such children communicated problems in daily life associated with these disorders to a <b>community</b> <b>support</b> staff member, which promoted the establishment of a conrmunlty support system. Conclusions 1) Medical examinations of 1. 5 -year-old infants and children participating in first-stage intervention classes are important for the early detection of developmental disorders and for establishing <b>community</b> <b>support</b> systems for such children. 2) Families of such children are strengthened through the <b>community</b> <b>support</b> system. The bond formed between parents during first- and second-stage intervention classes has been a factor...|$|R
