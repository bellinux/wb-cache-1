A {{finite element}} {{approach}} based on Ansys is developed to simulate stress intensity distribution in a three dimensional model of coupling <b>clamp</b> <b>joint,</b> which includes ferrules, pipe caps and bolts. The characteristics of stress intensity distributions of coupling <b>clamp</b> <b>joint</b> under strength pressure loading {{have been studied}} {{by means of the}} non-linear finite element method. The FE model can also predict the clamp quality and tolerances to be expected under different process conditions and define the most effective process parameters to influence the tolerances.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of work by the author in measuring and monitoring loads in bolts using an ultrasonic extensometer. A {{number of cases of}} bolted joints are covered. These include, a <b>clamped</b> <b>joint</b> with clearance fit between the bolt and hole, a <b>clamped</b> <b>joint</b> with the bolt in an interference fit with the hole, a flanged joint which allows the flange and bolt to bend; and a shear joint in a clevis and tang configuration. These applications were initially developed for measuring and monitoring preload in the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter critical joints but are also applicable for monitoring loads in other critical bolted joints of structures such as transportation bridges and other aerospace structures. The paper explains how to setup a model to estimate the load factor and accuracy for the ultrasonic preload application in a <b>clamped</b> <b>joint</b> with clearance fit. The ultrasonic preload application for <b>clamped</b> <b>joint</b> with bolt in an interference fit {{can also be used to}} measure diametrical interference between the bolt shank and hole; and interference pressure on the bolt shank. Model and experimental data are given to demonstrate use of ultrasonic measurements in a shear joint. A bolt in a flanged joint experiences both tensile and bending loads. This application involves measurement of bending and tensile preload in a bolt. The ultrasonic beam bends due to the bending load on the bolt. A numerical technique to compute the trace of ultrasonic ray is presented...|$|R

The development of this complex, multi-step analysis is explained and the results compared with alternate theories which ignore or take account of transverse friction in the band to flange contact region. It is shown that accounting for transverse friction yields a better comparison with the finite element results for lower coefficients of friction whilst ignoring this component gives better results for higher coefficients of friction.

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the <b>clamped</b> <b>joint</b> components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|R

Firstly, friction coefficients have been evaluated on “ad-hoc designed” specimens, by applying the Design of Experiment approach: the applied tightening torque has been precisely related to the imposed preloading force. Then, the tensile state of clamps have been evaluated both via FEM and by leveraging some design formulae proposed by the Authors as function of the preloading force and of the clamp geometry. Finally, the results have been compared to those given by some strain gauges applied on the tested clamps: the discrepancies between numerical analyses, the design formulae and the experimental results remains under a threshold of 10 %...|$|R

40|$|V-band <b>clamp</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} to connect circular flanges, for ducts, pipes and the turbocharger housing. Previous studies and research on V-bands are either purely empirical or analytical with limited applicability on the variety of V-band design and working conditions. In this paper models of the V-band are developed based on the classical theory of solid mechanics and the finite element method to study the behaviour of the V-bands under axial loading conditions. The good agreement between results from the developed FEA and the classical model support the suitability of the latter to model V-band joints with diameters greater than 110 mm under axial loading. The results from both models suggest that the axial stiffness for this V-band cross section reaches a peak value for V-bands with radius of approximately 150 mm across a wide range of coefficients of friction. Also, it is shown that the coefficient of friction and the wedge angle have a significant effect on the axial stiffness of V-bands...|$|R

Furthermore, it has been recently shown that specially developed glass bonding techniques withstand multiple autoclaving cycles. The current research investigated practice-relevant parameters influencing the lifespan of epoxy-or (urethane) acrylate-bonded glass bioreactors. Hereby, the influence of cleaning and sensitivity to fermentation compounds (ethanol and acetic acid) was quantified using glass-glass and glass-stainless steel specimens. Whereas cleaning did not adversely affect the durability of glass bonds, high concentrations of the fermentation compounds ethanol and acetic acid resulted in accelerated corrosion and subsequent bond failure. Moreover, no effect of eight different epoxy and (urethane) acrylate adhesives was observed on selected model organisms Escherichia coli K 12 and Hansenula polymorpha wild type. Another objective {{of this study was to}} refine the design of two small-scale bioreactors (ca. 250 mL) by replacing <b>clamps</b> and melted <b>joints</b> by adhesive joints.

The failure criterion was based on a fracture mechanics approach, incorporated within a XFEM framework, developed and validated previously for open-hole failure. Results were compared with experimental data obtained from <b>clamped</b> <b>joints.</b> While agreement between model and experiment showed promise, there are features of the problem, in particular the effect of bolt clamp-up and the associated load transfer as a result of friction, which cannot necessarily be captured with the limits of a two-dimensional model. The present work has therefore developed a three-dimensional model and applied it to the same data set. The effect of clamp-up torque is incorporated by modelling the bolt and washers and introducing a bolt tension, which enables the influence on frictional load transfer and the in-plane stress distributions to be incorporated within the model. The predictions for joint strength were in good agreement with experimental data up to the values of w/d for which the failure mechanism was observed experimentally to change to the bearing failure mode.

40|$|The {{conversation}} about the restoration materialization of historic buildings is an ongoing debate. Additions are allowed only {{if they do not}} detract from the interesting parts of the building, integrate harmoniously, yet are distinguishable to prevent architectural falsification of the monument. Completely transparent additions to historic buildings of structural glass can be an answer to all the above demands. As a research into these possibilities, a refurbishment proposal is made for the Ruin of Teylingen in the Netherlands. Here the original wood roof that is missing, is replaced by a structural glass roof. As a design research, the glass roof design has been elaborated in this graduation. The roof has the same shape and size of the original roof, and closes off the donjon, allowing a new function to be put in the castle. Laminated heat-strengthened glass beams are connected to a slender steel contour frame. To create a fluid curvature, laminated heat-treated cold bend glass panels are used, which are held in place by <b>clamping</b> <b>joints,</b> connected onto the glass beams. Passive climate measures are used to prevent overheating of the glass roof. A glass floor allows the roof {{to be used as a}} lookout point over the refurbished area around the castle. The design is checked by structural calculations. The product of the design process is an plausible and elegant solution for covering the historic building with an all glass roof that respects the historical and aesthetical value of the monument.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the mechanical response of thermoset polymers under high compressive loads. The study {{is divided into}} two parts. The first part focuses on the behaviour of a powder coating when used in a <b>clamping</b> force <b>joint</b> and how the properties vary when the chemical and physical structure of the coating is changed. The second part discusses the fundamental understanding of the behaviour of thermoset polymers with small thickness-to-width ratio subjected to compressive stresses, the aim being to develop mathematical material models for viscoelastic materials under high compressive loads. In the first part polyester powder coatings were used with variations in molecular weight, number of functional groups of the resin, amount and type of filler and thickness of the coating. The coatings were subjected to conventional tests for coatings and polymers and also to specially designed tests developed to study the behaviour of powder coatings in <b>clamping</b> force <b>joints.</b> The high compressive loads in a <b>clamping</b> force <b>joint</b> put high demands on the relaxation and creep resistance of the coating and the study shows the importance of crosslink density, filler content, and also coating thickness in order to achieve the desired mechanical properties of a coating. A high reactivity of the resin, facilitating a high crosslink density and hence a high Tg, is the most important property of the coating. A film with high crosslink density shows increase in relaxation time and in apparent yield strength under compression, and also an increase in relaxation modulus and storage modulus in tension at temperatures above Tg. Addition of fillers reduces the deformation during compression and tension, but also induces a lower strain at break and hence a more brittle coating. The reinforcing effect of the fillers is pronounced when increasing the crosslink density of the coating, especially in the compression tests. The effect is evident in compression even at low amounts of fillers, where the relaxation time and resistance to deformation are strongly increased. The combination of high crosslink density and addition of fillers is therefore desirable since fillers then can be used moderately in order to achieve a reinforcing effect in compression while minimising embrittlement. The study also showed that increased coating thickness will give rise to defects in the coating, especially voids and blisters due to evaporation of water formed during the curing of the polyester powder coating. These defects will give rise to stress concentrations and increased plastic deformations in the coating, impairing the properties of the <b>clamping</b> force <b>joint.</b> The results from relaxation tests in tension were used to create a micromechanical model. This model was used in finite element modelling to estimate the loss of clamping force in a screw joint and to correlate with the experimental results of the powder coatings. In {{the second part of the}} study a well-defined free radically cured vinyl ester resin was used and studied in six different geometries in order to determine the dependence of apparent mechanical properties on the particular size and shape of a sample when it is subjected to high compressive loads. Variation of the specimen thickness, boundary conditions and loading conditions reveals that the geometry of the sample has a significant effect on the mechanical performance of the polymer. The apparent modulus and the yield strength increase dramatically when the thickness-to-width ratio of the sample is reduced, whereas they decrease when the friction between the sample and the compression plate is reduced. The creep strain rate decreases when the thickness of the material is reduced and it decreases even more when the amount of material surrounding the compressed part of the sample is increased. Creep and strain recovery tests on large specimens were used to develop a mathematical model including non-linear viscoelastic and viscoplastic response of a thermoset vinyl ester. The model was used in FEM calculations where the experimental results were compared with the calculated results in order to model the trends of the material response when varying the sample geometry.

This paper seeks an explanation for this macroscopic behaviour by means of microscale finite-element simulations. The analyses show that the experimental results can be explained by assuming that: (a) however great the clamping pressure, a thin film of adhesive remains trapped between the crests of the mating surfaces; (b) under the high local pressure the shear strength of this film becomes greater than the regular adhesive at no pressure; (c) the stronger adhesives entail a higher increase than the weaker adhesives...|$|R
40|$|In Southern Europe the {{heritage}} and the everyday practice of precast structures consists mostly in dry or semidry assembled frames with hinged beams and cantilever columns restrained at their base. Such structures {{can provide a}} large energy dissipation, but they are intrinsically very flexible, especially if moving from industrial mono-storey buildings to commercial or residential multi-storey buildings. Their design becomes influenced by the need of reducing such flexibility, thus largely over-dimensioning the members and obtaining a complex seismic behaviour due {{to the influence of}} higher modes. Two solutions are envisaged to solve this problem by keeping the key feature of precast structures, that is the speed of erection: the introduction of dry or semi-dry assembled precast walls (particularly favourable in case of residential buildings) or the stiffening of the classical statically determined frame by means of introduction of moment resisting beam-column connections made with mechanical devices (mostly envisaged in the case of commercial buildings). In such enhanced frames, the realization of <b>clamped</b> <b>joints</b> can be performed in a second stage of the erection process, adapting the existing hinged connection realized at the first stage to clamped by activating the mechanical devices. Precast structures with adaptable restraints (PRESAR) are therefore presented in their essential features, among them the possibility of mix of a high quality dry precast construction technology with high speed of erection and the stiffness and redundancy provided by a traditional cast-in-situ frame. If properly designed, the horizontal members can fully be exploited by transferring the dead loads in a simply supported scheme before being adapted to clamped, with improvements in the behaviour and design of the whole building. A design comparison among 3 precast frames with similar geometries but different static schemes shows how this structural flexibility can be exploited to optimize the structure.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a self-organizing neural model for eye-hand coordination. Called the DIRECT model, it embodies {{a solution of}} the classical motor equivalence problem. Motor equivalence computations allow humans and other animals to flexibly employ an arm with more degrees of freedom than the space in which it moves to carry out spatially defined tasks under conditions that may require novel joint configurations. During a motor babbling phase, the model endogenously generates movement commands that activate the correlated visual, spatial, and motor information {{that are used to}} learn its internal coordinate transformations. After learning occurs, the model is capable of controlling reaching movements of the arm to prescribed spatial targets using many different combinations of joints. When allowed visual feedback, the model can automatically perform, without additional learning, reaches with tools of variable lengths, with <b>clamped</b> <b>joints,</b> with distortions of visual input by a prism, and with unexpected perturbations. These compensatory computations occur within a single accurate reaching movement. No corrective movements are needed. Blind reaches using internal feedback have also been simulated. The model achieves its competence by transforming visual information about target position and end effector position in 3 -D space into a body-centered spatial representation of the direction in 3 -D space that the end effector must move to contact the target. The spatial direction vector is adaptively transformed into a motor direction vector, which represents the joint rotations that move the end effector in the desired spatial direction from the present arm configuration. Properties of the model are compared with psychophysical data on human reaching movements, neurophysiological data on the tuning curves of neurons in the monkey motor cortex, and alternative models of movement control.

40|$|Mass and {{stiffness}} properties of real structures {{are different from}} those considered in design since simplified hypotheses are usually made and because the collaboration of non-structural elements and details are important. When structural problems are investigated (such as pathologies, serviceability and vibration comfort, etc.), knowledge of the actual response of the structure is needed with precision. Therefore, the source of the problem can be identified and solution in terms of reinforcement and possible retrofitting can be proposed. In this Master Thesis dynamic analysis and field data measurement is used in order to identify the parameters of complex structures. A real case study is considered, consisting in an office building with serviceability problems due to vibration. The structural system consists of steel frames; a bus ramp exists coupled to the building which introduces a dynamic excitation. The steel frames span over 17, 23 metres without intermediate columns, which leads to low Eigenfrequencies. All frame nodes are clamped, a perimeter steel profile has <b>clamped</b> <b>joints</b> too. Between frames over the distance of 8, 6 metres mixed beams are spanned, consisting of steel profile pinned to the frames and concrete slabs on a trapezoidal sheeting. Due to this concrete slabs the floors were assumed diaphragms in horizontal directions. A ramp is connected to the building. This ramp consists of longitudinal steel profiles carrying a trapezoidal sheeting as lost formwork with a concrete slab and an asphalt layer above. Those longitudinal profiles rest on transversal steel frames. The steel frames consist of a series of columns on one side and horizontal profiles which on the other side directly join the building frame´s column. Thus, whenever a vehicle excites the ramp, this vibration is transferred directly to the building, affecting serviceability and comfort. The objective of the research is to investigate the actual behaviour of the building and the possible imperfect connections. After the system is identified, possible actions are investigated in order to improve the service behaviour and comfort. In order to achieve this aim, dynamic traffic loads are simulated by a series of time history functions. Bus passes are simulated and measured under different velocities. As a result the ramp´s Eigenfrequency is 11, 1 Hz, and acts as excitation frequency on the building.

40|$|Laser {{plastic welding}} {{requires}} one part to be transmissive to {{a laser beam}} and either the other part absorptive or a coating at the interface to be absorptive to the beam. The two parts are put under pressure while the laser beam moves along the joining line. The beam passes through the first part and is absorbed by the other one or the coating to generate enough heat to soften the interface creating a permanent weld. Semiconductor diode lasers are typically used in plastic welding. Wavelengths {{in the range of}} 808 nm to 980 nm can be used to join various plastic material combinations. Power levels from less than 1 W to 100 W are needed depending on the materials, thickness and desired process speed. Diode laser systems have the following advantages in joining of plastic materials: • Cleaner than adhesive bonding • No micro-nozzles to get clogged • No liquid or fumes to affect surface finish • No consumables • Higher throughput • Can access work-piece in challenging geometry • High level of process control Requirements for high strength joints include: • Adequate transmission through upper layer • Absorption by lower layer • Material compatibility – wetting • Good <b>joint</b> design – <b>clamping</b> pressure, <b>joint</b> area • Lower power densit...|$|R
40|$|A {{validated}} Von-Mises stress-based {{model is}} presented for multi-axial fatigue evaluation of <b>clamped</b> sheet metal <b>joints</b> that {{are subjected to}} a cyclic bending stress additional to the compressive bearing stress in the bolted joint. Joint material, bolt preload level, and the amplitude level of the cyclic bending moment are studied for their effect on the fatigue life of the clamped sheet metal plate. Bolt tightening to a precise preload level is accomplished by using an ultrasonic instrument that has been mechanically pre-calibrated to convert the time delay of longitudinal ultrasonic wave reflection to a bolt elongation and corresponding preload value. Fatigue data is generated using an MTS fatigue testing system. Experimental and FEA results are fitted into a multi-axial model for predicting the fatigue behavior of the bolted joint. Discussion and data analysis are provided...|$|R
