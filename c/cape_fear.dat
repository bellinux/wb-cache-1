At [...] "Album of the Year" [...] on March 10, 2007 the titles would be vacated. Quicksilver has not wrestled since then, but has not announced his retirement.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River. Robert Johnson, {{governor}} of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River was in North Carolina's jurisdiction. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived {{at the mouth of}} the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River on 26September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. The sun had set by the time the rising tide lifted the Henry off the river bottom.|$|E
5|$|In the Carolinas, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, causing flash flooding, particularly along the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River in North Carolina. Overall, the hurricane resulted in 26fatalities and about $60million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Parker's fleet had an {{extremely}} difficult crossing. Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships {{of the fleet}} did not arrive at <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions {{up and down the}} coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that {{the decision was made to}} go there.|$|E
25|$|Particularly at <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear's</b> outlet to the Atlantic, {{the area}} was {{enclosed}} by a half dozen Confederate positions. The river flowed to the sea through two relatively shallow inlets, which were partitioned by Smith Island now Bald Head Island. The existence of two inlets resulted in a crucial advantage: guided by the Confederates, the blockade runners were capable of avoiding the Union ships. They simply had to change course unexpectedly, alternatively between the two inlets.|$|R
6000|$|... 304 Thus to the Eastern wealth through storms we go, [...] But now, the <b>Cape</b> once doubled, <b>fear</b> no more; [...] A {{constant}} trade-wind will securely blow, [...] And gently lay us on {{the spicy}} shore.|$|R
25|$|The {{evidence}} available thus {{seems to}} indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and <b>Cape</b> <b>Fears.</b> It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some reason to think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists {{in one form or another}} since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.|$|R
5|$|A plaque commemorating Bonnet stands near Bonnet's Creek in Southport, North Carolina, on the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River. The Yacht Basin Provision Company {{also holds}} an annual Stede Bonnet Regatta near Southport, commemorating the infamous pirate's dash for the ocean.|$|E
5|$|September 13, 1984– Hurricane Diana strikes near <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> with {{winds of}} about 90mph (150km/h) after {{weakening}} from peak winds of Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Rainfall {{in the state}} peaks at , and the hurricane causes three indirect fatalities and about $70million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The 46 pirates were {{scattered}} {{among the three}} sloops. During the night, Bonnet brought all of them aboard the Royal James and planned to fight his way out to sea in the morning rather than risk the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River's narrow channels in the dark. Bonnet also {{wrote a letter to}} Governor Johnson, threatening to burn all the ships in Charles Town Harbour. At daybreak, on 27September 1718, Bonnet set sail toward Rhett's force, and all three sloops opened fire, initiating the Battle of <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River. The two South Carolinian sloops split up in an effort to bracket the Royal James. Bonnet tried to avoid the trap by steering the Royal James close to the river's western shore, but ran aground in the process. Rhett's closing sloops also ran aground, leaving only the Henry in range of the Royal James.|$|E
50|$|New Brunswickers {{express the}} same fears as Prince Edward Islanders, fearing {{the loss of}} jurisdiction, and as <b>Cape</b> Bretoners, <b>fearing</b> the {{dilution}} of influence over provincial affairs. Of particular concern is the possible linguistic and cultural dilution that the Acadian community of New Brunswick would face - comprising over 30 percent of the New Brunswick population, cultural protections guaranteed to Acadians in officially bilingual New Brunswick could be compromised. Although both Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have Acadian communities as well, both are much smaller and less proportionally significant.|$|R
25|$|At first no one {{believed}} Nongquwuse's prophecy and the Xhosa nation {{ignored her}} prophecy. But when Chief Sarhili began to kill his cattle, {{more and more people}} began to believe that Nongquwuse was an igqirha (diviner) who could communicate with the ancestors. They too killed their cattle and destroyed their crops. The cult grew and built up momentum, sweeping across the eastern Cape. The government authorities of the <b>Cape</b> Colony <b>feared</b> chaos, famine and economic collapse, so they desperately appealed in vain to the Xhosa to ignore the prophecies. They even arrested Nongqawuse herself for disturbance caused.|$|R
50|$|Between 2-7 October, the {{crippled}} Litke was busy clearing a passage to Uritsky off <b>Cape</b> Shelagsky. <b>Fearing</b> that Litke itself would be trapped {{away from the}} convoy, Bochek and his staff ordered that it cease its efforts. Litke joined the main forces in Chaun Bay, preparing to stay there for the long Arctic winter. On 31 October, Litke was fully prepared for the winter; it still carried 500 tonnes of coal, with 150 allocated for heating at the anchorage. Its large luxurious saloons were used for propaganda and entertainment assemblies for the whole convoy. Meanwhile, the morale of its crew was plummeting. The ship surgeon and cook were relieved from duty for absenteeism.|$|R
5|$|The Expos {{converted}} Mota to {{a pitcher}} in 1997 and assigned {{him to the}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> Crocs of the South Atlantic League. Starting 23 of his 25 games for the Crocs, he had a 510 record with a 4.36 earned run average (ERA) and 112 strikeouts in 126 innings.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear,</b> North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to wait out the hurricane season there.|$|E
50|$|Decatur began {{pursuit of}} Estedio and chased her into shoal waters near {{the coast of}} Spain off <b>Cape</b> Palos. <b>Fearing</b> that his larger vessels might get beached, he sent the smaller vessels in his {{squadron}} the USS Epervier, USS Spark, USS Torch, and USS Spitfire {{to deal with the}} brig. Here the vessels fought a short engagement lasting a half an hour before the Algerines began to abandon their vessel and surrender. As Estedios crew members began to flee towards the cape in her boats, the American vessels began firing upon the boats, sinking one. The surviving 80 crew of Estedio surrendered. Besides the eighty captured, Estedio lost at least 23 men killed.|$|R
5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western <b>Cape</b> live in <b>fear</b> of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|R
50|$|On April 28, 1914, the Senate {{called for}} an {{investigation}} into the status and conditions of the Indians of Robeson and adjoining counties. The Indian Office sent Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson to the county to obtain information regarding the educational system of the tribe. In his report, submitted to the Senate on January 4, 1915, he wrote: While these Indians are essentially an agricultural people, I believe them to be as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white youth. The foregoing facts suggest the character of the educational institution that should be established for them, in case Congress sees fit to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be taught.John Reed Swanton, a noted anthropologist-historian, reported on possible origins of the Indians of Robeson County in his work on Southeast Indians. He wrote: The evidence available thus seems to indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and <b>Cape</b> <b>Fears.</b> It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant.

5|$|Clinton {{arrived at}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> on March 12, {{expecting to find}} the European convoy already there. He met with the royal {{governors}} of North and South Carolina, Josiah Martin and William Campbell, and learned that the recruited Scottish Loyalists had been defeated at Moore's Creek Bridge two weeks earlier. Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia, James Wright, who had been arrested, and then escaped to a navy ship.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued {{from the mouth}} of the Altamaha River in Georgia to <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear,</b> North Carolina. The next day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla, North Carolina before the storm moved ashore. In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel were {{generally}} {{light in the}} southeastern portion of the state. Sustained winds reached 72mph (116km/h) offshore in the Frying Pan Shoals, where a gust of 82mph (132km/h) was also reported. Sustained winds were lighter along the coast, peaking at 45mph (72km/h) at the Wilmington International Airport, while gusts reached 66mph (106km/h) at a North Carolina State Ports Authority facility in Wilmington. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as Lumberton, where gusts reached 52mph (54km/h). The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51inches (115mm) in Whiteville. Additionally, weather radars estimated over 5inches (125mm) of precipitation fell in portions of New Hanover County. The rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1foot (0.3m) above normal, though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22feet (1m). Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear.</b>|$|E

Under-reporting is high for sexually violent crimes, thus the number of corrective rapes are likely higher than what is reported.|$|R
50|$|Following {{commissioning}} Pawtuxet {{was ordered}} to the Grand Banks to join {{the quest for the}} Confederate raider , but before she could get underway Tallahassee had returned safely to Wilmington. Pawtuxet was then ordered south to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Joining the 3rd Division in October she {{was ordered to}} cruise off the Carolina coast, primarily between <b>Capes</b> Lookout and <b>Fear.</b> At the end of December she bombarded the defenses at Wilmington in support of the first assault against Fort Fisher. Returning on 13 January 1865, she again turned her guns on that fort; sent men and boats to participate in the successful assault on the 15th; then resumed blockade duties. Shifted to the Virginia coast in April, she decommissioned at New York on 15 June 1865, and was sold on 15 October 1867.|$|R
50|$|With {{the money}} from his book, he {{commissioned}} a 39' steel ketch which he named Joshua, in honour of Joshua Slocum, {{the first person to}} sail around the world solo. Finally he and Françoise left Marseille in October 1963, leaving her three children in boarding schools. After wintering in Casablanca they sailed first to the Canaries, then to Trinidad, and through the Panama Canal to the Galapagos Islands. After two years of spending time in each of these places they arrived at Tahiti, but realised that they were running out of time and that there was just eight months left to return to their children. So Moitessier proposed sailing Joshua home not via the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal, as originally planned, but eastwise, via the quickest route, including a passage about the much <b>feared</b> <b>Cape</b> Horn. Upon their arrival in France, at Easter, 1966, they had, without intending it, completed the longest nonstop passage by a yacht in history—14216 nautical miles, over 126 days, a world record which brought him immediate recognition throughout the world yachting community.|$|R
5|$|Two {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds {{and the lower}} Chesapeake Bay. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Santee River, as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear,</b> North Carolina to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear.</b> Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km).|$|E
5|$|Wallace Wolodarsky {{had seen}} the 1991 version of <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> and pitched the idea of {{spoofing}} the film. Jon Vitti was then assigned to write a parody of the original <b>Cape</b> <b>Fear</b> film from 1962 {{as well as the}} remake (both films are based on the 1957 novel by John D. MacDonald, entitled The Executioners). Instead of using the spoof as only a part of the episode, which could have contained a B-story, the entire episode was devoted to this parody. Sideshow Bob was cast as the villain and Bart became the main victim. The episode followed the same basic plot outline as the films and used elements from the original film's score by Bernard Herrmann (which was also used in the 1991 version), which, after this episode, became Sideshow Bob's theme. This episode marked the first time a Sideshow Bob episode was not a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Wild at Heart is a 1990 American film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Lynch, and based on Barry Gifford's 1989 novel Wild at Heart.

2500|$|Besides these {{academic}} studies, in 2009, ILGA {{published a}} report {{based on research}} carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden. This research found that of the 80 {{countries around the world}} that continue to consider homosexuality illegal, five carry the death penalty for homosexual activity, and two do in some regions of the country. In the report, this is described as [...] "State sponsored homophobia". This happens in Islamic states, or in two cases regions under Islamic authority. On February 5, 2005, the IRIN issued a reported titled [...] "Iraq: Male homosexuality still a taboo". The article stated, among other things that honor killings by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection. In August 2009, Human Rights Watch published an extensive report detailing torture of men accused of being gay in Iraq, including the blocking of men's anuses with glue and then giving the men laxatives. Although gay marriage has been legal in South Africa since 2006, same-sex unions are often condemned as [...] "un-African". Research conducted in 2009 shows 86% of black lesbians from the Western <b>Cape</b> live in <b>fear</b> of sexual assault.|$|R
50|$|The Lewa Marathon is {{an annual}} fund raising event held at Lewa Downs, about 140 mi north of Nairobi, Kenya. The 42.195 km {{endurance}} race {{is sponsored by}} Safaricom {{in partnership with the}} Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in order to raise funds for numerous community development and wildlife conservation efforts. Most well known for its unique setting Runner's World Magazine included the Lewa Marathon as being, 'One of the top ten races to run in your life'. One of the more notable characteristics of the Lewa Marathon is the setting in which it takes place. The race takes place on the Lewa wildlife conservancy, a game park that is home a variety of large African wildlife to include lions, elephants, rhinoceros, and the greatly <b>feared</b> <b>cape</b> buffalo. There are no physical barriers separating the runners from the wildlife, making Lewa a unique experience in the running world. The course consists of two 20.0975 km loops that are run on a dirt road that ordinarily serves as a four-wheel drive trail for safari vehicles. The average elevation of the course is 5,500 ft above sea level. Located within one hundred miles of the equator, the sun can bring afternoon temperature as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit all year round. The elevation, when combined with the equatorial sun have proven to test even the most seasoned marathon runners. Running a marathon race on an African wildlife preserve does present some unique security risks. The Lewa Conservancy is host to several large African predators that include lions, leopards, hyenas, wild dogs, and cheetahs. Security patrols of experienced, armed rangers from the Kenyan Wildlife Service guard the course {{to ensure the safety of}} the runners. In support of ground efforts, two helicopters and one spotter plane keep an eye out for any possible threats.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} novel idea that fashion may assist in {{creating}} {{social justice and}} transformation in post-apartheid South Africa. 2 Bop takes its inspiration from the classic arcade video games of the eighties and nineties, and the experiences of playing them as a child on the Cape Flats. The brand references Cape Flats 'corner shop culture' and 'Kaapse' (Cape Afrikaans dialect) slang. The thesis looks at the literature around the politics of recognition, pioneered by Charles Taylor, {{in order to try}} and understand whether a fashion brand with a broad customer base could produce a shared recognition between young people across pervasive apartheid divides - especially in Cape Town, which is still visibly and geographically divided along lines of race and class. The research was done through in-depth open-ended interviews with 35 participants of different races, classes and backgrounds;; as well as fieldwork done in stores where the brand is sold, and at various events around Cape Town. The participants divided roughly into two groups: a more multiracial, middle class group in the Cape Town City Bowl and an entirely coloured, working class group in Bishop Lavis on the Cape Flats. Through two overarching themes that emerged from the data, nostalgia and authenticity, this thesis reveals the complex ways that people identify with their clothing, their history, and one another. Firstly, 2 Bop inspires nostalgia for both playing the actual games, as well as the spaces where the games were played. However these experiences are politicized by the environments in which they were set, and reveal the contradictions of a nostalgia for an 'ordinary' childhood on the Cape Flats that involved both pleasure and pain. This sense of nostalgia is rooted in the anxieties of the present and this is illustrated further by the emphasis put on the brand being 'authentic' and the assertion of boundaries between who 'gets it' and who does not. The ideal of authenticity speaks to anxieties of class and race deprivation and social mobility between Cape Town and the <b>Cape</b> Flats ?the <b>fear</b> of 'selling out', the need to remain connected to one's roots without becoming stuck, the desire to feel like one has ownership of an identity as a young person in a fledgling democracy that is constantly in flux...|$|R
