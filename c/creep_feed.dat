50|$|In {{beef cattle}} production, profits are derived almost entirely from the weaning {{weight of the}} calf. Milk from the mother {{supplies}} {{only half of the}} nutrients the calf needs to achieve its maximum growth rate and weaning weight. By offering <b>creep</b> <b>feed,</b> both the rate of weight gain and the weaning weight of the calf can be significantly improved. It is used primarily with spring-born calves, as pasture quality at this time is declining, preventing the calf from finding the other 50% of its nutritive needs by grazing. A calf requires approximately 10% of its body weight in milk daily; for a 100 lb calf, this means 10 lb of milk. As the calf grows, the amount of milk it requires begins to exceed the capacity of its mother to produce the milk. A 500 lb calf requires 50 lb of milk, but a beef cow only produces approximately 13 lb of milk a day. The 500-lb calf is therefore shorted nearly 40 lb of milk. This difference is made up for by offering <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> However, a calf's rumen is still small and poorly developed - for this reason, <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> offered to beef calves must be very energy-dense.|$|E

Thirty-six crossbred steer calves were used in a randomized block design to compare <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> vs. non-creep feeding on plasma glucose, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) and plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), as well as overall performance. NEFA was tested as a measure of the mobilization of body fat reserves due to diet. Steers were randomly selected to one of three treatments. Steers were creep fed supplements daily during the <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> phase. They remained in the same treatment groups and were moved to drylot pens (6 animals/pen; 2 pens/treatment) for the feedlot phase. Live weights and blood samples were taken on selected days. Glucose, PUN and NEFA concentrations were analyzed colorimetrically using Linear Enzymatic Glucose, PUN and NEFA-C kits, respectively. Additionally, fat depth and rib eye area (REA) were measured using ultrasonography. There were no differences in average daily gains (ADG) between protein sources during the <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> or feedlot phases. However, creep fed calves had a greater (P. 10) in plasma NEFA concentrations among treatments and concentrations remained similar from day 14 to 176.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} creep feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and creep feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), creep feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), creep feeder design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and creep diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, creep feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. Creep feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, creep feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. <b>Creep</b> <b>feed</b> consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of creep feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume <b>creep</b> <b>feed)</b> and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the creep diet, and the duration of creep feeding. The proportion of eaters of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of creep feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary creep feeder with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> disappearance. Creep diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> did not affect <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> Therefore, creep feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|E

While <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> disappearance did not affect pre-weaning growth performance, there was a greater disappearance of the simple <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> than the complex <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> from 9 days of age to weaning (776 versus 461 g/litter, respectively, P ≤ 0. 004). Apparent <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake from individual piglets in a subset of litters was assessed at three time points (16 and 19 days of age and at weaning), allowing the characterisation of individual pigs as good, moderate, small or non-eaters. There was no difference between treatment groups (χ 2 ≤ 6. 27, P ≤ 0. 71) in the characterisation of apparent <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> disappearance by individual piglets, however piglets offered the simple creep diet before weaning consumed more feed (P ≤ 0. 004) and gained weight faster (P ≤ 0. 007) during the first 5 days after weaning than those animals offered the complex creep diet. Feed intake from weaning to 49 days of age also tended to be greater in pigs offered the simple creep diet before weaning (P ≤ 0. 053), with this difference reflected in daily gain from weaning to 49 days of age (P ≤ 0. 051).

40|$|In Europe, piglets {{are usually}} weaned before 4 weeks of age, thus {{changing}} abruptly from highly digestible milk {{to a less}} digestible starter diet, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth after weaning and sometimes post weaning diarrhea. Intake of a sufficient amount of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> during lactation can reduce these post weaning problems, but <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> consumption is usually low and highly variable. This thesis describes the effect of intermittent suckling (IS; a management technique in which piglets are separated from the sow for 12 h/ day from d 14 to weaning (d 25), on performance of pigs before and after weaning. IS increased average <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation. Distribution of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake shifted from a skewed one, with a majority of litters consuming less than 250 g. piglet- 1 in control litters, to a normal distribution with an average <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake of 500 to 750 g. piglet- 1 in IS litters. The higher <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake caused by IS resulted in better performance after weaning: IS litters had higher feed intake and higher weight gain {{in the first two}} weeks after weaning. Thereafter no differences were found until slaughter. IS litters with little or no <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation tended to have higher weight gains and feed intake after weaning than control litters with comparable <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation. IS did not increase the percentage of eaters within a litter during lactation and weaning weights did not differ between eaters and non-eaters. From one until four weeks after weaning piglets that were eaters during lactation had higher weights than non-eaters. IS did not affect feeder visiting behaviour of piglets from litters with an anyhow high level of feed intake during lactation, but IS piglets from litters with a low level of feed intake were stimulated to visit the feeder during lactation, which probably made them already familiar with the feeder and the feed. Part of the variation in feed intake between litters might be explained by differences in suckling behaviour and activity. To investigate if IS and/or <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake affects the absorptive capacity of the small intestines, an in vivo small intestine segment perfusion test was performed in 24 newly weaned piglets (6 eaters and 6 non- eaters from each treatment). Net absorption in non-infected segments of the small intestine was significantly higher in eaters than in non-eaters. No difference was found between IS and control piglets. IS also affected the sows: weight loss during lactation was decreased and ovulations were advanced. The results of these studies demonstrate that IS improves both <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation and feed intake and weight gain after weaning. Piglets consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> during lactation had higher weights and net absorption in the small intestine after weaning, independent of the suckling regimen.

Vocalization frequency and times of the following behaviors were recorded: lying down; standing still; walking; trotting; cantering. The TSNC foals spent more time walking than PSNC, PSC or CON foals, and spent less time standing still than foals on all other treatments. The TSC, PSNC, PSC and CON foals spent more time standing still than walking. There were no significant reat-ment effects on times spent lying down or cantering, but TSNC foals tended (P < 0. 06) to spend more time trotting than other foals. The PSC and CON foals were not different in locomotor patterns, indicating that during weaning PSC foals utilized the same patterns of activity behavior as unweaned foals, and weaning stress was apparently minimal. Data from the weaned foals (CON excluded) indicated partial separation resulted in less post...|$|E
40|$|Three trials {{involving}} 61 litters of pigs {{were conducted}} to evaluate the effects of creep feeding and creep diet on weaning weight and subsequent performance in the nursery. Pigs offered a commercial milk replacer pellet (Soweena Pig Pellets) consumed more feed and were heavier at weaning than pigs fed a 20 % whey corn-soybean meal creep diet or pigs fed no <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> Pigs utilized the <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> very efficiently with <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> conversion rates of less than 1 : 1.

40|$|The porous {{type wheel}} made for <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> {{grinding}} with difficult-to-grind materials is excellent {{for the prevention}} of workpiece burning, but its wear is usually considerable. So we must exactly obtain the characteristics of wheel wear in the case of precision profile <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> grinding operation. In this study, V profiled wheel wear is examined experimentally with SUS 304 and SKD 11 (Hrc 60) materials. From the results, characteristics of the edge wear and the linear relationship between wear and the inclined angle of the wheel surface are obtained. Further, a method is proposed by which any profiled wheel wear is able to be estimated using this relationship from a simple <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> grinding test. And the usefulness of the method is examined experimentally...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at University of Marília, SãoPaulo State, Brazil, aiming to determine the phase of intake transitionbetween exclusively liquid diet (milk) and diet based onmilk, grass and/or ration by lambs by δ 13 C technique. Six Suffolkcrossbreeding lambs were distributed in a totally random design(3 x 2), with two experimental groups and three replications. At thefirst one, lambs were penned and sucked milk from dams fed withC 4 diet. besides, they had access to C 3 ration in <b>creep</b> <b>feeding,</b> sincetheir birth. At the second group, lambs were kept on a paddock withTifton – 85 grass (C 4 photosynthetic way) {{as well as their}} dams andhad access to C 3 ration in <b>creep</b> <b>feeding,</b> since their birth. The C 3 ration contained soybean meal, ground oat grains, lucerne hay andalso mineral salt. The penned lambs’ ration consumption overcamethe milk intake at 30 - 35 days after birth; however, grazing lambsingested more milk and pasture than ration until 40 days afterbirth. The δ 13 C technique was considered effective on studies oflambs feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: <b>creep</b> <b>feeding,</b> weaning, {{intestinal}} microbiota, Lactobacillus sobrius, prebiotics, daidzein, probiotics, 16 S rRNA, DGGE, cloning, real-time PCR Nursing {{is a major}} {{critical period}} {{in the life of}} piglets. On one hand maternal antibodies are not able to cross the placenta, thus piglets are born without circulating antibodies and consequently lack maternal passive protection. On the other hand, creep-feeding and weaning increase susceptibility to gut disorders, infections and diarrhea. Therefore clarification of the composition and function of the normal gut microbiota of piglets is pivotal as a knowledge base for the design of innovative nutritional strategies based on pre- and probiotics to keep piglets healthy. The objectives of this study were to describe the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota of piglets during the nursing period through <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> and weaning, to in vivo and in vitro evaluate the effect of daidzein on composition and function of intestinal microbiota of nursing piglets in order to evaluate its prebiotic function, and to investigate the probiotic effect of Lactobacillus sobrius S 1 on composition and function of intestinal microbiota of nursing piglets. The porcine intestinal microbiota development and diversity, the in vivo and in vitro evaluation of prebiotic effect of daidzein and the investigation of probiotic effect of Lactobacillus sobrius S 1 on composition and function of intestinal microbiota of piglets during nursing period through <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> and weaning was described using real-time PCR, and PCR analysis of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning, in combination with analysis of gas production, lactate and VFA yield. The data obtained {{during the course of the}} study indicated that 1) Early creep-feeding stabilizes the microbiota of piglets around the weaning period. 2) Lactobacillus communities follow a successional change associated with piglet growth and diet shifting. <b>Creep</b> <b>feeding</b> stabilizes the Lactobacillus community of weaning piglets. Within the Lactobacillus community, some members like L. reuteri and L. amylovorus / L. sobrius might be permanent colonizers, while L. delbruckii, L. acidophilus and L. crispatus are more likely to be transient members of the Lactobacillus communities in the piglet´s GI tract. 3) Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations indicated that daidzein has the potential for use as a prebiotic additive in animal feed. 4) Lactobacillus sobrius S 1 has the potential of promoting beneficial bacteria and inhibiting pathogens...|$|R
