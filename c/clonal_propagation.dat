2500|$|A {{variety of}} adaptations make A.platyneuron an {{aggressive}} colonizer, even weedy, {{when compared with}} other spleenworts, although a warming climate {{and an increase in}} second growth habitats may also {{have played a role in}} its expansion in the Great Lakes region. It tolerates broad variation in soil conditions, including pH, and will grow in both sun and shade. The starchy stipe bases provide energy for rapid growth in the spring, allowing the fronds to keep ahead of competing vegetation. The erect fertile fronds, unusual for Asplenium, help release spores into the wind for long-distance dispersal, while the proliferative buds allow <b>clonal</b> <b>propagation</b> in moist, fertile habitats. The species also carries a very low genetic load, so that viable sporophytes can develop from intragametophytic self-fertilization with 83–89% success. This means that new sporophytes can usually grow from the gametophyte formed from a single spore. This has allowed ebony spleenwort to be an early colonizer, from distant locations, of recently disturbed habitats, such as coal spoils in southern Iowa. The appearance of A.platyneuron in a disturbed habitat in Slovakia, [...] is probably the result of long-distance dispersal, which may also have allowed it to colonize and naturalize in South Africa.|$|E

The {{objective}} of this work was to monitor the maintenance of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) protective isolates stability in selected clones of 'Pêra' sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), preimmunized or naturally infected by the virus, after successive <b>clonal</b> <b>propagations.</b> The work {{was carried out in}} field conditions in the north of Paraná State, Brazil. Coat protein gene (CPG) analysis of 33 isolates collected from 16 clones of 'Pêra' sweet orange was performed using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP). Initially, the isolates were characterized by symptoms of stem pitting observed in clones. Then viral genome was extracted and used as template for the amplification of CPG by reverse transcription polimerase chain reaction (RTPCR). RTPCR products electrophoretic profiles were analyzed using the Jaccard coefficient and the UPGMA method. The majority of the clones had weak to moderate stem pitting symptoms and its CTV isolates showed alterations in the SSCP profiles. However, the stability of the protective complex has been maintained, except for isolates from two analised clones.

Significant variations were also recorded for two major constituents of essential oil such as citronellal and geraniol in some selected somaclones.

Out of the eighteen primers used, ten primers revealed polymorphism showing distinctly different banding patterns in the five improved somaclones, which were equally prominent in their differences from the control.
