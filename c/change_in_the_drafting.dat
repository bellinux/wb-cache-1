Therefore the organization for economic co-operation and de-velopment (OECD) have started the base erosion and profit shifting project which aims to prevent the exploiting of gaps and differences of regulations in different states in cross-border transactions. Within this project the documentation requirements are discussed, more specifically a potential harmonization of the requirements. 30 July 2013 a white paper on the subject was published which led to a suggested <b>draft</b> for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chapter V of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.

40|$|Casualties {{during the}} First World War were {{far higher than}} had been {{anticipated}} in pre-war planning. They required rapid replacement {{in order to maintain}} operational effectiveness. This Thesis considers the provision and management of British Other Rank replacements for Infantry battalions on the Western Front. The initial influx of volunteers meant a much larger Army, which in turn required an increased number of draft-finding units and changes to reinforcement procedures for its maintenance. It has previously been assumed that these changes, together with the introduction of conscription, destroyed the previous cohesion of regiments. A chronological approach is used in order to trace the evolution of changes. Although predominantly pitched at the management level, implicit in this examination are the effects of political decisions together with the impact on battalions of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> and reinforcement process. Amongst the conclusions reached are that {{there is little or no}} evidence that the Government actively withheld reinforcements.

40|$|<b>The</b> provinces have, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{absence of}} strong {{national}} leadership, national legislation and clear strategic direction {{over the past}} eight years, attempted to fill the vacuum with the introduction of their own legislative frameworks and policies. These generally differ from each other and from the policy direction given by the national Department of Health (NDoH) in February 2001. This chapter reviews <b>the</b> variations <b>in</b> current provincial legislation and strategic planning resulting from these uncoordinated processes. Expected <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next <b>draft</b> National Health Bill suggest that, with the exception of environmental health, which will become a local government responsibility, the remainder of PHC will be a provincial responsibility. Although provinces will remain responsible for the funding and planning of these PHC services, it is expected that over time they will be delegated to Metro (type A) and District (type C) Councils for implementation. In turn it is envisaged that District Councils will be able to delegate the rendering of services to Local Municipalities (type B). 8...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is a reform of the Polish Civil Code <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of {{contemporary}} tendencies to unify private law in Europe. <b>In</b> October 2008 <b>the</b> Civil Law Codifying Commission introduced <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> of Book I of the new code. <b>The</b> essential <b>changes</b> proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> include removal of general clauses of social coexistence principles and social-economic destination of a right, introduction of a reasonableness clause, and - with regards forms of the declaration of will - annulment of the ad, probationem form and introduction of a document form. The authors of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> refer to <b>the</b> non-binding uniform European principles of private law (PECL and PEL), and draw inspiration from <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> of a Common Frame of Reference (DCFR). Those regulations, prepared at the initiative of the European Union, were meant to create a basis for the introduction of a common European Civil Code for the Member States. That plan has never materialised, mainly {{because of the lack of}} legislative competence of <b>the</b> EU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of private law...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the Web, performance issues have come to the fore both on an intranet basis and on an Internet basis. Web performance impacts the popularity of a particular Web site or service as well as the load on the network. While Web caching has become popular and has been studied extensively, there have been no publically available end-to-end measurements that have focused on a large number of popular Web servers examining the components of delay or the effectiveness of the recent changes to <b>the</b> HTTP protocol. <b>In</b> this paper we report on an extensive study carried out from several client sites geographically distributed around the world to a collection of over 700 servers to which a majority of Web traffic is directed. Our results show that <b>the</b> primary <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recently <b>draft</b> standardized HTTP/ 1. 1 protocol are indeed useful but further examination is warranted.
