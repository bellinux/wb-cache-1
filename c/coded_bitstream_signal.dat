40|$|Abstract—For two-description image coding, a {{conventional}} scheme is to partition an image {{into two parts}} and then to produce each description by alternatively concatenating a finely <b>coded</b> <b>bitstream</b> of one part and a coarsely <b>coded</b> <b>bitstream</b> of the other part. This letter presents a new two-description image coding approach using steganography. Specifically, we propose forming each description by embedding (hiding) the coarsely coded part into the finely coded part based on a least-significant bit (LSB) steganographic method. In this way, the bit budget for the coarsely coded part in each description can be saved with little recon-struction degradation for the finely coded part if the embedding process is well designed. The experimental results substantiate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. Index Terms—Data embedding, image coding, multiple descrip-tion coding, steganography. I...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that the problem}} of addressing heterogeneous networks in multicast can be solved by simultaneous transmission of multiple bitstreams of different bitrates and by layered encoding. This paper analyzes the use of H. 264 /AVC video coding in simulcast and for layered encoding. The sub-sequence feature of H. 264 /AVC enables hierarchical temporal scalability, which allows disposal of reference pictures from a <b>coded</b> <b>bitstream</b> without affecting the decoding of the remaining stream. In this paper we extend the scope of the H. 264 /AVC sub-sequence coding technique to quality scalability. The resulting quality scalable coding technique is similar to conventional coarsegranularity quality scalability but fully compatible with the H. 264 /AVC standard. It is found that the proposed method drops bitrate consumption in the core network compared to simulcast up to 20 %.

Moreover, inevitable packet losses cannot be totally avoided and, hence, the video-streaming schemes should be complemented with appropriate error concealment techniques.

In particular, we show how the properties and the motion parameters of such pictures can be exploited for efficient video transcoding into lower resolutions and different encoding formats for pre-encoded video streams. At the decoder side, however, we also emphasize on the important role of the bidirectional prediction on interframe error concealment.
