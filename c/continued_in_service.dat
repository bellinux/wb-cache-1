5|$|Amazon <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> {{for several}} more years, being active in combating raiders and privateers, before being {{withdrawn}} from active service in late 1811. She was retained in ordinary until several {{years after the end}} of the Napoleonic Wars, when she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> {{under new}} owners. In 1885, her captain {{deliberately}} wrecked {{her off the}} coast of Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, {{and the name of the}} ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion.|$|E
5|$|Italia <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> through Italy's {{participation}} in World War I, from May 1915 to November 1918, initially as a guard ship in Brindisi. In December 1917, {{she was taken}} to La Spezia, where she was converted into a grain carrier, serving briefly with the Ministry of Transport in June 1919 before being transferred to the State Railways in July. The ship returned to the Navy in January 1921, but was stricken in November that year and sold for scrap.|$|E
25|$|The Congressional resolve of June 2, 1784, caused Major Doughty's Artillery Company to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>service,</b> as {{his company}} was the unit retained. To his company belongs the {{distinction}} of being the only element of the Continental Army to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> after the war as an element of the United States Army.|$|R

5|$|Production of the Heinkel {{continued}} {{after the}} war as the Spanish-built CASA 2.111. Spain received a batch of He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly in powerplant only, eventually being equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The Heinkel's descendant <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Bardulf {{began his}} royal service under King Henry II of England, {{where he was}} a steward to the royal household. He also served as a royal justice and a sheriff during Henry's reign, and {{continued}} as sheriff under Henry's son and successor, Richard I. Because Bardulf was a vassal of Richard's younger brother John, who rebelled against his older brother, Bardulf was denounced briefly as a traitor to Richard. He was quickly restored to royal service, however, and <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> throughout the rest of Richard's reign and into the reign of John. Bardulf died sometime before 1203, and his heir was his brother, Robert Bardulf.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1898, Montebello was {{withdrawn}} from front-line service and {{employed as a}} training ship for engine room personnel. In 1903, her boilers were replaced {{with a variety of}} coal and oil-burning boilers manufactured by Pattison, Yarrow, and Thornycroft to give trainees several types of equipment to operate. At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, Montebello was stationed in Venice along with Tripoli and Goito. None of the vessels saw action during the war. The ship did not see action after Italy entered World War I either, as both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian fleets adopted cautious strategies. Montebello <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> as a training ship until 26 January 1920, when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|On May 5, 1888, {{a second}} royal decree was issue, officializing the {{creation}} of the Banco Español de Puerto Rico, which received a charter validity of 25 years. This grant of authority was awarded to Enrique Vijande y Loredo, José Caldas y Caldas and Pablo Ubarri, the members composing this partnership. The bank wasn't established immediately, this was because the currency being used in Puerto Rico was Mexican silver, which created problems and delayed the establishment date until early 1890. Until this point, the Sociedad Anónima de Crédito Mercantil de Puerto Rico <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service,</b> before disappearing in April.|$|E
5|$|The new {{management}} linked {{the line with}} an existing coastal railway via Saltburn, running north of the Eston Hills, and closed the line west of Guisborough in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though part of the line <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> until 1966 as a freight route for a brickworks and carried passengers to Eston between 1902 and 1929. The NER constructed four passenger stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line in the 1870s. These were closed between 1958–1964 along with the section of the line from Guisborough to Brotton, but the easternmost part of the line is still in use today as a mineral railway.|$|E
5|$|During the World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Morava was the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division, and operated on the River Tisza. She fought off attacks by the Luftwaffe, and shot down one enemy aircraft, but {{was forced to}} withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigating monitors was difficult, and she was scuttled by her crew on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most surrendered on 14 April. The remainder {{made their way to}} the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. She was later raised by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, an Axis puppet state, and <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> as Bosna until June 1944, when she struck a mine and sank.|$|E

5|$|Within days of {{the action}} Hood had been {{promoted}} to rear-admiral and awarded a pension of £500 a year, but despite his wound he <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service,</b> fighting a notable action with Russian ships in the Baltic Sea in 1807 and later operating off the Spanish coast in the early Peninsular War. French efforts to resupply their West Indian colonies continued throughout the next three years, costing a heavy toll of men and ships lost to the British blockade. By 1808, {{the situation in the}} French Caribbean had become desperate and the French increased their supply convoys, losing five frigates and a ship of the line in failed reinforcement efforts during late 1808 and early 1809. The weakened colonies were unable to resist British attack, and co-ordinated invasions forced the surrender of first Martinique in January 1809 and Guadeloupe a year later, Cayenne and Santo Domingo also falling to British, Spanish and Portuguese forces.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain's coastal defences {{depended}} on extensive barriers constructed along the shores, combined {{with large numbers}} of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover. Several of the Device Forts were brought back into service in this way. Pendennis, St Catherine's, St Mawes and Walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries, Calshot and Hurst were rearmed with naval guns and anti-aircraft defences, and Sandsfoot was used as an anti-aircraft battery. Southsea <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service,</b> and was involved in Operation Grasp, which seized the French fleet in 1940. Others were used as support facilities; Yarmouth was requisitioned for military use; Portland was used for accommodation, offices and as an ordnance store, and West Cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of the D-Day landings. Camber was used as an early warning and decoy site to distract raids from nearby Rye. Early in the war a German bomber destroyed much of the captain's quarters at Deal, forcing William Birdwood to move to Hampton Court Palace. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was appointed as the captain of Walmer Castle during the war, but declined {{to use it as a}} residence, noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain, and that it lay within the range of German artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Batavi, a Germanic tribe, {{inhabited}} the region today known as Gelderland (Netherlands), in the Rhine river delta, {{then known as}} the Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi", because surrounded by branches of the Rhine), part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. They were a warlike people, skilled horsemen, boatmen and swimmers. In return for the unusual privilege of exemption from tributum (direct taxes on land and heads normally exacted from peregrini), they supplied {{a disproportionate number of}} recruits to the Julio-Claudian auxilia: one ala and eight cohortes. They also provided most of Augustus' elite personal bodyguard unit (the Germani corpore custodes), which <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> until 68AD. The Batavi auxilia amounted to about 5,000 men, implying that during the entire Julio-Claudian period, over 50% of all Batavi males reaching military age (16 years) may have enlisted in the auxilia. Thus the Batavi, although just 0.05% of the total population of the empire of c. 70 million in 23AD, supplied about 4% of the total auxilia i.e. 80 times their proportionate share. They were regarded by the Romans as the very best (fortissimi, validissimi) of their auxiliary, and indeed all, their forces. In Roman service, both their cavalry and infantry had perfected a technique for swimming across rivers wearing full armour and weapons.|$|E

25|$|Murtaja {{survived the}} war without major damage and <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> through the interwar period. As new icebreakers entered {{service in the}} 1920s, she was {{stationed}} in Turku, the second official winter port.|$|E
25|$|However, the H6K became {{vulnerable}} to a newer generation of heavier armed and faster fighters. It <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> throughout the war, {{in areas where the}} risk of interception was low. In front-line service, it was replaced by the Kawanishi H8K.|$|E
