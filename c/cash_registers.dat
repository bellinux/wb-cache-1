A mobile-capable version of the device utilizing HSPA+ cellular technology with 32 GB of storage was later introduced in October 2012 for $299.

5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Cranor spent $42 million {{restructuring}} the company's operations worldwide. He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E

Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million.

25|$|Price Chopper was {{an early}} {{innovator}} in the conversion of conventional stores to superstores and combination (food and drug) units, as well as operating stores that are open 24 hours a day. The first Price Chopper opened in the late 1970s in Oneonta, NY followed by another in the early 1980s in Latham, New York, and then an even larger unit constructed in Queensbury, in 1986. The Super Centers, which were {{state of the art}} by 1980s standards, often featured full-service meat, seafood, and bakery departments, as well as pharmacies and banks (features new to supermarkets at the time). These units were also known for their unconventional layouts with aisles facing horizontally, or away from the <b>cash</b> <b>registers,</b> rather than the traditional vertical arrangement with the aisles facing the cash register area. Very few Price Chopper stores still retain this layout today. In the late 1980s Price Chopper changed its corporate logo. The aforementioned logo featured a morgan silver dollar like coin with an axe chopping into the coin. Women's advocates complained the logo promoted violence against women. Price chopper now features an axe cutting into a generic looking coin with no obverse image.|$|E
500|$|Each side of {{the album}} is a {{continuous}} piece of music. [...] The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring {{the nature of the}} human experience, and (according to Waters) [...] "empathy". [...] "Speak to Me" [...] and [...] "Breathe" [...] together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life – [...] "Don't be afraid to care". [...] By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental [...] "On the Run" [...] evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. [...] "Time" [...] examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in [...] "Breathe (Reprise)". The first {{side of the}} album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] Opening with the sound of <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> and loose change, the first track on side two, [...] "Money", mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, [...] "Money" [...] has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands). [...] "Us and Them" [...] addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. [...] "Any Colour You Like" [...] concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. [...] "Brain Damage" [...] looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line [...] "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" [...] reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. [...] The album ends with [...] "Eclipse", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.|$|E
