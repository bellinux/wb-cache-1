50|$|Electrodynamic droplet {{deformation}} also {{of particular}} interest in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>processing</b> as a method to improve the separation rate of water and salts from the bulk. In its unprocessed form, crude oil cannot be used directly in industrial processes because the presence of salts can corrode heat exchangers and distillation equipment. To avoid fouling due to these impurities {{it is necessary to}} first remove the salt, which is concentrated in suspended water droplets. Exposing batches of crude oil to both DC and AC high-voltage electric fields induces droplet deformation that ultimately causes the water droplets to coalesce into larger droplets. Droplet coalescence improves the separation rate of water from crude oil because the upward velocity of a sphere is proportional to the square of the sphere’s radius. This can be easily shown by considering gravitational force, buoyancy, and Stokes flow drag. It has been reported that increasing both the amplitude and frequency of the applied electric fields can significantly increases water separation up to 90%.|$|E

The downstream sector touches consumers through products such as gasoline or petrol, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil, heating oil, fuel oils, lubricants, waxes, asphalt, natural gas, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as well as hundreds of petrochemicals.

40|$|The {{introduction}} to {{the issues of the}} economics of the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises (refine- ry) and the analysis {{of the relationship between the}} crude oil price (the input of the refinery) and the prices of selected oil products (the output of the refinery) in the year of 2006 is the basic target of this paper. The stock quotation prices of the selected oil products (ULSD - diesel fuel, PREM UNL - gasoli- ne „BA 95 Natural“ and HSFO 3. 5 % S - heavy fuel oil with up to 3. 5 % sulphur) on the basis of FOB Barges Rotterdam (traded on the commodity stock exchange in Rotterdam) and the prices of the North Sea crude oil Brent are used in this analysis. The prices are quoted in US dollar. The prices are analyzed by the means of regression and correlation analysis. The term „refinery margin“ and its application in practical use with reference to the production configuration of the crude oil processor are explained in this article. The regression functions can be used for predic- tion of the oil products prices trend. These functions could be essentially changed in future with reference to the relevant changes on the fuel products market (for example a strong shift to fuels with biological components) or due to the decrease of the importance of crude oil as a natural resource. Furthermore, the popular oil peak theory by geologist Hubbert is presented here. It is possible to say that it would be fine to think about other economic issues, concerning the crude oil industry economics - the negative externalities related to the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>processing</b> and the fossil fuels consumption...|$|E
30|$|Even though {{selective}} oxidation is {{a direct}} and economic route to convert aromatic hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals, the scenario for heterocyclic aromatics is a little different. Oxidation with air of these compounds as a synthesis route to obtain added value products is not reported in standard texts [42, 43]. Their oxidation chemistry is rather discussed {{as part of the}} <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>processing</b> and fuel stability. For instance, sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds are typically undesired materials in crude oil. The oxidation of these compounds (i.e., oxidative desulfurization and oxidative denitrogenation) to give chemically modified products with properties that favor their separation or removal has been explored [44, 45]. Furthermore, it is known that autoxidation of nitrogen heterocyclic aromatics plays a role in the formation of heavy addition products, e.g., nitrogen-containing compounds seem to be related with the formation of sludge in fuels [46], thereby affecting fuel storage stability.|$|E
40|$|The {{breakup of}} crude oil {{emulsions}} to produce clean oil and water phases is an important task in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>processing.</b> We have investigated the demulsification kinetics of a model oil-in-water emulsion in a centrifugal field to mimic the forces acting on emulsion droplets in oil/water separators such as hydrocyclones. The {{rate of growth of}} separated oil phase and the change in mean droplet diameter of the emulsion layer was measured as a function of surfactant concentration, centrifugal acceleration and time. Demulsification is enhanced with increasing centrifugal acceleration and time and decreasing surfactant concentration. A kinetic analysis was performed that allows to estimate the characteristic coalescence times between droplets in the emulsion and between a droplet and the separated oil interface. The experimental procedure presented in this work can serve as a simple, but useful test to predict the separation efficiency of emulsions in separators with swirling flow fields...|$|E
50|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is usually divided into three major sectors: upstream, midstream and downstream. The downstream sector is the refining of petroleum <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and the <b>processing</b> and purifying of raw natural gas, as well as the marketing and distribution of products derived from <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas. The downstream sector reaches consumers through products such as gasoline or petrol, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil, heating oil, fuel oils, lubricants, waxes, asphalt, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as well as hundreds of petrochemicals.|$|R
50|$|The {{usage and}} pricing of {{gasoline}} (or petrol) results from {{factors such as}} <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices, <b>processing</b> and distribution costs, local demand, the strength of local currencies, local taxation, {{and the availability of}} local sources of gasoline (supply). Since fuels are traded worldwide, the trade prices are similar. The price paid by consumers largely reflects national pricing policy. Some regions, such as Europe and Japan, impose high taxes on gasoline (petrol); others, such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, subsidize the cost. Western countries have among the highest usage rates per person. The largest consumer is the United States, which used an average of 368 million US gallons (1.46 gigalitres) each day in 2011.|$|R

If the gas required further processing or needed to be piped a long distance to market, the producer shut in the well. Flares got rid of gas coming from oil wells.|$|R
