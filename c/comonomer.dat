25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a <b>comonomer</b> {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing <b>comonomer</b> content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with <b>comonomer</b> content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|Ethylene/{{vinyl alcohol}} {{copolymer}} (EVOH) is (formally) a copolymer of PE and vinyl alcohol (ethenol), which is prepared by (partial) hydrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (as vinyl alcohol {{itself is not}} stable). However, typically EVOH has a higher <b>comonomer</b> content than the VAC commonly used.|$|E
25|$|In this way, {{approximately}} one billion kilograms of polycarbonate is produced annually. Many other diols {{have been tested}} in place of bisphenol A, e.g. 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane and dihydroxybenzophenone. The cyclohexane {{is used as a}} <b>comonomer</b> to suppress crystallisation tendency of the BPA-derived product. Tetrabromobisphenol A is used to enhance fire resistance. Tetramethylcyclobutanediol has been developed as a replacement for BPA.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Comonomers</b> {{are often}} {{employed}} {{to improve the}} plastification of polymeric materials, i.e. {{the flexibility of the}} polymer. Unlike traditional plasticizers, <b>comonomers</b> are not leachable. In other cases, <b>comonomers</b> are used to introduce crosslinking. Divinylbenzene, for example, when copolymerized with styrene, gives a crosslinked polystyrene.|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer. The <b>comonomer</b> is {{typically}} used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|If {{unsaturated}} esters are copolymerized with ethylene, {{either the}} alcohol moiety {{may be in}} the polymer backbone (as it is the case in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer). Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of <b>comonomer</b> has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Metallocene {{polyethylene}} (PE-M) {{is prepared}} {{by means of}} metallocene catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform <b>comonomer</b> content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} fumaric esters and amides having bulky substituents were prepared, and their homo- and copolymerisations with electron-rich <b>comonomers</b> were investigated. As the {{resulting}} polymers are characterised by rather stiff polymer backbones, they represent weakly amphiphilic polymers of the ''hairy rod'' type which are accessible by radical polymerisation. The spreading behaviour at the air-water interface was studied, {{with respect to}} the influence of the substituents and of the <b>comonomers</b> used on monolayer properties...|$|R
25|$|<b>Comonomers</b> such as {{methacrylic acid}} {{can be added}} to {{increase}} the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications.|$|R
25|$|A {{small amount}} of {{acrylate}} <b>comonomers</b> are routinely used in PMMA grades destined for heat processing, since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ("unzipping") during processing.|$|R
25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of <b>comonomer</b> (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

50|$|Methyl {{acrylate}} {{is used as}} a <b>comonomer</b> in the polymerization with {{a variety}} of acrylic and vinyl monomers. In doing so it has a similar range of uses as ethyl acrylate. When using methyl acrylate as <b>comonomer</b> resulting acrylic paints are harder and more brittle than those with the homologous acrylates. Copolymerizing methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile improves their melt processability to fibers, which could be used as precursors for carbon fibers.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{sequential}} copolymerization {{strategy was}} investigated for preparing macromolecules with programmed sequences of functional <b>comonomers.</b> Four different N-substituted maleimides (N-propyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide, N-methyl maleimide, and N-[3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] maleimide) were consecutively added during the atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene performed at 110 degrees C {{in the presence}} of a catalyst composed of copper(I) bromide and 4, 4 '-dinonyl) - 2, 2 '-bipyridine. Owing to the exceptional cross-propagation of N-substituted maleimides with styrene, the four functional <b>comonomers</b> could be sequentially incorporated in the growing polymer chains...|$|R
40|$|N-Ethylmaleimide(EtM) copolymerizes {{easily with}} vinylmonomers at 30 ℃ 	under {{ultraviolet}} irradiation. On the 	other hand，no copolymerization occurs at 30 ℃ under 	dark condition. <b>Comonomers</b> used are methylmethacry 1 ate， 	ethylmethacrylate，n-butylmethacrylate，i-butylmethacrylate 	ethylvinylether，n-butylvinylether，styrene，α-methylstyrene 	and N-vinylpyrrolidone. 	The rates of copolymerization of EtM with styrenes and 	vinylethers {{are higher than}} those of EtM with methacry 1 ates. 	Among <b>comonomers</b> N-vinylpyrrolidone has extremelyhigh rate， 	which is ascribable to the excitation of complex suggested 	by UV spectrum. 	Copolymers have high molecular weight except for those 	obtained from α-methylstyrene and N-vinylpyrro 1 idone，and 	have an alternating structure except for those from methacrylates...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary use}} of 1-hexene is as a <b>comonomer</b> in {{production}} of polyethylene. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) use approximately 2-4% and 8-10% of comonomers, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{compatibility}} of polyethylene (PE) with a functionalized graphene sheet (FGS), {{which was}} {{prepared by the}} thermal reduction of graphite oxide, was examined in this study. The dispersion of the FGS in the PE was improved as the molecular weight of the PE was decreased. The PE copolymers containing polar <b>comonomers</b> such as maleic anhydride or acrylic acid exhibited better compatibility with FGS than the PE homopolymers. The compatibility of the FGS with PE copolymers containing small amounts of <b>comonomers,</b> which have a solubility parameter slightly larger [up to approximately 0. 5 (J/cm 3) 1 / 2] than that of PE itself, {{was better than the}} compatibility of both the PE and PE copolymers containing larger amounts of <b>comonomers.</b> The morphology, electric conductivity, and tensile properties of FGS/PE copolymer/PE nanocomposites showed that the copolymers with a solubility parameter slightly larger than that of PE effectively served as a compatibilizer in FGS/PE nanocomposites...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} chain disruptors, both novel and existing, as <b>comonomers</b> on the {{transition}} temperatures of liquid crystalline polymers was investigated. Novel <b>comonomers</b> prepared from cost effective natural {{materials such as}} cardanol and copolymerised with 4 -hydroxy benzoic acid (4 -HBA) showed a decrease in transition temperature, but the polyesters started decomposing prior to melting except the bromine containing polyester. Copolyesters of 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4 -HyPA) and 4 -hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (4 -HyPP) with 4 -HBA showed fairly good nematic texture with comparatively high thermal stability indicating possibility for further studies. The effects of azophenyl group and di-amide links were also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|The {{nomenclature}} {{used for}} nylon polymers was devised during {{the synthesis of}} the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to describe the number of carbons between acid and amine functions (including the carbon of the carboxylic acid). Subsequent use of cyclic and aromatic monomers required the use of letters or sets of letters. One number after [...] "PA" [...] for a homopolymer based on one monomer, and two numbers or sets of letters where there are two monomers. For copolymers the <b>comonomers</b> or pairs of <b>comonomers</b> are separated by slashes, {{as shown in the}} examples below.|$|R
50|$|Copolymerization is {{the process}} of {{combining}} two polymers that are different. This is an industrial process that creates a substance that has long chains of molecules. In terms of ROP, the stoichiometric equation for copolymerization includes two or more of <b>comonomers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In polymer chemistry, a <b>comonomer</b> refers a polymerizable {{precursor}} to a copolymer {{aside from the}} principal monomer. In some cases, only small amounts of a <b>comonomer</b> are employed, in other cases substantial amounts of comonomers are used. Furthermore, in some cases, the comonomers are statistically incorporated within the polymer chain, whereas in other cases, they aggregate. The distribution of comonomers {{is referred to as}} the [...] "blockiness" [...] of a copolymer. 1-Octene, 1-hexene, and 1-butene are widely used comonomers in the manufacture of polyethylenes. The advantages to such copolymers has led to a focus on catalysts that facilitate the incorporation of these comonomers, e.g., constrained geometry complexes.|$|E

40|$|By {{combined}} {{light scattering}} and circular dichroism measurements (CD), we {{have investigated the}} coil-toglobule transition of the thermosensitive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) copolymerized with a 1 / 10 fraction of valine- or leucine-derived groups randomly positioned along the chains. The <b>comonomers</b> provide the pNIPAAm chains with chirality, electric charge, and increased hydrophobicity. For valine-derived copolymers, the coil-globule transition is basically unmodified with respect to pNIPAAm, whereas doping with leucine-derived groups significantly lowers the transition temperature and makes the transition discontinuous. We find the CD signal of the chiral <b>comonomers</b> to cleanly depend on the local chain density. We interpret this behavior as an effect of the whole chain conformation on the conformations accessible to the chiral groups...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "blockiness" [...] of a {{copolymer}} is {{a measure}} of the adjacency of <b>comonomers</b> vs their statistical distribution. Many or even most synthetic polymers are in fact copolymers, containing about 1-20% of a minority monomer. In such cases, blockiness is undesirable.|$|R
