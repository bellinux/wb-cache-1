5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, the largest being the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> lipoma {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} brain {{condition that}} may or may not present with symptoms. This occurs in the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> also known as the calossal commissure, which is a wide, flat bundle of neural fibers beneath the cortex in the human brain.|$|E
25|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown {{patients}} with Niemann-Pick, type C to have a <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> with microstructural abnormalities. Clear reductions in <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> mean thickness and surface area have been shown when compared to age-matched controls. Also, studies using diffusion tensor imaging have shown marked reductions in callosal fractional anisotropy, which suggests architectural abnormalities based on the directional flow of water. These conclusions suggest that the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> {{plays an important role}} in the disease and should be explored for use as a biomarker of disease progression.|$|E
25|$|One of Fechner's speculations about {{consciousness}} {{dealt with}} brain. During his time, {{it was known}} that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical {{and that there is}} a deep division between the two halves that are linked by a connecting band of fibers called the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b> Fechner speculated that if the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> were split, two separate streams of consciousness would result - the mind would become two. Yet, Fechner believed that his theory would never be tested; he was incorrect. During the mid-twentieth century, Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga worked on epileptic patients with sectioned <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> and observed that Fechner's idea was correct.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Dr. Clarren {{described}} a second infant whose {{mother was a}} binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.|$|E
25|$|Arachnoid cysts {{can also}} occur {{secondary}} to other {{disorders such as}} Marfan syndrome, arachnoiditis, or agenesis of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ‘other’ {{types are}} {{associated}} with <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> agenesis or cerebellar hypoplasia while the cobblestone lissencephalies {{are associated with}} eye and muscle disorders.|$|E
25|$|The <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> {{transfers}} information {{between the}} left and right cerebral hemispheres. The <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks. Furthermore, previous research has found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Separating the {{anterior}} horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum: a thin, triangular, vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> {{down to the}} fornix. During the third month of fetal development, a space forms between two septal laminae, known as the cave of septum pellucidum (CSP), which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment. During the fifth month of development, the laminae start to close and this closure completes from about {{three to six months}} after birth. Fusion of the septal laminae is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus, amygdala, septal nuclei, fornix, <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> and other midline structures. Lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior-to-anterior fusion, resulting in the continuation of the CSP into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{there is a}} smaller McGurk effect exhibited than in normals. Often a reduced size of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> produces a hemisphere disconnection process. Less influence on visual stimulus is seen in {{patients with}} AD, which is {{a reason for the}} lowered McGurk effect.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{abnormalities}} {{of the brain}} are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) {{of two or more}} standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> cerebellar hypoplasia).|$|E
25|$|Variants of the {{androgen}} receptor (AR) gene {{have also been}} discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the AR gene, {{which in turn is}} associated with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> is supported by this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Linnaeus {{described}} birds as: A {{beautiful and}} cheerful portion of created nature consisting of animals having a body covered with feathers and down; protracted and naked jaws (the beak), two wings formed for flight, and two feet. They are areal, vocal, swift and light, and destitute of external ears, lips, teeth, scrotum, womb, bladder, epiglottis, <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> and its arch, and diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the recent}} advent of {{non-invasive}} medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers {{to discover how}} language works in the brain. For example, severing the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy. Researchers could then study {{the ways in which}} the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.|$|E
25|$|Classical lissencephaly, {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b> Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|Willis was {{the first}} to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually {{enumerated}} by anatomists. He noted the parallel lines of the mesolobe (<b>corpus</b> <b>callosum),</b> afterwards minutely described by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr. He seems to have recognised the communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the lateral cavities beneath the fornix. He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they make with the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies showed}} {{evidence}} {{that there may be}} an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse. A neuropsychological study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the brain, which is largely responsible for processing emotions. In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex. These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|To {{localize}} INMT, {{a qualitative}} leap is accomplished {{with use of}} modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum).</b> Immunohistochemistry showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E
500|$|The {{parts of}} the brain most {{affected}} by rotational forces are the midbrain and diencephalon. [...] It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas, and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion. [...] Other areas of the brain that may be affected include {{the upper part of the}} brain stem, the fornix, the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> the temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe. Angular accelerations of 4600, 5900, or 7900 radian/s2 are estimated to have 25, 50, or 80% risk of MTBI respectively.|$|E
500|$|A {{substantial}} part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres {{has come from the}} study of [...] "split-brain patients"—people who underwent surgical transection of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures. These patients do not show unusual behavior that is immediately obvious, but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body, with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it. These patients, when briefly shown a picture {{on the right side of}} the point of visual fixation, are able to describe it verbally, but when the picture is shown on the left, are unable to describe it, but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown.|$|E
500|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain, and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a deep groove, the longitudinal fissure. The outer part of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex, made up of grey matter arranged in layers. It is [...] thick, and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance. Beneath the cortex is the white matter of the brain. The largest part of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex, which has six neuronal layers. The rest of the cortex is of allocortex, which has three or four layers. The hemispheres are connected by five commissures that span the longitudinal fissure, the largest of these is the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b> The surface of the brain is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci), many of which are named, usually according to their position, such as the frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe or the central sulcus separating the central regions of the hemispheres. There are many small variations in the secondary and tertiary folds.|$|E

2500|$|Another study led by Shanghai-based East China Normal University's Department of Physics, [...] "The <b>Corpus</b> <b>Callosum</b> of Albert Einstein's Brain: Another Clue to His High Intelligence", {{published}} in the journal Brain On September 24, 2013, showed a new technique to conduct the study, which is the first to detail Einstein's <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> the brain's largest bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication. [...] Einstein's <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> was thicker than those in control groups, possibly indicating better cooperation between the hemispheres. Scientists currently cannot tell how far the unusual features above were innate or how far they were due to Einstein devoting his life to higher thought.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{possible}} {{symptoms of}} lissencephaly include telecanthus, estropia, hypertelorism, {{varying levels of}} mental retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> aplasia, and decreased muscle tone and tendon reflexes. [...] Over 90% of children affected with lissencephaly have seizures.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Brain [...] in September 2013 analyzed Einstein's <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> - a large bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication in the brain - using a novel technique that allowed for a higher resolution measurement of the fiber thickness. Einstein's <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> was compared to two sample groups: [...] 15 brains of elderly people and 52 brains from people aged 26. [...] Einstein was 26 in 1905, his Annus Mirabilis (Miracle Year). The findings show that [...] Einstein had more extensive connections between certain parts of his cerebral hemispheres compared to both younger and older control group brains.|$|E
2500|$|Lesions {{typically}} {{exist in}} the white matter of brains injured by DAI; these lesions vary in size [...] from about 1–15mm and are distributed in a characteristic way. [...] DAI most commonly affects white matter in areas including the brain stem, the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> and the cerebral hemispheres.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} {{that there may be}} neurological indicators of early onset dysthymia. [...] There are several brain structures (<b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> and frontal lobe) that are different in women with dysthymia than in those without dysthymia. [...] This may indicate that there is a developmental difference between these two groups.|$|E
2500|$|DAI is {{classified}} into grades based on {{severity of the}} injury. [...] In Grade I, widespread axonal damage is present but no focal abnormalities are seen. [...] In Grade II, damage found in Grade I is present in addition to focal abnormalities, especially in the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b> [...] Grade III damage encompasses both Grades I and II plus rostral brain stem injury and often tears in the tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Peek {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah with macrocephaly, damage to the cerebellum, and {{agenesis}} of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> {{a condition in which}} the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the anterior commissure were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons made unusual connections due to the absence of a <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> which resulted in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16–20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye. [...] According to an article in The Times newspaper, he could accurately recall the contents of at least 12,000 books.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been shown that {{bilingualism}} affects the white matter of the brain, expressed as increased myelination of a series of white matter tracts, including the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum,</b> in sequential adult bilinguals that are active users of their second language. It is thought that these effects are due to the cognitively demanding skill of handling more than one languages, which requires more efficient connectivity between areas in the grey matter of the brain. Similar effects have been found in lifelong elderly bilinguals [...] and simultaneous bilingual children.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cases have}} {{injury to the}} {{occipital}} and temporal lobes and the critical site of injury {{appears to be in}} the left occipito-temporal region, often with involvement of the splenium of the <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum.</b> The etiology of the cognitive impairment, as well the areas of the brain affected by lesions and stage of recovery are the primary determinants of the pattern of deficit. [...] More generalized recognition impairments, such as, animate object deficits, are associated with diffuse hypoxic damage, like carbon monoxide poisoning; more selective deficits are correlated with more isolated damage due to focal stroke.|$|E
2500|$|The fate of polydendrocytes {{has been}} highly debated. [...] Using Cre-Lox recombination-mediated genetic fate mapping, several labs have {{reported}} {{the fate of}} polydendrocytes using different Cre driver and reporter mouse lines; reviewed in reference. [...] The consensus of these studies is that polydendrocytes generate predominantly oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter. [...] The rate at which they generate oligodendrocytes declines with age and is greater in white matter than in gray matter. [...] These studies revealed that up to 30% of the oligodendrocytes {{that exist in the}} adult <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> are generated de novo from polydendrocytes over a period of 2 months. [...] It is not known whether all polydendrocytes eventually generate oligodendrocytes while self-renewing its population or whether some remain as polydendrocytes throughout the life of the animal and never differentiate into oligodendrocytes.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{traumatic}} stress, including stress caused by sexual abuse, causes notable changes in brain functioning and development. Various {{studies have suggested that}} severe child sexual abuse may have a deleterious effect on brain development. Ito et al. (1998) found [...] "reversed hemispheric asymmetry and greater left hemisphere coherence in abused subjects;" [...] Teicher et al. (1993) found that an increased likelihood of [...] "ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms" [...] in abused subjects; Anderson et al. (2002) recorded abnormal transverse relaxation time in the cerebellar vermis of adults sexually abused in childhood; Teicher et al. (1993) found that child sexual abuse was associated with a reduced <b>corpus</b> <b>callosum</b> area; various studies have found an association of reduced volume of the left hippocampus with child sexual abuse; and Ito et al. (1993) found increased electrophysiological abnormalities in sexually abused children.|$|E
