40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{necessary}} optimality <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> optimal <b>control</b> problems with nonlinear and nonsmooth implicit control systems. Implicit control systems have wide applications including differential algebraic equations (DAEs). The {{challenge in the}} study of implicit control system lies in that the system may be truly implicit, i. e., the Jacobian matrix of the constraint mapping may be singular. Our necessary optimality conditions hold under the so-called weak basic constraint qualification plus the calmness of a perturbed constraint mapping. Such constraint qualifications allow for singularity of the Jacobian and hence is suitable for implicit systems. Specifying these results to control of semi-explicit DAEs we obtain necessary optimality <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>control</b> of semi-explicit DAEs with index higher than one.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with transient global amnesia (TGA) experience a depressive mood during the episode. However, little evidence has been found of possible mood congruency effects on memory, which are probably masked by the massive anterograde amnesia. An implicit assessment could provide a means of settling this question. First, we measured patients' emotional states on psychopathological scales. Second, we administered a lexical decision task to assess three priming effects: Semantic priming (SP; table-chair), emotional priming (EP; murder-garbage), and emotional plus semantic priming (ESP; cemetery-coffin). Patients displayed a more depressed mood than <b>controls.</b> <b>For</b> patients, we found a SP effect in the ESP condition and a striking inhibition effect (i. e., negative target recognized more slowly when preceded by a negative prime rather than a neutral one) in the EP <b>condition.</b> <b>For</b> <b>controls,</b> a priming effect was found in the SP and ESP conditions, but not the EP condition. Finally, whereas the priming effect was greater in SP than in the other two <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>controls,</b> <b>for</b> patients it was the EP condition that stood out from the other two, being the only condition that led to an inhibition effect. We highlighted a mood congruency effect in TGA which could impel patients to focus their attention on negative information. While the negative valence of items always led to a slowdown in reaction times for both patients and controls, attesting to a negativity bias, this bias was greater in patients, leading to an inhibition effect...|$|R
