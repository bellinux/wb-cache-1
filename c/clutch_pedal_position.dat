40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle is presented in this paper. A four wheel drive parallel hybrid electric vehicle is built by assembling an auxiliary electrical machine and battery group. Some preliminary instrumentation such as accelerator pedal, brake, <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> sensors and gear ratio estimation are realized to split torque demand into the two power sources. The first power source is {{the internal combustion engine}} and the second one is the permanent magnet electric motor. A rule-based control strategy is developed by setting transition rules between the two power sources. The control strategy is implemented on a proof-of-concept vehicle and road tested. In order to satisfy smooth transient switching between the two power sources, and in order not to disturb the driver by abrupt or retarded transitions, torque splitting is achieved by taking the power source dynamics and vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal direction into account. The internal combustion engine is not operated at its high emission and low fuel efficient regions. Regenerative braking is implemented to charge the electric motor battery pack during braking. 8 page(s...|$|E
50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left twist grip while the right twist grip advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust valve lifter, and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>positioned</b> on the left side of the bike.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of the free <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> {{adjustment}} on <b>clutching</b> movements of the left lower limb {{as well as on the}} perceived discomfort. Six automotive <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> configurations were tested by 20 subjects (5 young females, 5 young males, 5 older females, 5 older males) using a multiadjustable experimental mock-up. Results showed that the <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> was adjusted to ensure a good starting <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> allowing a less flexed ankle and avoiding unnecessary leg displacement from the foot rest to the position at start depression. <b>Pedal</b> <b>position</b> adjustment seemed not motivated by reducing joint torque though discomfort ratings were found significantly correlated with knee and ankle torques at the end of depression. The present work also illustrates that the less-constrained motion concept is helpful for a better understanding of people preference and useful for identifying motionrelated biomechanical parameters to be considered for defining assessment criteria...|$|R

50|$|When {{the driver}} stops the vehicle on an incline where {{the nose of}} the car is {{sufficiently}} higher than the rear of the car, the system is engaged when the driver's foot is depressing the brake pedal, and then the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is fully depressed. Once set, the driver must keep the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> fully depressed but may remove the foot from the brake pedal. To disengage the system and move the car forward, the driver selects first gear, gently depresses the fuel pedal, and slowly releases the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> which at a point in its travel releases the braking system, allowing the car to proceed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} develop objective discomfort evaluation indicators for a task oriented motion using the concept of less constrained movement. The basic idea is to compare imposed and less constrained movements {{in order to identify}} relevant biomechanical parameters for defining objective discomfort indicators. The task of automotive <b>pedal</b> <b>clutching</b> was chosen for illustrating the proposed method. Based on discomfort questionnaire and motion analysis of the experimental data, four discomfort indicators were proposed. Two of them were based on the ankle joint angle around flexion/extension axis at {{the beginning and the end}} of the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> depression. The third one was defined using knee flexion/extension joint torque at the end of the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> depression. The last indicator was defined as the relative lateral position of the heel compared to the average <b>pedal</b> lateral <b>position</b> for less constrained configurations. A global discomfort function was also defined as a weighted sum of all indicators. Globally, the proposed global discomfort indicator succeeded in differentiating the tested configurations in agreement with experimental observation. As expected, less discomfort rating is obtained for less constrained movement when compared with the corresponding imposed one...|$|R

50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{instead of on the}} floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R

50|$|Other {{engineering}} {{improvements that}} modernized the 1961 Larks included {{the introduction of}} cowl ventilation, suspended brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> (accompanied by a firewall-mounted brake master cylinder) and revamped steering systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{gear stick}} (rarely spelled gearstick), gear lever (both UK English), {{gearshift}} or shifter (US English) is a metal lever {{attached to the}} shift assembly in a manual transmission-equipped automobile and is used to change gears. In an automatic transmission-equipped vehicle, a similar device {{is known as a}} gear selector. A gear stick will normally be used to change gear whilst depressing the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> with the left foot to disengage the engine from the drivetrain and wheels. Automatic transmission vehicles, semi-automatic transmissions, and those with continuously variable transmission gearboxes do not require a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
30|$|Usage {{of manual}} gearbox: Clutch wear {{is reduced by}} {{choosing}} a low starting gear and a correct handling of the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b> When cruising, the vehicle should be operated at a high gear.|$|R
5000|$|Double-clutching {{allows the}} driver to control the engine and {{transmission}} revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) {{just the right amount}} in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. [...] "Skip changing" [...] is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.|$|R
50|$|Line locks {{are often}} used for burnouts by fully locking the front wheels and then {{engaging}} the gas pedal and disengaging the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal,</b> this makes the rear tires spin but keeps the car stationary.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{options are}} either a Lamborghini-sourced six-speed manual gearbox with metal gate for the shift lever, or an Audi-developed R Tronic gearbox—which is a semi-automatic, without a traditional <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> with automatic gears shifting mode.|$|R
50|$|The 'Sensonic' clutch variant, (available on Turbo models only) {{provided}} a manual gear lever as {{in a standard}} manual transmission car, but omitted the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> in favor of electronics which could control the clutch faster than an average driver.|$|R
5000|$|The Freelander TD4_e {{features}} stop-start {{technology to}} improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions. The system cuts out the engine when {{the vehicle is}} stationary, neutral is selected and the clutch engaged; the engine restarts when the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed.|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{is fully}} released, the clutch is fully engaged {{and all of}} the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, the clutch does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1940 model, Oldsmobile was {{the first}} auto {{manufacturer}} to offer a fully automatic transmission, called the [...] "Hydramatic", which features four forward speeds. It has a gas pedal and a brake—no <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b> The gear selector is on the steering column.|$|R
50|$|It also {{features}} a realistic manual transmission mode (including a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{and the possibility of}} stalling the car should one mis-shift) and force feedback steering wheel, in which the driver would have to properly operate the car as they would in real life.|$|R
