50|$|The eponym <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{was named}} after its discoverers: Josef Christ (1871-1948), a German dentist and {{physician}} from Wiesbaden, {{who was the first}} physician to identify the condition, Hermann Werner Siemens (1891-1969), a pioneering German dermatologist from Charlottenburg, who clearly identified its pathological characteristics in the early 1930s, and Albert Touraine (1883-1961), a French dermatologist who likewise noted and identified additional characteristics of the disease in the late 1930s.|$|E
40|$|<b>Christ–Siemens–Touraine</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a form}} of anhidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (ED) characterized by triad of hypodontia, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis. Palmoplantar keratoderma is a characteristic feature of hidrotic forms of ED. Till date, only two cases have been reported of <b>Christ–Siemens–Touraine</b> <b>syndrome</b> with palmoplantar keratoderma; here we report a similar case emphasizing this rare association...|$|E
40|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} {{exhibits a}} classic triad of hypohidrosis, hypotrichosis, and hypodontia. Self- mutilation {{could be due}} to organic or functional causes. The occurrence of self-mutilation with functional cause represents a diagnostic challenge to practitioners. In most of the instances dentists are the first to recognize patient with ectodermal dysplasia as they report primarily with a complaint of missing teeth. The most common type is hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome).</b> A thorough knowledge of this disease with multidisciplinary approach aids in successful outcome of the treatment. This is an unusual case report of <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome</b> with self-mutilation...|$|E
40|$|Ectodermal dysplasias {{are a large}} {{hereditary}} {{group of}} disorders which are usually manifested as X-linked recessive disorders and have a full expression in males, whereas females show little to no signs of the disorder. The two most common types of ectodermal dysplasias are hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (Clouston syndrome). Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by hypodontia, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis. Here, we present two female sibling cases of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia...|$|E
40|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} {{is a rare}} disorder with {{defects in}} {{two or more of}} the following structures: the teeth and the skin and its appendages including hair, nails, eccrine, and sebaceous glands. Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is the most common type of disease. This rare disorder, also known as <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome,</b> manifests as a triad of hypotrichosis, asteatosis, and anhidrosis. In view of the rarity of this entity, a classical case of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is reported. We have also provided a review of recent investigations in the area of dental abnormalities in this syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{ectodermal}} dysplasias are congenital, non-progressive and diffuse disorders affecting {{primarily the}} tissues derived from ectoderm. Over a period, their classification has become confusing due to indiscriminate {{use of them}} &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;ectodermal dysplasia&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC; for numerous syndromes with a defect {{in one or more}} epidermal defect in each element of skin; their precise classification appears difficult as yet. Only X-linked recessive ectodermal dysplasia (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome)</b> remains best defined. This paper describes three cases of ectodermal dysplasias highlighting their overlapping features...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 6  year old child, second {{in order of}} birth of non consanguineous Egyptian parents with typical {{characteristics}} of <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The patient had sparse light hair over the scalp, scanty eyebrows and eyelashes, a high arched cleft palate, decayed oligodontic teeth, hyperpigmentation all over the body more marked in cheeks, perioral area, chin, neck, axillae and back of both knees, fragile dry skin, hyperextensibility of the metacarpophalangeal joints, dysplastic nails and absent nipples. Our patient had also gallstones which were not reported previously and mild mental retardation. His mother had mild teeth abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia, {{also called}} the <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is characterized by congenital dysplasia {{of one or more}} ectodermal structures and is manifested by hypohidrosis, hypotrichosis and hypodontia. It is usually an X-linked recessive mendelian character which is rarely seen in males. It results from abnormal morphogenesis of cutaneous and oral embryonic ectoderm. Patients with this disorder exhibit smooth, thin and dry skin, fine and blond scanty hair. Intra-orally anodontia or hypodontia, with impaired development of alveolar process is seen. A case report of a rare case of this disorder in a female patient aged 18 years is hereby presented...|$|E
40|$|Hypotrichosis and oligodontia {{associated}} with a chromosomal anomaly (Xq-deletion) are described in a 11 -month old cattle (Simmenthal/Red Holstein cross-breed). This chromosomal anomaly was accompanied with hairlessness and grievous teeth abnormalities. The animal had a very thin haircoat, had only one incisor and between one to three molars per mandible or maxilla. This resulted in reduced food intake, reduced rumination, and retarded growth. Post-mortem examination revealed lesions in the kidneys (bilateral chronic interstitial nephritis), adrenals (hyperplasia), pancreas (focal fibrosis) and abomasum (obstipation and multiple ulcers). Some of these abnormalities are comparable with the human "anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia" (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and supports the hypothesis that there are homologies in the X-chromosome of different mammals...|$|E
40|$|I have {{suggested}} that the X-linked gene Tabby (Ta) and its autosomal mimics in the mouse may be homologous with the genes for sex-linked anhidrotic (hypohidrotic) ectodermal dysplasia (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome,</b> CST) and its apparent autosomal mimics in the human. In the present study, I examined whether anhidrosis, a cardinal feature of CST, is present in the putative mouse sex- linked model, Tabby. The results demonstrate that whereas normal mice perspire on the volar and plantar surfaces of their paws, hemizygous Ta/Y male mice show anhidrosis and absence of sweat glands, as do human hemizygous male sufferers of CST. This result is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that Ta is homologous to the gene for CST...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Ectodermal Dysplasia {{comprises}} a large, heterogeneous {{group of}} inherited disorders that {{are defined by}} primary defects {{in the development of}} two or more tissues derived from embryonic ectoderm. The tissues primarily involved are the skin, hair, nails, eccrine glands and teeth. The X-linked recessive ED (<b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is the most common disorder; it affects males and is inherited through female carriers. It is characterized by the triad of signs comprising sparse hair (atrichosis or hypotrichosis), abnormal or missing teeth (anodontia or hypodontia) and inability to sweat due to lack of sweat glands (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis). The lack of teeth and the special appearance were reported to be major concerns. Two case reports illustrating the typical features of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia have been presented. Since there is no definitive treatment for the disease, an early prompt diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach in planning a treatment can {{improve the quality of life}} of the patient...|$|E
40|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} (ED) is {{an inherited}} disorder {{in which two}} or more ectodermally derived structures fail to develop, or are abnormal in development. Hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) or <b>Christ-Siemens-Touraine</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is an X-linked recessive syndrome with an incidence of 1 / 10, 000 to 1 / 100, 000 births. Because of its X-linked inheritance pattern, it {{is more common in}} males. HED is characterised by hypohydrosis (diminished perspiration), hypotrichosis (decreased amount of hair) and microdontia (small teeth), hypodontia (lack of development of one or more teeth) or adontia (total lack of tooth development). These patients present diagnostic and treatment challenges because of variable oral manifestations. This report describes an 11 -year-old Xhosa boy, who was referred to the University Dental Faculty by his general medical practitioner because of hypodontia. General facial features included: frontal bossing, a depressed nasal bridge, 'butterfly' pattern of eczema over the nasal bridge to the malar process of each cheek, thinned out hair, loss of vertical dimension of face and dry skin. Intra-oral examination revealed hypodontia with peg-shaped anterior teeth and diastemas. Radiological examination revealed no developing permanent teeth or tooth buds. Diagnosis was confirmed by doing a sweat gland count. Management included oral hygiene instruction, fluoride treatments, construction of a partial lower denture and counselling about his condition with particular reference to the danger of hyperthermia and control of allergies.
