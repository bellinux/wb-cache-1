25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>{{struggle}}</b> with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights?

And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{observe that}} the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South, and discrimination {{in many areas}} outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle,</b> whereas the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent between those with more or less ancestry and helped sustain {{an image of the}} country as an example of post-colonial harmony. This has hindered the development of a common identity among black Brazilians.|$|E
25|$|Scouting has {{sometimes}} become entangled in social controversies {{such as the}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle</b> in the American South and in nationalist resistance movements in India. Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials {{as an instrument of}} colonial authority but became a subversive challenge to the legitimacy of British imperialism as Scouting fostered solidarity amongst African Scouts. There are also controversies and challenges within the Scout Movement itself such as current efforts to turn Scouts Canada into a democratic organization (see also Non-aligned Scouting and Scout-like organisations).|$|E

25|$|In 1964 {{he carried}} the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>struggle</b> into the American Library Association. In spite of the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision, which {{encouraged}} desegregation of libraries and ALA chapters, the ALA was slow in implementing integration of all of its southern chapters until Josey offered his resolution at the 1964 Conference which prevented ALA officers and staff members from attending segregated state chapter meetings. The four remaining segregated chapters that denied membership to African-American librarians at that time were Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi; and they integrated immediately. He {{is well known for}} his uncompromising opposition to any form of discrimination whether it is racial, gender, age or sexual orientation.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Higginbotham issued his {{influential}} {{opinion in}} Comm. of Pa. v. Local 542, Int'l Union of Operating Engineers, {{explaining why he}} as an African American judge {{with a history of}} active involvement in the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle</b> was not obligated to recuse himself from presiding over litigation concerning claims of racial discrimination. He held, in an opinion that was followed by later judges, including a series of Black judges who faced recusal requests, that a judge should not be forced to recuse solely because of their membership in a minority group. [...] Jewish federal Judge Paul Borman relied on the Higginbotham opinion in part in his 2014 decision not to recuse himself from the trial of Palestinian-American Rasmea Odeh.|$|E
50|$|Straight University {{also offered}} {{professional}} training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886, and its graduates participated in {{local and national}} Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggles.</b> For example, 1876 Straight University Law School graduate Louis André Martinet published The Crusader—a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> daily, co-founded the Comité des Citoyens (Citizens' Committee), and {{played a significant role}} in the Plessy v.

50|$|The progress—both {{symbolic}} and real—during this period became {{a point of}} reference from which the African-American community gained a spirit of self-determination that provided {{a growing sense of}} both Black urbanity and Black militancy, as well as a foundation for the community to build upon for the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>struggles</b> in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The Chicano Movement, {{also known}} as the Chicano <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement, Mexican-American <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement, and El Movimiento, {{occurred}} during the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> era that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the 1960s and was active through the late 1970s in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggles</b> that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.|$|R
500|$|Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone {{asserted}} that [...] "This is 100 percent {{having to do}} with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle</b> into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E

25|$|Most important, {{it was in}} {{the local}} {{organizations}} that the great work of building a culture of Black political activism was carried on.

2500|$|One strong {{possibility}} for the divergence of black American English and white Southern American English (i.e., {{the disappearance of}} older Southern American English) is that the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggles</b> caused these two racial groups [...] "to stigmatize linguistic variables associated with the other group".
