40|$|Unlike {{most adults}} with <b>compensated</b> <b>pressure</b> {{overload}} {{of the left}} ventricle, children with moderate to severe aortic stenosis exhibit pronounced left ventricular muscle hypertrophy, enhanced ejection performance and diminished wall stress. To determine whether these findings are present in other forms of left ventricular pressure overload in children, left ventricular mechanics were studied by catheterization in 14 children with {{coarctation of the aorta}} (average peak gradient 39 ± 17 mm Hg) and in 10 normal children. Ejection fraction and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening in the coarctation group (0. 74 ± 0. 09 and 1. 71 ± 0. 43 circumferences/s, respectively) were significantly higher than in normal subjects (0. 65 ± 0. 05 and 1. 27 ± 0. 26 circumferences/s, respectively) (p = 0. 008), but the ranges for both groups overlapped. End-systolic stress in children with coarctation (77 ± 20 dynes · 103 /cm 2) was less than in normal children (121 ± 24 dynes · 103 /cm 2) (p < 0. 001), again with overlap of the ranges for both groups. The ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index, an estimate of contractile function, was similar in both groups. Relations between severity of obstruction (left ventricular peak systolic pressure, coarctation gradient) and end-systolic stress and between stress and ejection performance were present within the coarctation group.

At 1 - 2 years, dogs with severe LV hypertrophy (LV free wall/body wt ratio 6. 8 ± 0. 6 g/kg) and sham-operated littermates (LV free wall/body wt ratio 4. 0 ± 0. 3 g/kg) were instrumented with ultrasonic dimension crystals to measure LV short axis internal diameter and wall thickness, miniature LV pressure transducers, and aortic and LV catheters. During atrial pacing (240 beats/min) in eight control dogs, LV pressure did not change from 119 ± 2 mm Hg, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) did not change from 1. 25 ± 0. 09 /sec. In seven dogs with LV hypertrophy, atrial pacing (240 beats/min) decreased systolic LV function; that is, LV systolic pressure decreased (p< 0. 01) by 65 ± 12 from 254 ± 14 mm Hg, and VCF decreased (p< 0. 01) by 0. 19 ± 0. 03 from 0. 97 ± 0. 15 /sec.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we sought to}} {{evaluate}} whether the antiadrenergic action of adenosine in the heart is altered in pressure overload hypertrophy produced in rats by suprarenal aortic banding. Epicardial and coronary effluent adenosine and inosine concentrations and release were significantly elevated in <b>compensated</b> <b>pressure</b> overload hypertrophy but not in hearts with left ventricular failure. In pressure overload hearts, the contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation was less inhibited by incremental concentrations of either adenosine or the selective A(1) receptor agonist chloro-N:(6) -cyclopentyl adenosine than in controls. Furthermore, the extent of desensitization to the antiadrenergic actions of adenosine in pressure overload hypertrophy appeared to be proportional {{to the extent of}} chamber dilation and dysfunction. A 60 -minute infusion of adenosine produced a sustained antiadrenergic effect that lasted up to 45 minutes after the infusion was terminated in both controls and hearts with compensated hypertrophy. This effect was not observed in the decompensated left ventricular failure group. Subsequent infusion with adenosine of the A(2 A) receptor antagonist 8 -(3 -chlorostyryl) -caffeine to counteract the proadrenergic effect of A(2 A) receptor stimulation did not alter the decreased sensitivity to the antiadrenergic actions of adenosine in hypertrophied hearts. Finally, isolated myocytes from hypertrophied hearts demonstrated a decreased ability to suppress isoproterenol-elicited increases in [Ca(2 +) ](i) transients in the presence of adenosine and the A(2 A) receptor antagonist compared with myocytes from control hearts. Myocardial adenosine concentrations increase during the compensated phase of pressure overload hypertrophy but then decrease when there is evidence of decompensation. The antiadrenergic actions of adenosine transduced via the myocardial A(1) receptor are diminished in pressure overload hypertrophied hearts. These factors may render these hearts more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of chronically increased sympathetic activity...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Foram examinados trinta e oito olhos de 19 pacientes pela manhã (9 am) e à tarde (6 pm), obtendo-se refração esfero-cilíndrica dinâmica, acuidade visual (logMAR) sem correção (AVsc) e corrigida (AVcc) e parâmetros do ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) : histerese corneana (corneal {{hysteresis}} - CH), fator de resistência da córnea (corneal {{resistance factor}} - CRF), pressão intraocular (intraocular pressure &- IOP) calibrada para o padrão Goldmann (IOPg) e pressão compensada da córnea (IOPcc). Considerando a não distribuição normal das variáveis (teste de Kolmogorov-Smirnov), o teste de Wilcoxon signed rank foi utilizado para verificar significância nas diferenças entre as medidas da manhã e as da tarde de cada variável. O teste de Spearman foi utilizado para verificar correlações das medidas do ORA com o estado refracional e com a acuidade visual pela manhã e à tarde, assim como para verificar as correlações entre as medidas do ORA pela manhã e à tarde e as variações da refração e da acuidade visual. RESULTADOS: Grau esférico (E), equivalente esférico (EE), equivalente desfoco (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg variaram significativamente (Wilcoxon, p PURPOSE: To verify {{the morning to}} evening variations of refraction, visual acuity, intraocular pressure and biomechanical parameters on patients operated by radial keratotomy who presented for refractive re-treatments; and to correlate the biomechanical parameters with refraction, visual acuity and their variations among morning and evening. METHODS: 19 patients were examined, respectively thirty-eight eyes in the morning (9 am) and evening (6 pm), recording sphere-cylindrical dynamic refraction, visual acuity (logMAR) without correction (AVsc) and corrected (AVcc) and ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) parameters: corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), intraocular pressure calibrated for Goldmann (IOPg) e corneal compensated (IOPcc). Variables had no normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), so that the Wilcoxon signed rank was used for testing the significance on the differences for each variable between morning and afternoon. The Spearman test was used for assessing {{the correlations between the}} ORA parameters and refraction, visual acuity in the morning and afternoon, as well as to verify the correlations between the ORA parameters and the variations on refraction and visual acuity. RESULTS: Sphere (E), spherical equivalent (EE), defocus equivalent (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg varied significantly (Wilcoxon, p< 0. 05) between morning and evening. There was more hyperopia, worse visual acuity, higher pressure and lower CH in the morning measurements. In the morning measurements, there was a positive correlation (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between EE and ED and IOPcc (rs= 0. 39 and 0. 34 respectively), but not with IOPg. In the evening measurement, there were no correlations between the refractive and pressure measurements. Negative correlations were observed (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between AVsc (logMAR) and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 48 e rs= - 0, 51), between E and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 66 and - 0. 76), between E and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 40 and - 0. 47), between EE and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 70 and - 0. 68), between EE and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 41 and - 0. 46), between ED and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= 0. 64 and - 0. 54) and between ED and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 35 and - 0. 34). There was a significant negative correlation between the morning measurement of CRF and the variation of defocus equivalent (p = 0. 05; rs = - 0. 30) and the variation of AVsc (p = 0. 04; rs = - 0. 33).

Since the sensitivity of different emitters to water temperature variations is variable, four different, widely used, types of Iranian emitters including in-line long-path emitter, gun emitter, <b>pressure</b> <b>compensating</b> emitter, and double-chamber tube were used. Each emitter was evaluated under 14 different irrigation water temperature treatments ranging from 11 to 43. 5 °C.  The results showed that in general as water temperature increases, the emitter discharge increases linearly in all types, except for the <b>pressure</b> <b>compensating</b> emitter in which the discharge decreases linearly.

Below the surface layer, these pressure gradients tend to accelerate the upper-thermocline flow in a direction opposing the local winds.

Methods: The study included 51 patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (mean age, 40. 80 ± 13. 15 years; range, 18 - 72 years) and 34 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age, 42. 00 ± 12. 32 years; range, 18 - 60 years). All underwent a complete ophthalmological and physical examination, including visual acuity testing and biomicroscopic anterior and posterior segment examinations. Corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor, Goldmann-correlated intraocular <b>pressure,</b> and corneal <b>compensated</b> intraocular <b>pressure</b> were evaluated with an ocular response analyzer, {{and the central}} corneal thickness was measured with Sirius® corneal tomography. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Functional Index, and Metrology Index scores were recorded.

There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the patients and controls in the corneal biomechanical features. The Goldmann-correlated intraocular <b>pressure</b> and corneal <b>compensated</b> intraocular <b>pressure</b> both showed positive correlations with age (p= 0. 003 and p= 0. 001, respectively).

These inferred values were validated by comparison with 3 -hourly pressure records taken at a routine weather station located in the study area, as well as an aneroid barometer and an additional pressure sensor, yielding errors lower than 1 hPa, i.e., about 0.4 mm in PWV. Regular semi-diurnal pressure tides with amplitudes of 3 to 5 hPa were confirmed, corresponding to 1.1 to 1.8 mm in PWV. It is therefore advisable to employ ground pressure readings for PWV retrieval from GPS observations instead of relying on modeled pressure values.|$|R
40|$|Actually {{companies}} have to concentrate on their own core competencies to <b>compensate</b> the <b>pressure</b> coming from {{the market and the}} increasing complexity of processes, products or surrounding environment. Modern companies are specialized on similar fields and form work groups, work lines or even companies for this. Specialization means in this context: on the one hand high qualified employees and very special know how, {{but on the other hand}} a large amount of communication work. A holistic view and a long term plan are necessary to achieve such ambitious goals like knowledge management in a diversified or spread company. Our case shows the successful co-ordination of project handover and collaborative knowledge production between development and production division of Trumpf Maschinen Austria...|$|R
