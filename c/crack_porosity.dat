The samples used are composed of the carbonate minerals. The measure-ments showed that the VP increase by confining pressure is due to the closing of pre-existing cracks in a rock. Based on the relation between the measured Vp and confining pressure, distributions of shapes of pre-existing cracks in rocks were calculated inversely and were exhibited by the <b>crack</b> <b>porosity</b> for a given aspect ratio.

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{for three}} P-wave attenuation mechanisms in sedimentary rocks {{are given a}} unified theoretical framework. Two of the models concern wave-induced flow due to heterogeneity in the elastic moduli at mesoscopic scales (scales greater than grain sizes but smaller than wavelengths). In the first model, the heterogeneity is due to lithological variations (e. g., mixtures of sands and clays) with a single fluid saturating all the pores. In the second model, a single uniform lithology is saturated in mesoscopic ''patches'' by two immiscible fluids (e. g., air and water). In the third model, the heterogeneity is at ''microscopic'' grain scales (broken grain contacts and/or micro-cracks in the grains) and the associated fluid response corresponds to ''squirt flow''.

A field {{study was conducted to}} investigate the mechanisms of initiation and development of desiccation cracks on two soils.

The results show that desiccation cracks developed in three stages: initial stage, primary stage, and steady state stage. In the initial stage, few cracks developed with gradually decreasing water content. When the water content reached a critical value for crack initiation, cracks developed quickly and this was the start of the primary stage. The critical suction at crack initiation was calculated using a stress criterion, which is in the range of 5. 3 - 21. 3 times the preconsolidation pressure of the soil.

The objectives of the field study were to investigate the crack patterns and probability distributions of the geometric parameters of cracks and to determine the representative elementary volume (REV) of the crack network. The desiccation cracks at the survey site formed an inter-connected columnar structure. The traces of the cracks on the soil surface formed a primary structure consisting of inter-connected crack polygons and a secondary structure comprising of isolated cracks. The locations and orientations of the desiccation cracks followed a uniform distribution, differing from the distribution of fracture sets often observed in fractured rocks. The lengths and apertures of the cracks followed a lognormal distribution as expected.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the effect of micro-cracks induced by a slow heating/cooling process (also called heat-treatment) in a mortar, upon its poro-elastic {{properties}} under drained hydrostatic compression, and upon its intrinsic permeability. Prior to the experiments, mortar samples are subjected to a slow heating-cooling cycle up to one temperature T = 105, 200, 300 and 400 °C. The reference state of mortar is taken after drying at 60 °C until constant mass. Experimental results show that the effective drained bulk modulus Kb of mortar decreases significantly with heat-treatment temperature T. A transition from elastic to plastic behavior with increasing heat-treatment temperature T is also observed. These effects are mainly attributed to heating-induced micro-cracks, and, to a lesser extent, to the increase in connected porosity. We also measure a significant increase in permeability. Based on these experimental evidences, a micro-mechanical analysis is proposed, which describes micro-cracks as independent 3 D penny-shaped cracks of varying aspect ratio α. A relationship between the degradation of bulk modulus and heating-induced micro-cracks is established. The distribution of aspect ratio of micro-crack porosity is determined for each heat-treatment temperature. The correlation between heating-induced <b>crack</b> <b>porosity</b> (or with crack aspect ratio) and permeability is also determined.

40|$|The time {{variation}} of crustal velocities in tectonic regions is most reasonably attributed to stress induced variations in <b>crack</b> <b>porosity.</b> The decrease in V_p/V_s before earthquakes is due primarily {{to a large}} decrease in V_p. This supports the Nur dilatancy hypothesis but not the effective stress hypothesis. New data from the San Fernando region verify the V_p drop, show that this drop cannot be entirely due to source depth effects, and give strong support to the explanation of material property, or path effect, rather than source effect variations. Calculations show that the crack-widening model works even for mid crustal depths in saturated rock. Narrow cracks of low aspect ratio are required to satisfy the velocity and uplift constraints. The recovery of velocity prior to fracture can be due to fluid flow or crack closure. The t ∼ L^ 2 relation does not require diffusion. Diffusion of groundwater or crack closure leads to increased pore pressure and rock weakening. Observations of gravity, conductivity, and crustal distortions along with velocities should narrow the choice of models. The crust in regions of thrust tectonics is probably always dilatant to some degree. The aftershock region is smaller than the anomalous velocity region, which in turn must be smaller than the dilatant region. A simple relationship is derived for the relative sizes of the anomalous and aftershock regions...|$|E
40|$|A key {{consequence}} {{of the presence of}} microcracks within rock is their significant influence upon elastic anisotropy and transport properties. Here two rock types (a basalt and a granite) with contrasting microstructures, dominated by microcracks, have been investigated using an advanced experimental arrangement capable of measuring porosity, P wave velocity, S wave velocity, and permeability contemporaneously at effective pressures up to 100 MPa. Using the Kachanov (1994) noninteractive effective medium theory, the measured elastic wave velocities are inverted using a least squares fit, permitting the recovery of the evolution of crack density and aspect ratio with increasing isostatic pressure. Overall, the agreement between measured and predicted velocities is good, with average error less than 0. 05 km/s. At larger scales and above the percolation threshold, macroscopic fluid flow also depends on the crack density and aspect ratio. Using the permeability model of Gue´guen and Dienes (1989) and the crack density and aspect ratio recovered from the elastic wave velocity inversion, we successfully predict the evolution of permeability with pressure for direct comparison with the laboratory measurements. We also calculate the evolution of the <b>crack</b> <b>porosity</b> with increasing isostatic pressure, {{on the basis of the}} calculated crack density, and compare this directly with the experimentally measured porosity.

The extension of Biot’s poroelasticity (Biot 1956, 1962 a, b) to double-porosity solids was carried out by Berryman and Wang (1995, 2000). They derived the phenomenological equations for a double-porosity/dual-permeability medium. They found that three longitudinal and one shear wave exist in the double-porosity medium. Later, Pride (2003) and Pride and Berryman (2003) modified the governing equations developed by Berryman and Wang (1995, 2000) for mesoscopic fluid-flow in double-porosity dual-permeability materials by using the volume averaging technique. Based on the Berryman and Wang theory, the wave propagation at the boundary of double-porosity media was investigated by Dai et al. (2006) and Dai and Kuang (2008).

The composite samples were produced at different stirring speed of 300, 500 and 700 rpm. However, the processing temperature and time are maintained at 800 °C and 180 secs processing condition. Dry reciprocating wear test is conducted using a ball on disc wear tester at a constant operating condition of 50 N load, 10 Hz frequency for 30 mins on the samples. The influence of stirring speed on the microstructure and wear morphology is examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM).
