500|$|According to {{the author}} Raymond Benson, Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's {{previous}} work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond [...] "becomes something more than... cardboard figure" [...] {{that he had been}} in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as [...] "Elastic office hours from around ten until six,... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends,... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women." [...] This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing [...] "a sourness" [...] in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling—illegal except in private members clubs in 1955—and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a <b>carafe</b> of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption [...] "meant relaxation, ritual and reliability". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.|$|E

2500|$|Deburau's great successes {{had come}} in the [...] "pantomime-féerie", {{featuring}} frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. [...] Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. [...] It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, {{and it was in}} the [...] "realistic" [...] pantomime that he excelled. [...] At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of Pierrot Dandin (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in Pierrot Dandin. [...] We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he has done nothing but this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. [...] It must indeed be difficult to make people cry when one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. [...] Well! [...] Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. [...] In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. [...] The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's Bureaucrat Pierrot (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a very lazy, very inaccurate clerk. [...] At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. [...] Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little <b>carafe</b> of wine. 1023, MS 3408, sc. 1 (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr.
