Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket as often as he <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it <b>could.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
25|$|For the {{millions}} of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It <b>could,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.|$|E

25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information.

25|$|The Energy {{transition}} is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies {{by means of}} renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by the decentralization process of energy generation which is starting to allow average homeowners and small companies to generate their own electricity, allowing everyone to install solar panels on their rooftops and, in many markets, sell their excess electricity back on to the grid. This trend continues to grow and <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country rather {{than a handful of}} coal and nuclear power plants. The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase-out is the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the ASN {{released}} a report announcing a sweeping safety upgrade to all the country's reactors. The ASN's report states plainly that a loss of coolant or electricity <b>could,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worst cases, see meltdowns at nuclear reactors in hours. It also lists many shortcomings found during 'stress tests', in which some safety aspects of plants were found not to meet existing standards. It will now require all power plants to build a set of safety systems of last resort, contained in bunkers that will be hardened to withstand more extreme earthquakes, floods and other threats than plants themselves are designed to cope with. It will also adopt a proposal by EDF to create an elite force that is specifically trained to tackle nuclear accidents and could be deployed to any site within hours. Both moves are {{a response to the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster.|$|E
25|$|The {{project of}} the {{expedition}} was of course known to the Batavian and French governments and military commanders, but they were of necessity uncertain of {{the exact location of}} the landing. This compelled them to spread their forces thinly over a large area, from the Scheldt in the South to Groningen. One of the two divisions of the new Batavian army, under Daendels, was indeed positioned in North Holland. He had about 7,000 men {{in the northern part of}} the peninsula, around Alkmaar, while a reserve force under General Van Zuylen van Nijevelt was located at the narrowest part of the province of Holland, near Beverwijk. The second Batavian division, under Lieutenant-General Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau (who was a Belgian, later naturalized to Dutch nationality), was guarding the northern provinces, Friesland and Groningen, and therefore separated from the North-Holland peninsula by the Zuiderzee, which abutted its eastern shore. This implied that Dumonceau was several day marches away and <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event not reach Daendels in time to support him. The same applied to the French forces under the command of General Guillaume Marie Anne Brune, the supreme commander of the Franco-Batavian forces in this theater of war.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy <b>could,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of vested interests, have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E

500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's something that we learned from Miyamoto: Start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments." [...] Unlike the original game, where levels shared graphic assets, Seeds of Evil features unique levels with different geometry, textures and enemies.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, Lewis co-wrote Make this Your Canada with F. R. Scott, {{then the}} CCF's National Chairman. [...] The book's main {{argument}} was that national economic planning had proven itself during wartime with the King government's imposition of wage and price controls through the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. [...] Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime, and that Canada should adopt a mixed economy. [...] They {{also called for}} public ownership of key economic sectors, and for the burden {{to be placed on}} private companies to demonstrate that they could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sector. [...] The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party's decision-making process. By Canadian standards, the book was popular, and sold over 25,000copies in its first year of publication.|$|E

500|$|Captain Laurie {{then made}} a poor {{tactical}} decision. Since his summons for help had not produced any results, he ordered his men to form positions for [...] "street firing" [...] behind the bridge in a column running perpendicular to the river. [...] This formation was appropriate for sending a large volume of fire into a narrow alley between the buildings of a city, but not for an open path behind a bridge. Confusion reigned as regulars retreating over the bridge tried to form up in the street-firing position of the other troops. Lieutenant Sutherland, {{who was in the}} rear of the formation, saw Laurie's mistake and ordered flankers to be sent out. But as he was from a company different from the men under his command, only three soldiers obeyed him. The remainder tried as best they <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confusion to follow the orders of the superior officer.|$|E

Cancellara was emotional after finishing his final Tour of Flanders. He said that he had [...] "missed this one second", referring to the attack by Sagan. He said that he and Vanmarcke had done all they <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chase, but that Sagan was too strong. Vanmarcke, meanwhile, said that he had struggled due to crashes in the middle part of the race and then had suffered cramp when Sagan attacked on the Paterberg.

500|$|Aki's {{appearance}} was conceived by the lead animator of the project, Roy Sato, who created several conceptual designs for Sakaguchi to consider, and then used the selected design {{as a guide}} for her character model.

[...] In an interview, Sato described actively trying to make her appear as realistic as possible, making her similar to himself in as many ways as he <b>could</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animation, including elements of his personality through facial expressions. He concluded that Aki ended up being similar to him in almost every way, with the exception that [...] "she's a lot cuter".
