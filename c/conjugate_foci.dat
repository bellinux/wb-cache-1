The magnetic field {{can be set}} to 27 values corresponding {{to the center of}} spectral lines and zero lines on both sides of each peak. The automatic scanning consists of: (1) rapid field change between adjacent field values (~ 500 G/sec); (2) locking in at the preset field values (~ 0. 3 sec); (3) remaining in a channel for a preset time during which the ion beam current is integrated and the data digitized. Repeated arbitrary excursions between channels do not cause effective field variations of more than |DeltaB/B| = 2 × 10 ^– 5.

40|$|X-ray {{testing of}} the AXAF outer mirror pairs, in the VETA- 1 configuration, reveals a point spread {{function}} (PSF) with unexpectedly large wings at low energies. Although the angular dependence in {{the wings of the}} PSF is close to that expected for diffractive scattering from surface roughness, the energy dependence differs substantially. Analyses of the observed X-ray PSF, images near ring focus, and single-quadrant images at <b>conjugate</b> <b>focus</b> suggest that the excess scattering observed at low X-ray energies results from diffractive scattering by relatively small grains (as small as a few tenths micrometer in radius). We develop a simple model for the contribution of scattering by particulates to the PSF. Merging this model with that for scattering by surface roughness, we fit the combined model to the observed energy-dependent PSF, in order to estimate parameters and associated uncertainties characterizing the grain-size distribution and the surface-roughness power spectral density. In particular, we find that the fractional coverage of the mirrors by particulates is approximately 1 x 10 exp - 4 (for grain radii between 0. 1 and 10 microns), and that the rms surface-roughness is approximately 0. 7 nm (for spatial frequencies between 1 /mm and 1000 /mm) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} infrared {{hemispherical reflectance}} measurements (2 - 15 microns) {{that were made}} on 58 chromic acid anodized tray clamps retrieved from the LDEF spacecraft. These clamps were used for maintaining the experiments in place and were located at various locations about the spacecraft. Changes in reflectance of the tray clamps at these locations were compared with atomic oxygen fluxes at the same locations. A decrease in absorption band depth was seen for the surfaces exposed to space indicating {{that there was some}} surface layer erosion. In all of the surfaces measured, little evidence of contamination was observed and none of the samples showed evidence of the brown nicotine stain that was so prominent in other experiments. Total emissivity values were calculated for both exposed and unexposed tray clamp surfaces. Only small differences, usually less than 1 percent, were observed. The spectral reflectances were measured using a hemi-ellipsoidal mirror reflectometer matched with an interferometer spectrometer. The rapid scanning capability of the interferometer allowed the reflectance measurements to be made in a timely fashion. The ellipsoidal mirror has its two foci separated by 2 inches and located on the major axis. A blackbody source was located at one focus while the tray clamp samples were located at the <b>conjugate</b> <b>focus.</b> The blackbody radiation was modulated and then focused by the ellipsoid onto the tray clamps.

40|$|Motivated by {{the work}} of Musiela and Zariphopoulou [24], we study the Itô random fields which are utility {{functions}} U(t,x) for any (ω,t). The main tool is the marginal utility Ux(t,x) and its inverse expressed as the opposite of the derivative of the Fenchel conjuguate Ũ(t,y). Under regularity assumptions, we associate a SDE(µ,σ) and its adjoint SPDE(µ,σ) in divergence form whose Ux(t,x) and its inverse −Ũy(t,y) are monotonic solutions. More generally, special attention is paid to rigorous justification of the dynamics of inverse flow of SDE. So that, we are able to extend to the solution of similar SPDEs the decomposition based on the solutions of two SDEs and their inverses. The second part is concerned with forward utilities, consistent with a given incomplete financial market, that can be observed but given exogenously to the investor. As in [24], market dynamics are considered in an equilibrium state, so that the investor becomes indifferent to any action she can take in such a market. After having made explicit the constraints induced on the local characteristics of consistent utility and its <b>conjugate,</b> we <b>focus</b> on the marginal utility SPDE by showing that it belongs to the previous family of SPDEs. The associated two SDE’s are related to the optimal wealth and the optimal state price density, given a pathwise explicit representation of the marginal utility.

Since C. neoformans is {{structurally}} and chemically distinct from the standard tumor cell target used in the model of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the NK cell response after binding to cryptococci. Transmission electron micrographs and three-dimensional reconstructions of NK cell-cryptococci <b>conjugates</b> demonstrated <b>focusing</b> of the NK cell centrioles and Golgi apparatus toward the cryptococcal attachment site. NK cell cytoskeletal changes after cryptococcal binding were confirmed by immunofluorescence studies in which NK cells were allowed to bind to cryptococci in Mg 2 (+) -containing, Ca 2 (+) -free medium. One hour after the addition of Ca 2 + to the preformed conjugates, the bound NK cells demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of microtubule organizing centers focused toward the cryptococcal binding site. Colchicine, a drug that inhibits microtubule assembly, did not affect NK cell-cryptococci binding but abrogated NK cell-mediated cryptococcal growth inhibition, indicating that microtubule assembly, an important prerequisite for the secretory process, is not required for NK cell-cryptococci binding but is essential for inhibition of cryptococcal growth. In addition, the Ca 2 + channel-blocking reagents, lidocaine and verapamil, did not affect NK cell-cryptococci binding but blocked the NK cell-mediated anticryptococcal activity, suggesting that a Ca 2 + flux is essential for inhibition of cryptococcal growth. Considered together, these data indicate that NK cells respond to binding of a target cell that has a capsule and cell wall, in addition to a cell membrane, in a manner similar to that seen following binding to target cells that are surrounded by only a cell membrane; however, the response of the NK cells to the binding of C. neoformans is slower and possibly less efficient than the response after tumor cell binding...|$|R

Accounting for the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination may promote more rational resource allocation decisions with respect to adult pneumococcal vaccines. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to assess {{the extent to which}} the literature has empirically captured (e. g., through measurement or modeling) the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase to identify studies published between January 1, 2010 and April 10, 2016 that examine adult pneumococcal vaccination. We included articles if they captured any health or economic benefit of an adult pneumococcal vaccine administered to adults age ≥ 50 or ≥ 18 in risk groups. Finally, we summarized the literature by categorizing the types of benefits captured, the perspective taken, and the strength of the evidence presented. Our protocol is number 42016038335 in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews. We identified 5, 857 papers and included 150 studies for analysis. While most capture health gains and healthcare cost savings, far fewer studies consider additional benefit categories, such as productivity gains. However, the studies with a broader approach still exhibit significant limitations; for example, many present only abstracts, while others offer no new measurements. Studies that examine the 13 -valent pneumococcal <b>conjugate</b> vaccine <b>focus</b> more on broad economic benefits, but still have limitations. This review highlights the need for more robust empirical accounting of the full benefits of adult pneumococcal vaccination.

In silico approaches currently used for VUS pathogenicity assessment are predictive and often produce conflicting data. Furthermore, functional assays are either domain or function specific, thus {{they do not}} examine the entire spectrum of BRCA 1 functions and interpretation of individual assay results can be misleading. PolyPhen algorithm predicted that the BRCA 1 p. Ser 36 Tyr VUS identified in the Cypriot population was damaging, whereas Align-GVGD predicted that it was possibly of no significance. In addition the BRCA 1 p.

We describe a cellular system for examining the function of exogenous full-length BRCA 1 and for classifying VUS. We achieved strong protein expression of full-length BRCA 1 in transiently transfected HEK 293 T cells. The p.

Co-precipitation analysis further demonstrated that it has a reduced ability to interact with BARD 1. Further, co-precipitation analysis of nuclear and cytosolic extracts as well as immunofluorescence studies showed that a high proportion of the p.

Three separate reactions occur within one reaction flask: 1) olefin metathesis of the starting phenylpropene to yield phenylpropene dimer via Ru=C catalyst, 2) conversion of Ru=C to Ru-H via addition of an inorganic hydride source, 3) isomerization of phenylpropene dimer via insertion and β-hydride elimination to yield <b>conjugated</b> product.

40|$|Reduction-sensitive {{biodegradable}} polymers and conjugates {{have emerged}} as a fascinating class of biomedical materials that can be elegantly applied for intracellular triggered gene and drug delivery. The design rationale of reduction-sensitive polymers and conjugates usually involves incorporation of disulfide linkage(s) in the main chain, at the side chain, or in the cross-linker. Reduction-sensitive polymers and conjugates are characterized by an excellent stability in the circulation and in extracellular fluids, whereas they are prone to rapid degradation under a reductive environment present in intracellular compartments such as the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. This remarkable feature renders them distinct from their hydrolytically degradable counterparts and extremely intriguing for the controlled cytoplasmic delivery {{of a variety of}} bioactive molecules including DNA, siRNA, antisense oligonucleotide (asODN), proteins, drugs, etc. This review presents recent advances in the development of reduction-sensitive biodegradable polymers and <b>conjugates,</b> with particular <b>focus</b> on the up-to-date design and chemistry of various reduction-sensitive delivery systems including liposomes, polymersomes, polymeric micelles, DNA containing nanoparticles, polyion complex micelles, nano- and micro-gels, nano-tubes, and multi-layered thin films.

40|$|Conjugation of {{truncated}} recombinant staphylokinase (trSak) with {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) {{is an effective}} way to overcome its short plasma half-life and enhance its therapeutic potential. However, conventional amine directed PEGylation chemistry inevitably led to modification at its functionally important N terminus, which resulted in a significantly reduced bioactivity of trSak. In this study, a novel solid phase PEGylation process was developed to shield the N-terminal region of the protein from PEGylation. The process was achieved by oriented adsorption of an N-terminally His-tagged trSak (His-trSak) onto an immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). His-trSak was efficiently separated and retained on IMAC media before reaction with succinimidyl carbonate mPEG (SC-mPEG, 5, 10 or 20 kDa). The IMAC derived mono-PEGylated His-trSak showed structural and stability properties similar to the liquid phase derived <b>conjugate.</b> However, isoelectric <b>focusing</b> electrophoresis analysis revealed that mono-PEGylated His-trSaks via solid phase PEGylation were more homogeneous than those from liquid phase PEGylation. Moreover, tryptic peptide mapping analysis suggested that a complete N-terminal blockage of IMAC bound His-trSak from PEGylation with 10 kDa- and 20 kDa-SC-mPEG. In contrast, only partial protection of the N-terminal region was obtained for 5 kDa-SC-mPEG. Bioactivities of 10 kDa- and 20 kDa-PEG-His-trSak conjugates without N-terminal PEGylation were significantly higher than those of randomly PEGylated products. This further demonstrated the advantage of our new on-column PEGylation strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
