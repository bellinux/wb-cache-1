5|$|When Singapore became self-governing in 1959 Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was {{determined}} to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the new state a coat of arms, among other symbols, to replace the coat of arms of the United Kingdom {{that had been in}} use until then. A committee was formed to design the state symbols, headed by the deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, who wanted both the arms and flag of Singapore to represent the country's united, multi-ethnic society.|$|E

25|$|The Secretary of State was {{empowered}} {{to direct a}} council to make a decentralisation scheme, with area committees being formed of all the councillors for a specified area. This provision {{has been used to}} <b>create,</b> <b>for</b> example, area committees for Brecknockshire, Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire in Powys, and the Arfon, Dwyfor and Meirionnydd in Gwynedd.|$|E
25|$|Noten {{started the}} project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers {{how they felt}} about art, what they knew about MIMA and what they would like him, as an artist, to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> their cars. He {{received}} answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too busy for art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|They {{are created}} in local {{workshops}} and {{transported to the}} event by their creators. One of the main problems aspiring participants have is obtaining sponsorship {{for the creation of}} the monumental pieces. The creation of the pieces is expensive. Smaller figures can cost on average of 10,000 pesos to <b>create.</b> <b>For</b> a figure of over four meters, the cost is between 50,000 and 70,000 pesos as metal frames need to be used along with paper, paint and other materials.|$|E
25|$|To {{form the}} double {{covering}} graph (i.e., the corresponding skew-symmetric graph) from a polar graph G, <b>create</b> <b>for</b> each vertex v of G two vertices v0 and v1, and let σ(v'i)=v1i. For each edge e=(u,v) of G, create two directed edges in the covering graph, one oriented from u to v and one oriented from v to u. If e {{is in the}} first subset of edges at v, these two edges are from u0 into v0 and from v1 into u1, while if e is in the second subset, the edges are from u0 into v1 and from v0 into u1.|$|E
25|$|Wyler {{encouraged}} Davis to see Bankhead in {{the original}} play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist Perc Westmore <b>create</b> <b>for</b> her.|$|E

25|$|On January 3, 2013, it was {{announced}} by AOEO Trajan (Kevin Perry) via the official community blog that Age of Empires Online had finished its development stage and was entering its support phase, and in September 2013 Microsoft Studios announced that the Age of Empires Online servers would be shut down on July 1, 2014. Producer Kevin Perry gave a presentation at the 2013 Game Developers Conference explaining the reasons for AoEO's closure and why he believed its business model ultimately failed, that being mostly due to the content being too expensive to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the small daily active userbase.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a concern}} in the 1970s that {{residential}} housing construction was declining as people moved from New York City to the suburbs. In response to this trend, the state passed the original 421-a tax abatement program in 1971, {{with the goal of}} encouraging the construction of more residential housing in the city. The 421-a tax abatement program kept property taxes on the developer steady during and {{for a period of time}} after construction. The goal of doing so was to decrease the large tax burden an increased valuation of the property would <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the developer, which would then encourage residential housing creation in the process.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands are an {{important}} part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the Great Basin. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{highlighted}} inconsistency in honouring {{those in}} Canada's royal family. For example, the Queen Mother was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on only an honorary basis, though the Canadian Forces Decoration awarded {{to her was}} substantive. Similarly, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was offered only honorary appointment to the Order of Canada, which he refused on the grounds that, as the royal consort of the Queen, he was Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment, {{as he had been}} awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration and Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan. In 2013, the constitutions of the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit were amended to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> each of the three grades of each order an extraordinary category reserved for those members of the Royal Family (in the Canadian Forces for the latter order) nominated and approved for appointment. Upon taking office, governors general and viceregal consorts become Extraordinary Companions of the Order of Canada and the governor general an Extraordinary Commander of the Order of Military Merit.|$|E
25|$|The Columbus Avenue {{site was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Bal Tabarin, a nightclub that featured big band music and a multi-act floor show including a line of dancing showgirls. Restaurateur and businessman Bob Grison partnered with popular bandleader Tom Gerun (born Gerunovitch) and Frank Martinelli, manager of a nightclub called the Roof Garden, to establish a nightclub in 1930. In 1931, {{in anticipation of the}} repeal of Prohibition in the United States, architect Timothy L. Pflueger was contracted to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the nightclub a stage for live music and dance shows, and a comfortable and sophisticated cocktail bar atmosphere—unusual for the day, as most bars were not decorated to appeal to women. The bar itself was implemented in the Moderne style later called Art Deco. The stage design used Pflueger's patented indirect lighting hidden behind curved strips of decorative metal. The color coming from behind the façade could be changed smoothly from one hue to another. Two years later, with alcohol bans officially lifted nationwide, the Bal Tabarin was issued California's first new liquor license, and in 1934 Pflueger gave the nightclub a quick renovation. The popularity of the club netted for Pflueger a series of contracts to design cocktail lounges for prominent hotels in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was undeterred by the {{negative}} reactions; referring to Louis Lambert {{and the other}} works in Le Livre mystique, he wrote: [...] "Those are books that I <b>create</b> <b>for</b> myself {{and for a few}} others." [...] Although he was often critical of Balzac's work, French author Gustave Flaubert was influenced – perhaps unconsciously – by the book. His own story [...] "La Spirale", written in the 1850s, bears a strong plot resemblance to Balzac's 1832 novel.|$|E
5000|$|A {{music video}} was <b>created</b> <b>for</b> [...] "On the Way Up", {{although}} no video was <b>created</b> <b>for</b> the second single [...] "Oooh This I Need", although TV performances of both singles were broadcast in both America and Europe.|$|R

500|$|Nowak {{wanted to}} start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers {{so that he could}} {{formulate}} [...] "a sense of the atmosphere" [...] which they wanted to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> the film. He wanted to create a [...] "dark, scary and oppressive environment" [...] for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation {{for his role in the}} production. Explaining this decision, he said, [...] "I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. Of course, there were some elements from the show that had to be retained." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} weakness {{grew from}} the contradiction between {{the idea of}} collective security that {{formed the basis of}} the League and international relations between individual states. The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their national interests, to support states for which they had no normal affinity. This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis, when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> themselves in Europe [...] "to defend against the enemies of internal order", in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia {{as a member of the}} League.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, [...] "I don't use {{the piano}} in {{composition}} – {{that would limit}} me terribly". [...] Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but [...] "to dig for it. ... I decide on [...] before I come {{to the question of}} melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." [...] Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was [...] "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to <b>create</b> <b>for</b> itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve [...] "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the failed}} operation, the U.S. {{government}} realized more changes {{needed to be}} made. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), {{also known as the}} Night Stalkers, was <b>created</b> <b>for</b> special operations requiring aviation support. The Navy's SEAL Team Six, an earlier incarnation of the current Naval Special Warfare Development Group, was <b>created</b> <b>for</b> maritime counterterrorism operations.
