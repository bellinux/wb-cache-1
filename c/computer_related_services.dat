The main empirical focus {{of this paper is}} on the “dynamic efficiency gains ” brought about by the interaction of manufacturing and BS industries and, in particular, on assessing the role of BS in supporting (in a Schumpeterian fashion) various types of non-price competitive factors, the most important being the capacity of developing and introducing new products, more effective organizational innovations and new business models. The empirical analysis is based on an original data set obtained by integrating – for a selected number of EU countries- different industry level data sources, namely the OECD Input-Output Tables, the OECD Structural Analysis Database and data provided by the Community Innovation Survey. The results of the empirical analysis show that BS do exert a positive impact on the international competitiveness of manufacturing industries even though these effects vary according to the type of intermediate intangible input acquired and type of user sector...|$|E

We use {{the results of our}} series of empirical studies of the needs and concerns of students with disabilities and individuals responsible for providing services to them. The goal is to target evolving issues, provide an up-to-date, user friendly list of resources, and make practical recommendations about what postsecondary personnel responsible for providing services to students with disabilities can do to facilitate access to computer and information technologies at their colleges and universities. Computer technologies are rapidly becoming a part of our professional, personal and academic lives. Because computer knowledge is a necessity for effective participation in the new North American economy, computer literacy and know-how are part of most postsecondary students ’ formal education. One need only look at North American colleges and universities to see this trend in action. North American college campuses are becoming increasingly “wired” and the technology is pervading all aspects of academic life (Bernstein, Caplan, Glover, 2001; EDUCAUSE Online Guide to Evaluating Information Technology on Campus, 2001). The integration of online courses and computer-mediated and web-based learning into curricula are top priorities at most universities and community/junior colleges.

Due to varied terrain, weather, languages and lack of infrastructure, {{it is difficult to}} provide <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> <b>services</b> to the average Indian. In this poster, we look at three projects that are going to help overcome these obstacles and improve the living conditions of an average person in India. A “Simputer ” has been developed and is already in market at the cost of approximately $ 250. This is a simple computer that is affordable and portable, thus allowing Internet connectivity to an average Indian. A country with 22 major languages, with less than half the population proficient in English, has a problem using Internet. Now, software is available for various languages in India, and these, along with translation tools make it possible for an average Indian to communicate with another person who speaks a different language. Microsoft Corporation has developed a prototype of a system that would help connect illiterate domestic workers in India with families seeking their services “Infostation ” is an innovative idea that tells a rural farmer about the weather.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} of the competition, {{the simultaneous}} saturation {{of the markets}} and {{the complexity of the}} process technology have increased the importance of service inputs as determinants of competitiveness for the forest industry. At the same time new information technologies have substituted the traditional production inputs such as labour and thus enabled the more efficient production of the services and the increase in their use. From the perspective of the forest industry the most important services for it's competitiveness are engineering services, maintenance <b>services,</b> <b>computer</b> and <b>related</b> <b>services</b> and transportation and logistics. Services are produced by service industries themselves but increasingly also by the forest industry machinery producers, the core business of which is gradually transforming into engineering and maintenance services. The demanding business environment and the globalisation of the forest industry create new opportunities for the internationalisation of these services. The determinants of the over all competitiveness are technological, organisational and market structure based competitiveness. The technology used in the production of the services is very advanced, and it forms a distinct factor of competitiveness for the whole forest cluster. In terms of the market structure the situation within the service branches is in general good, but there is room for improving the market relations between the forest industry and the service companies.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Monthly Inquiry into the Distribution and Services Sector (MIDSS) is {{designed to meet the}} Government need for the production of a monthly Index of Services (IoS) and the Index of Distribution (IoD) which is a component of the IoS. Turnover data are collected monthly and, additionally, employment data are collected quarterly. It is used to estimate the change in turnover (and employment) in the service and distribution industries (excluding retail). MIDSS provides 40 % of the current turnover data used in the compilation of the IoS and 45 % of the data used to estimate the number of employees in the distribution and service industries. Both of these measures are key short-term economic indicators. The MIDSS also provides 30 % per cent of the output measure of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and feeds into the income measure of GDP along with other labour market data. There is no other official source of short-term economic data for distribution and service sectors with the comprehensive coverage of the MIDSS. MIDSS covers the following sectors: motor trades, wholesale, hotels and restaurants, transport and postal services (excluding national post activities), renting, <b>computer</b> and <b>related</b> <b>services,</b> research and development, business services (e. g. labour recruitment and accounting), sewage and refuse disposal, recreation, and other services. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} if {{the proximity}} to financial centres affects {{costs and benefits}} to go public. First was tested, in the Italian case, the hypothesis that distance has {{a negative effect on}} the decision of a firm to go public. To this aim, we have compared firms which decided, during 1995 - 2004 period, to list to the Italian stock exchange with those not listed despite meeting the listing requirements. A probit model was estimated and econometric results show that distance of a firm from the main Italian financial centre of Milano, coeteris paribus, affects negatively the decision of the firm to go public. Afterwards the paper analyses the relationship between distance from the financial centre of Milano and underpricing in the period 1995 - 2006. We used as control variables the usual ones (size, age, market volatility, underwriter reputation, etc). The OLS estimation shows a positive and significant effect of distance on underpricing. This result corroborates the hypothesis of a negative effect of distance on the IPO regional distribution. In the end the analysis have been extended to three countries: Italy, France and UK. Our analysis have been limited to one but very significant sector, the ICT. This is a sector that in the past years registered a very high number of IPO and is characterized by an high number of high growth firm. The econometric estimation shows that the number of IPO per capita in ICT industry of a region is negatively correlated with distance of the chief town of the region from the main financial centre of the country and positively correlated with the degree of specialization in <b>computer</b> and <b>related</b> <b>services</b> industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} economic growth in Indian economy since the 1980 s, with particular focus {{on the role of}} information and communication technology (ICT). The impact of ICT on economic growth is analyzed via two main channels. The direct contribution of ICT investment to aggregate economy and manufacturing growth, and the indirect impact of ICT on Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG) in ICT using and ICT producing sectors. The results suggest an increasing role of ICT investment in driving aggregate economic growth in India, though largely limited to the service sector. Moreover, the economy has not been successful in spreading the ICT spillover effect across the board, thus limiting the productivity gain from ICT use. Whereas we see an improving productivity growth in ICT using market services and their contribution to aggregate productivity growth, the manufacturing sectors lags quite behind. Indeed, India׳s export oriented ICT sector has helped gain efficiency improvement in its fast growing service economy, while there is still large potential for ICT use in the manufacturing sector. The paper opens further avenues for improving the data on ICT investment, and also stresses the need for more detailed sectoral analysis of the impact of ICT on economic growth, treating <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> and software <b>services</b> separatel...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{differences}} between innovative and non-innovative establishments in business service industries. It focuses on small establishments that supply core technical inputs to other firms: establishments in <b>computer</b> and <b>related</b> <b>services,</b> engineering, and other {{scientific and technical}} services. The analysis begins by examining the incidence of innovation within the small firm population. Forty percent of small businesses report introducing new or improved products, processes or organizational forms. Among these businesses, product innovation dominates over process or organizational change. A majority of these establishments reveal an ongoing commitment to innovation programs by introducing innovations on a regular basis. By contrast, businesses that do not introduce new or improved products, processes or organizational methods reveal little supporting evidence of innovation activity. The paper then investigates differences in strategic intensity between innovative and non-innovative businesses. Innovators attach greater importance to financial management and capital acquisition. Innovators also place more emphasis on recruiting skilled labour and on promoting incentive compensation. These distinctions are sensible - among small firms in R&D-intensive industries, financing and human resource competencies {{play a critical role}} in the innovation process. A final section examines whether the obstacles to innovation differ between innovators and non-innovators. Innovators are more likely to report difficulties related to market success, imitation, and skill restrictions. Evidence of learning-by-doing is more apparent within a multivariate framework. The probability of encountering risk-related obstacles and input restrictions is higher among establishments that engage in R&D and use intellectual property rights, both key elements of the innovation process. Many obstacles to innovation are also more apparent for businesses that stress financing, marketing, production or human resource strategies.
