40|$|The report {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the rate of inequality in the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages by households in the Czech Republic. It analyzes the said inequality on the basis of data from the Family Account Statistics for the period of 2001 – 2009. The main methodical tools for the performed analysis are the quantification of the Gini coefficient of natural consumption and the consumption expenditures for foodstuffs and beverages of Czech households, the construction, quantification and verification of consumption functions. The obtained results evidence a greater balance in the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages than which is shown by the allocation of the overall expenditures or income of Czech households. At the same time, the said inequality in the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages is characterized by a slightly declining tendency in time. With regard to individual categories of foodstuffs and beverages, the greatest inequality can be defined in the case of dispensable commodities, which are consumed by quantitatively wealthier strata of the population, who are simultaneously willing to pay a higher price for them. Thus, for a number of commodities, we can note the greater quality of foodstuffs and beverages consumed by higher income groups. These commodities may primarily be characterized as having a greater price elasticity. On the other hand, there are foodstuffs in the case of which consumers react more flexibly to changes in income, but whose consumption is relatively stable. Therefore, inequality of consumption is not unequivocally associated with income elasticity, but rather with price elasticity...|$|E

40|$|The {{context of}} this paper focuses {{on some of the}} {{problems}} surrounding organisations that arise as a reaction to the environmental impact of current production and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> associated with rising urbanisation. We examine specifically two types of organisations that we categorise as ecovillages and network oriented organisations respectively. Ecovillages are villages based on ecology in Denmark and other countries, while network oriented organisations are foodstuff communities in Denmark and foreign countries. These categorisations are made through empirical document analysis and case studies, primarily of text from the organisations’ websites. Afterwards David Harvey’s theory about ecosocialism is involved. In this part of the paper the pros and cons about the two types of organisations are analysed, with the purpose of assessing which of the two is the most beneficial. The theory of science in the paper is critical realism. Furthermore, theory about materialism concerning dualistic, dialectical and continuity perspective is involved. The overall conclusion is, that network oriented organisations are the most beneficial solution to the environmental impact of current production and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff.</b> As the network oriented organisations are found in the city, it reaches out to more people and integrates the solutions to environmental problems with the already established society in the city...|$|R

Univ Talca, Fac Enterprise Sci, Sch Commercial Engn, Talca, ChileThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to distinguish different types of consumers according to their level of ethnocentrism in relation to the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> in central-southern Chile. To do this a modification of the CETSCALE (Consumer Ethnocentric Tendencies Scale) was applied through direct survey of 800 habitual supermarket shoppers in two cities in central-southern Chile. The modified CETSCALE presented a sufficient level of internal consistency and there were three factors which included the 17 items of the scale. Five typologies of consumer with different degrees of ethnocentrism were distinguished by cluster analysis, based on the values of the factors and items in the CETSCALE. The composition of the typologies of consumers were related to the city and zone of residence, age, socioeconomic level, self-declared life-style, ethnic origin, knowledge of the origin of the foodstuffs purchased, frequency of purchase of imported foodstuffs and reasons for rejection in the case of a low purchase frequency. It may therefore be concluded that different levels of ethnocentrism exist in the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> related with some socio-demographic characteristics of consumers and their attitudes to imported foodstuffs.

40|$|Abstract In Western populations, historically, {{from early}} times until the 19 th century, diets were {{composed}} largely of plant foods &mdash; cereals, beans, vegetables and fruit. The huge major-ity of populations were very poor with restricted food choices. The same situation prevails with most present-day Third World populations, although principally with rural dwellers. In Western populations, in recent times, stemming largely from urbanization and rise in prosperity, and accompanying increased partiality to animal foods, {{there have been}} falls in the intake of some plant foods yet rises in others. Potato intake has halved, whereas vegeta-ble consumption has increased only slightly, although that of fruit more so. National <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> these <b>foodstuffs</b> vary widely, those in the United Kingdom and United States of America being {{only about half of}} those in Mediterranean countries, Spain, Portu-gal and Greece. In the former countries, present dietary guidelines urge that vegetable consumption be doubled, with fruit up by a half. In southern Africa, <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> veg-etables and fruit by the white population appears similar to those in the USA and UK. Yet in African cities, intake is low due to their cost. In view of the protective role of high vegetable and fruit intake in the combating of coronary heart disease and many forms of cancer, the relatively low <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> these <b>foodstuffs,</b> especially in the poorer populations, is disappointing, and alas, appears unlikely to rise in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Owing to {{the high}} cost of {{transporting}} farm produce before the railway age, the land-intensiveness of European mixed farming caused both production and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and intermediate farm inputs in the steady state to be highly dispersed, a spatial configuration offering weak inducement to reorganize farm structure or to invest available labour and capital with a view to increasing output. In such conditions {{the most common cause of}} rising agricultural productivity was spatial concentration of demand, which raised the demand price of farm produce and farm inputs within the privileged space bounded by discontinuities in the cost of land transport. The ultimate cause of observed changes in agricultural productivity before the nineteenth century must therefore be sought outside the farming sector in the development of markets for tradable manufactures, tradable services, and the economies of scale in their provision that supported spatial concentration of population. ...|$|E

40|$|The French Paradox: Vegetables or Wine To the Editor: In {{their recent}} study based on {{statistics}} from 40 countries, Artaud-Wild et all mentioned that wine may {{be protective against}} coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality when the population consumed large amounts of saturated fats.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an extensive inquiry into urban <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> in Flanders between 1800 and 1860. The octroi tax, an indirect tax levied on various consumer items, formed the principal source. During the initial phase of Belgian industrialisation the inhabitants of the eight cities under study (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Courtrai, Ghent, Lokeren, Leuven and Mechelen) experienced a sharp decrease in the consumption of bread grains, meat, fish, beer, wine and gin. A number of other indicators suggest at the same time an accelerated widening of the gap between rich and poor. This process of impoverishment and pauperisation, which occurred in all cities (small or large, industrial or merchant centre), is explained as a result of Malthusian tensions. The rapid population growth, which started around 1750, generated the division of arable land and a sharp increase in land prices. The growing demand for food, stagnating agricultural output, and the trade and agricultural policy of the government led to {{a significant increase in the}} price level of foodstuffs. The capitalism hypothesis of Lis and Soly, elaborated for Antwerp, is rejected. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is assumed}} {{in the article}} that food economy is {{composed}} of: agriculture, food industry, turnover of agricultural products and foodstuffs, production of means of production for needs of agriculture and food industry. On the other hand, by the notion of vertical integration all the activity is understood that aims at co-ordination of actions between producing subjects in particular phases of food production. Changes in <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> belong to factors influencing processes of integration of food economy. The changes find their expression in reduction of direct share of agriculture in satisfying food needs of the society. This process is confirmed by increase of elasticity coefficient of foodstuffs supply towards net agricultural produce as well as diminishing relation between net final production and value of foodstuffs consumption. Economic development and increase in incomes are connected with growing demand for foodstuffs highly processed. It means that responsibility for satisfaction of society's consumtion needss shifted to food industry in still larger extent. Observed changes in food consumption oblige to more comprehensive integration of participants of the food production process.

This work assessed the in vitro effects of urolithin A, urolithin B, and urolithin B-glucuronide, ellagitannin-derived metabolites of colonic origin, on NO release and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Urolithins were tested both individually at 15 μM and as a mixture of 5 μM each, at different time points. The biotransformation of these molecules in cell media due to cell metabolism was also evaluated by UHPLC-MSn. The mix of urolithins at 5 μM significantly increased nitrite/nitrate levels following 24 h of incubation, while single urolithins at 15 μM did not modify NO bioavailability. Both the mix of urolithins at 5 μM and urolithin B-glucuronide at 15 μM activated eNOS expression.

This matched case-control study with prospective recruitment included 88 triads (PE-DEN-control). All women were face-to-face interviewed with a standardized questionnaire, and serum dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyl measurements were available for 58 of them. Alcohol consumption (odds ratio (OR) : 5. 82 [confidence interval at 95 % (95 %CI) 1. 20 - 28. 3]) in DEN and low physical activity at work for DEN (OR: 4. 58 [95 %CI 1. 80 - 11. 62]) and PE (OR: 5. 61 [95 %CI 1. 90 - 16. 60]) were traced as significant risk factors.
