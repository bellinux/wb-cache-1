40|$|Four commercially {{available}} disinfection products were tested for their efficacy against Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms), causative agent of bacterial ring rot, on wooden potato storage crates. Each {{of these products}} represented a different class of biocide, i. e. organic acids (benzoic acid), peroxygenous compounds (potassium peroxysulfate), quaternary ammonium compounds (didecyldimethylammoniumchloride) and hypochlorite-generating compounds (sodium-p-toluenesulfochloramide). The target objects consisted of small wooden panels that were smeared with potato tuber pulp homogenized with a high inoculum of Cms. By dipping the inoculated panels into the product solutions and subsequent determination of the densities of colony-forming units, the relative efficacy of the products was established. The two products that exhibited the highest relative efficacy were studied for their disinfection performance when applied as cleaning agent in a conventional automated <b>crate</b> <b>washer.</b> The results showed that jet cleaning in a <b>crate</b> <b>washer</b> for 2 min using the authorised dose of the product containing sodium-p-toluenesulfochloramide is an effective method for disinfecting Cms-contaminated wooden potato crates. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{monitoring}} {{was used}} to study the incidence and sources of salmonellae in a 4160 bird broiler flock during the growing period, transport and processing in a commercial plant. No salmonellae were isolated from any of 132 litter samples of 189 chickens cultured during the seven-week growing period, even though nest litter samples from four of the eight parent flocks yielded salmonellae and Salmonella worthington was isolated from the meat meal component of the grower ration. On arrival at the plant, 2 / 23 birds sampled carried S. infantis on their feathers, although intestinal cultures failed to yield salmonellae. Three of 18 processed carcasses samples yielded salmonellae (S. infantis, S. heidelberg, S. typhimurium var copenhagen). The most likely source of these salmonellae was the plastic transport crates, since 15 / 107 sampled before the birds were loaded yielded salmonellae (S. infantis, S. typhimurium). The <b>crate</b> <b>washer</b> at the plant did not {{reduce the incidence of}} Salmonella-contaminated crates, since 16 / 116 sampled after washing yielded salmonellae (S. infantis, S. typhimurium, S. heidelberg, S. schwarzengrund, S. albany) ...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{monitoring}} {{was used}} to determine the incidence and sources of salmonellae in a 4160 -bird broiler flock raised on litter in 32 pens. Twenty-five of the pens remained apparently free of salmonellae during the 49 -day growing period. Salmonella johannesburg, first detected in the meat meal component of the starter ration, was recovered from the litter of seven pens and from the intestines of dead or culled chicks from two pens. Salmonella alachua was also recovered from two of these pens. Culture of swabs collected from the plastic crates used to transport this flock for processing showed that 97 / 112 (86. 6 %) were contaminated with salmonellae (15 serovars) before the birds were loaded. The <b>crate</b> <b>washer</b> at the plant did not remove salmonellae from these crates: 97 / 132 (73. 5 %) crates sampled after washing yielded salmonellae. Eleven serovar were recovered, including S. johannesburg and S. alachua introduced by the infected flock. Twelve of 31 chickens (38. 7 %) collected when the birds were unloaded at the processing plant were intestinal carriers of S. johannesburg and/or S. alachua and 29 (93. 5 %) were external carriers. Salmonella johannesburg, S. alachua and four other serovars were isolated from the feathers of these birds. Eleven of 25 (44 %) carcasses tested from this flock yielded salmonellae. Salmonella johannesburg or S. alachua, first isolated from the infected flock, were recovered from five carcasses and S. haardt and S. Typhimurium, first isolated from the transport crates were recovered from six carcasses...|$|E
