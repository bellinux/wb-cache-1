40|$|Topic: Treatment of peptic ulcers Autor: Jiří Sakač Peptic ulcers {{represent}} one of {{the most}} widespread gastrointestinal disease all over the world. It occurs the most in the middle and high aged people. It is a multifactorial disease, which is developed by dysbalanc between agresive and protective factors. Its occurrence and incidence is associated with presence of the infection Helicobacter pylori in gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori is the main risk faktor for a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases, and it makes first damage of mucous membrane. Comprehensive individual treatment consist of non-pharmacological lifestyle modification and pharmacological treatment. In the treatment, there are used drugs, which inhibite secretions of the agresive hydrochloric acid (H 2 -receptor antagonist, proton pumps inhibitors), cytoprotective drugs (sucralfat, bismut`s salts, syntetic analogs of prostaglandins) and drugs for eradication of H. pylori - antibiotics and <b>chemoterapeutics.</b> Accurate diagnosis, timely and efective treatment reduce a risk of recurrence and the complications; which can endanger patient's life (bleeding, penetration, perforation); and they can accelerate final healing most of the ulcers...|$|E

RNDr. Lenka Skálová, Ph. D. Title of {{a diploma}} work: Doxorubicin {{cytotoxicity}} and metabolism in MCF- 7 cell line. Doxorubicin (DOX) is ranked among anthracycline <b>chemoterapeutics,</b> significantly {{participant in the}} treatment of solid tumors, inclusive breast carcinoma and haematologic malignancies. DOX is metabolized to 13 -OH-doxorubicinol (DOX-OL) produced by carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR 1). DOX-OL is lower antineoplastic, but more cardiotoxic compared to the parent drug. Aim of this work was research of reduction DOX and testing possible increasing cytotoxicity of DOX through inhibition his reductase. For experiments has been selected human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7. Initially has been elicit optimal composition of cultural medium and optimalized process on sample preparation for HPLC. In the study of DOX metabolism in cytosol the MCF- 7 cells act oracin (potentional chemoterapeutic) as significantly kompetition's inhibitor of DOX reductases. In cytotoxicity tests acted DOX more toxic in cells with bovine serum in medium, oracin was again more toxic in cells without bovine serum. Combination DOX with oracin [...] ...|$|E
