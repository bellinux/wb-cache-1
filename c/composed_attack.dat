5000|$|The nine Super Giant {{films were}} {{purchased}} for distribution to U.S. television and were edited into four films and cheaply dubbed by Walter Manley Enterprises for syndication by Medallion Films. The two original Japanese films that <b>composed</b> <b>Attack</b> from Space (The Artificial Satellite and the Destruction of Humanity and The Spaceship and the Clash of the Artificial Satellite) were each 39 minutes in duration. The two films were edited into one 76-minute film, resulting {{in only two}} lost minutes in the combined edit, probably consisting mostly of cast and credits. As a result, this compilation suffered least among the Super Giant films in its adaptation for American television, except in terms of cast and credits. Although Riichiro Manabe composed the music to the original two films, most of the original music was replaced by library tracks in the American adaptation, which were then credited to Chumei Watanabe. Additionally, the screen cast, which was {{identical to the one}} used for [...] "Atomic Rulers", includes names of performers not appearing in the film, and omits those of some performers who did.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} pair of tools to assess the risk of an {ICT} system through a scenario-based method. In each scenario, {{rational}} threat agents <b>compose</b> <b>attacks</b> against the system to reach some predefined goal. The first tool builds {{a description of the}} target system by automatically discovering and classifying the vulnerabilities in its components and the attacks they enable. Starting from this description and from the one of the agents, the other tool applies a Monte Carlo method to simulate step by step each agent and its attacks. By collecting samples on the agent attacks, the number of times they reach a goal and the corresponding impact this tool returns a database to compute statistics to support the assessment. After describing both tools, we exemplify their adoption in the assessment of an industrial control system that supervises a power production plant. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} {{vulnerability}} management tools in two stages. In the first stage, we perform a global comparison involving thirty tools {{available in the}} market. A framework composed of several criteria based on scope and analysis is used for this comparison. From this global view of the tools, we detected that only three tools perform correlated analysis. Correlated analysis {{can be done in}} two ways: (i) correlation of scanning results with the output from other security devices such as firewall and intrusion detection systems, or (ii) correlation between vulnerabilities <b>composing</b> <b>attack</b> scenarios. Although both correlations add value to vulnerability management, the latter is especially important to unveil stepping stones which could be exploited by attackers. The comparison shows that two out of three tools perform correlation of the second type but scalability and the amount of manual input required seems to be their biggest problems...|$|R

40|$|When {{intelligent}} threats {{attack a}} system, they rarely {{achieve their goals}} by exploiting a single vulnerability. Rather, they achieve their goals by <b>composing</b> <b>attacks</b> and by exploiting structural security flaws of the target system. Attack graphs have been the de facto tool for discovering possible complex attacks. This thesis proposes a cost-effective safeguard selection strategy, which first identifies a complex attack set that covers all the complex attacks {{through the use of}} attack graphs and later selects a minimal set of countermeasures through the formulation and resolution of an integer linear programming problem. Multiple goals in conjunction or disjunction relation can be analyzed. We have built a working prototype system that implements this strategy and that helps maximizing the return-on-investment by identifying critical stepping-stone hosts and by suggesting the most cost-effective set of countermeasures. The mechanism of this approach is independent of the modeling abstraction level. We have considered both an example model that goes into the details of elementary attacks and an example model that targets worst-case analysis...|$|R

40|$|The most {{critical}} steps in the risk assessment of a system are the discovery of attacks against the system {{as well as the}} computation of the probabilities that attacks are successful and their impacts. We present a framework to support these steps driven by a detailed simulation of the attacks implemented by intelligent threat agents. The framework can evaluate the role of factors such as the probability of discovering a vulnerability, the resources available to agents, how an agent <b>composes</b> <b>attacks</b> into plans to reach a goal. The agents and their plans are described through a proper extension of attack graphs. A simulation defined in terms of attack graphs can fully exploit an important feature of these graphs, namely their ability of describing both attack plans and the countermeasures to stop these plans. Furthermore, a simulation-driven approach can evaluate how the availability of information about the system implementation influences the success of attack plans. Finally, we describe the tools that implement the simulation and that produce statistics about both attack plans that have been successfully implemented and the resulting risk for the system owner...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the composition of}} protocols that share a common secret. This situation arises when users employ the same password on different services. More precisely we study whether resistance against guessing <b>attacks</b> <b>composes</b> when the same password is used. We model guessing attacks using a common definition based on static equivalence in a cryptographic process calculus close to the applied pi calculus. We show that resistance against guessing <b>attacks</b> <b>composes</b> {{in the presence of}} a passive attacker. However, composition does not preserve resistance against guessing attacks for an active attacker. We therefore propose a simple syntactic criterion under which we show this composition to hold. Finally, we present a protocol transformation that ensures this syntactic criterion and preserves resistance against guessing attacks. ...|$|R

40|$|Selfish mining [9] is a {{well-known}} attack where a selfish miner, under certain conditions, can gain {{a disproportionate share of}} reward by deviating from the honest behavior. In this paper, we greatly expand the mining strategy space, and consider a class of stubborn mining strategies where a miner performs better by taking long shot gambles. Consequently, we show that the selfish mining attack is not optimal for a large parameter region. Further, we show how a miner can further amplify its gain by non-trivially <b>composing</b> mining <b>attacks</b> and network-level attacks. We show that surprisingly, in some strategies desirable for the adversary, victims of an eclipse attack can actually benefit from being eclipsed!...|$|R
40|$|Haruspex is a {{suite of}} tools that assesses ICT risk through a {{scenario}} approach. Each scenario includes the target system and some threat agents that <b>compose</b> the <b>attacks</b> enabled by the system vulnerabilities to reach some predefined goals. The suite applies a Monte Carlo method with multiple simulations of the agent attacks against the target system. The simulation applies a formal model of the target system that describes the system nodes, the components with their vulnerabilities, and the logical topology. This paper proposes an extension to model in a more accurate way how the relations and the interactions among applications affect the agent attacks. After introducing this extension, we show how it supports the modeling of web applications. Then, we adopt the new model to assess a critical infrastructure that supervises and manages gas distribution...|$|R

3000|$|... [...]), {{the example}} of {{reactive}} (or responsive) attacker can be used where the intruder looks for ongoing transmissions in order to <b>compose</b> their <b>attack</b> signal (the intruder applies power management to identify the appropriate direction of transmission, power, and timing for its attack) [28]. Through the transmission of a high power signal on the same frequency of a user, the intruder can create a competing signal that collides with and, in effect, cancels out the users’ signal. Cell phones (users), which are designed to increase power {{in the case of}} low levels of interference, react to this interference. Consequently, the intruder must be aware of any increases in power by the users and match that power level accordingly. A type of reactive intruder called intelligent intruder uses this knowledge to disrupt the communications. In fact, intelligent intruders could be considered as a type of reactive intruders. By using intelligent attack techniques, the attacker decreases its probability of detection and consumption of energy than basic reactive one.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Networked {{control systems}} present an {{inviting}} target for adversaries seeking to attack physical infrastructure through cyber attacks alone. A diverse set of possible attacks, including node compromise, false data injection, malware propagation, and {{denial of service}} have been identified and studied in isolation. Currently, however, there is no framework for <b>composing</b> multiple <b>attacks,</b> mounted {{by one or more}} adversaries, and designing a system defense that guarantees stability and allows flexible performance. In this paper, we introduce a passivity framework for modeling and mitigating multiple, interdependent attacks on networked control systems. Under our framework, multiple adversaries are modeled as passive individual blocks, either in parallel or negative feedback interconnections depending on the interdependencies between the attacks, leading to an overall system that is passive and stabilizable. We present two case studies within this framework, namely joint node capture and malware propagation, as well as joint node capture and control channel jamming, and derive a stabilizing network response to the attacks. Our results are illustrated through a numerical study. I...|$|R

40|$|Developing and {{evaluating}} secure MANET (mobile adhoc networks) in real systems {{is a complex}} process that involves careful design of attack test cases and security countermeasures, as well as meaningful performance measurements to evaluate both the impact of attacks {{and the performance of}} security solutions. It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to <b>compose</b> complex <b>attacks</b> from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET. 1...|$|R

40|$|Model {{checking}} cryptographic protocols {{have evolved}} to a valuable method for discovering counterintuitive security flaws, which make possible for a hostile agent to subvert {{the goals of the}} protocol. Published works and existing security analysis tools are usually based on general intruder models that embody at least some aspects of the seminal work of Dolev-Yao, in an attempt to detect failures of secrecy. In this work, we propose an alternative intruder model, which is based on a thorough analysis of how potential attacks might proceed. We introduce an intruder model that provides an open-ended base for the integration of multiple basic attack tactics. Those attack tactics have the possibility to be combined, in a way to <b>compose</b> complex <b>attack</b> actions that require a number of procedural steps from the intruder’s side, such as a Denial of Service attack. In our model checking approach, protocol correctness is checked by appropriate user-supplied assertions or reachability of invalid end states. The analyst can express security properties of specific attack actions that are not restricted to safety violations captured by a generic model checker.
