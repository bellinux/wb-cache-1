There was no varietal difference in the <b>chlorophyll</b> <b>mutation</b> frequencies among the three varieties, irrespective of their radiosensitivities measured by root‐length reduction of the irradiated seeds. Of all the mutants detected at the seedling stage and maturity, more than 50 % were sterile mutants, m ost of which seems to be due to chromosomal aberrations. The present results imply that chromosomal aberrations are predominantly induced by X-ray irradiation of dormant rice seeds and bring about high proportion of sterile and chlorophyll deficient mutations in the M 2 generation. 体細胞分裂周期や減数分裂期の種々のステージにおける突然変異誘発効果とその突然変異スペクトラムを比較することを目的として，本研究では突然変異体誘発に最もよく用いられている乾燥種子について調査した。放射線感受性が顕著に異なる水稲の 3 品種について，乾燥粒子に 5 ～ 40 kR のX線照射を行ない，M 2 世代において葉緑素突然変異体，不稔変異体および形態的変異体の頻度を調べた。その結果，葉緑素突然変異体とくにアルビノ変異体の頻度は照射線量に対して指数関数的に増加した事から，これら葉緑素突然変異はX線照射による 2 ヒット型事象に基づく染色体の中間部欠失から由来するものと考えられる。さらに葉緑素突然変異率に関して 3 品種間で有意な差異が認められなかった事から，発芽時の根長で顕著に認められる放射線感受性の品種間差異をもたらす要因として染色体異常の誘発が直接的に関与していないことを示唆している。M 2 世代において可視的に検出されたすべての突然変異体のうち 55. 6 %が部分不稔個体や完全不稔個体を分離する不稔変異体であり，これらの大半は相互転座や逆位などの染色体異常に由来するものと考えられる。さらに突然変異スペクトラムの内訳を見ると，短稈変異体が 27. 1 %，葉緑変異体が 10. 4 %でその他矮性や出穂期変異体および長芒変異体などが数%認められた。以上の結果から，イネの乾燥種子に対する放射線照射においては染色体異常が最も誘発されやすく，照射後代において染色体異常による不稔変異体や葉緑素突然変異体が高い割合でを生ずるものと考えられる。従って種実生産を目的とする作物の突然変異育種においては染色体異常を伴なわない遺伝子突然変異体の効率的な誘発が望まれることから，種子照射よりもむしろ減数分裂期照射や受精卵細胞の分裂周期別照射などのように植物体の照射ステージを考慮することが重要であると考えられる...|$|E

The spectrums of <b>chlorophyll</b> <b>mutations</b> (albina, xantha, chlorina, viridis and striata) were observed and grouped. Except striata, remaining four kinds of mutations viz., xantha, chlorine, viridis and albina were more frequently.

40|$|Effects {{on three}} {{sulfonate}} esters, a nitrosamine and γ-radiation have been compared {{on the basis}} of mutation rate, sterility and lethality. The most powerful mutagen was ethyl-methane-sulfonate (EMS) inducing up to 16 per cent chlorophyll mutants. After, we have respectively methyl-N-nitro-N′-nitrosoguanidine (MNG) 12 per cent, methyl-methane-sulfonate (MMS) 7 · 5 per cent, γ-radiation 5 · 5 per cent and butyl-methane-sulfonate 2 · 3 per cent. Increase of mutation frequency can arise from decreased lethality in treated plants. Mutagenic efficiencies compared with toxicity correspond fairly well to those obtained for induced sterility. By decreasing power we have EMS > MNG > MMS > γ BMS. Comparison of induced sterility related to <b>chlorophyll</b> <b>mutation</b> frequency showed a maximal efficiency for EMS, meaning that for the same number of induced mutations, this alkane sulfonate induced less sterility. Relations of mutagenic effects with concentration are linear after irradiation, exponential after MNG or EMS and rather sigmoidal after BMS and MMS. Evidence was obtained of preferential induction of some chlorophyllian phenotype with the mutagen utilized. EMS induced relatively few albina as compared with γ-rays. <b>Chlorophyll</b> <b>mutation</b> spectra differed not only with the nature of the mutagen but also with experimental conditions, temperature and pH. Genome itself can interfere to preserve or eliminate some mutations. Mean segregation ratios of M 2 chlorophyll mutations are widely lower than 25 per cent. Their values which is an indication of the mutated sector increases in the direction MMS < γ < MNG < EMS. The analysis of these segregation ratios made us consider the occurence of two or three initials as origin of the generative tissue. Some external conditions can increase the mutation rate. Temperature during the treatment increased the reactivity of MNG. In the case of EMS, seed presoaking has the same action. Increase of pH of the mutagenic solution results in an increase of mutated plants after MMS treatments. Differential sensitivity to EMS appeared in three strains of Arabidopsis from different geographical origins. These differences are concerned as well with the mutability as the biological reactions of the treated generation. © 1969. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} of mutations {{by the use}} {{of chemicals}} is still a relatively new field of research. Since 1946, when the first published reports on effective chemical mutagens appeared, many workers have tested a variety of chemical compounds for their ability to produce mutations. Until very recently no chemical mutagens had been found which equalled or surpassed ionizing radiation in the production of genetic changes. However in 1959 Heslot et al., treated barley with a considerable series of related organic compounds and found one, ethyl methanesulfonate, that induced chlorophyll mutations at a much higher rate than did even the largest tolerated doses of radiation. The results are extremely important since with high <b>chlorophyll</b> <b>mutation</b> rates the chances of obtaining desirable mutations are presumed to be correspondingly increased. This is only a presumption since {{there is a possibility that}} a mutagen might alter certain genes only, or might cause chromosome breaks only in specific (e. g. heterochromatic) regions (McLeish, 1953). Some chemicals (Ehrenberg, Gustafsson & Lundqvist. 1958) have been found to induce a relatively low proportion of chromosome aberrations and still produce a high mutation rate. From the genetic standpoint, this is of advantage since fewer chromosome aberrations would in turn lead to less disruption of the division mechanism. Mutations produced would be tentatively attributed to true 'point' or gene mutations. It was considered of interest to discover whether or not EMS is a chemical which causes effects of this sort. Since EMS is the most potent of the plant mutagens described up to the present, a detailed investigation of its effects on plants was undertaken...|$|E

The mutation causes decreased stability of UGA-containing mRNAs. Our data suggest that transcripts with UGA stop codons are terminated exclusively by AtprfB in chloroplasts and that AtprfB {{is involved in the}} regulation of both mRNA stability and protein synthesis. Furthermore, sequence data reveal a + 1 frameshift at an internal in-frame TGA stop codon in the progenitor prfB gene of cyanobacteria. The expression pattern and functions of atprfB could reflect evolutionary driving forces toward the conservation of TGA stop codons exclusively in plastid genomes of land plants...|$|R

Mature seeds of 3 self-pollinated lines (ZL 9, ZL 102, ZL 169) and immature seeds of 2 lines (ZL 102 and ZL 169) {{were treated with}} EMS at the concentrations of 0. 01 %, 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % for 6 and 12 h and 0. 01 % and 0. 1 % for 6 and 12 h, respectively. We isolated and described 18 types of mutation, which were classified into the following groups: chloro-phyll deficiency (6), leaf (5), stem and (4) ray floret shape and color (3). Geno-typic differences were revealed for the spectrum of mutations occurring after mutagenic treatment of mature and immature seeds. Differences in mutation spectrum existed in the studied lines after treatment of mature seeds. Mutation frequency after immature seed treatment did not exceed the amount of muta-tions after mature seed treatment where the maximum frequency amounted to 13. 2 %. <b>Chlorophyll</b> deficiency <b>mutations</b> averaged a half {{and more of the}} visi-ble morphological mutations.

40|$|ALADIN is a {{component}} of the nuclear pore complex in higher eukaryotes. An Arabidopsis knockout line that had a T-DNA insertion in the ALADIN gene was defective in plant growth and thylakoid development and had reduced photosynthetic activity resulting from lower <b>chlorophyll</b> accumulation. The <b>mutation</b> appeared to decrease the level of chloroplast RuBisCO subunits and PSBA and PGL 35 proteins. Unexpectedly, the T-DNA insertion in the ALADIN gene decreased the expression of the neighboring gene PSRP 5, which functions in translation in chloroplasts. The mutant phenotype was rescued by expressing PSRP 5, but not by expressing ALADIN. The abnormal phenotypes were also detected in an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) -mediated PSRPS 5 knockdown, but not in an amiRNA-mediated ALADIN knockdown line. Thus, users of T-DNA insertions should be aware that a TDNA insertion in one gene can have effects on the expression of neighboring genes...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 120). x, 120 leaves, bound col. ill. 29 cmDracaenas {{are important}} foliage plants {{not only in}} the United States, but also worldwide, and new varieties are needed to maintain consumer demand. Flower induction, mutation induction with gamma rays, and polyploidization using oryza 1 in were attempted on various dracaenas to lay down the foundations for a long-term breeding program to create new varieties for the foliage industry. Using traditional breeding methods for breeding requires the availability of flowers on plants intended for breeding. Two methods were employed to attempt flower induction - Gibberellic acid (GA 3) applications and cold temperature treatments. GA 3 solutions ranging in concentration from 0 to 6000 ppm were applied to nine different varieties of Dracaena to attempt out of season flower induction. Dracaena fragrans 'Massangeana' flowered at the rate of 8 % in the 0, 500, and 1000 ppm treatments and 16 % in the 2000 ppm treatment. Dracaena xmasseffiana flowered at rates of 0 %, 41. 67 %, 58. 33 % and 62. 5 % in the 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm treatments, respectively. None of the other treated plants flowered during the experiments. Three cold temperature experiments using temperatures ranging from 8 to 20 °C and treatment durations from 3 to 40 days were performed on seven different Dracaena varieties. D. xmasseffiana plants chilled for 0, 3, 6, or 9 days at 12 °C flowered at the rate of 0 %, 16. 9 %, 39. 2 %, and 86. 7 % of stems, respectively. None of the other plants treated had significant flowering percentages. Mutation induction using irradiation is a useful method for creating new varieties of ornamental plants that are vegetatively propagated. Unrooted cuttings of four Dracaena varieties were irradiated using Cesium- 137 gamma rays at dosages ranging from 0 to 500 Grays (Gy) in the first round and 0 to 50 Gy in the second round in order to estimate the LD 50 dosages for root and shoot formation. A general trend of decreased root and shot formation with increased radiation dosage was observed. For root formation, the LD 50 dosages were estimated as 14. 6, 13. 8, 5. 7, and 17. 7 Gy and for shoot formation, the dosages were estimated as 19. 4, 16. 6, 22. 1, and 10. 9 Gy for D. deremensis 'Santa Rosa', D. fragrans 'Massangeana', D. fragrans 'Victoriae', and D. xmasseffiana, respectively. Visually detectable mutations for each treatment were observed at rates of 0 % to 93. 3 % with <b>chlorophyll</b> <b>mutations</b> being the most common. Polyploid forms of plants often have horticulturally desirable characteristics such as more compact growth habit, thicker and more robust leaves, and a deeper green color. Two methods of polyploidization on Dracaena were attempted. Both methods employed six treatments consisting of three concentrations of oryzalin ranging (0 %, 0. 05 % and 0. 01 %) and two durations of treatment (24 and 48 h). The first method treated developing axillary buds of D. deremensis 'Santa Rosa' in vivo by placing oryzalin soaked cotton on the meristem and covering the meristem in plastic. The second method treated call us tissue of D. deremensis 'Lisa' in vitro by soaking the calli in oryzalin solution. The developed shoots from the axillary buds and the regenerated shoots from the callus tissue were tested for conversion to polyploidy using flow cytometry with leaf tissue nuclei. In vivo treatments resulted in only one mixoploid. In vitro treatments resulted in one mixoploid and one tetraploid plant. The tetraploid has shorter internodes and shorter leaves than its diploid counterpart and is being further evaluated for suitability as a new variety or for use in hybridizing efforts...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study the mutagenic effect of the chemical mutagen, EMS on two well known short duration rice varieties viz., ADT 43 and ADT 45 of Tamil Nadu, South India. A wide spectrum of chlorophyll mutants namely albino, xantha and chlorina were observed in all the treatments in M 2 generation. The albino type were most frequent and chlorina were least common. The treatments produced the relative frequency and wide spectrum of viable mutants like early, spreading, narrow leaf, lax panicle, hairy grain, awned grain and grain length mutants in M 2 generation. Early mutants were observed maximum at 0. 8 per cent EMS in ADT 43, while spreading mutants were observed maximum at 0. 8 per cent EMS in ADT 45. Maximum narrow leaf mutants were observed at 0. 6 % EMS in ADT 43.

40|$|Color changes often {{accompany}} {{the onset of}} ripening, leading to brightly colored fruits that serve as attractants to seed-dispersing organisms. In many fruits, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and pepper (Capsicum annuum), there is a sharp decrease in chlorophyll content and a concomitant increase in the synthesis of carotenoids {{as a result of}} the conversion of chloroplasts into chromoplasts. The green-flesh (gf) and <b>chlorophyll</b> retainer (cl) <b>mutations</b> of tomato and pepper, respectively, are inhibited in their ability to degrade chlorophyll during ripening, leading to the production of ripe fruits characterized by both chlorophyll and carotenoid accumulation and are thus brown in color. Using a positional cloning approach, we have identified a point mutation at the gf locus that causes an amino acid substitution in an invariant residue of a tomato homolog of the STAY-GREEN (SGR) protein of rice (Oryza sativa). Similarly, the cl mutation also carries an amino acid substitution at an invariant residue in a pepper homolog of SGR. Both GF and CL expression are highly induced at the onset of fruit ripening, coincident with the ripening-associated decline in chlorophyll. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are two distinct groups of SGR proteins in plants. The SGR subfamily is required for chlorophyll degradation and operates through an unknown mechanism. A second subfamily, which we have termed SGR-like, has an as-yet undefined function...|$|R
