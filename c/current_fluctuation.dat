Detection is designed to probe separately the absorption and emission contributions of <b>current</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> i. e. the positive and negative frequencies of the Fourier transformed nonsymmetrized noise correlator. It relies on measuring the quasiparticles photon assisted tunneling current across a superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction (the detector junction) caused by the excess <b>current</b> <b>fluctuations</b> generated by quasiparticles tunneling across a Josephson junction (the source junction).

40|$|Field {{emitters}} {{can be used}} as a cathode electrode in a cathodoluminescence device, and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{that are}} synthesized by arc discharge are expected to exhibit good field emission (FE) properties. However, a cathodoluminescence device that uses field emitters radiates rays whose intensity considerably fluctuates at a low frequency, and the radiant fluctuation is caused by FE <b>current</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> To solve this problem, is very important to obtain a stable output for field emitters in a cathodoluminescence device. The authors consider that the electron-emission fluctuation is caused by Fowler–Nordheim electron tunneling and that the electrons in the Fowler–Nordheim regime pass through an inelastic potential barrier. We attempted to develop a theoretical model to analyze the power spectrum of the FE <b>current</b> <b>fluctuation</b> using metallic SWCNTs as field emitters, owing to their electrical conductivity by determining their FE properties. Field emitters that use metallic SWCNTs with high crystallinity were successfully developed to achieve a fluctuating FE current from field emitters at a low frequency by employing inelastic electron tunneling.

The statistical {{properties of the}} RTN <b>current</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are analyzed {{in a variety of}} reading conditions by exploiting the Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) to decompose the complex RTN traces in a superimposition of two-level fluctuations. We investigate the physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the RTN <b>current</b> <b>fluctuations</b> by considering two options that are the Coulomb blockade effect and the metastable-to-stable transition of defect assisting the Trap- Assisted-Tunneling (TAT) charge transport. Physics-based simulations show that both options allow reproducing the RTN <b>current</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> The electron TAT via oxygen vacancy defects, responsible for the current in High Resistive State (HRS), is significantly altered by the electric field caused by electron trapping at defects (i. e. neutral interstitial oxygen), not directly involved in charge transport.
