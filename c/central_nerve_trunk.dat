40|$|Introduction: Facial nerve {{paralysis}} {{is a major}} {{complication of}} parotid surgery and is widely reported. Little {{attention is paid to}} the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> in children. The facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> in children and infants can be easily injured since they lie close to the surface. The present study therefore intends to describe the variability in the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> and its branching pattern in foetuses. Methods: The study was done bilaterally in 30 formalin-fixed foetuses (15 females, 15 males), age ranging from 21. 0 to 35. 5 weeks of gestation. The length of the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> was measured and bifurcation and trifurcation of the trunk was examined. Variability in the branching pattern was also noted. Results: The most common facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> branching type was bifurcation (53. 33 %), followed by trifurcation (33. 33 %). Multiple branching of the facial nerve was also observed in 13. 34 % of the cases. Other variations related to the facial nerve were also noted. The mean length of the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> was 7. 15 ± 2. 12 mm. There {{was no significant difference between}} the right and left sides and in case of males and female foetuses. Conclusion: Facial nerve injury during parotid surgery is a main cause of paediatric facial paralysis. The length of the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> therefore must be accurately known in any surgical procedure planned in the area. The main furcation of the facial nerve should also receive special attention...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Identification of the extracranial part {{of facial}} nerve {{with respect to}} bony {{landmarks}} is important to avoid injury to it. Purpose: To measure {{the length of the}} facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> and its divisions and to measure the distance of the <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> with the mastoid process and atlas. The variations in the divisions and branches were also noted. Methods: Twenty hemi-faces were dissected. The facial nerve was identified at the stylomastoid foramen and dissected meticulously through the parotid gland. The divisions and branches were identified and traced. The trunk was measured from the stylomastoid foramen to its point of bifurcation. The length of the two divisions were measured up to their branching. The distance from the <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> to the mastoid process and atlas were measured. Results: Mean length of facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> in centimetres was 1. 380 ± 0. 082, length of upper division was 0. 820 ± 0. 108 and length of lower division was 0. 890 ± 0. 090. The mean distance in centimetres between the facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> and mastoid process tip was 1. 300 ± 0. 089 and the distance between facial <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> and transverse process of atlas was 1. 645 ± 0. 108.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Palpation of {{peripheral}} <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> {{has been}} advocated {{as a method}} of assessing the presence of hyperalgesic nerve tissue as a contributing factor to pain syndromes in musculoskeletal disorders of the upper quadrant. This study investigated, in the first instance, the pressure pain thresholds of the median, radial and ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> of the upper limb in healthy, asymptomatic subjects. Method. Forty-five male and 50 female healthy volunteer subjects participated in this study which involved measurement of pressure pain thresholds by use of pressure algometry bilaterally over the three peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the upper limbs. Results. Pressure pain thresholds were shown to be lowest in the median nerve (p= 0. 001) and lower in female subjects (p= 0. 001). Laterality (p= 0. 077) or the age of the subject (p= 0. 254) did not significantly influence results. Conclusions. The study demonstrated differences in pressure pain thresholds in the three <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> of the upper limb. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of nerve palpation in musculoskeletal upper quadrant disorders...|$|R

40|$|Biopsies {{were made}} on six rat tibial nerves and 'absolute' numbers of myelinated fibres {{determined}} by counting all fibres in all <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> Subsequently, two unbiased sampling schemes-systematic random quadrat (SRQ) and 'fractionator' sampling-were used to select fibres from the same nerves and to obtain estimates of their numbers. Both schemes captured roughly 200 out of the total of 3000 myelinated fibres found in these <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks,</b> {{all of which were}} sampled exhaustively, without replacement. Estimates of fibre number were derived by an established approach, the 'ratio technique' (using SRQ samples), and by a new principle, the fractionator (using fractionator samples). Counting all fibres in every <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> took almost 6 hours. Both the ratio technique and the fractionator approaches provided efficient and unbiased estimates of fibre numbers. Six <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> were analysed by SRQ sampling in 77 minutes, compared with 65 minutes by the fractionator. Apparent differences between the two approaches were of minor interest when set against the benefits of sampling per se.

Adrenal tissue was obtained from three subjects during therapeutic radical nephrectomy for renal neoplastic disease. Light microscopy revealed a heterogeneous pattern of cortical innervation, with nerves most abundant {{in the head and}} body and largely absent from the tail. There was frequently a subcapsular plexus of interwoven AChE + ve <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in close relationship to densely stained (ganglion) cells. Nerves also traversed the zona fasciculata in radial trunks and a further plexus with ganglion cells was observed in the zona reticularis. <b>Nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> were seen to penetrate the medulla. Some <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> appeared to terminate or branch or form individual nerve fibres (often with varicosities) which ramified through the cortical parenchyma. In the medulla, a generalised granular staining was superimposed on <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> which were branched and interwoven to form a plexus around ganglion cells. The presence and distribution of AChE + ve nerve plexuses and varicose nerve fibres is suggestive of a functional intrinsic, probably cholinergic, innervation to the human adrenal cortex, perhaps derived from the splanchnic nerves...|$|R

50|$|In Hirschsprung disease, calretinin {{immunohistochemistry}} offers additional diagnostic {{value in}} specimens with inadequate amount of submucosa and rarely seen ganglion cells.

40|$|Recovery {{cycle of}} the evoked {{potential}} in the thalamic nuclei was investigated in 18 adult cats under moderate chloralose-urethane anesthesia. Both concentric bipolar electrode and glass-insulated tungsten microelectrode were used to record the amplitude of mass response {{or the number of}} the unit discharge respectively. Stimuli were applied to the peripheral (radial, tibial, peroneal and sural) nerves in the following three different ways : 1) double shocks to a nerve in a extremity, 2) two shocks separately to two different <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the same extremity, 3) two shocks separately to two different <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the different extremities. It was observed that the time course of the recovery cycle became shorter in the following order : 1) recovery tested by the routine double shock method in the same <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk,</b> 2) recovery tested by the stimuli separately applied to the different <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the same extremity, 3) recovery tested by stimuli separately applied to the different <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the different extremities.

40|$|The {{total number}} of myelinated fibres in four unifascicular tibial nerves from {{diabetic}} rats has been counted and measured {{in order to assess}} the merits of various schemes for estimating group mean fibre diameter. The average <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> contained some 2960 fibres which were measured in just under five hours. With different sampling designs, the average measurement time per nerve was reduced to between 17 and 69 minutes, with little consequent loss of reliability or precision of estimated mean fibre size. The most efficient schemes were those taking systematic samples of squares or sectors. A modification of a method relying on complete strips across two diameters of each nerve was the least efficient sampling approach.

Methods: A total of 25 cases (22 HD, 3 TCA) and 18 controls were processed for calretinin and b-tubulin immunohistochemistry. Sections representative of distal aganglionic, transition, and proximal ganglionic segments were evaluated by a visual grading score; b-tubulin was evaluated also by image analysis. Submucosal <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> hypertrophy and hyperplasia were measured by citomorphology. The length of proximal segment was correlated to postoperative bowel function.

In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or Western blot analyses have shown that at least two molecules, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and a non-catalytic truncated form of tyrosine protein kinase receptor B, which could potentially participate in the process of nerve repair, were detectable in chronically denervated skeletal muscle.

40|$|The {{source of}} Enteric Nervous System Progenitor Cells present in Aganglionic Gut in Hirschsprung’s disease – George Stephen Bethell The enteric nervous system {{develops}} predominantly from vagal neural crest cells which proliferate and differentiate into enteric neurons and glia whilst migrating to the distal gut. Failure {{of this process}} for unknown reasons results in Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) which is characterised by an absence of enteric ganglia in a variable length of distal gut. This causes life threatening bowel obstruction and requires surgical intervention to remove the affected bowel. Following surgery 10 - 30 % of patients suffer from long term constipation or faecal incontinence which can worsen with time. Our group has previously shown that enteric nervous system progenitor cells (ENSPC) can be isolated from ganglionic HSCR gut which then differentiate into enteric neurons and glia in vitro. Most importantly, these ENSPC form clusters of cells known as neurospheres which when implanted into ex vivo aganglionic mouse gut, restore normal patterns of contractility. More recently and quite surprisingly, ENSPC have also been obtained from aganglionic HSCR gut and behave similarly to ganglionic ENSPC in vitro. The aim of this thesis is to add understanding to this finding by determining the source of ENSPC in aganglionic HSCR gut. The first results chapter focuses on the optimum medium which {{should be used to}} culture neurospheres. It was found that a horse serum based medium promotes the formation of neurospheres under adherent conditions more effectively than a more complex medium containing various growth factors. The next section tests the hypothesis that ENSPC are located within thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut. Using samples of aganglionic HSCR gut from patients with all variants of HSCR it was possible to correlate the presence of thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> and the ability to obtain ENSPC as aganglionic gut from total colonic and total intestinal HSCR doesn’t contain thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> It was found that {{it was not possible to}} obtain ENSPC from aganglionic HSCR gut where thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> were absent. This suggests that ENSPC are associated with the thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut. Subsequently, experiments were aimed at determining whether aganglionic ENSPC are of neural crest lineage. Fluorescence activated cell sorting was used to obtain a sub-population of P 75 positive neural crest derived cells from freshly dissociated aganglionic HSCR gut. After 6 days in culture these cells differentiated into neurons whereas this was not the case in the P 75 negative sub-population. Finally immunohistochemistry was used to look at the structure of thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut and the expression of P 75 is correlated to the possible cellular sources of aganglionic ENSPC. When combined, work in this thesis narrows down the possibilities of the cellular origin of ENSPC of which the most likely source is cells of Schwann cell lineage located within thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> These findings direct further work and make the potential of in vivo ENSPC stimulation and a medical treatment for HSCR more possible...|$|R
