50|$|Class XD (or Crossover Displacement) is a {{proprietary}} and patented amplifier technology developed in-house by the engineering team at London based, Cambridge Audio.First appearing in 2006 - and {{featured in the}} company’s Azur 840A integrated amplifier - the Crossover Displacement design sought to combine the outright performance of a traditional Class A design with the overall efficiency of Class B but without the linearity and distortion limitations of Class AB.The technology would help the 840A be selected as the 2007/2008 two-channel amplifier {{of the year at}} the prestigious EISA Awards.In <b>Class</b> <b>A</b> <b>amplification</b> the output transistors are modulated by the audio signal to turn more or less ‘on’ but never actually turn off, however in Class B the output transistors actually at some point turn off as the output is passed from one transistor to another.|$|E
50|$|In early {{vacuum tube}} audio amplifiers, {{center-tapped}} transformers were sometimes {{used as the}} phase inverter to drive the two output tubes of a push-pull stage. The technique is nearly as old as electronic amplification and is well documented, for example, in The Radiotron Designer's Handbook, Third Edition of 1940. This technique was carried over into transistor designs also, {{part of the reason}} for which was that capacitors were large, expensive and unreliable. However, since that era, capacitors have become vastly smaller, cheaper and more reliable, whereas transformers are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, as designers acquired more experience with transistors, they stopped trying to treat them like tubes. Coupling <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>A</b> intermediate <b>amplification</b> stage to <b>a</b> <b>class</b> AB power stage using a transformer doesn't make sense anymore even in small systems powered from a single-voltage supply. Modern higher-end equipment is based on dual-supply designs which eliminates coupling. It is possible for an amplifier, from the input all the way to the loudspeaker, to be DC coupled without any capacitance or inductance.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-six {{lung cancer}} tissues from {{operation}} or autopsy and eight lung cancer cell lines were examined for <b>an</b> <b>amplification</b> {{of the ten}} different cellular oncogenes, c-myc, N-myc, L-myc, c-erbB- 1, c-erbB- 2, c-fos, v-sis, c-H-ras, v-K-ras, and N-ras, by the Southern blot hybridization. In small cell lung cancer(SCLC), one SCLC tissue(13 - 1) out of four SCLC tissues and one SCLC cell line contained three fold amplifications of the L-myc oncogene. In non-SCLC, one adenocarcinoma cell line(SLO 51) and one large cell carcinoma cell line(SLC- 30) showed <b>an</b> <b>amplification</b> of the c-myc oncogene at four fold normal amount and twenty fold amplifications of the c-erbB- 1 oncogene respectively, out of twenty-two non-SCLC tissues and seven non-SCLC cell lines.

These results suggest that <b>an</b> <b>amplification</b> of the studied oncogenes {{may not always be}} associated with carcinogenesis even in lung cancer cell lines.

In a retrospective analysis, we determined the molecular subtypes of breast cancer originally defined by expression microarrays by immunohistochemistry in tumours of patients who took part in a randomised study of adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy {{in breast cancer}}. In addition, the topoisomerase II alpha (TOP 2 <b>A)</b> <b>amplification</b> status was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and chromogenic in situ hybridisation. 411 of the 753 tumours (55 %) were classified as luminal-like, 137 (18 %) as basal-like and 205 (27 %) as human epithelial receptor type 2 (HER 2) amplified. The basal-like tumours were defined as having no expression of ER and HER 2; 98 of them did express epidermal growth factor receptor and/or cytokeratin 5 / 6. The luminal-like tumours had a significantly better recurrence free and overall survival than the other two groups.

Patients with an HER 2 -amplified tumour randomised to the high-dose therapy arm did worse than those in the conventional treatment arm, possibly caused by the lower cumulative anthracycline dose in the high-dose arm.
