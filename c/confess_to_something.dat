[...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth.

On May 11, he was shown on Transdniestrian state television confessing to being a spy. Vardanean said he was recruited by Nicolae Botezatu, an official with the Moldovan Intelligence and Security Service, in May 2001 when he was a fourth-year student at Chişinău University. Vardanean's lawyer said his client was forced to <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> he did not do (he believes the journalist was forced to make the confession in exchange for a meeting with his wife Irina).

When she was almost sixteen years old, her mother and a gossipy neighbor, Evelyn Page, who was the mother of Allison's friend, Norman Page, thought that the two had sex. In truth, they hadn't, they had gone on an innocent picnic; but Constance and Evelyn forced them to wrongly <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> they didn't even do; and both were punished for it.

50|$|The town made {{national}} news headlines in 2003 {{when a man}} poisoned the coffee urn at the local Lutheran church, sickening 15 parishioners and killing one. On April 27, 2003, 78-year-old Walter Reid Morrill, known to the town by his middle name, died of arsenic poisoning after drinking coffee at the Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church in New Sweden, and 15 other, mostly elderly churchgoers became il, three of them seriously. Five days later, church member Daniel Bondeson, 53, was found after apparently shooting himself in the lower-chest with a rifle, and supposedly leaving a suicide note in which he <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> having <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the poisoning, but the note has never been released to the public.|$|R

50|$|Eventually King Philip's Inquisitors {{succeeded in}} making Jacques de Molay <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> the charges. On 18 March 1314, de Molay and de Charney recanted their confessions, stating they were {{innocent}} of the charges and they were only guilty of betraying their Order by <b>confessing</b> under duress <b>to</b> <b>something</b> they did not do. They were immediately found guilty of being relapsed heretics, for which the punishment was death. This effectively silenced the other Templars. Philip continued to pressure and threaten the Pope to officially disband the Order, and things came to a dramatic end in 1314 with the public execution by burning of leader Jacques de Molay, and Geoffroi de Charney.|$|R

50|$|Chuck is seen {{spending}} his summer {{with other women}} and prepares to impress Blair by meeting her {{at the bus stop}} of the Hamptons jitney, fresh from her travels. Blair returns but is seen with a new man, James, whom Blair uses to make Chuck jealous. During lunch at their Hamptons house, Chuck's attempts to ruin Blair reveals Blair's conflicted feelings for Chuck but chooses not to forgive him after he left her during her travels. In the hopes of getting rid of James, Chuck calls his private investigator to find any information on him. James' origins soon become questionable when he mixes up the college he is enrolled in. During the White party, James tries <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Blair but finds Blair still enamored of Chuck and dismisses her. Blair turns to James to apologize and he confesses that he is of English nobility and reveals his real name to be Marcus Beaton. The revelation stuns Blair and the two continue their relationship. As the White party ends, Chuck attempts to reconcile with Blair but she gives him an ultimatum: <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> his love for her or she'll leave with Marcus. Unable to express his love, Blair leaves the party with Marcus.|$|R
60|$|She {{had hardly}} spoken when a sharp, firm ring {{at the door}} vibrated through the summer night.

Mrs. Penniman at the same moment gave a little start, and then Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her aunt. They met Mrs. Penniman's and sounded them for a moment, sharply. Mrs. Penniman was blushing; her look was a conscious one; it seemed <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b> Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her chair.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for {{alluding}} {{to me as}} a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b> I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It began <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin.|$|R
50|$|Maron is {{very close}} with her best friend Miyako, though she still holds her at a distance. In the beginning, she sees Chiaki as merely a playboy, and refuses to trust him as he had {{always seemed to be}} hitting on her. However, after the {{incident}} when Maron was told of her parents’ divorce, Chiaki found Maron alone in tears, and he encouraged her to believe in herself. This was a turning point for Maron: Chiaki's kindness helped her trust others, and it also sparked romantic feelings toward Chiaki. At first, she was surprised and dismayed about Chiaki's/Sinbad's identity, but she came {{to fall in love with}} him even more. Throughout the series, she tries <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> him, but <b>something</b> always happens. She ends up not confessing before because if she did, she will hurt Miyako's feelings. Finally, in the second last chapter, she <b>confesses</b> <b>to</b> him that she loves him and they even sleep together. Seven years later, Maron is 24 years old, married to Chiaki, and has a daughter named Natsuki who is the reincarnation of Finn.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a broadly}} ethnomethodological approach, {{mediated}} stylistics is strongly inﬂuenced by discursive psychology (DP), {{as well as}} the sociology of scientiﬁc knowledge (SSK), membership categorization analysis (MCA) [...] and the work of stylisticians like Mick Short, Paul Simpson and Lesley Jeffries [...] in which the analytic utility of stylistics to and for an understanding of data other than strictly 'literary' texts becomes immediately apparent. What unites these approaches is their rejection of a particularly widespread understanding of language in which words-in-here-on-a-page name things-out-there-in-the-world. Because this understanding assumes a natural link between descriptions and the events so described it also assumes a non-linguistic sense of the world as the ﬁnal arbiter of the in/accuracy of descriptions. For DP, SSK and MCA, however, there can be no socially meaningful sense of the non-linguistic without the founding, constitutive force of language. Although language might not be all there is in the world, it is, nevertheless, all there is in the world that allows for the world to become accountable and knowable to ourselves and others. And once you reject—as these approaches reject—the possibility of some non-linguistic arbiter of accuracy, it follows that all descriptions (whether those we decide to treat as accurate or those we do not) have to be understood as the products of particular, locally speciﬁc contexts. The issue is no longer whether mediated texts transmit in/accurate in-formation, but how they act as [...] "vehicles for action", where such actions might include defending someone, accusing someone, <b>confessing</b> <b>to</b> <b>something,</b> or any number of other things besides. It is here that we see how an ethnomethodological approach to language opens the possibility for a mediated stylistics; that is, for analytical tools traditionally associated with stylistics to be adopted for use within media studies. A journalist writing a news article about 'real events' and a novelist constructing a believably-real-yet-imaginary-world may well be working with diﬀerent materials, but they are both engaged in essentially the same kind of literary task: building descriptive vehicles with the potential to pull off a certain set of contextually speciﬁc actions such as detailing, characterizing, informing, confessing, defending, accusing, and so on, in what constitutes an inﬁnitely extendable list of other such social actions.|$|R

50|$|In both True Grit films, Cogburn <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> having robbed <b>something</b> {{after the}} war before {{becoming}} a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969. He spoke admiringly of Quantrill, with whom he served during the Civil War. Twenty-five years after the Tom Chaney hunt, Little Frank (Mattie's younger brother) wrote Mattie Ross a letter with a flyer enclosed saying Rooster Cogburn was travelling with a Wild West show. Unfortunately, Cogburn died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben Cogburn, a fact which he gave freely in the 2010 version of the film (and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that).|$|R

The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after she <b>confessed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown.

50|$|When {{another student}} is murdered later that week, Maddie {{is once again}} the prime suspect. However, when later Gwen is attacked, Maddie is {{released}} and she is attacked herself. Oakdale now deals with a serial killer and the cops {{have no idea who}} it is. Casey, Will and Gwen decide to take a road trip, away from all the {{things that are going on}} in Oakdale. Maddie follows them to Raven Lake, and so do a few other teenagers. Their trip proves to be a horrible and fatal mistake when the Slasher follows them and starts killing the teenagers one by one at night. Having no contact with their parents, who have no idea what's going on, the teenagers are cut from the outside world and have to survive on their own. Maddie finally tells Casey what happened to her and he keeps her with him, trying to protect her against the Slasher, only to be killed himself. Maddie continues her way in an attempt to find her friends. When she runs into Louis, who was the next prime suspect, she's convinced he's the killer. However, he tries <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her, but is stabbed and killed from behind by the real Slasher. In Oakdale, the parents and cops have realized what is going on at Raven Lake and they head over, stumbling over the many bodies that are left behind. Maddie faces her attacker and is about to be killed when Casey rescues her, showing he didn't actually die. He knocks the Slasher unconscious and Maddie takes of his mask, revealing that the Slasher in no other than her sister Eve. The teenagers who survived are found by the cops and Eve is arrested. Her motive for killing the teenagers and blaming Maddie for it was the fact that Louis raped Maddie. Eve turned it around and saw it as Maddie seducing Louis.|$|R

And I swear to you that I was sorry for the venture almost before I had embarked, and ere I had received a shilling.

You were all of a man, and such an one as I might have hoped to be had I been born like you. You said what you chose, and spoke from your own convictions, and catered to no one. You did not whine when the luck went against you, but lost like a gentleman, and thought no more of it. You had no fear of the devil himself. Why should you?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the moral convictions, or the lack of same, in the {{personal}} character of Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan and to show how those convictions affected not only their work and personal friendship but society as well. They first met in 1946 when Harold Clurman of the Group Theater passed to Kazan a Miller play that he had read entitled All My Sons. With the success of the play, the two became fast friends and collaborators in profession and ideology. Each had in common the Great Depression, problem fathers, marital instability and Communism. For a short period during the 1930 s, both men belonged to the Communist Party. Kazan was deeply committed to the cause, whereas Miller preferred to watch from a distance and take notes that may eventually become the basis for a future play. Miller 2 ̆ 7 s was a more intellectual approach to Communism while Kazan was a pro-active member of the rank and file. They disdained capitalism and considered the business world, in Kazan 2 ̆ 7 s word, 2 ̆ 2 antihuman 2 ̆ 2. They worked well together and in 1949 did Death of a Salesman. Its theme could be interpreted as the anti-American dream. For both men, Miller 2 ̆ 7 s plays served as a sounding board for what they considered to be a social injustice. On stage and in the movies they confronted the mores of the time. Eventually what they wrote and produced would come under the scrutiny of the federal government. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated them. Senator Joseph McCarthy had predicated his senate investigation on the subversive anti-American, anti-Christian immorality and atheism of Communism that he thought was intent on overthrowing America. He attacked the theater and entertainment industry in an effort to rid it and America of what became known as 2 ̆ 2 slanted writing 2 ̆ 2 [...] plays and movies that contained hints of Communist doctrine. McCarthy accused some of America 2 ̆ 7 s finest artists of subversion and demanded they confess their Communist connections and name the names of their comrades or 2 ̆ 2 fellow travelers 2 ̆ 2 as they came to be known. Though their short three-year friendship was strong and binding, it would not, and could not, survive this attack. It could not survive because Kazan had violated Miller 2 ̆ 7 s personal values. When the HUAC asked Miller to give them the names of his fellow travelers, he refused and was convicted of contempt of Congress. However, Kazan named names; including Miller 2 ̆ 7 s. It would be almost 10 years before they would speak again. In the interim, they spoke to each other and the world through their work, specifically Miller 2 ̆ 7 s The Crucible and Kazan 2 ̆ 7 s On the Waterfront. Proctor, the adulterous protagonist of The Crucible, would rather be hanged than betray himself by <b>confessing</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> he didn 2 ̆ 7 t do. Terry Malloy, the stool pigeon of Waterfront becomes a state witness for the prosecution in the conviction of corrupt union bosses on the docks. In their own way, and in their best style, Miller and Kazan tried to explain and justify their actions. Each thought what they did was the morally right thing to do. This paper will explore how the character convictions of Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan determined their HUAC testimony and how what they said and did affected the American culture and the world in general...|$|R
