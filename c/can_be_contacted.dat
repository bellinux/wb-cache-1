5|$|Resident Evil 3 {{begins on}} September 27, 1998, 24 hours {{prior to the}} events of Resident Evil 2. Jill Valentine, a former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member, {{attempts}} to escape from Raccoon City. Nearly all of Raccoon City's citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. On her way to the Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new enemy. This creature, named Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef. Nicholai explains to Jill and Carlos that a rescue helicopter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower and ring the bell.|$|E

The many individual resistance (ESR) and inductance (ESL) losses are connected in parallel, so that these total undesirable parasitic losses are minimized.|$|E

25|$|Lesser spirits {{known as}} ágbàrà or álúsí operate below the high god Chineke and {{are parts of}} him divided by gender in his mind. These spirits {{represent}} natural forces; agbara as a divine force manifests as separate alusi in the Igbo pantheon. A concept of 'the eye of sun or god' (ányá ánwụ́) exists as a feminine solar deity which forms {{a part of the}} solar veneration among the Nri-Igbo in northern Igboland. Alusi are mediated by dibia and other priests who do not contact the high god directly. Through áfà, 'divination', the laws and demands of the alusi are communicated to the living. Alusi are venerated in community shrines around roadsides and forests while smaller shrines are located in the household for ancestral veneration. Deceased ancestors live in the spirit world where they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted.</b> Below the alusi are minor and more general spirits known as mmúọ loosely defined by their perceived malevolent or benign natures. These minor spirits are not venerated and are sometimes considered the lost souls of the dead.|$|E
500|$|Park service roads lead {{to major}} features; however, road {{reconstruction}} has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone {{is in the}} midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from Gardiner, Montana, and extends to Cooke City, Montana, are closed to wheeled vehicles. Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. The park has [...] of paved roads which can be accessed from five different entrances. There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided snowmobile and snow coach tours, though their numbers and access are based on quotas established by the National Park Service. Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.|$|E

2500|$|The Union College Campus Safety Department, often {{referred}} to as [...] "Campo" [...] by the student body, is the organization authorized by the college to provide student safety and law enforcement services. The department's officers operate under Article 129A-§6435 of the New York State Education Laws, affording them limited law enforcement powers on campus and the college boasts a relatively clean record for violent and sexual crimes on campus as a result. Aside from serving as campus law enforcement, the Campus Safety Department also provides safety escort services to students and staff; administrates the colleges parking & transit programs, ID services and operates a Communications Center in their offices at College Park Hall. Campus Safety <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> from any campus phone by calling 911.|$|E
2500|$|USAF KC-135 and French Air Force KC-135FR refueling-boom {{equipped}} tankers can be field {{converted to}} a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. [...] In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue {{at the end of}} it instead of the usual nozzle. [...] The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the receiver aircraft then flies the probe into the basket. [...] Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the “iron maiden” by naval aviators because of its unforgiving nature. [...] Soft drogues <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. [...] The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially “slapping” the aircraft’s fuselage and causing damage.|$|E

2500|$|As the Spiritualist {{religious}} movement became {{prominent in}} the 1840s–1920s with a distinguishing belief that {{the spirits of the}} dead <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> by mediums, new technologies of the era including photography were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a spirit world. So popular were such ideas that Thomas Edison was asked in an interview with Scientific American to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and ouija boards mediums employed at the time. However, {{there is no indication that}} Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose. As sound recording became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism [...] declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.|$|E
