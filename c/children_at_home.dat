She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the {{enjoyment}} of {{the look and feel of}} plants.

5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> or in a private area.|$|E

25|$|Stanford University {{political}} scientist Professor Rob Reich wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can probably result in biased students, as many homeschooling parents view {{the education of}} their children as a matter properly under their control and no one else's.

25|$|For most {{of history}} and in {{different}} cultures, the education of <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> by family members was a common practice.

But, it continued to be practiced in isolated communities. Homechooling began a resurgence in began in the 1960s and 1970s with educational reformists dissatisfied with industrialized education.|$|E

500|$|In {{a section}} {{apparently}} reprinted from earlier publications, the pamphlet discerns [...] "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" [...] {{in a number}} of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated. Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers. Such children, the pamphlet argued, could not help but to grow up effete and were [...] "scarcely worth raising". Some of the blame for this, the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and having them educated by women, rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits; governed by women, they never learned to dominate women themselves, which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.|$|E
500|$|Despite these trials, James neither renounced {{her faith}} nor gave up hope {{that one day}} she would have the blessings she desired. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, she {{struggled}} {{to care for the}} remaining <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> as a single parent. In 1872, she sold the family farm and moved closer to the city in order to save money. During these years James both managed a household of children and small grandchildren, but also worked as a domestic servant in order to make ends meet. In addition, she made the family's soap, clothing, and raised vegetables in a small garden. James remained active in the church at this time as well. She participated in the Relief Society doing extensive charitable work. She also contributed financially to the building of the Logan, Manti, and St. George temples; temples that, as an African-American, she was not allowed to enter. The members of her congregation, however, did recognize her faith and sacrifice. In her later life, both she and her brother Isaac J. Manning received reserved seats near the front and center of the Utah Tabernacle for church services. James remained a strong supporter of Joseph Smith, calling him [...] "the finest man I ever saw on earth." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were three}} broad criticisms {{aimed at the}} idea of {{maternal}} deprivation from feminist critics. The first was that Bowlby overstated his case. The studies on which he based his conclusions involved almost complete lack of maternal care and it was unwarranted to generalise from this view that any separation in {{the first three years of}} life would be damaging. Subsequent research showed good quality care for part of the day to be harmless. The idea of exclusive care or exclusive attachment to a preferred figure, rather than a hierarchy (subsequently thought to be the case within developments of attachment theory) had not been borne out by research and this view placed too high an emotional burden on the mother. Secondly, they criticised Bowlby's historical perspective and saw his views as part of the idealisation of motherhood and family life after World War II. Certainly his hypothesis was used by governments to close down much needed residential nurseries although governments did not seem so keen to pay mothers to care for their <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> as advocated by Bowlby. Thirdly, feminists objected to the idea of anatomy as destiny and concepts of [...] "naturalness" [...] derived from ethnocentric observations. They argued that anthropology showed that it is normal for childcare to be shared by a stable group of adults of which maternal care is an important but not exclusive part.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, {{the term}} [...] "mother tongue" [...] or [...] "mother {{language}}" [...] {{is used for}} the language that a person learned as a <b>child</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> (usually from their parents).
