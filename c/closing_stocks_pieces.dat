The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and finds many practical applications in the cutting and packing area. We analyze a well-known lower bound and determine its worst-case performance.

Extensive computational testing on problem instances from the literature involving up to 120 pieces shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the cutting of rectangular order <b>pieces</b> into <b>stock</b> <b>pieces</b> of specified width and length. The cutting process involves three stages of orthogonal guillotine cutting: <b>Stock</b> <b>pieces</b> are cut into sections that are cut into slits that are cut into order pieces. Restrictions {{imposed on the}} cutting process make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex, but limit the scope of solution space. The objective {{of the problem is}} mainly to minimize waste, but our model also accounts for other issues such as aging <b>stock</b> <b>pieces,</b> urgent or optional orders, and fixed setup costs. Our solution approach involves a nested decomposition of the problem and the recursive use of the column-generation technique: We use a column-generation formulation of the problem (Gilmore and Gomory 1965) and the cutting-pattern—generation subproblem is itself solved using a column-generation algorithm. LP-based lower bounds on the minimum cost are computed and, by rounding the LP solution, a feasible solution and associated upper bound is obtained. This approach could in principle be used in a branch-and-bound search to solve the problem to optimality. We report computational results for industrial instances.

40|$|The cutting stock problem it is {{of great}} {{interest}} in relation with several real world problems. Basically it means {{that there are some}} smaller pieces that have to be cut from a greater <b>stock</b> <b>piece,</b> in such a way, that the remaining part of the <b>stock</b> <b>piece</b> should be minimal. The classical solution methods of this problem generally need a great amount of calculation. In order to reduce the computational load they use heuristics. A newer solution method is presented in this paper, which is based on a genetic technique. This method uses a tree representation of the cutting pattern, and combines different patterns in order to achive patterns with higher performance. The combination of the cutting patterns is realized by a combined crossover - mutation operator. An application of the proposed method is presented briefly in the end of the paper. 1.
