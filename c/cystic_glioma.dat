40|$|Giant parenchymal {{cysticercosis}} is {{a relatively}} rare condition and surgical treatment may be required when it is associated with elevated intracranial pressure. We report two patients with giant parenchymal cysticercosis who were treated surgically for the elevated intracranial pressure. In both the patients the preoperative diagnosis was of a <b>cystic</b> <b>glioma.</b> Total excision of the lesions was achieved in both the patients. In countries endemic to neurocysticercosis gaint parenchymal cysticercosis {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of cystic enhancing mass lesion. Surgical excision may be indicated when it is associated with elevated intracranial pressure...|$|E
40|$|Teratomas {{represent}} 0. 5 % of all intracranial tumors. These benign tumors contain tissue {{representative of}} the three germinal layers. Most teratomas are midline tumors located predominantly in the sellar and pineal regions. The presence of a teratoma in the cavernous sinus is very rare. Congenital teratomas are also rare, especially those of a cystic nature. To our knowledge, {{this would be the}} first case report of a congenital, rapidly growing cystic teratoma within the cavernous sinus. A three-month-old boy presented with a past medical history of easy irritability and poor oral intake. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of the head disclosed a large expanding cystic tumor filling the right cavernous sinus and extending into the pterygopalatine fossa through the foramen rotundum. These scans also demonstrated a small area of mixed signal intensity, the result of the different tissue types conforming to the tumor. Heterogeneous enhancement was seen after the infusion of contrast medium. However, this was a cystic tumor with a large cystic portion. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis of <b>cystic</b> <b>glioma</b> was made. With the use of a right frontotemporal approach, extradural dissection of the tumor was performed. The lesion entirely occupied the cavernous sinus, medially displacing the Gasserian ganglion and trigeminal branches (predominantly V 1 and V 2). The lesion was composed of different tissues, including fat, muscle and mature, brain-like tissue. The tumor was completely removed, and the pathological report confirmed the diagnosis of a mature teratoma. There was no evidence of recurrence. Despite the location of the lesion in the cavernous sinus, total removal can be achieved with the use of standard microsurgical techniques...|$|E
40|$|Anti-normal brain {{antibodies}} {{were studied}} in glioma cyst fluids. Cyst fluids {{were obtained by}} stereotaxic puncture from 34 patients with <b>cystic</b> <b>gliomas.</b> Immunoglobulins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immuno-Western blotting, concentration measures, and isoelectrofocalization. 80 % of cyst fluids stained astrocytes and/or microvessels in non-tumoral white matter. In white matter extracts, cyst fluids recognized five immunoreactive bands having apparent molecular masses of 50 - 75 kDa. Although cyst proteins could be of systemic origin, isoelectrofocalization analysis suggests an additional local immune response. These antibody activities could be involved in certain peritumoral events such as brain edema...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} {{patients with}} cystic enhancing lesions on CT {{and to determine}} whether thallium- 201 (201 Tl) SPECT adds to further preoperative information in differential diagnosis between gliomas and abscesses.  Methods—Twenty one patients with cystic ring enhancing CT findings were studied and uptake indices were compared with CT enhancement volumes, histopathology, and survival times.  Results—Fourteen high grade gliomas, three low grade gliomas, and four abscesses were found. Uptake was higher in the highly malignant glioma group (median thallium index (TI) = 2. 1), than in the low grade glioma group (median TI= 1. 4) or among the abscesses (median TI= 1. 6). Overlapping indices were found {{between high and low}} malignant <b>cystic</b> <b>gliomas</b> as well as between either one of the glioma groups and the infectious lesions, and {{there were no significant differences}} between groups. There was a level at the value 2, where TI⩾ 2 correlated with tumour diagnosis. One low grade tumour had an extremely high index and a very high enhancement volume. Indices correlated significantly with CT enhancement volumes (P= 0. 005). There was no significant correlation between Tl indices and patient survival times among the high grade gliomas. One patient with a highly malignant tumour but low Tl uptake five years.  CONCLUSIONS—It is concluded that high 201 Tl uptake in enhancing cystic lesions is an indicator of highly malignant glioma. However, the differentiation between the high malignant gliomas and abscesses or low malignant gliomas by 201 TL SPECT is only partial with an overlap between these groups. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} have {{examined}} the mechanism {{of the formation of}} tumor cysts. Cyst fluid samples were obtained during surgery and by percutaneous aspiration from 22 patients with <b>cystic</b> cerebral <b>gliomas.</b> The concentration of protein was measured in the cyst fluid and blood plasma. Analysis of brain tumor cyst fluids revealed that plasma proteins constituted a major fraction (92 %) of cyst fluid proteins; moreover, the protein fractions occurred in concentrations (relative to the plasma concentrations) that were around 50 -fold of those in cerebrospinal fluid. This strongly indicates blood-brain barrier disruption. Evidence from computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans as well as from electron microscopy of tumor cyst walls suggests the transition of spongy edematous tissue in or around tumors into the contents of associated cysts. Pathophysiologically, blood-brain barrier breakdown is inherent to the occurrence of vasogenic brain edema. It is therefore plausible that the development of cysts is related to peritumoral vasogenic edema...|$|R
40|$|Cystic meningioma is a {{relatively}} rare condition, radiological appearance of the cystic-solid components of the mass may create a diagnostic dilemma.

40|$|Abstract. Cystic meningioma is an {{uncommon}} menin-gioma variant {{that is often}} difficult to distinguish from other intra-axial tumors, including necrotic <b>gliomas.</b> <b>Cystic</b> meningiomas located in the ventricle are particularly rare and may be misdiagnosed with other brain tumors, including ependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma and neurocytoma, due to its location. The present study discusses two cases of lateral ventricular meningiomas, which exhibited intratumoral or peritumoral cystic changes on magnetic resonance imaging scans. The two patients underwent surgical treatment and histological examination confirmed one case of metaplastic meningioma and the other case of psammomatous menin-gioma. The two patients were middle-aged females and had been misdiagnosed prior to surgery. Although this clinical entity is rare, the diagnosis of meningioma should be consid-ered, particularly in middle-aged female patients...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{presentation}} of cystic meningioma in the inter-hemispheric near the falx cerebri is uncommon. It {{is difficult to}} differentiate it from intra-axial tumors, such as gliomas. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} it is misdiagnosed as other types of brain tumors. Methods: In this study, we reported a cystic meningioma case in the inter-hemispheric location, showing an intramural nodule on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: Patient underwent surgical treatment and pathological section confirmation revealing meningioma. The patient was a middle-age woman and had been misdiagnosed as suffering from glioma followed by slight hemipharesis on the right extremities. Conclusions: Although this is a rare case, it will be good if we always consider cystic meningioma in inter-hemispheric space when diagnosing this type of cystic lesion if the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a <b>cystic</b> lesion mimicking <b>glioma</b> image presentation...|$|R
