[...] This is critical as the PIV technique cannot generally measure motion normal to the laser sheet and so ideally this is eliminated by maintaining an entirely 2-dimensional laser sheet. [...] It should be noted though that the spherical lens cannot compress the laser sheet into an actual 2-dimensional plane. [...] The minimum thickness is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of the laser light and occurs at a finite distance from the optics setup (the focal point of the spherical lens).

2500|$|Typical PIV {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a camera (normally a digital camera with a CCD chip in modern systems), a strobe or laser with an optical arrangement to limit the physical region illuminated (normally a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> to convert a light beam to a line), a synchronizer {{to act as an}} external trigger for control of the camera and laser, the seeding particles and the fluid under investigation. A fiber optic cable or liquid light guide may connect the laser to the lens setup. [...] PIV software is used to post-process the optical images.|$|E

50|$|Cylindrical: A {{cylindrical}} Fresnel lens {{is equivalent}} to a simple <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens,</b> using straight segments with circular cross-section, focusing light on a single line. This type produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent simple <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> due to diffraction {{at the edges of}} the ridges.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> is a lens {{which focuses}} light into a line {{instead of a}} point, as a spherical lens would. The curved face or faces of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> are {{sections}} of a cylinder, and focus the image passing through it into a line parallel to {{the intersection of the}} surface of the lens and a plane tangent to it. The lens compresses the image in the direction perpendicular to this line, and leaves it unaltered in the direction parallel to it (in the tangent plane). In a light sheet microscope, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> is placed in front of the illumination objective to create the light sheet used for imaging.|$|E

50|$|Some {{kinds of}} {{magnifying}} glasses, made specifically for reading wide columns of print, are cylindrical lenses. For a simple <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens,</b> {{the surfaces of}} the lens are portions of a cylinder's surface. Consider how this would refract light. When a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> acts as a magnifier, it magnifies only in one direction. For example, the magnifier shown magnifies letters only in height, not in width.|$|E
50|$|This {{began with}} a {{proposal}} by Pendry, in 2003. Magnifying the image required a new design concept in which {{the surface of the}} negatively refracting lens is curved. One cylinder touches another cylinder, resulting in a curved <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> which reproduced the contents of the smaller cylinder in magnified but undistorted form outside the larger cylinder. Coordinate transformations are required to curve the original perfect lens into the <b>cylindrical,</b> <b>lens</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|Similarly when a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> puts {{an optical}} system {{out of focus}} and {{introduces}} blur, it blurs only in one direction.|$|E

By replacing {{the line and}} space pairs in a simple parallax barrier with tiny <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lenses,</b> Hess avoided the light loss that dimmed images viewed by transmitted light and that made prints on paper unacceptably dark. An additional benefit is that {{the position of the}} observer is less restricted, as the substitution of lenses is geometrically equivalent to narrowing the spaces in a line-and-space barrier.|$|R

5000|$|The Benoy Dial {{was invented}} by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham in Nottinghamshire. Light is used to replace the shadow-edge of a gnomon.

50|$|A {{line laser}} is a laser {{modified}} {{to project a}} line rather than a point (e.g. laser pointer). This may be achieved by passing the beam through a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> or a Powell lens.|$|E
50|$|In 3D PALM/STORM, a type {{of optical}} super-resolution microscopy, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> can be {{introduced}} into the imaging system to create astigmatism, which allows measurement of the Z position of a diffraction-limited light source.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of microscopy, the {{illumination}} is done perpendicularly to the direction of observation (see schematic image {{at the top of}} the article). The expanded beam of a laser is focused in only one direction by a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens,</b> or by a combination of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> and a microscope objective as the latter is available in better optical quality and with higher numerical aperture than the first. This way a thin sheet of light or lightsheet is created in the focal region that can be used to excite fluorescence only in a thin slice (usually a few micrometers thin) of the sample.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of down-looking Synthetic Aperture Imaging Ladar(SAIL) uses quadratic phase history reconstruction {{in the travel}} direction and linear phase modulation reconstruction in the orthogonal direction. And the linear phase modulation in the orthogonal direction is generated by the shift of two <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lenses</b> in the two polarization-orthogonal beams. Therefore, the fast-moving of two <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lenses</b> is necessary for airborne down-looking SAIL to match the aircraft flight speed and to realize the compression of the orthogonal direction, but the quick start and the quick stop of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>lenses</b> must greatly damage the motor and make the motion trail non-uniform. To reduce the damage and get relatively well trajectory, we make the motor move like a sinusoidal curve {{to make it more}} realistic movement, and through a resampling interpolation imaging algorithm, we can transform the nonlinear phase to linear phase, and get good reconstruction results of point target and area target in laboratory. The influences on imaging quality in different sampling positions when the motor make a sinusoidal motion and the necessity of the algorithm are analysed. At last, we perform a comparison of the results of two cases in resolution...|$|R
50|$|Astigmatism: A {{person with}} {{astigmatic}} refractive error sees {{lines of a}} particular orientation less clearly than lines {{at right angles to}} them.
