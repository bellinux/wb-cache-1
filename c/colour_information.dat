5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no <b>colour</b> <b>information.</b> In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E
25|$|Rods {{are more}} {{sensitive}} to light, but give no <b>colour</b> <b>information,</b> whereas the less sensitive cones enable colour vision. In diurnal birds, 80% of the receptors may be cones (90% in some swifts) whereas nocturnal owls have almost all rods. As with other vertebrates except placental mammals, some of the cones may be double cones. These can amount to 50% of all cones in some species.|$|E

As far as motion detection is concerned, enhanced robustness is achieved by extended depth analysis and motion estimation reliability assessment.

25|$|All three {{cameras were}} CCDs {{manufactured}} by Eastman Kodak Company, and were {{controlled by the}} rover's CPU. They all had auto-exposure and capabilities for handling bad pixels, and the image parameters (exposure time, compression used, etc.) {{were included in the}} transmitted images as part of the image header. The rover could compress the front cameras' images using the block truncation coding (BTC) algorithm, but it could only do the same for the back camera's images if the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> was discarded. The cameras' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6cm details across a 0.65m range.|$|E
50|$|Black & white TV systems predate colour, and so {{subsequent}} analogue colour broadcast {{systems have}} been designed with backwards-compatibility in mind (known as a compatible colour system). Thus, the chrominance (colour) signal is typically 'shoe-horned' into the same channel as the luminance (brightness) signal, modulated on a fixed frequency, known as the colour subcarrier. Black and white televisions do not decode this extra <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> in the subcarrier, using only the luminance to provide a monochrome picture. However, due to limited bandwidth in the video channel, the chrominance and luminance signals bleed into each other considerably, resulting in the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> showing up visibly as Chroma Crawl, or Chroma dots on black & white TV sets. This is normally considered a nuisance in analogue broadcasting. However, since telerecordings were made from black & white TV screens and technicians at the time often decided not to apply a filter to remove this interference, these patterns are retained even in the existing monochrome film prints and theoretically contain the original <b>colour</b> <b>information.</b> (Occasionally the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> was filtered out using a notch filter and is lost.) The idea to recover this information was originally suggested by BBC researcher James Insell.|$|E

50|$|Basically, image sensors {{provide only}} {{monochrome}} images. With a 1-chip camera, <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> {{can be easily}} obtained {{through the use of}} colour filters over each pixel. With 1-chip cameras, the so-called Bayer filter is very common. Red, green and blue filters are arranged in a pattern. The number of green pixels is twice as large as that of the blue and red, thus the higher sensitivity and resolution of the human eye is replicated. To get a colour image, different algorithms are then used to interpolate the missing <b>colour</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some double cones have {{members with}} {{identical}} visual pigments (twin cones), {{while others have}} members with different cone types (members have a different spectral sensitivity).

50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the 4-tube system concerned noise in the picture. As the composite signals in NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems all used band-limited <b>colour</b> <b>information,</b> so the colour channels in a 4-tube camera could be band-limited, appropriately.

5000|$|The name [...] "Phase Alternating Line" [...] {{describes}} {{the way that}} the phase of part of the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> on the video signal is reversed with each line, which automatically corrects phase errors in the transmission of the signal by cancelling them out, at the expense of vertical frame colour resolution. Lines where the colour phase is reversed compared to NTSC are often called PAL or phase-alternation lines, which justifies one of the expansions of the acronym, while the other lines are called NTSC lines. Early PAL receivers relied on the human eye to do that cancelling; however, this resulted in a comb-like effect known as Hanover bars on larger phase errors. Thus, most receivers now use a chrominance analog delay line, which stores the received <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> on each line of display; an average of the <b>colour</b> <b>information</b> from the previous line and the current line is then used to drive the picture tube. The effect is that phase errors result in saturation changes, which are less objectionable than the equivalent hue changes of NTSC. A minor drawback is that the vertical colour resolution is poorer than the NTSC system's, but since the human eye also has a colour resolution that is much lower than its brightness resolution, this effect is not visible. In any case, NTSC, PAL, and SECAM all have chrominance bandwidth (horizontal colour detail) reduced greatly compared to the luminance signal.|$|E
