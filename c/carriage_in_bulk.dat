40|$|In this paper, the {{features}} of Sverdlovsk region to ensure grain products are reviewed. The dependence of the agricultural sector and the conditions of its transport and logistics are substantiated. It is proven that transport and logistics services have the greatest impact not on harvest and on its processing and storage. The choice of transport and logistics service strategy for enterprises of agriculture depends on productivity, prices for grain and its products and the financial condition of the producer. From the calculations made in the paper it is visible that rail transport has a significant — more than double — advantage over the automobile transport on unit costs for <b>carriage</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> grain cargo, but, for some reason, road transport is beginning to occupy an increasing share in the carriage of grain cargoes. Based on comparative analysis of costs to import grain cargo using various transport modes, recommendations for improvement of transport and logistics infrastructure are made, as well as measures for improving the payments system between producers, processors and transporters are suggested...|$|E
50|$|Tank steamers were {{constructed}} for the <b>carriage</b> of oil <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Many of these ships were adapted {{not only for}} the carriage of oil, but also for its consumption in their furnaces in place of coal. The experience of many years has enabled the owners of some of these lines to exhibit a wonderfully low record of loss, the percentage of deaths at sea to numbers carried being small beyond the dreams of, say, the 1870s. A tenth of 1% over a somewhat extended period is not an unprecedented average.|$|R
