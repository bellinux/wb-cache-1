2500|$|Another {{important}} {{work of this}} period was {{an investigation of the}} influence of tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, {{and a number of other}} drugs on the capacity for doing work both muscular and mental. For this research he was well fitted after his work under Kraepelin at Heidelberg. A great many of these experiments Rivers made on himself, and for this purpose gave up for a period of two years not only alcoholic beverages and tobacco, which was easy enough for him as he liked neither, but all tea, coffee and cocoa as well. Although the investigation was initially formed with physiological motives in mind, it soon became clear that a strong psychological influence was also involved in the act of taking the substances. Rivers realised that part of the effects- mental and physical- that substances had were caused psychologically by the excitement of knowing that one is indulging. In order, therefore, to eliminate [...] "all possible effects of suggestion, sensory stimulation and interest", Rivers made sure that the substances were disguised from him so that he was not aware, on any given occasion, whether he was taking a drug or a <b>control</b> <b>substance.</b> This was the first experiment of its kind to use this double-blind procedure and, in recognition of this momentous study, Rivers was appointed Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians in 1906.|$|E

50|$|John M. Riddle about Heinsohn: “Gunnar Heinsohn {{is one of}} {{the rare}} {{individuals}} who deserve the accolade ‘Universal and International Scholar’, because his intellect cuts across disciplines, re-conceptualizes hypotheses, and proposes theories truly original and challenging. His far-ranging contributions include cross culture theories about markets from anthropology to economics, Judaic history from early Israelites to the Twentieth Century, and ancient chronology. To list Prof. Heinsohn’s disciplinary range would virtually list a university curriculum in the Humanities and Social Sciences. To me, his work (in collaboration with Professor Otto Steiger on linking early modern demography with witchcraft suppression has a major, innovative impact in understanding the dynamics of witches and population decline ultimately leading to the earliest governmental attempts to <b>control</b> <b>substance</b> possession. Prof. Heinsohn’s work is pioneering: it is inventive, eclectic without being pedantic and comprehensible without being simplistic. Entirely is it fitting and appropriate for international scholars to recognize the work of Professor Heinsohn”.|$|E
