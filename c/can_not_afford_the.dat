In {{the first}} place, {{there are certain}} kinds of {{generalization}} which, if the principles already laid down be correct, must be groundless; experience <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> necessary conditions for establishing them by a correct induction. Such, for instance, are all inferences from the order of nature existing on the earth, or in the solar system, to that which may exist in remote parts of the universe; where the phenomena, for aught we know, may be entirely different, or may succeed one another according to different laws, or even according to no fixed law at all. Such, again, in matters dependent on causation, are all universal negatives, all propositions that assert impossibility. The non-existence of any given phenomenon, however uniformly experience may as yet have testified to the fact, proves at most that no cause, adequate to its production, has yet manifested itself; but that no such causes exist in nature can only be inferred if we are so foolish as to suppose that we know all the forces in nature. The supposition would at least be premature while our acquaintance with some even of those which {{we do know is}} so extremely recent. And however much our knowledge of nature may hereafter be extended, {{it is not easy to}} see how that knowledge could ever be complete, or how, if it were, we could ever be assured of its being so.|$|E
