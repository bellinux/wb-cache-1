It is known that the number of well-formed orderings of n open and n <b>closed</b> <b>parentheses</b> is Cn [3, pp. 60, 63, 64]. Many proofs of this fact involve recurrence relations and generating functions. Other proofs use combinatorial reasoning to show that the number of well-formed orderings is Γ 2 n n ΔΓΓ 2 n nΓ 1 Δ, and then verify algebraically that this difference equals Γ 2 n n Δ =(n + 1). The following proof shows that the number of well-formed orderings is Cn by partitioning the set of all Γ 2 n n Δ orderings into Cn subsets of cardinality n + 1, each containing exactly one well-formed ordering. 2. 1 Formulas [...] ...|$|R
