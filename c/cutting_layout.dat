In this paper a multicriteria model is proposed for <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> problem and for printing an additional print run in particular. The multicriteria formulation of the <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> problem is considered, where the material waste, the number of the nesting patterns and the <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> cost are minimized simultaneously. The paper provides an approach to solve the problem using the additive multicriteria estimation. The efficiency of the proposed multicriteria model is tested for a series of computational experiments...|$|E

In this paper, a hybrid, intelligent genetic algorithm will be developed for solving a <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> problem in the Belgian fashion industry. In an initial section, an existing LP formulation of the cutting problem is briefly summarised and is used in further paragraphs as the core design of our GA.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry generates {{a substantial amount}} of solid waste. Cutting building materials into smaller pieces to fit the design is one of the sources of waste in new construction. This type of waste is known as leftover or residual. Drywall leftover is an example of such waste. Currently, contractors do not perform a detailed analysis of how many drywall panels would be required. Moreover, they do not use a consistent system for reusing their scrap and often cut a needed piece from a brand new panel instead of using available scrap. Building Information Model (BIM), as an object-oriented representation of the building contains all the required data and can be utilized to provide drywall crews with layouts indicating how to cut the panels into the required pieces so the leftover could be reduced. Also, some commercially available software applications, such as Autodesk Revit provide a platform to automate processes such as optimization by implementing algorithms through their Application Programming Interface (API). Similar problems have been studied in other fields and industries. Bin packing problem in mathematics and Nesting process in the cutting industry are examples of such research. As the result, automated optimization methods that utilize Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are introduced to address these problems. There is an opportunity to apply Evolutionary Algorithms to solve a similar problem in the {{construction industry}}. This study investigates if it is feasible to implement EA-based optimization methods on a BIM platform to develop an automated optimization tool. In light of available tools and methods, an automated optimization tool is developed as a Revit add-in. It extracts geometrical data from BIM and receives dimensions of available drywall panel(s) from the user. The algorithm, finds the most desirable arrangement of panels and the number of full panels is calculated. The outline of smaller pieces that need to be cut out of full panels are also determined. Then by utilizing an EA-based optimization method, it generates the <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts.</b> The add-in is tested on a certain number of simple models for several iterations and the generated <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts</b> show very optimal leftover. On a very specific model containing twenty pieces that need to be cut out of full panels, the add-in application spent 100 minutes to generate the <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts,</b> which resulted in 36 % reduction in the leftover, compared to the layouts generated in the initial iterations. The test proved that the proposed algorithm is able to optimize <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts.</b> It demonstrates that utilizing such optimization algorithm on a BIM platform could be considered as an effective way to reduce the material waste...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the One Dimensional Cutting Stock Problem, in which a demand {{of a set of}} small pieces named items, gotten from large pieces named objects, has to be produced. It is {{desirable}} that the <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts</b> have a small waste or the remaining piece must be big enough to be reused in the future. This is an important problem, since even small improvements in the <b>cutting</b> <b>layouts</b> result in large savings of raw material and energy when the amount of produced material is huge. The Cutting Stock Problem is NP-hard, so a heuristic combining the Modified First Fit Decreasing (FFD) method, an Integer Programming (IP) model and a Data Mining (DM) module is proposed to solve it. The FFD heuristic is used to produce an upper bound. With this upper bound the IP model becomes able to be solved more quickly. Then, the DM module is proposed to extract common parts from the best current solutions obtained from several iterations of the IP model. Finally the extracted common parts are used to guide the search for better solutions in less computational time. Computational results have shown that the proposed method is able to generate good quality and competitive solutions when compared to the ones presented in the related literature...|$|R

Reducing the waste of raw materials and managing the production schedule are important factors for such manufacturing. Nesting is an activity designing a <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> while scheduling is one managing operational procedures. Noting such nesting and scheduling in sheet metal processing, {{we need to consider}} those simultaneously for increasing the entire efficiency. This is because there often occurs a trade-off between them. To resolve such problem, we previously proposed an integrated method of nesting and scheduling. In order to enhance the scheduling ability that was insufficient in our method, this study extends the idea through a heuristic approach. Actually, we apply a local search to update the initial schedule which is decided by EDD based dispatching rule and manage it in terms of the criteria referring to the bottleneck process. Computational experiment is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

Since a component {{designated as a}} wing base is produced together with this base, the thesis is also concerned with production of this part. Methods of sheet metal forming are analyzed in the theoretical part. Methods used during production pressings - such as cutting, bending, punching and calibrating – are concerned. Practical part of the thesis comprises description of produced segments and their location and function within the assembly, choice of material, shearing layout and choice of forming machine. Economic evaluation of segments production has been performed in conclusion. As soon as material has been chosen (11 343 material has been chosen with regard to low requirements for assemblies), calculation of cutting and bending force has followed. Forming machine (LE 250 has been found the most suitable one) has been chosen based on results of the necessary forming forces, after evaluation of <b>cutting</b> <b>layout</b> and demand on the sheet metal coil.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an indoor {{localization}} system employing ordered sequence of access points (APs) based on received signal strength (RSS). Unlike existing indoor localization systems, our approach {{does not require}} any time-consuming and laborious site survey phase to characterize the radio signals in the environment. To be precise, we construct the fingerprint map by <b>cutting</b> the <b>layouts</b> of the interested area into regions with only the knowledge of positions of APs. This can be done offline within a second and has a potential for practical use. The localization is then achieved by matching the ordered AP-sequence to {{the ones in the}} fingerprint map. Different from traditional fingerprinting that employing all APs information, we use only selected APs to perform localization, due to the fact that, without site survey, the possibility in obtaining the correct AP sequence is lower if it involves more APs. Experimental results show that, the proposed system achieves localization accuracy < 5 m with an accumulative density function (CDF) of 50 % to 60 % depending on the density of APs. Furthermore, we observe that, using all APs for localization might not achieve the best localization accuracy, e. g. in our case, 4 APs out of total 7 APs achieves the best performance. In practice, the number of APs used to perform localization should be a design parameter based on the placement of APs. Comment: VTC 2016 -Spring, 15 - 18 May 2016, Nanjing, Chin...|$|R
40|$|Sourcing is {{the first}} line of {{competitiveness}} of timber supply networks, identifying and locating stands to be harvested that best fit to market demands. The sourcing process is difficult because information is either only available on an aggregated level or is even unavailable, e. g. on non-industrial forest owner’s land. Our study aimed to explore a LiDAR-data-based approach to improve the sourcing of stands to be harvested. We developed a spatially explicit approach, consisting of three steps: (1) harvest screening at the management unit scale or even larger, (2) location and delineation of cutting units, and (3) characterization of tree attributes that are required for stand (cutting unit) -level bucking optimization. The study resulted in the following major findings. First, a tree map represented with Voronoi cells is a useful tool to support the harvest screening process, because it is easily readable and understandable, even by operations personnel. Second, cutting unit location and delineation can easily be done on the tree map, too. Third, the estimation of stem distribution over DBH of a cutting unit may easily be extracted from the spatial tree map database, assuming that there is a deterministic relationship between tree height and DBH. However, there are still issues to be improved, such as comparison of LiDAR-based results with ground-truth, the improvement of LiDAR-based tree delineation methods, the improvement of the estimation of stems over both DBH and tree height, or a mathematical formulation and solution of <b>cutting</b> unit <b>layout...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{heuristic}} algorithm employing {{dynamic programming}} is presented for solving the two-dimensional cutting stock problem {{where all the}} small rectangles are of the same dimensions, but without the usual restriction that the cutting be done with "guillotine" cuts, i. e., cut which must be made in stages from one edge to the opposite edge of the large rectangle being cut. The objective of the algorithm is to determine a <b>cutting</b> or <b>layout</b> pattern for which {{the ratio of the}} unused area to the total area of the large rectangle tends to be small. To demonstrate the method, the common problem of establishing standardized loading patterns for rectangular items on pallets is examined in detail. The algorithm is described with a minimum of mathematics through the use of several pictorial displays and a simple example. The efficiency of the heuristic is then evaluated by comparing computer generated loading patterns for 182 different size items to the loading patterns recommended by the U. S. Navy, and shown to be 10. 4 percent more efficient for 64 out of 182 cases when the number of items per layer were not identical. The algorithm is also shown to be an effective aid to management both in establishing standardized loading patterns and procedures, and in communicating these loading standards to production personnel via computer generated "shop paper. " This type of computer design flexibility and control is a valuable management tool not only for standardizing pallet arrangements, but for carton design and consolidation, warehouse design and layout, bin and shelf stocking, designing tapes for numerically controlled gas cutting machines, and numerous other industrial problems involved with the efficient layout of rectangular objects. dynamic programming: applications, production/scheduling: cutting stock, production/scheduling: material handling...|$|R
40|$|Nesting {{problems}} have been present {{for as long as}} mankind exists. Present days these problems occur in many different industries, e. g. textile, paper, wood, metal and glass industry. These industries produce massive amounts of products to answer the global demand. To minimize the material waste making these products, a good <b>cutting</b> and packing <b>layout</b> is beneficial. The last three decades, researchers have focused on developing methods to solve these problems through computing, instead of solving them manually. Many possible solutions have been found, each method focusing on the specifications of the problem. This thesis had two sub-objectives. The first one was to find the best method for nesting optimization, by doing an intensive literature study. The second sub-objective was to work with a previous made program that is capable of doing optimization tests, containing a nesting optimization method, and try to improve this method to get better results, using the literature study. At a certain point in this project, based on the progress of the literature study and knowledge acquired on the in-house developed program, a decision had to be made either to continue with the previous developed method or to try a new method. A lot of ideas from the literature where used and implemented to improve the method leading to improving results. Hence, the choice was made to continue working with the previous developed method. A new placement strategy was introduced in the program. Additional program code to improve stencil evaluation was added. A proper user interface was created.
