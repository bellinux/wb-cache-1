40|$|Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{is a major}} {{food safety}} concern for the beef industry. Several studies have {{provided}} evidence that <b>cattle</b> <b>hides</b> are {{the main source of}} beef carcass contamination during processing and that reductions in the E. coli O 157 :H 7 load on the <b>hides</b> of <b>cattle</b> entering processing facilities will lead to reductions in carcass contamination. Bacteriophages have been proposed as a novel preharvest antimicrobial intervention to reduce the levels of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on <b>cattle</b> <b>hides.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a commercialized phage application administered in the lairage area of commercial beef processing plants for the ability to reduce E. coli O 157 :H 7 contamination of <b>cattle</b> <b>hides</b> and carcasses. <b>Cattle</b> lots either received phage spray treatment (n = 289) or did not (n = 301), as they entered the lairage environments in two separate experiments at two different commercial beef processing plants. Hide and carcass samples were collected and analyzed for E. coli O 157 :H 7 prevalence and concentration. <b>Cattle</b> <b>hides</b> receiving phage treatment had an E. coli O 157 :H 7 prevalence of 51. 8 %, whereas untreated hides had a prevalence of 57. 6 %. For carcass samples, the E. coli O 157 prevalence in treated and untreated samples was 17. 1 % and 17. 6 %, respectively. The results obtained from these experiments demonstrated that the treatment of <b>cattle</b> <b>hides</b> with bacteriophages before processing did not produce a significant reduction of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on <b>cattle</b> <b>hides</b> or beef carcasses during processing...|$|R

50|$|The {{collagen}} fibre bundles in <b>cattle</b> <b>hide</b> {{are arranged in}} a complex weaving pattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin surface. <b>Cattle</b> <b>hide</b> also contains sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a distinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in {{the upper part of}} the skin. Kangaroo hide on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform orientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not contain sweat glands or erector pili muscles and elastin is evenly distributed throughout the skin thickness. This structural uniformity explains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the greater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in cross section. Hence in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears can start when placed under tension. In addition when sliced into splits the {{collagen fibre}}s running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut. These then become weak points in the structural strength.|$|E
50|$|Latigo {{is usually}} infused with oils and waxes. Techniques such as hot-stuffing, wet-stuffing, and fat {{liquoring}} {{have been devised}} {{to increase the amount}} of oil and wax the hide can hold. Due to oil/wax infusion, and its partial chrome tanning, the leather is moderately flexible, less rigid than full vegetable tans, but more rigid than full chrome tans. Because of its weight and tanning process, latigo is among the most expensive <b>cattle</b> <b>hide</b> leathers.|$|E

50|$|The land {{currently}} {{occupied by}} the city of Salinas is thought to have been settled by Native Americans known as the Esselen prior to 200 AD. Between 200 and 500 AD, they were displaced by the Rumsen group of Ohlone speaking people, who were the inhabitants at contact with the Spanish. Large Spanish land grants for the Catholic Missions and as bonuses to soldiers gave way to Mexican land grants for smaller ranchos where mostly cattle were grazed, and a thriving trade in <b>cattle</b> <b>hide</b> came through the Port of Monterey.|$|E

5000|$|In October 22, 2,000 {{rebels were}} killed in the {{consequent}} Battle of Jajak Pass, the largest battle in Gangwon Province before the Korean War. The rebels lacked guns, and they used birch branches as weapons.

Maeng himself reports that [...] "it was impossible to see how many died", but descendants have given an estimate of 1,800~2,000.

5000|$|A Nguni shield is a traditional, pointed oval-shaped, ox or cowhide shield {{which is}} used by various ethnic groups among the Nguni people of {{southern}} Africa. Recently it is used by diviners or for ceremonial and symbolic purposes, and many are produced for the tourist market. A cow-hide shield is known as isihlangu, ihawu or ingubha in Zulu, and ikhaka or ikhawu in Xhosa. Strictly speaking these native names denote shields of different application, and additional types are known by other names. War shields were traditionally stockpiled by a chief or king, to whom they belonged, while a smaller shield was reserved for his subordinates' personal daily use, or as a complement at their dancing ceremonies. True Nguni shields are made of raw <b>cattle</b> <b>hide,</b> as the esteemed Sanga-Nguni cattle lend distinction to the shields, which are more than mere commodities for physical protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{central unit}} of Maasai society is the age-set. Young boys are sent {{out with the}} calves and lambs {{as soon as they}} can toddle, but {{childhood}} for boys is mostly playtime, with the exception of ritual beatings to test courage and endurance. Girls are responsible for chores such as cooking and milking, skills which they learn from their mothers at an early age. Every 15 years or so, a new and individually named generation of Morans or Il-murran (warriors) will be initiated. This involves most boys between 12 and 25, who have reached puberty and {{are not part of the}} previous age-set. One rite of passage from boyhood to the status of junior warrior is a circumcision ceremony performed without anaesthetic. In modern times, boys living close to towns with doctors may endure the ceremony in safer conditions, but still without anaesthetic because they must endure the pain that will lead them to manhood. This ritual is typically performed by the elders, who use a sharpened knife and makeshift <b>cattle</b> <b>hide</b> bandages for the procedure. The Maa word for circumcision is emorata. The boy must endure the operation in silence. Expressions of pain bring dishonor, albeit temporarily. Any exclamations can cause a mistake in the delicate and tedious process, which can result in lifelong scarring, dysfunction, and pain. The healing process will take 3-4 months, during which urination is painful and nearly impossible at times, and boys must remain in black clothes for a period of 4-8 months.|$|E
5000|$|Women's {{traditional}} {{clothes in}} Ethiopia {{are made from}} cloth called shemma and are used to make habesha kemis. The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90 cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the fabric for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men {{as well as women}} wear shawls, the netela.Zulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernised clothing for everyday use. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the umutsha (pronounced [...] ), and is usually made of springbok or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ibheshu , is made of a single piece of springbok or <b>cattle</b> <b>hide,</b> and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the umqhele , which is usually also made of springbok hide, or leopard hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called imishokobezi [...] during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.|$|E
