Kelly then moved into a flat with Paul Hewson (Dragon) in Elizabeth Bay. Both Walker and Hewson {{encouraged}} Kelly to continue with his song-writing. By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album—at a cost of $3,500—Post. Session musicians included Michael Barclay (Weddings Parties Anything) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmermen), and bass guitarist Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X). They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare's studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.|$|E

25|$|Barnes took an {{apprenticeship}} in a foundry {{with the}} South Australian Railways in 1973 but the love {{he and his}} brother had for music led him to join a band. Swanee was now playing drums with Fraternity, who had just parted ways with singer Bon Scott. Barnes took over the role but his tenure with the band was brief and before long he had joined a harder-edged band called Orange, featuring organist and songwriter Don Walker, guitarist Ian Moss, drummer Steve Prestwich and bassist Les Kaczmarek (who would be replaced by Phil Small within two years). Within a short time the group had changed its name to <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel</b> and began to develop a strong presence on the local music scene. Barnes' relationship with the band was often volatile and he left several times, leaving Moss to handle vocal duties until he returned. After a temporary move to Armidale, New South Wales while Walker completed his engineering studies there, <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel</b> moved to Melbourne in August 1976 and then three months later shifted base to Sydney. Progress was slow and Barnes announced he was leaving once again in May 1977 to join Swanee in a band called Feather. However, his farewell performance with <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel</b> went so well that he changed his mind and decided to stay in the band and a month later the band was signed by WEA.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their initial}} {{dissolution}} in 1982 <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel</b> lead vocalist Jimmy Barnes {{embarked on a}} successful solo career that has continued from the 1980s to the present. Many of Barnes' albums have featured versions of songs from these genres and his chart-topping album Soul Deep (1991) consisted entirely of covers of classic 1960s soul/R covers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>chisels</b> come in {{a variety}} of sizes, from fine {{engraving}} tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. <b>Cold</b> <b>chisels</b> are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge. The head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to withstand hammer blows.|$|R

500|$|Tea & Sympathys {{critical}} reception was moderate. It {{was generally}} {{seen as being}} less entertaining than Fanning's Powderfinger work—The Age said Powderfinger were a [...] "rock band ingrained in the national psyche" [...] like <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel,</b> but that Tea & Sympathy showed little resemblance to <b>Cold</b> <b>Chisel</b> frontman Jimmy Barnes's groundbreaking debut album, Bodyswerve. Barnaby Smith of musicOMH said the album was not [...] "a work to suggest [...] solo career might better Powderfinger". The BBC's Jenna Bachelor wrote that the album is [...] "pleasant enough without pulling up any trees".|$|E
