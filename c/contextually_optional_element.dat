40|$|Can <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> work as triggers? And more generally, how is {{the grammar}} {{constrained}} to guarantee that the child will have reliable triggers? The passive rule in English is an ideal domain for this inquiry because it has both obligatory and <b>optional</b> <b>elements,</b> and they are deployed differently in two major dialects of English, African American English (AAE) and mainstream American English (MAE). Both dialects have the passive construction, and children of both dialect groups take a relatively long time in learning it. The effect of the optional or obligatory nature of the cues on learning the passive for the two dialect groups may {{shed light on the}} status of <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> as triggers. Furthermore, both obligatory and <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> of the passive are often compromised in language impairment, so learning of the construction by that population provides another avenue where the facts of acquisition may bear on the question of adequate triggers...|$|R

40|$|The WWW {{contains}} {{a huge amount}} of documents. Some of them share the subject, but are generated by different people or even organizations. To guarantee the interchange of such documents, we can use XML. This allows to share documents that {{do not have the same}} structure. However, it makes difficult to understand the core of such heterogeneous documents (in general, schema is not available). In this paper, we offer a characterization and algorithm to obtain the midpoint (in terms of a resemblance function) of a set of semi-structured, heterogeneous documents without <b>optional</b> <b>elements.</b> The trivial case of midpoint would be the common elements to all documents. Nevertheless, in cases with several heterogeneous documents this may result in an empty set. Thus, we consider that those elements present in a given amount of documents belong to the midpoint. Once we have such midpoint, the algorithm is generalized for the obtaining of repetitions and <b>optional</b> <b>elements.</b> Thus, a exact schema can always be found generating <b>optional</b> <b>elements.</b> However, the exact schema of the whole set may result in overspecialization (lots of <b>optional</b> <b>elements),</b> which would make it useless. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Information Card (InfoCard) is a {{user-centric}} {{identity management}} metasystem. It has been ac-cepted {{as a standard}} of OASIS Identity Metasystem Inter-operability Technical Committee. However, there is cur-rently a lack of security analysis to InfoCard protocol, es-pecially, with formal methods. In this paper, we accommo-date such a requirement by analyzing security properties of InfoCard protocol adopting a formal protocol analysis tool. Our analysis result discovers that current InfoCard proto-col is vulnerable against the session replay attack. Further-more, we reveal the importance of two <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> in InfoCard metasystem, token scope and proof key, and found that InfoCard protocol will be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attack and token replay attack if these two <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> lack.

40|$|To express object transfer, Cantonese-speakers use a ditransitive ([V-R-T] or [V-T-R] where V=Verb, T=Theme, R=Recipient), or a {{more complex}} prepositional/serial-verb (P/SV) construction. Clausal {{elements}} in Cantonese datives can be optional (resulting in full versus non-full forms) or appear in variant orders (full non-canonical and full canonical). We report on usage of dative constructions with the word bei 2 to give in 86 parents and 53 three-year-old children during conversations. The parents used more P/SV than ditransitive bei 2 -datives, and vice versa for the children. Both groups showed a similar usage pattern of <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> and variant structures in their ditransitive and P/SV bei 2 -datives. The roles of multiple construction types, <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> and variant structures in children's learning of bei 2 -dative constructions are described.

40|$|Questions {{of state}} {{sovereignty}} are {{the cause of}} many conflicts today. The theory of earned sovereignty is an evolving concept. A review of recent practice in southern Sudan, Bougainville, and Aceh shows that the core elements of earned sovereignty offer a three-part roadmap for conflict resolution beginning with shared sovereignty, continuing through institution building, and ending at a determination of final status. Other parts of the theory called, “optional elements,” are tools stakeholders in a conflict situation may use {{in order to move}} from one core element to another until a final status solution is obtained. Though the <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> of phased sovereignty, conditional sovereignty, and constrained sovereignty are parts of earned sovereignty they need not always be used. In-depth analysis of the peace agreements in southern Sudan, Bougainville, and Aceh show that, while the core elements are implemented throughout, the <b>optional</b> <b>elements</b> are used to varying degrees and in some instances not at all...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The script {{frameworks}} model (R. Schank, 1975) and causal {{network model}} (T. Trabasso 2 ̆ 6 L. Sperry, 1985) {{were used to}} assess script-based story retellings of children with and without language impairments (LI). When retelling scripts and stories, children developing typically include (a) more obligatory than <b>optional</b> <b>elements,</b> with few temporal sequencing errors, and (b) story elements having several versus few causal connections to other story elements. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether children with LI demonstrated a similar pattern of recall. Method: A script-based story retell was collected from 22 children with LI and 22 age-matched peers (AM). Retells were analyzed for inclusion of obligatory and <b>optional</b> <b>elements,</b> elements with high and low causal connectivity, and temporal sequencing accuracy. Results: Retells from both groups contained more obligatory elements and elements with high causal connectivity. However, groups differed on the specific elements included. Conclusions: Children in the AM group appeared to utilize script and causal connectivity elements when retelling a script-based story. Children in the LI group appeared to focus more on script elements than causal connectivity. Their deficiencies may reflect difficulties with flexible application of scripts and accessing relevant knowledge, and/or generalized difficulties organizing information and extracting patterns...|$|R
