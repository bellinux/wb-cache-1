40|$|Abstract: Communication {{nowadays}} {{is based}} on <b>communication</b> <b>platforms</b> like Skype, Facebook, or SecondLife. The formal modeling and analysis of communi-cation platforms poses considerable challenges, namely highly dynamic structures and complex behavior. Since most of the well-known formal modeling approaches are adequate only for specific aspects of <b>communication</b> <b>platforms,</b> {{in this paper we}} introduce the approach of reconfigurable algebraic high-level nets with individual tokens and show in our case study Skype that this approach is adequate for model-ing the main aspects and features of <b>communication</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlgebraic High-Level (AHL) nets are a {{well-known}} modelling technique based on Petri nets with algebraic data types, which allows {{to model the}} communication structure and the data flow within one modelling framework. Transformations of AHL-nets–inspired by the theory of graph transformations–allow in addition to modify the communication structure. Moreover, high-level processes of AHL-nets capture the concurrent semantics of AHL-nets in an adequate way. Altogether, we obtain a powerful integrated formal specification technique to model and analyse all kinds of communication based systems, especially different kinds of <b>communication</b> <b>platforms.</b> In this paper, we show how to model the evolution of <b>communication</b> <b>platforms</b> and scenarios based on transformations of algebraic high-level nets and processes. All constructions and results are illustrated by a small case study showing the evolution of Apache Wave platforms and scenarios. The evolution of platforms is modelled by the transformation of AHL-nets and that of scenarios by the transformation of AHL-net processes. Two new results for transformation of AHL-net processes are presented, motivated by the evolution of <b>communication</b> <b>platforms</b> and scenarios...|$|R
