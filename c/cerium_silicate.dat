40|$|The {{luminescent}} {{and structural}} properties of cerium and terbium co-doped silicon oxide thin films were investigated through transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. While combined {{blue and green}} luminescence characteristic of Ce 3 + and Tb 3 + ions, respectively, was observed from different compositions of films, the emission intensity from samples in which Ce 2 Si 2 O 7 nanocrystallites were formed after high temperature annealing was much stronger than in films where the Ce and Tb co-dopants were incorporated in an amorphous SiO 2 host matrix. Films containing the <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> phase also exhibited a very strong enhancement of Tb emission. X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray excited optical luminescence analysis at the Si L 3, 2 -, Si K-, O K-, Ce N 4 -, and Ce M 5, 4 -edges indicated this enhancement was likely {{the result of a}} direct energy transfer process between the <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> and Tb levels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present work {{reports a}} {{nanoscale}} chemical and structural {{study on the}} influence of Ce content in Ce-doped SiO 1. 5 thin films via atom probe tomography (APT). Using this technique, we can explore 3 D mapping of the atomic distribution inside a material. Such an investigation is crucial to optimize the optical properties of Ce-doped SiOx films. As a result, we clearly identify the influence of cerium on the phase separation process, on the silicon nanocrystal growth, and on the formation of <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> nanoparticles occurring during annealing treatments. The observed nanoscale structure is correlated with the optical properties measured by room temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy thus leading to a comprehensive understanding of the properties of Ce-doped SiO 1. 5 thin films...|$|E
40|$|Équipe 104 : NanomatériauxInternational audienceThe optical {{properties}} of Ce-doped SiO 2 thin films were investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy. Strong blue luminescence is obtained {{at room temperature}} from as-deposited films. The dependence of the luminescence on both Ce content and annealing temperature is then systematically studied. The luminescence is found to shift to higher wavelength as the annealing temperature increases. Moreover, the integrated luminescence intensity first increases for annealing temperatures between 500 degrees C and 900 degrees C {{as a result of}} the activation of Ce 3 + ions and eventually decreases for higher temperatures which is interpreted by the formation of cerium clusters. At 1100 degrees C, the formation of a <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> phase is observed by infrared absorption spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm the formation of an orthorhombic Ce 6 Si 4 (SiO 4) (2) O- 13 compound...|$|E
40|$|Équipe 102 : Surfaces et SpectroscopiesInternational audienceBoth {{the optical}} and {{structural}} properties of Ce-doped SiO 1. 5 thin films were investigated. The Ce-related blue luminescence, {{which can be}} seen even {{at room temperature for}} as-grown films, exhibits a rather complex evolution with the annealing temperature. In particular, a strong decrease is observed when the films are annealed at 900 degrees C. Structural characterizations combining scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography reveal the formation of Si- and Ce-rich clusters at this temperature, thus demonstrating that the decreasing Ce-related luminescence is due to concentration induced quenching. For annealing temperatures higher than 900 degrees C, the Ce-related luminescence increases. The different structural characterizations provide clear experimental evidence of a phase separation occurring at the nanoscale between pure Si nanocrystals and Ce-rich clusters having a stoichiometry close to the <b>cerium</b> <b>silicates</b> Ce 2 Si 2 O 7 or Ce- 4. 667 (SiO 4) (3) O. The latter compounds are optically active thereby explaining the increased Ce-related luminescence observed at the highest annealing temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} of four A(3) MSi(6) O(15) (. nH(2) O) silicates (A = Na or K, M = Nd or Y) recently {{determined by the}} authors are compared {{with one another and}} with the {{structures of}} related silicates. The 2 : 5 Si:O ratio in these compounds (silicate tetrahedra linked by sharing three O atoms per tetrahedron plus one unshared O atom) permits layer, double-chain, or double-ring configurations. In alpha-K 3 NdSi 6 O 15. 2 H(2) O, beta-K 3 NdSi 6 O 15, and Na 3 NdSi 6 O 15. 2 H(2) O, the linkage is found to result in a corrugated layered structure, in beta-Na 3 YSi 6 O 15 a double-chain structure, and in alpha-Na 3 YSi 6 O 15 a unique double-ring structure. Although the factors that govern the stabilities of ring vs. chain vs. layered structures remain to be completely elucidated, it is apparent in the layered structures that larger M cations (such as Nd and Ce) produce a greater degree of corrugation than do Zr and Ti cations. The more open structures of neodymium and <b>cerium</b> <b>silicates</b> contain large channels that may serve as pathways for fast alkali ion transport...|$|R

40|$|CeO 2 {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on silicon and silicon nitride substrates by magnetron sputtering {{at room temperature}} and annealed at 400 and 600 °C in air and vacuum. Interaction between deposited CeO 2 and Si in CeO 2 /Si and CeO 2 /Si 3 N 4 systems was investigated by XPS. The results show that Ce is present as both Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + oxidation states in CeO 2 film deposited on Si substrate, whereas Ce 4 + is the main species in as-deposited CeO 2 /Si 3 N 4 film. Detailed analyses of Ce 3 d, Si 2 p and O 1 s core level spectra demonstrate that Ce 2 O 3 and SiOx or <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> type of species are formed at the interface of CeO 2 and Si. Concentrations of Ce 3 + species increase drastically in CeO 2 /Si thin films after annealing at 400 °C in vacuum due to enhanced interfacial reaction. On the other hand, interfacial reaction between CeO 2 and Si 3 N 4 substrate is limited in as-deposited as well as 600 °C heat treated films...|$|E
40|$|The redox {{features}} of Rh and other noble metals (Pt, Pd) supported on silica-doped ceria catalysts are investigated by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Noble metal oxides {{are reduced to}} the corresponding metals at temperatures below 600 K, whereas at higher temperatures {{the reduction of the}} support takes place with formation of reduced ceria and a <b>cerium</b> <b>silicate</b> phase. After redox aging, reduction of the support in the bulk occurs at lower temperatures; this effect depends on the amount of silicon present. A more detailed reduction profile is obtained by monitoring water evolution during TPR in both ceria and ceria-silica-based catalysts. Differences are observed in H- 2 consumption and water formation which are not always simultaneous: their positions depend on redox treatments, precursor salt used for preparation, and type of support. Oxidation of CO under oscillating feedstream conditions is used as an estimate of dynamic oxygen storage capacity. Redox treatment promotes oxygen storage on both the support and noble-metals-supported samples. This is related to the formation during reduction of a silicate phase, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and HRTEM analysis, which on reoxidation gives small particles of nanocrystalline ceria...|$|E
