40|$|Objective: The greater {{acceptance}} of acupuncture by healthcare professionals {{and the public}} has increased the importance of addressing public concern about its safety. Of particular concern has been the potential for transmission of infectious disease and organ and tissue injury, {{as well as the}} training and professional standards of acupuncture practitioners. This paper, therefore, addresses the following question: What is the frequency and severity of adverse complications and events in acupuncture treatment? Data Sources: All first-hand case reports of complications and adverse effects of acupuncture that could be identified in the English language literature were reviewed and classified according to type of complication or adverse effect, circumstances of the event, credentials of the acupuncturist, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence,</b> and long-term patient outcome. Study Selection: The case reports were selected by a search of 9 databases and covered the years between 1965 - 1999. Data Extraction: Relevant papers were collected and analyzed by 2 reviewers. Over the 35 years, 202 incidents were identified in 98 relevant papers reported from 22 countries. Results: Types of complications included infections (primarily hepatitis from a few practitioners), and organ, tissue, and nerve injury. Adverse effects included cutaneous disorders, hypotension, fainting, and vomiting. There is a trend toward fewer reported serious complications after 1988. Conclusions: Declines in adverse reports may suggest that recent practices, such as clean needle techniques and more rigorous acupuncturist training requirements, have reduced the risks associated with the procedure. Therefore, acupuncture performed by trained practitioners using clean needle techniques is a generally safe procedure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In a taxonomic {{review of}} the species of the Heterodera "cacti group," H. thornei n. sp. is {{described}} and illustrated from Miner's lettuce in California. This new species is distinguishable especially by havpunctate egg shells and a larval stylet (27 μm) and tail (56 μm) longer than other related species. Heterodera weissi is redescribed, type specimens are designated, and new data added {{on the basis of}} original and topotype specimens. New morphometric data, along with illustrations, are given for H. cacti, H. amaranthi, and H. estonica, and certain details in the original descriptions are clarified on the latter two species. Diagnoses and a key for identification of these species are given. A common name for each species is proposed when one is lacking. Previously unrecognized tooth-like structures occurring in the vulval cone top of these species and in H. schachtii are characterized and named "vulval denticles. " Because of its markedly different morphology, especially in cysts, H. betulae is removed from the H. cacti group and placed alone, since it is incompatible with any of the present Heterodera "groups.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to compare gender inequalities in sports participation across Europe, {{and the extent to which}} this varies by age using large, cross-sections of the population. The Eurobarometer Survey 62. 0 (carried out in 2004 at the request of the European Commission and covering the adult population of 25 European member states, N= 23, 909) was used to analyse differences in regular sports participation by gender and by age in the different countries. For the majority <b>of</b> <b>countries,</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> regular sporting activity was less than 40 %. Additionally, binary logistic regression analyses identified significant gender differences in sports participation in 12 countries. In Belgium, France, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK, men were more likely to report being regularly active in sports than women, whereas in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands the opposite was true. Moreover, the extent to which these gender inequalities differ by age varies considerably across countries. The results imply that: (i) in some European countries more efforts must be undertaken to promote the original goals of the Sport for All Charter, and (ii) to achieve more female participation in sports will require different policy responses in the diverse European member states...|$|R

Infected specimens included Colostethus olfersioides (Dendrobatidae), Bokermannohyla gouveai and Hypsiboas freicanecae (Hylidae), as well as Thoropa miliaris and Crossodactylus caramaschii (Leptodactylidae), extending the area <b>of</b> B. dendrobatidis <b>occurrence</b> in Brazil approximately 1, 600 km N, 200 km S, and 270 km E. The altitudinal range of the chytrid is broad, spanning from less than 100 m (Estação Ecológica Juréia-Itatins, Reserva Biológica do Tinguá) to about 2, 400 m (Parque Nacional do Itatiaia).
