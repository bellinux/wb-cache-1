2500|$|The page 425 {{legislation}} {{began as}} a separate bill that was co-sponsored by Republicans Charles Boustany, Patrick Tiberi and Geoff Davis. Boustany, a heart surgeon, said the end-of-life legislation was a [...] "good medical practice". 204 GOP House members and 42 GOP Senators voted for a 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill that included end-of-life counseling. The 2003 legislation only covered end-of-life counseling for terminally ill patients, which the Republican <b>Charles</b> <b>Grassley</b> supported. Grassley said that the 2009 end-of-life counseling would [...] "pull the plug on grandma" [...] and that [...] "You shouldn't have counseling {{at the end of}} life, you should have done that 20 years before," [...] which is what the 2009 legislation would allow.

He said that Rush Limbaugh, Virginia Foxx, Newt Gingrich, <b>Charles</b> <b>Grassley</b> and other Republicans defended the death panel story only after Betsy McCaughey's editorials, and that some people at town hall meetings even wanted to [...] "keep government out of their Medicare," [...] a government run program. Blumenauer said that as recently as April 2008 then-governor Palin supported end-of-life counseling as part of Health Care Decisions Day. Palin's office called this comparison [...] "hysterically funny" [...] and [...] "desperate". Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who co-sponsored a 2007 end-of-life counseling provision, called the euthanasia claim [...] "nuts". Analysts who examined the end-of-life provision Palin cited agreed that it merely authorized Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling for advance health care directives (including living wills). According to TIME and ABC, Palin and McCaughey made false euthanasia claims.|$|E
