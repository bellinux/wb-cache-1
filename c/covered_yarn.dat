Drawing Spandex to be a core yarn of <b>covered</b> <b>yarn</b> into the hollow spindles is so complicated that its automation is especially hoped. So we developed an auto drawing-in apparatus that could draw Spandex in both upper and lower hollow spindles simultaneously.

Spandex was drawn into the lower spindle by the injection flow driven by the injector and was drawn from the upper spindle by the suction flow driven by the ejector. (2) Drawing-in was performed for a model covering machine by the developed auto-doffing apparatus. It could draw-in 20 D Spandex that was widely used and was too thin to be easily drawn-in even by a manual doffing operation. So this confirmed that the developed auto-doffing apparatus had practical utility in drawing -in operation.

Four types of fabrics were knitted with polyester SCY (Single <b>Covered</b> <b>Yarn).</b> Then fabric size including weight and thickness, stretch properties (stretch, elastic recovery), and clothing pressure were then measured, to analyze their interrelation. A comparison of fabric size indicated that yarn floating caused reduction in both course and wale-wise specimens; in addition, yarn overlapping caused a release in course-wise and shrinkage in wale–wise due to tuck. The high density caused by shrinkage in the course-wise due to yarn floating rather than overlapping influenced the weight and thickness of knitted fabrics. Yarn floating reduced course-wise elasticity and increased wale-wise elasticity in the fabric stretch test; however, yarn overlapping reduced elasticity in both directions. The elastic recovery analysis indicated that the recovery value gap among four specimens decreased over time. In comparison clothing pressure, ‘plain-float’ fabric showed higher clothing pressure than ‘plain’, while the pressure value of ‘plain-tuck’ was similar to ‘plain’. Dimensional change in course-wise had a greater effect on clothing pressure than in wale-wise in the correlation among fabric size, stretch properties and clothing pressure. Weight and thickness change exerted a strong influence on clothing pressure which vertically presses down the body.

40|$|T he textile {{industry}} {{is the largest}} water user and wastewater producer in North Carolina. Typically a large mill will produce over two million gallons of wastewater per day, which is discharged into treatment systems then to the environ-ment. Whether the mill operates its own treatment system or discharges to a pub-liclyowned treatment works(POTW), the cost of treating this pollution is high. In 1980, a large mill reported wastewater treatment operating expenses of over $ 221, 000 (Table I). Mills that discharge to POTW's also pay {{a high price for}} po l luu l t discharges. A summary of charges from typical North Carolina mu-nicipalities (Ealeigh, Rocky Mount, New-ton, Asheville and Fayetteville) is shown in Table 11. Based on these charges, it is not unusual to find even small mills paying $ 10, 000 to $ 50, 000 per month in sewer surcharges. In addition to wastewater treatment costs, large costs are involved in disposal of solid waste. For example, a mill producing one million pounds of woven fabrics per week might consume 6 % on the weight of the goods or 60, 000 pounds of size mate-rial.

It was clearly demonstrated from the drag force measurements that the yarn construction and fiber composition have a substantial effect on the drag coefficient (CD), with fabrics composed of spun yarn experiencing no CD-drop as opposed to those composed of filament yarn, and being almost unaffected by the cover factor in the range of Reynolds numbers investigated. Hairiness of the spun yarn was found to minimise the drag-reducing effect of the boundary layer transition and increase the trans-critical drag. The hairy surface layer also appeared to retard the turbulent boundary layer as almost no pressure recovery was observed prior to separation on the cylinder model. The effect of elastic deformation was investigated by image analysis of scanned textile samples, and demonstrated that surface roughness might not be directly correlated to cover factor when the fabrics are stretched. Different elastic behavior of fabrics with different cover factors was also found to affect the structure of the knit surface and thus their aerodynamic behavior.

40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} {{consideration of the}} late sixteenth/early seventeenth century gilt and silk knitted jackets, based on close examination of seventeen examples held in various collections in North America and Europe. Little is known about them, so that mostly speculation has been published as fact. They {{have been identified as}} jackets for men, created on knitting frames and on knitting machines, and in the past, were almost always identified as of Italian origin or manufacture. My argument, having closely examined seventeen, is that • they were in fact handknitted: the technology simply did not exist in the early seventeenth century for two-color knitting, nor for reverse stockinette and garter stitch, nor were the frames capable of knitting with the metal - <b>covered</b> <b>yarns.</b> Too, a few of the jackets have sleeves knit in the round, also impossible in frame knitting in the seventeenth century. The range of gauge in this sample is 13 to 20 stitches to the inch. Knitting frames were limited to no more than eight stitches to the inch until well into the seventeenth century, and ribbing attachments were not invented until the 1730 s. • they were made for women. The largest one I 2 ̆ 7 ve examined is from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art [AC 1995. 1. 1], which has a 36 inch chest. The average of twelve jackets is 30 inches. The smallest has a 27 inch chest, from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts [06. 2397], but the garments are not easy to measure in hard and fast terms. Despite the small circumferences, most have long sleeves and bodies, and would not suit children. • More importantly, the cut of most of the jackets follows ladies 2 ̆ 7 fashion of the period much more than that of men. • At least some were made in England. Although they are often referred to as Italian, I would argue this is {{based on the fact that}} many of the floral patterns are Italianate, which were readily available in the popular pattern books all over Europe. There is at least one jacket in a Scandinavian collection with an English export seal. according to Santina Levey. Many of the motifs, including those in Scandinavia, appear on the sixteenth century Burato sampler from Little Morton Hall. • They were independently made by different people, although the knitting of the majority was done in consistently the same fashion: a rectangle for the back, two narrower rectangles for the fronts, and two rectangles for the sleeves, all knitted flat and sewn together. All shaping was done in the construction; by taking larger seam allowances, folding under edges, etc [...] There are very few similarities in actual construction: i. e., one is fully lined, one has lined sleeves, another has only lined cuffs. It 2 ̆ 7 s possible that separate elements of one garment were made by different knitters, and assembled by another.

Abby Lillethun’s interest in analyzing mud silks brought this cloth, identified as Xiang-yun-shā, from obscurity to notoriety. Its most obvious feature is the two-colored surfaces created by first dyeing the fabric and then coating one side with black mud as described in the preceding papers by Lillethun and Lin. The selvage of the URI fabric, seen from the backside in figure 1, has some iron-rich mud along the edge and some stitching holes from a previous use. The geometric leno-weave pattern creates a key design with a little openness in the structure. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrograph in figure 2 shows some open spaces {{on either side of the}} diverted warps of the leno weave that run diagonally across the picture.

An increase in take-down load also improved NPR for tightly knitted samples, but led to initial decrease and subsequent increase in NPR for medium and higher loop lengths; except for p-AR fabrics, which showed a decrease in NPR with take-down load for higher loop lengths. Tensile properties of the developed auxetic structures were also found to depend strongly on fibre type and loop length, and the highest tensile performance was achieved with lower loop lengths and p-AR yarns. The p-AR fabrics produced using lower loop length and lower take-down load resulted in the highest NPR of− 0. 713. Therefore, the developed knitted structures produced using high performance yarns and showing strong auxetic effects can have huge potential for industrial applications, especially in personal protection materials, such as cut resistance fabrics, bullet proof vest, helmets, and so on.
