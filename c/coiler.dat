25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the <b>coiler</b> mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} automated detection of complex (non-self-avoiding) postures of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its application to analyses of locomotion defects. Our approach is based on progressively detailed statistical models that enable detection {{of the head and}} the body even in cases of severe <b>coilers,</b> where data from traditional trackers is limited. We restrict the input available to the algorithm to a single digitized frame, such that manual initialization is not required and the detection problem becomes embarrassingly parallel. Consequently, the proposed algorithm does not propagate detection errors and naturally integrates in a "big data" workflow used for large-scale analyses. Using this framework, we analyzed the dynamics of postures and locomotion of wild-type animals and mutants that exhibit severe coiling phenotypes. Our approach can readily be extended to additional automated tracking tasks such as tracking pairs of animals (e. g., for mating assays) or different species...|$|R
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of {{that highly}} {{sympathetic}} nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.

60|$|It {{came to my}} knowledge, {{through what}} passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was {{attentive}} to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all. Drummle didn't say much, but in his limited way (he {{struck me as a}} sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. <b>Coiler</b> the toady neighbor showed any interest {{in this part of the}} conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the carving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he was about.|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} monitoring package, AusRivAS, {{was used to}} develop a broad scale picture of {{the health of the}} Mersey catchment. Nineteen sites were selected within the catchment, five on the mainstream Mersey River, three on the Dasher River, two each on the Minnow River, Redwater Creek and Lobster Rivulet, and one each on smaller tributaries downstream from Parangana Dam. Key findings from the survey: · The majority of the Mersey River appears to be in reasonable health. The macroinvertebrate community in lower the reaches indicates a slight impact, most likely a result of water quality, and just below Parangana Dam there is evidence that the river is slightly impaired, a result of flow and habitat alterations caused by the dam. · There is a general loss of taxa sensitive to water pollution {{down the length of the}} Mersey River. · Tributaries in the lower catchment are of a major concern. Kings and Parramatta Creeks were identified to be severely impaired and Bonneys Creek was identified to be impaired.

40|$|<b>Coiler</b> drums are {{integral}} {{components of the}} Steckel mill reversing hot strip rolling process. A Steckel mill produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the Steckel mill. <b>Coiler</b> drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases. In order to obtain high rolling speeds and retain temperature, the strip is successively coiled and uncoiled, under tension, onto and from the heated <b>coiler</b> drums during processing. As <b>coiler</b> drums have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, <b>coiler</b> drum performance is important to Steckel mill operators. The high cost is associated with the high alloy composition of the casting and the specialised manufacturing process required for the production of <b>coiler</b> drums. Deterioration of the <b>coiler</b> drum condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip.

A three-dimensional finite element model of a bolted joint has been developed using Pro-E wildfire 4. 0 and analysis has been done in ANSYS 11 commercial package.
