40|$|Electronic {{structure}} {{calculations of}} GaAs inversion-domain boundaries (IDBs) on different planes are reported. The resulting interface energies are analyzed {{in terms of}} the number of 'wrong' bonds (Ga-Ga and As-As) and their mutual compensation. The <b>compensation</b> <b>energy</b> varies roughly inversely proportionally to the distance between the wrong bonds. This favors local compensation in stoichiometric material. This automatically occurs for 110 -plane planes or by chemical reconstruction for other planes. Ga-rich IDBs are predicted to have low energy in either Ga-rich or n-type material...|$|E

40|$|Weight {{loss from}} exercise-induced energy deficits is usually less than expected. The {{objective}} of this systematic review was to investigate predictors of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation,</b> which is defined as body energy changes (fat mass and fat-free mass) over {{the total amount of}} exercise energy expenditure. A search was conducted in multiple databases without date limits. Of 4745 studies found, 61 were included in this systematic review with a total of 928 subjects. The overall mean <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was 18 % ± 93 %. The analyses indicated that 48 % of the variance of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> is explained by the interaction between initial fat mass, age and duration of exercise interventions. Sex, frequency, intensity and dose of exercise energy expenditure were not significant predictors of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> The fitted model suggested that for a shorter study duration, lower <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was observed in younger individuals with higher initial fat mass (FM). In contrast, higher <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was noted for younger individuals with lower initial FM. From 25 weeks onward, <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was no longer different for these predictors. For studies of longer duration (about 80 weeks), the <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> approached 84 %. Lower <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> occurs with short-term exercise, and a much higher level of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> accompanies long-term exercise interventions...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> after a preload (meal, snack, or beverage) {{has been}} {{associated}} with excess energy intake, but experimental studies have used heterogeneous methodologies, making <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> difficult to predict. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the relative contributions of two key variables, preload physical form and intermeal interval (IMI), to differences in <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> Forty-eight publications were included, from which percent <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> (%EC) data were extracted for 253 interventions (121 liquid, 69 semisolid, 20 solid, and 43 composite preloads). <b>Energy</b> <b>compensation</b> ranged from - 370 % (overconsumption, mostly of liquids) to 450 % (overcompensation). A meta-regression analysis of studies reporting positive <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> showed that IMI (as the predominant factor) together with preload physical form and energy contributed significantly to %EC differences, accounting for 50 % of the variance, independently from gender and BMI. <b>Energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was maximized when the preload was in semisolid/solid form and the IMI was 30 - 120 min. These results may assist in the interpretation of studies assessing the relative efficacy of interventions to enhance satiety, including functional foods and weight management products...|$|R
40|$|Many {{individuals}} lose less {{weight than}} expected {{in response to}} exercise interventions when considering the increased energy expenditure of exercise (ExEE). This is due to <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> in response to ExEE, which may include increases in energy intake (EI) and decreases in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA). We examined the degree of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> in healthy {{young men and women}} in response to interval training. Data were examined from a prior study in which 24 participants (mean age, BMI, & VO 2 max = 28 yrs, 27. 7 kg•m- 2, and 32 mL∙kg- 1 ∙min- 1) completed either 4 weeks of sprint-interval training or high-intensity interval training. <b>Energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was calculated from changes in body composition (air displacement plethysmography) and exercise energy expenditure was calculated from mean heart rate based on the heart rate-VO 2 relationship. Differences between high (≥ 100 %) and low (< 100 %) levels of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> were assessed. Linear regressions were utilized to determine associations between <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> and ΔVO 2 max, ΔEI, ΔNEPA, and Δresting metabolic rate. Very large individual differences in <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> were noted. In comparison to individuals with low levels of compensation, individuals with high levels of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> gained fat mass, lost fat-free mass, and had lower change scores for VO 2 max and NEPA. Linear regression results indicated that lower levels of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> were associated with increases in ΔVO 2 max (p < 0. 001) and ΔNEPA (p < 0. 001). Considerable variation exists in response to short-term, low dose interval training. In agreement with prior work, increases in ΔVO 2 max and ΔNEPA were associated with lower <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> Future studies should focus on identifying if a dose-response relationship for <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> exists in response to interval training, and what underlying mechanisms and participant traits contribute to the large variation between individuals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{determine}} <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> following exercise induced energy expenditure (ExEE). The specific objectives were: I) {{to determine}} {{the impact of the}} time spent performing physical activity (PA) of varying intensities on body weight and composition (Study 1); II) {{to determine the}} overall <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> and the major predictors of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> through the systematic review approach (Study 2); III) to develop new methods to measure energy intake (EI) (Study 3) and time spent performing different activities (Study 4); IV) {{to determine the effects of}} a lower (LI) and higher intensity (HI) ExEE intervention on <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> (Study 5); and V) to investigate the inter-individual variability regarding exercise induced <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> (Study 6). In Study 1, women spending more time performing light-intensity PA were shown to have lower adiposity compared to women spending more time performing moderate- and high-intensity PA. Results from Study 2 (systematic review) show an overall <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> of 25 % following exercise interventions and that fat mass (FM), exercise intensity and duration of the intervention are the main predictors of <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> To better capture <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> (i. e., EI and EE), new methods to measure EI and time spent performing activities were developed (Studies 3 and 4) and used in the following studies. In Study 5, overweight/obese women training at HI displayed higher <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> when compared to women training at LI, which was accompanied by a reduction of NSPA (non-structured physical activity) and a greater amount of time spent lying down. Results from Study 6 showed that complete compensators (CC) had higher EI, fat and carbohydrate intake at the onset of the ExEE intervention when compared to incomplete compensators (IC). However, the results also showed that dietary disinhibition was increased, whereas NSPA was decreased at the end of the intervention in IC. Taken together, these studies emphasize that weight loss following exercise is impeded by <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> In addition to the impact of FM, exercise intensity and duration of the intervention on <b>energy</b> <b>compensation,</b> NSPA and cognitive factors also seem to modify <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> that occurs as a result of exercise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The voltage at {{the point}} of common {{coupling}} (PCC) in a weak network is very sensitive to load changes. A sudden change in active load will cause both a phase jump and a magnitude fluctuation in the bus voltage, whereas reactive load changes mainly affect the voltage magnitude. With the addition of energy storage to a static synchronous compensator (StatCom), it is possible to compensate for the active power change as well as providing reactive power support. In this paper some effective active power compensation schemes are proposed. Simulation and experimental results verify the compensation schemes by showing that a StatCom with energy storage can significantly reduce phase jumps and magnitude deviations of the bus voltage. Simulation results are also presented showing the benefits of active power compensation to certain applications with phase sensitive load.

40|$|General {{awareness}} {{of global warming}} has increased interest towards renewable energy solutions. Photovoltaic solar power {{is one of the}} most notable renewable energy production methods and a continuously increasing industry. The power production behavior of photovoltaics, however, is rapidly and intensively fluctuating even on very short timescales. Feeding such fluctuating power into a power system can cause serious stability issues. More and more grid operators are demanding solar power producers to regulate the fluctuations to stay within strict ramp rate limits. Energy storage systems have been recognized as a viable solution for compensating these fluctuations. This thesis delves into the behavior, control and sizing of these systems based on the requirements that the compensation application sets for them. The thesis depicts how solar power can be generally modelled with irradiance and temperature measurements. The model is utilized together with extensive measurement data to study virtual energy storage systems with solar power plants. This thesis demonstrates how the capacity and power requirements of the energy storage are highly dependent on the control method of the system. Notable capacity savings can be made by utilizing state of charge control. The control, however, can cause production outages. Methods to reduce these outages are presented in this thesis in order to enable the use and benefits of state of charge control. The results of this thesis show how the sizing of the storage depends greatly on the size of the plant and the required ramp rate limit. Very strict ramp rate limits require the storage capacity to be relatively high regardless of the plant size. The storage power requirement is inversely proportional to both the generator size and ramp rate limit. Power rating savings can also be made if complete ramp rate limit obedience is not necessary. The thesis also reveals how the fluctuation compensation induces an exponentially decreasing amount of stress to the storage as a function of the required <b>compensation</b> <b>energy.</b> The degradation resulting from the stress is shown to be minimal if an appropriate storage technology is utilized...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that monosodium glutamate (MSG) may have a biphasic effect on appetite, increasing appetite within a meal with its flavour-enhancing effect, but enhancing subsequent satiety due to its proposed role {{as a predictor of}} protein content. The present study explored this by assessing the impact of a 450  g soup preload differing in MSG concentration (1 % MSG added (MSG+) or no MSG (MSG-)) and nutrient content (low-energy control or high-energy carbohydrate or high-energy protein) on rated appetite and ad libitum intake of a test meal in thirty-five low-restraint male volunteers using a within-participant design. Protein-rich preloads significantly reduced intake at the test meal and resulted in more accurate <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> than did carbohydrate-rich preloads. This <b>energy</b> <b>compensation</b> was stronger in the MSG+ protein conditions when compared with MSG+ carbohydrate conditions.

This is a paradoxical finding, as nuts are an energy dense food and the consumption of energy dense foods has been implicated in the etiology of obesity. Intake frequency has also been proposed to influence BMI by impacting energy intake. The current study attempted to reconcile these two ideas and determine if dietary pattern optimizes peanut <b>energy</b> <b>compensation.</b> Sixty-three participants were randomized {{to one of three}} treatments (peanut, snack mix and snack mix with peanuts) with all participants completing the control treatments. Participants completed four sessions in random order, including two levels of intervention (treatment vs. control) and two levels of session (meal vs. snack). Lunch was provided at all sessions. Meal sessions required provision ingestion during the lunch meal, while the provision was ingested 120 minutes after the lunch meal during snack sessions. Treatment provisions were matched on energy, macronutrient composition, weight, sensory attributes and palatability. The control provision was matched to peanuts on energy and palatability. There were no differences in total daily energy intake between the control (2573 ± 67 kcal), peanut (2490 ± 107 kcal), snack mix (2483 ± 113 kcal) and snack mix with peanuts (2495 ± 116 kcal). Habitual snackers tended to consume more total daily energy (2597 ± 19 kcal) compared to habitual non-snackers (2423 ± 86 kcal). The peanut provision significantly reduced mean daily hunger ratings (20 ± 2 mm) compared to the control (25 ± 1 mm) provision.
