5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction.

Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E

5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors.

5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms are the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% {{are considered to be}} suicides.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses.

Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected.

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident.

Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism.

Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths.

Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
