25|$|Murder {{will make}} the killer a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> of {{whatever}} property they acquire as a result. This applies to murder, as in In the Estate of Crippen, inciting someone to murder, as in Evans v Evans, and causing death by reckless driving, as in R v Seymour (Edward). In Re K, {{it was confirmed that}} involuntary manslaughter will not require constructive trusts, and neither will situations where there is a successful plea of insanity, as in found in Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. Curiously, there is no requirement that the defendant be found guilty in criminal proceedings; in Re Sigsworth, it was decided that claims can be brought without criminal proceedings having taken place providing the defendant is held up to the criminal standards of guilt in the equity case.|$|E
2500|$|When non-trustees {{interfere}} with the workings of an express trust {{to such an extent}} as to harm it, they can be deemed to be [...] "constructive trustees", or trustees de son tort. In Mara v Browne, Smith LJ stated that [...] "if one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to intermeddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee, he may therefore make himself what is called in law trustee of his own wrong - ie, a trustee de son tort, or, as it is also termed, a constructive trustee". For someone to be made a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> they must have had the property in their possession or control before the application, and have acted in a dishonest or reckless way. If found liable, the constructive trust will be held to account personally to repay any loss suffered by the trust fund, and will be responsible for maintaining that trust property in his possession.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases of}} fraud, the same {{principle}} applies; the property is held by the fraudster on constructive trust for the original owner, unless the original owner {{was involved in the}} fraud, as in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 2). An exception to this principle is fraudulent misrepresentation, where the courts disagree over whether it immediately forms a constructive trust or requires action by the victim. In Collings v Lee, an estate agent transferred property to a non-existent purchaser (in reality an alias) and then claimed that as he was not the transferee, {{he did not have to}} pay the vendors; it was held that this fraudulent misrepresentation meant he held the property on constructive trust. However, in Lonrho, Millett J held that [...] "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is voidable, not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so, the representor is not a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> of the property transferred pursuant to the contact, and no fiduciary relationship exists between him and the representee".|$|E
5000|$|Strangers {{are not to}} be made <b>constructive</b> <b>{{trustees}}</b> {{merely because}} they act as the agents of trustees in transactions, … unless those agents received and become chargeable with some part of the trust property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design {{on the part of the}} trustees.|$|R
5000|$|At first {{instance}} the claims were equally focussed upon {{the club and}} the firm's bankers (against whom the claimant solicitors pleaded both negligence and liability as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustees).</b> Unusually, {{at the end of}} the plaintiff's case, the bank's counsel (Jonathan Sumption QC) made a submission of [...] "no case to answer" [...] and offered no evidence.|$|R
50|$|Dishonest assistants {{have been}} {{frequently}} described by courts as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustees.</b> However, such classification {{is not without}} difficulty: dishonest assistance is often imposed {{even if there is}} no obviously identifiable property subject to the trust; also, in many cases of dishonest assistance property has reached the hands of innocent third parties who may not be under any obligation to restore it. Some commentators have sought to explain this on the basis that there is a type of constructive trust which can arise even if there is no identifiable trust property.|$|R
2500|$|Constructive trust: Unlike {{an express}} trust, a {{constructive}} trust is not created by {{an agreement between}} a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an [...] "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them {{to the person who}} rightfully should have them. The <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an [...] "equitable remedy" [...] imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{types of}} {{constructive}} trust not relating to unconscionable dealings are constructive trusts over property, mutual wills, and arguably secret trusts. Where property is sold or transferred, {{the signing of}} an agreement to do so automatically transfers the equitable interest to the buyer or transferee; until the property itself is transferred, it is deemed to be held on constructive trust for the recipient. Mutual wills are irrevocable wills made by multiple people to come into force at the writer's death; similarly, these are also considered constructive trusts. Secret trusts {{are the subject of}} much debate over their classification, but one theory holds them to be constructive in nature. Related to constructive trusts are constructive trustees, or trustees de son tort; these are where [...] "one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to intermeddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee". Where their actions are reckless or dishonest, the court makes that person a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> forcing them to account to the beneficiaries for any loss suffered and look after the trust property in their possession.|$|E
50|$|Instead of prosecuting this person, {{the courts}} may hold {{him or her}} to be a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> and, thereby, impose the {{liabilities}} of an actual trustee in accounting for his or her acts.|$|E
40|$|THE {{facts of}} Barclays Bank Ltd. v. Quistclose Investments Ltd. are well-known. In July 1964 Rolls Razor Ltd. {{declared}} a dividend payment {{that they were}} unable to meet. In order to meet their obligation, the company arranged to borrow the amount of the dividend, £ 210, 000, from Quistclose Investments. The money was duly transferred into a separate account of Rolls Razor, opened specially for the purpose, held at Barclays Bank. The dividend was payable on 24 July but had not been paid when, on 27 August, Rolls Razor entered voluntary liquidation. Barclays and Quistclose both claimed the money. Barclays asserted a right of set-off against the Rolls Razor overdraft, while Quistclose claimed that the money was held in trust for them and, since Barclays were aware of this, the bank were accordingly <b>constructive</b> <b>trustees</b> of the funds...|$|R
2500|$|The third, and {{practically}} most important strategy for creditor protection, was {{to require that}} dividends and other returns to shareholders could only be made, generally speaking, if a company had profits. The concept of [...] "profit" [...] is defined by law as having assets above the amount that shareholders, who initially bought shares from the company, contributed {{in return for their}} shares. For example, a company could launch its business with 1000 shares (for public companies, called an [...] "IPO" [...] or initial public offering) each with a nominal value of 1 penny, and an issue price of £1. Shareholders would buy the £1 shares, and if all are sold, £1000 would become the company's [...] "legal capital". Profits are whatever the company makes on top of that £1000, though as a company continues to trade, the market price of shares could well be going up to £2 or £10, or indeed fall to 50 pence or some other number. The Companies Act 2006 states in section 830 that dividends, or any other kind of distribution, can only be given out from surplus profits beyond the legal capital. It is generally the decision of the board of directors, affirmed by a shareholder resolution, whether to declare a dividend or perhaps simply retain the earnings and invest them back into the business to grow and expand. The calculation of companies' assets and liabilities, losses and profits, will follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the UK, but this is not an objective, scientific process: a variety of different accounting methods can be used which can lead to different assessments of when a profit exists. The prohibition on falling below the legal capital applies to [...] "distributions" [...] in any form, and so [...] "disguised" [...] distributions are also caught. This has been held to include, for example, an unwarranted salary payment to a director's wife when she had not worked, and a transfer of a property within a company group at half its market value. A general principle, however, recently expounded in Progress Property Co Ltd v Moorgarth Group Ltd is that if a transaction is negotiated in good faith and at arm's length, then it may not be unwound, and this is apparently so even if it means that creditors have been [...] "ripped off". If distributions are made without meeting the law's criteria, then a company has a claim to recover the money from any recipients. They are liable as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustees,</b> which probably mirrors the general principles of any action in unjust enrichment. This means that liability is probably strict, subject to a change of position defence, and the rules of tracing will apply if assets wrongfully paid out of the company have been passed on. For example, in It’s A Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula the directors of a bankrupt company argued that they had been unaware that dividend payments they paid themselves were unlawful (as there had not in fact been profits) because their tax advisers had said it was okay. The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was not a defence. A contravention existed so long as one ought to have known of the facts that show a dividend would contravene the law. Directors can similarly be liable for breach of duty, and so to restore the money wrongfully paid away, if they failed to take reasonable care.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} broad claims against the bank: one as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> and other for negligence. Each {{alleged that the}} bank knew or ought to have known that Cass was drawing on the firm's bank account for the {{purposes}} of satisfying his personal gambling problem, and yet they failed to take any action. [...] The Court of Appeal accepted counsel's submission that the bank could not be liable as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> if it was not shown to be at least negligent. [...] May LJ also asserted nothing less than actual knowledge should constitute a third party as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b> [...] The Court further held that the bank had not been negligent, and thus could not be liable as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b> The Court noted the large number of cheques cleared daily, and that in this case only approximately one-seventh of the cheques drawn on the firm's account were fraudulent (and that the firm was one of over 2,800 customers of the bank branch). May LJ held [...] "There is nothing ... express or implied, which could require a banker to consider the commercial wisdom or otherwise of the particular transaction. ... In my opinion any implied term requiring the banker to exercise care must be limited. To a substantial extent the banker's obligation under such a contract is largely automatic or mechanical. Presented with a cheque drawn in accordance with the terms of that contract, the bank must honour it save in what I would expect to be exceptional circumstances." ...|$|E
50|$|Held, (reversing the {{decision}} of North, J., 1895 2 Ch. 69), therefore, that neither of the defendants could be held liable as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> and that the appeal must be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs.|$|E
50|$|Hugh Browne in {{all that}} he did acted in the {{capacity}} of solicitor {{for one of the}} two trustees, whose directions as to investments were accepted or acted on by the other; that under these circumstances he could not be made liable as a constructive trustee: and that {{it was too late to}} make him liable as solicitor. Held also, that it was not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in a solicitor's business to constitute himself a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> so as to bind a partner and make him also liable as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> although he was not aware of the dealings by which the constructive trust was established.|$|E
50|$|The Judge held Mr Tan was liable as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> to Royal Brunei. The Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam {{held that}} the company was not guilty of fraud or dishonesty, and so Mr Tan could not be either. The case was appealed to the Privy Council.|$|E
50|$|Nourse LJ {{gave the}} lead {{judgment}} in the Court of Appeal, {{and allowed the}} appeal {{on the basis that}} the company had at all times been free to deal with the proceeds in those accounts, and thus it was never a trustee of them. Accordingly, it was not material what notice NatWest Bank had or had not received - it could not become a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The appellants {{claim was}} that Maori vendors {{could not have}} {{understood}} this concept and as such the Crown had breached [...] "fiduciary or equitable duties of disclosure and fair dealing". Consequently, the appellants sought a declaration in the High Court that the Crown, to the extent it had ownership of the Waikato riverbed, it held it as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> for {{the descendants of the}} original owners.|$|E
50|$|Belmont Finance Corp was {{wholly owned}} by City Industrial Finance, Mr James the {{chairman}} of both. Belmont’s directors paid £500,000 under a scheme to help Maximum Co, owned and controlled by Mr Grosscurth, to buy shares in Belmont from City. This was a breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the prohibition on financial assistance. City received £489,000 ultimately. Belmont later claimed City was liable to account as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although some sums {{were paid}} to RTB from that account in {{repayment}} of the loans, {{when the company}} entered into financial difficulty, NatWest Bank blocked the account. RTB sued NatWest Bank alleging that it held the sums in that account as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> for RTB. The company did not appear and was not represented. At first instance noted {{that he had been}} advised that it was in receivership {{at the time of the}} hearing.|$|E
50|$|Hoffmann J {{held that}} it was a breach of the directors' {{fiduciary}} duty to sell the property at an undervalue. Given the relationship between the parties, the sale at an undervalue represented a distribution, and as the sale amounted to an unlawful reduction of capital, it was incapable of ratification. The transferee was therefore accountable as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b> ‘This was a dressed up distribution’, it was ultra vires and incapable of ratification.|$|E
50|$|Mr Lee {{owned and}} {{controlled}} both Aveling Barford Ltd and Perion Ltd. Aveling Barford owned a country house and 18 {{acres of land}} in Grantham, which it sold to Perion £350,000, rather than the £1,150,000 it had been valued for prospective mortgagees. Aveling Barford subsequently went into liquidation, and the liquidator sued to have Perion be declared a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> of the proceeds realised by Perion on the resale of the property.|$|E
5000|$|Mara v Browne 1895 is a Court of Chancery {{case that}} dealt with {{liability}} as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> ultimately ruling that, [...] "if one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to inter-meddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic {{of the office of}} trustee, he may therefore make himself what is called in law trustee of his own wrong - i.e., a trustee de son tort, or, as it is also termed, a constructive trustee" ...|$|E
50|$|Nourse LJ {{held that}} Mr Akindele’s {{knowledge}} in 1985 {{was not enough}} to make the transaction unconscionable, and for him to retain the benefits of the divestiture payments, even though there were rumours about BCCI’s management. There was nothing to alert Mr Akindele to the transaction being tainted. Dishonesty was not needed to establish liability for knowing receipt as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2) 1980 1 All ER 393 considered. The degrees of knowledge in Baden were unhelpful and a single test of unconscionability was better. Even if constructive knowledge was still the test, Mr Akindele did not have constructive knowledge of the breach of trust by BCCI management.|$|E
50|$|The {{employee}} {{is not a}} <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> of the profit for the employer and the employer has no proprietary interest in the profit. Hence, there is no theft from the employer and the profit is merely a civil debt owed by the employee to the employer (Note: In light of FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC 2014 UKSC 45, this may in fact {{no longer be the}} case according to the law of England and Wales). Where more than one person is involved there could be a conspiracy to defraud and, since the coming into force of the Fraud Act 2006, the employee could be guilty of fraud by abuse of position.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquidators}} of BCCI sued Chief Labode Onadimaki Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, for $6,679,226 {{that he got}} in divestiture {{payments in}} 1988. ICIC Overseas Ltd, in the BCCI group, had agreed Akindele would buy shares in BCCI Holdings, and be guaranteed a 15% pa return for a $10m investment. BCCI in fact gave him $16.679m to do this, thus leaving $6.679 over. Akindele did not know {{this was part of}} a fraud scheme to enable BCCI Holdings to buy its own shares. The liquidator argued he was a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> for both knowing receipt and knowing assistance. The liquidators argued his dishonesty could be inferred from his knowledge of the artificially arranged loan transactions and his unusually high interest rate of 15%.|$|E
50|$|Mr George Baden, Jacques Delvaus and Ernest Lecuit were {{liquidators}} of the Luxembourg Mutual Investment Fund (FOF Proprietary Funds Ltd, {{along with}} a fund of funds, Venture Fund (International) NV, and IOS Growth Fund Ltd, all mutual 'dollar funds'). They claimed that Société Générale owed it $4,009,697.91, which it held for its customer, the Bahamas Commonwealth Bank Ltd in a trust account. On 10 May 1973, it followed BCB's instructions, in arrangement with Algemene Bank, Amsterdam, transferred the money to Banco Nacional de Panama, to a non-trust account in BCB's name. This, claimed Baden, made Société Générale a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> and so had a duty to account. Alternatively, Société Générale was claimed to owe a duty of care, and to be liable in damages for the loss suffered.|$|E
50|$|Murder {{will make}} the killer a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> of {{whatever}} property they acquire as a result. This applies to murder, as in In the Estate of Crippen, inciting someone to murder, as in Evans v Evans, and causing death by reckless driving, as in R v Seymour (Edward). In Re K, {{it was confirmed that}} involuntary manslaughter will not require constructive trusts, and neither will situations where there is a successful plea of insanity, as in found in Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. Curiously, there is no requirement that the defendant be found guilty in criminal proceedings; in Re Sigsworth, it was decided that claims can be brought without criminal proceedings having taken place providing the defendant is held up to the criminal standards of guilt in the equity case.|$|E
50|$|Sir Robert Megarry VC {{held that}} the solicitor’s {{knowledge}} of clause 14(B) should not be imputed to the tenth Duke so as to affect his conscience. Even if the tenth Duke had known, he {{probably would not have}} remembered when he received the chattels. So although the trustees were in breach of their fiduciary duty in 1948, the Duke had received nothing as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b> The touchstone of liability is unconscionability. There is a defence if one knows of a breach but genuinely forgets before receipt. One must have, at least, wilfully and recklessly failed to make inquiries that an honest person would. In his view there are some people who, though not sufficiently innocent to not be bona fide purchasers for value, they may not be sufficiently guilty or knowledgeable to be knowing recipients.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquidator}} of Relfo Ltd sued Varsani, {{a friend}} of the former director Mr Gorecia, who got money from the company. HMRC had sued Relfo Ltd for outstanding tax, whereupon Relfo Ltd put the £500,000 it had in its bank account to pay $890,050 into a Latvian account of Mirren Ltd, and then coincidentally an entity called Intertrade paid $878,469 from a Lithuanian bank account to Varsani. Shortly after Mr Varsani gave Mr Gorecia $100,000 The liquidator argued this was all connected, and the $100,000 was Mr Gorecia’s reward for diverting Relfo’s funds for Varsani’s benefit. Therefore, Relfo Ltd retained a title in equity over the funds that Mr Varsani held, that Varsani was on notice of the facts at all times and so was a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee,</b> and that even if tracing was not possible the payments were connected enough to base an unjust enrichment claim.|$|E
50|$|In December 1923, {{the future}} tenth Duke of Manchester {{assigned}} his trustees, under clause 14, 'all articles of furniture plate pictures and other chattels' {{that he would}} be entitled to after the ninth Duke’s death, and under clause 14(B) the trustees should make an inventory of the chattels, which would be included in the settlement, and hold the residue for the future tenth Duke absolutely. When the ninth Duke died in February 1947 the trustees did not make the inventory, and released them to the tenth Duke. His solicitor knew that this was not following clause 14(B), but said in a letter on 15 November 1948 that he was free to sell the items. The Duke sold some. He died in 1977. The eleventh Duke brought a claim for breach of trust by failing to make any selection or an inventory of the chattels, and release them all to the tenth Duke, who was a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> when he received them.|$|E

50|$|Sales J {{held the}} {{liquidator}} could recover the money. A proprietary argument against Varsani failed because the funds were dissipated and the liquidator had not applied for an order (which {{could have been}} done) to disclose where the funds went, which would be necessary for a tracing exercise. However, Varsani was a knowing recipient, it was a fair inference that all the transactions were linked, {{there was no reason}} for the Intertrade payment. His conscience would be affected as a <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee</b> because it was high probable that Gorecia had explained Mr Varsani the whole arrangement, cf Re Montagu’s ST 1987 Ch 264. He was liable to account for the whole Intertrade payment without any reduction for the $100,000 transferred. And, even if the Intertrade payment could not be traced from the payment between Relfo Ltd and Mirren Ltd, Varsani was enriched at Relfo’s expense, as the payments were made in breach of Mr Gorecia’s fiduciary duty, without authority and established an in personam claim against Mr Varsani. Liability was strict and did not depend on knowledge or conscience. Mr Varsani had given no defence, and so he received the money as a volunteer.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the continuing suitability of the existing Australian test for determining when a voluntary assignment of legal property has passed in equity. It suggests that the current test, which focuses upon the ‘completion’ by the donor of the all the necessary transfer formalities, and the underlying equitable maxims that support it, should be revised to better reflect the dual concerns of assignment and constructive trust. The article reviews the English authorities, in particular the English Court of Appeal in Pennington v Waine, which held that the equitable jurisdiction can validate a voluntary assignment of legal property where, in the circumstances, it would be unconscionable to allow the donor to resile. It is argued that this approach represents an appropriate progression because it provides greater scope for a particularised examination of the intention, circumstances and behaviour surrounding the purported assignment. A test which encourages greater contextual examination of the overall circumstances underlying the assignment process {{is consistent with the}} core expectations of equitable methodology. It supports the multi-layered process of determining whether a donor intended the assignment and further, whether that donor should be held liable as <b>constructive</b> <b>trustee.</b> <br /...|$|E
