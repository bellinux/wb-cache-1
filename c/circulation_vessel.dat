40|$|Abstract: Self-awakening, {{waking up}} at a {{designated}} time decided before sleeping, could prevent {{failure in the}} blood <b>circulation</b> <b>vessel</b> system such as heart attack, acute increases in heart rate or blood pressure upon waking. Previous research showed that anticipatory changes occurred in heart rate prior to awakening from a short nap by means of self-awakening for young participants. However, the effects of self-awakening remained unclear for elderly people. The present study {{examined the effects of}} self-awakening on heart rate and blood pressure in a short afternoon nap (20 min) among the elderly. Nine participants [74. 1 (SD = 5. 01) years old] underwent both self-awakening and forced-awakening conditions. In the self-awakening condition, it was revealed that blood pressure gradually increased before the scheduled time of awakening, and that heart rate did not show a rapid increase at arousal. In contrast, forced-awakening induced acute increases in both heart rate and blood pressure. These results suggest that self-awakening facilitates a more smooth transition from sleep to wakefulness via autonomic activation before the time of self-awakening...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{experimental}} trials {{were conducted in}} a large-scale (5. 5 m× 16. 5 m× 1. 2 m) mixed-cell raceway (MCR) to evaluate the effect of nozzle diameter {{and the rate of}} bottom-center drain discharge on the magnitude and uniformity of water velocities in the mixed-cell. Three nozzle diameters, 10, 15, and 20 mm, and three bottom-center flows, 0, 15, and 20 % of the system flow rate (64 – 257 m 3 /h), were evaluated. Measurements of water velocities in the mixed-cell were made at 5 cm {{from the bottom of the}} tank. While the nozzle diameter was found to have a highly significant influence (p 0. 05). Also, results suggested that uniformity of water velocities in terms of the radial-wise profile is not affected by either the nozzle diameter or the percentage of bottom flow. This study indicates that the flux of momentum is the driving force controlling water velocities in a jet-forced <b>circulation</b> <b>vessel,</b> and therefore jet velocity and nozzle diameter become the main variables to control. It was found that the linear influence of the jet velocity on water velocities reported in previous studies remained valid provided that the nozzle diameter was maintained constant. An equation to predict water velocities of the mean rotating flow was derived from the flux of momentum approach and a set of iso-curves was constructed to predict water velocities as a function of the jet velocity and nozzle diameter. The iso-curves, or directly, the equation derived, can be used to facilitate the design of a MCR where a particular water velocity is desired...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{cerebral}} vasospasm {{is one of the leading}} causes of death and neurological disability after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most of these studies, however, have focused on anterior <b>circulation</b> <b>vessels.</b> Since the introduction of the transcranial Doppler (TCD), increasing attention has been given to basilar artery (BA) vasospasm, especially in traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. As shown for the anterior circulation, however, the significance of elevated flow velocities (FVs) in the posterior vessels may be ambiguous, so vasospasm may not be reliably differentiated from hyperemia. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential additional value of an intracranial/extracranial FV ratio in the posterior circulation to cope with this shortcoming of the TCD in the diagnosis of BA vasospasm. Methods—FV in the extracranial vertebral artery (VA) was measured in 20 healthy volunteers. Normative values of an intracranial/extracranial VA FV ratio (IVA/EVA) and a BA/extracranial VA FV ratio (BA/EVA) were calculated. Thirty-four patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were then evaluated with TCD and CT angiography (CTA). The value of the IVA/EVA and BA/EVA ratios in the diagnosis and assessment of vertebrobasilar vasospasm was investigated. Results—The extracranial VA could be insonated in all subjects at depths ranging from 45 to 55 mm. The average FV for the extracranial VA was 26 cm/s. The ratios between intracranial and extracranial VA FVs were 1. 6 on both sides...|$|R

Methods : The material {{for this study was}} the results of complex examinations of 37 patients (49 eyes) with OIS in combination with CCI. In order to study peculiarities of the course of OIS with CCI, in addition to a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, used UC DM extracranial and intracranial segments of the great vessels of the brain, oftalmodopplerografy, MRI tractography. Quantitative characteristics of blood flow in the vessels of the eye and the brain were maximal systolic, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, carotid-ophthalmic ratio. Results: Analysis {{of the results of the}} study revealed a change in visual function in all patients to varying degrees, depending on the ratio of the degree of destruction of MCA and ACA, OphAr, CRA and PSCA and maturities to experts. The data obtained Doppler examination of extracranial and intracranial segments of the great vessels and MR tractography correlated with changes oftalmodopplerografy, breach of visual acuity, and defects in the VF. Conclusion: Pathological changes of the extracranial and intracranial segments of arteries have a negative impact not only on the parameters of cerebral vascular circulation, but also exacerbate the violation of the parameters of blood <b>circulation</b> <b>vessels</b> of the eye, leading to the progression of OIS. Important in the development CCI and progression of OIS holds the consistency of collateral circulation.

We have now tested whether the perivascular sensory nerve CaR-linked dilator {{system is a}} local phenomenon restricted to the mesentery, or is present in other <b>circulations.</b> <b>Vessels</b> from the mesenteric, renal, coronary, and cerebral circulations were studied. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed using anti-CaR and anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) antibodies. Wire myography {{was used to assess}} contracation and relaxation. Although perivascular nerves of all arteries stained for CaR protein, there were regional differences. A morphometric method used to estimate CaR positive nerve density revealed the following rank order: mesenteric branch artery>basilar artery=renal interlobar artery>main renal trunk artery>left anterior descending coronary artery. Vessels from the mesentery, renal, coronary, and cerebral circulations showed nerve-dependent relaxation in response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) when precontracted with serotonin in the presence of guanethidine. The degree of Ca 2 +-induced relaxation of mesenteric, renal, and cerebral arteries positively correlated with the magnitude of EFS-induced relaxation. In contrast, coronary arteries contracted at Ca 2 + levels between 1. 5 and 3 [*]mmol L− 1, and relaxed to a small degree to 5 [*]mmol L− 1 Ca 2 +. Thus, a functional perivascular sensory nerve CaR-linked dilator system is present to varying degrees in the mesenteric, renal, and cerebral circulations, but only to a very limited extent in the coronary circulation...|$|R

In this disertation we therefore tried to (at least partially) solve this problem by answering the question how do acute and chronic hypoxia affect fetoplacentar vasculature. Unlike all vascular beds with the exception of the pulmonary <b>circulation,</b> fetoplacental <b>vessels</b> respond to acute hypoxia with vasoconstriction (HFPV). This mechanism presumably diverts blood flow from poorly oxygenated areas towards regions with better O 2 supply.

We propose that this hypoxia-induced depolarization leads to vasoconstriction by activating voltage- dependent calcium (Ca) channels and Ca influx.

Laser technology, however, may cause a number of complications, in particular segmental thrombophlebitis, ecchymosis, skin hyperpigmentation, neurological disorders, and paravasal burns.

Retinal ischemia was induced for 60 minutes in Sprague-Dawley rats by ligating the optic nerve. Gene expression for endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and nNOS) was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To inhibit cNOS, A^'-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) was injected intraperitoneally four times (every 6 hours) beginning 2 hours after reperfusion, for a total dose of 80 mg/kg.
