40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt {{is hard to}} {{argue that there is}} a more prevailing issue than <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> when discussing strike warfare today. The outlook of the United States and other militaries regarding bombing operations, particularly concern about <b>collateral</b> <b>damage,</b> is a historically contingent process. This thesis examines three case studies—the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Kosovo air campaign—to examine the impact of concern about <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> on U. S. policy and strategy. It analyzes the disparity between <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> effects at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels over the span of a half century. A significant amount of research on the effects of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> from strike warfare focuses on legal, humanitarian, and moral issues. To oversimplify, killing non-combatants is bad, but it happens, and not always by accident. Therefore, it is instructive to gain knowledge on how it affects policy and strategy. Depending on the conflict and time period, U. S. administrations and war strategists have put the priority of mitigating <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> at different levels. Understanding the reasoning and timing behind the political and military attitudes toward <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> is helpful to understanding how the potential for civilian casualties fits into military strategy as a whole.

For the next three months, Jessie is able to discreetly poisons Mrs. Anton with small amounts of Aconite to keep her too ill to attend any parties, having been warned against cursing her by Mambo Marie, a fellow Voodoo practitioner. However, when the three months are done, Delphine LaLaurie reneges on their deal after Jessie Bodeen had kept up her end of it.

In 1970, Francisco da Costa Gomes, the Chief-Commander of the Armed Forces of Angola, decided to reinforce the Eastern Front by relocating troops and armament from the North to the East. In 1971, the FAP started a counter-insurgency military campaign, that although provoking a number of civilian <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> in its first stage, effectively expelled the three guerrilla movements operating in the East of Angola to beyond the frontiers of the territory. The last guerrillas lost hundreds of soldiers and left tons of equipment behind, disbanding chaotically to the neighboring foreign countries in the region or in some cases, joining or surrendering to the Portuguese authorities. In order to gain the confidence of the local rural populations, and create conditions for their permanent and productive settlement in the region, the FAP organized massive vaccination campaigns, medical check-ups, water, sanitation and alimentary infrastructure. 45% of Eastern Angola population were under 15 years old and less than 10% of those children had gone to school. The FAP built schools and enforced policies to stimulating the admittance of the local child in those schools.|$|E
