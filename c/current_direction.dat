25|$|Northeastward current (Jun-Sep, Summer Monsoon): The Somali Current begins {{developing}} its strength from mid-May with the summer monsoon onset, and current velocities rapidly grow {{to the maximum}} until June and September with the southwest monsoon blowing. During this season, the <b>current</b> <b>direction</b> is northeastward, and the velocity in mid-May is about 2.0m/s and in June, 3.5m/s and more. Typically the Somali Current will move about 1500km to the northeast and, near Cape Guardafui (at 6~10°N), change its direction to the east to merge with the Indian Monsoon current.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, Aziz {{travelled}} to Iran in 2006, {{and privately}} told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad he must change course regarding its nuclear program, as the <b>current</b> <b>direction</b> was neither in Iran’s nor the region's interest. Aziz urged Ahmadinejad to immediately place {{a moratorium on}} uranium enrichment while {{on the other hand}} Erdoğan described the EU-3 proposal, with Russian enhancements, as a very attractive offer for Iran. Both Aziz and Erdoğan condemned Ahmedinejad’s statements attacking Israel as completely unacceptable and serving no purpose. Aziz's tenure considerably improved relations with Japan and after visiting Japan, Aziz welcomes the investment in the manufacturing sector and Pak-Japan joint ventures in steel manufacturing as an excellent symbol of cooperation in expanding steel production between two countries.|$|E

25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its <b>current</b> <b>direction.</b> In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E
500|$|Overall {{the game}} follows {{the format of}} the original, but it differs in a number of key respects, {{including}} a landscape orientation of the screen, that the wraparound Warp Tunnel is located at the top and bottom as opposed to the sides, the maze layout and overall color scheme. [...] Pac-Man himself features an eye and he only faces left and right, never turning to face up or down when traveling in those directions. The ghosts' eyes constantly cycle through four directions rather than being fixed in their <b>current</b> <b>direction</b> of travel. The maze contains 126 wafers, just shy of half of the arcade's 244 dots. [...] The nest from which the ghosts emerge has its entrance on its right side instead of the top, and the arcade's eight distinct and different-valued bonus items (mostly fruits) are replaced by the nondescript single-value Vitamin.|$|E
500|$|While Bush {{endorsed}} the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, {{he declined to}} endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump {{and he did not}} attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the <b>current</b> <b>direction</b> of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, [...] "I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president." [...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{energy saving}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} issues for polymer processing industry. Electromagnetic induction heating has many advantages such as fast heating and low energy consumption. Previous studies using electromagnetic induction heating for rapid tool heating have indicated that the temperature uniformity on a cavity surface is not easy to be achieved. In this paper, two different coils were used for heating uniform 7 mm thick hot work tool steel (JIS SKD 61) surface. One is a four-row coil with opposite <b>current</b> <b>directions</b> and the other is a two-row coil with identical <b>current</b> <b>directions.</b> Magnetic flux concentrators were used to control magnetic field and heat the workpiece uniformly. The heating experiment results showed that coil with opposite adjacent <b>current</b> <b>directions</b> had more uniform temperature distribution on tool surface. The temperature uniformity was about 94 %∼ 95 %. The coil with identical adjacent <b>current</b> <b>directions</b> had higher average temperature and the temperature rose from 50 °C to 150 °C in 15 seconds...|$|R

[...] The Comics Curmudgeon also makes frequent reference to the seemingly unremitting gloom of the strip, calling it [...] "a black hole of bleakness and depression and cancer from which no joy or laughter can escape." [...] The strip has also inspired a blog, Son of Stuck Funky, which provides a daily commentary.|$|E
