40|$|I {{examined}} {{the different ways}} in which individuals <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> anxiety and stress levels. One hundred thirteen participants, 64 females and 41 males ranging from age 18 to 55, received a 9 -question survey related to their level of stress and anxiety and how often they <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> their stress in various ways; for example coping by exercising more often than coping by overeating depending on age and gender. All of {{the participants in this study}} were from general psychology classes at Boise State University. The results indicate there is a significant relationship between age and engaging in physical activities to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress and anxiety. Contrary to other studies, my results indicate no significant differences between males and females and the level of their stress. However, there is a significant difference between males and females and overeating to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress. Females tend to overeat to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress more often than males. This finding suggests that more females tend not to engage in physical activities to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress but instead eat to cope. It would be beneficial in the future to have a larger sample of participants and ask more specific questions as to how individuals <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress and anxiety and why...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the introduction of}} fundamental physics in design education as a pedagogical method that brings interdisciplinarity into play. It presents the framework of three workshops {{that took place in}} a design school. For each workshop, a theme was chosen by the designers and the professor of physics: superconductivity in 2011, quantum physics in 2013 and light and optics in 2014. The authors suggest that introducing physics in a design curriculum was thought in terms of an “a fortiori” education program that would help practitioners to draw pertinent questions and responses whatever the situation. The authors suggest therefore that the curriculum had five goals that correspond to a model of design: affective (how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> uncertainty), reflexive learning (how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> processes rather than contents), cognitive (how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> non knowledge), economic (how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the industrial society of innovation), and political (how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the equality of disciplines and “indiscipline”) ...|$|R

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
