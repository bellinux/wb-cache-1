500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl <b>Charles</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers of {{the book}} were {{impressed}} by Irving's characters. English author Giles Foden wrote in The Guardian that Ketchum is [...] " [...] magnificent creation, he's {{like something out of}} The Last of the Mohicans", while Ron <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> in The Washington Post that he is [...] "one of Irving's most endearing and memorable characters", a cross between Shakespeare's Falstaff and Louise Erdrich's Nanapush. Literary critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Constable Carl, the policeman who pursues Dominic and Danny, as not unlike Victor Hugo’s obsessive Inspector Javert in Les Misérables. Foden said Irving's manipulation of the character's identities was [...] "nothing less than show-stopping".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E

Billboard compared the song's piano riff to the one's {{used by the}} artist himself, while the percussion and chord progression was reminiscent of [...] "OneRepublic's oeuvre more than Mars' sunny hits". The review concluded with positive feedback for the singer's [...] "pitch-perfect vocals and his knack for warbling about women troubles, the man once again delivers." [...] Scott Shetler, from the music website PopCrush, awarded the single 3,5 out of 5 starts, labeling it as [...] "more subdued than we're used to hearing from Mars, but that's appropriate for a song from [...] "Twilight"." [...] Shetler also wrote that although [...] "is not a major artistic leap forward for ...the mood of the song makes it {{a good fit for}} the latest [...] "Twilight" [...] movie". While revising the music video, Metros, Aaron-Spencer <b>Charles</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Each verse is strong with emotion and...the song [...] the right amount of lift." [...] Lyrically, Charles commented that, [...] "the emotions come from a real place and the heart-felt lyrics resonate" [...] with those who have ended a similar relationship. American singer and songwriter Adam Lambert complimented Mars' vocals and the song's melody.|$|E

2500|$|Samuel Brannan {{delivered}} {{a speech on}} justice and {{the enforcement of the}} law before the trial. The actual trial took place on May 20 of 1855. Belle Cora funded several attorneys to represent Charles Cora including Edward Dickinson Baker and James A. McDougall. Belle Cora paid Edward Dickinson Baker $15,000 of his $30,000 retainer in gold and sent meals to Charles Cora while he was in jail. In addition, she {{even went so far as}} trying to bribe the star witness Maria Knight to change her testimony. The case was framed as one of self-defense case in which Richardson was alleged to have threatened Charles Cora with a knife. However, the jury could not come to a decision which led to a second trial. However, James Casey murdered the prominent newspaper editor James King of William sparking the Vigilance Committee to resurge and seize both Casey and Cora. The committee sentence both of them to hang on Friday, May 23, at 12 o'clock. For fear of escape, Charles Cora was led by 3,000 men and two field pieces. Before the execution, Belle and Charles got married by Father Michael Acoltti. <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> nothing as the noose was placed around his head. [...] The cord was cut at twenty minutes past one o'clock leaving Cora to drop 6 feet and hang for fifty five minutes before being turned over to the coroner..|$|E

2500|$|Wales' maiden {{appearance}} in the tournament, {{it was also the}} only time all four of the Home Nations qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and Northern Ireland made it past the group stage. The Welsh FA were pessimistic for their prospects, and before the tournament they arranged for five days of training on some free land at Hyde Park and booked the flights home for before the beginning of the knockout stages. Manager Jimmy Murphy used highly defensive tactics, they would prove highly effective as Wales never conceded more than once in any of their five games in the tournament. Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary, Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. Wales had played well against the Hungarians but played poorly against the Mexicans, though they still came close to recording two victories; in the third match both the Swedes and the Welsh were happy to amble to a draw, as that way both sides remained in the competition. As Hungary also recorded three points in the group, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the Råsunda Stadium to advance with a 2–1 win; however due to dirty play from the opposition John Charles was injured in the match and missed out {{on the rest of the}} tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, thanks to a goal by Pelé in the 66th minute – this was only Pelé's second game for his country, and the goal made him the youngest player ever to score in a World Cup game. Charles later recalled that Pelé miskicked the ball, and even in later life it upset him greatly to remember the ball trickling across the line. Pelé himself said that Charles was the best centre-half of the tournament, and the Brazilian swapped shirts with Charles after the game. The Brazilians went on to win the competition. It was a difficult experience for Wales, who were forced to play five highly competitive games in eleven days. Despite their heroics, the competition received little publicity in Britain at the time – the South Wales Evening Post's back page headlined a Glamorgan cricket match – and <b>Charles</b> <b>said</b> in his autobiography that [...] "I don't think many people in Wales even knew the World Cup was on." ...|$|E
