As James Mann suggested in his book About Face, the unique situation of the United States and China, marked by secrecy, countless concessions, and uneasy negotiations, originated from exceptional circumstances and administrative precedent. From the beginning, the US treated China distinctively, as government officials continually followed Kissinger’s footsteps {{in dealing with the}} cunning Communist regime. Many factors contributed to this complex relationship, including diplomacy styles, incorrect assumptions, and, most importantly, the geopolitical circumstances of the Cold War. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the glue holding the two nations together has disappeared, and with it the clear intentions of both countries. Now, we are faced with an emerging military and economic superpower of which the future is completely uncertain.

In order to identify a set of common indicators that are indicative of successful sub-regional policy, I begin my research with an analysis of three existing sub-regional frameworks: the European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, the Northern Dimension and the Black Sea Economic Co-operation. On the basis of this analysis, I identify indicators of successful sub-regional policy as: equal partnership, joint ownership, diverse stakeholder involvement, adequate funding and institutional capacity, strong level of commitment and <b>common</b> <b>interests</b> and <b>objectives.</b> When applied to the external dimension of the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region, the indicators reveal several weaknesses that may serve to reduce the strategy’s overall effectiveness.

40|$|Objectives: In {{the last}} few years the Dutch {{ministry}} of Health has been searching for a renewed Health in All Policies (HiAP) strategy. This study analyses the Dutch practices and explores opportunities to reduce health inequalities by HiAP. Methods: A qualitative screening on the Dutch national budget was performed to explore ongoing policy resolutions of ministries inside and outside the public health domain. Additionally, semi-structured (group) interviews were conducted with 19 policy officers of seven ministries to identify critical factors for intersectoral collaboration. Results: Using the Dutch model on health inequalities 38 policy resolutions were selected: 15 on improving the socioeconomic position of people; four on improving participation of people with health problems; 19 on improving living and working conditions and lifestyle; and four on accessibility and quality of care. To improve intersectoral collaboration, policy officers suggested to strengthen existing links between the ministries, create <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>objectives</b> as well as visible results, approach this theme in a coordinated way, and to achieve broad political agreement. Conclusions: The main challenges for a formal HiAP strategy are to (a) cover the determinants of health inequalities in a balanced way linked to concrete objectives and visible results, (b) enhance high level agreement and coordinated mechanisms from the government in general and the ministry of Health in particular.

40|$|Transnational actors (TNAs), such as Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} {{autonomous}} {{in their attempts to}} influence states. But whenever NGOs and states share <b>common</b> <b>interests</b> or <b>objectives,</b> opportunities for mutual influence exists. (Theoretical) Discussions in International Relations (IR) have largely overlooked this possibility. However, recently more scholars are paying attention to opportunities for reciprocal relationship between states and transnational actors. Informed by this new literature this study examines how Norwegian engagement policy towards the Western Balkans has been shaped by a complex relationship between Norwegian NGOs and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). My case study demonstrates that the relationship between state authorities and NGOs in the formulation of the Norwegian Western Balkans policy, is thus best described as a reciprocal relationship. My argument is that the Norwegian state authorities, exercise greater influence on some NGOs than on others. In other words, depending on various factors some NGOs {{are likely to be more}} influenced by the MFA than others. While some research has suggested that states influence TNAs in two ways, namely through resources and through framing their normative framework of meaning (see Hëgel and Peretz 2005), the present study suggests that the efficiency of these strategies on the part of the state largely depends on other factors as well, namely the expertise of the NGO vis-à-vis the state, as well as their access to other normative frameworks of meaning through international or global alliances with other TNAs. In the present case, the state’s ability to influence NGOs depended not only upon domestic or national factors, but also on international ones...|$|R
40|$|The "closed vs open " dualism is an {{integral}} part of the Internet, which is born and grown up as a collective open project based on a network architecture and planned to contain every kind of information and subject. Communities are an essential aspect of the Internet and can be defined as structured aggregation systems sharing <b>common</b> <b>interests</b> and <b>objectives.</b> One of the main contemporary community is the one of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, which collects knowledge and information in order to spread them around the world and potentially reach everyone on the planet. The way Wikipedia works is very similar to the bazaar model typical of free and open source projects, like GNU Linux and Mozilla, and defined by Eric Raymond in his essay “The cathedral and bazaar”. Some of the features which constitutes this model are collaboration, transparency, a global involvement in terms of number of people in action and geographical areas implicated and an active culture of participation which enables community users to influence decisions and tendencies of the project. The bazaar model demonstrated its effectiveness in several ways, first of all in the rise of Linux and of the FLOSS systems, then in the transition process from Nupedia (the first encyclopedia founded by Jim Wales) to Wikipedia. In both cases the success of a modus operandi has not been dictated only by ethical ideals, but also by functional and structural reasons which we will analyze in the progress of this paper and which will state the favorable connection between the sharing of knowledge and the model adopted to share it...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the 2006 IAP Conference, held at Alexandria, from 1 - 3 December 2006, was 'The Unity of Science'. Let me explain how I {{interpret}} this interesting motto. For me, {{this does not mean}} that there is one regina scientiarum that rules over the other fields of science and learning; a role that was allotted to theology in olden times, and that nowadays - in a more secular vein - is claimed by physics. In my view, the notion 'unity of science' rather refers to 'communality within diversity'. Disciplines vary in content, issues and methods. But there are also quite some <b>common</b> <b>objectives,</b> <b>interests</b> and concerns, the most important of which may be the common goal of searching for testable truth with objective and independent evidence. The communalities render it possible, or even imperative, to communicate and to cooperate. The diversity implies complementariness and calls for interdisciplinarity in the study of today's numerous and complex phenomena in science and society. © 2008 Academia Europaea...|$|R

40|$|Online Communities {{have existed}} {{for a number}} of years but {{evaluation}} methods allowing their managers to make decisions are limited. These decisions can take the form of resource prioritisation, choice of specific future development areas or termination of Online Communities. This research document introduces a novel 4 -step method that can be used to assist this decision-making. A number of interpretations as to what is meant by the term ucommunity" are presented from a variety of disciplines before moving onto the newer concept of "Online Community". The literature does not provide one common meaning for these terms so a definition appropriate for this study was proposed. In this case an Online Community is defined as "a social or business space, supported by technology and Internet tools, in which people with <b>common</b> <b>interests,</b> <b>objectives</b> or values can meet and satisfy their needs". Next, current evaluation techniques were reviewed. From this, and from responses from interviews with Online Community Managers, it was clear that a new evaluation method that could answer business questions in a non-resource intensive manner was required. 4 requirements were identified as key to developing a new evaluation method that would provide benefit to the Online Community practitioners: " It must be simple to implement with minimum use of already limited resources " It must be flexible to allow custornisation for each unique Online Community " It should allow action to be taken to improve the day-to-day management " The measures collected must help answer business questions. To enable an efficient process to be utilised it was proposed to use a classification of Online Communities to reduce the complexity of the problem and to condense large amounts of information into a manageable format. After establishing that no existing classification was appropriate a new one with 4 classes was developed, based on data from literature and interviews with Online Community practitioners. After simplifying the problem by the use of the classification above, attention was turned to generating a new method that would meet the requirements identified previously. This was achieved by extracting key aspects from 3 specific techniques and frameworks, namely The Performance Prism, Performance Measurement Questionnaire and the Extended Web Assessment Method. The resulting method takes account of multiple stakeholders, facilitates definition of measures and recognises the use of perception data in relation to performance evaluation. Supporting material, in the form of flowcharts and templates, was also created to enable the customised measures to be developed in a rapid and resource efficient manner. The method was tested with two Online Communities and the results discussed. Feedback was captured from the participants and changes were subsequently made to improve the method. In addition it became clear that there was a need to explicitly address the "health" of the community aspect in the supporting material. From this research it is clear that the performance of Online Communities can be considered on many levels through this 4 -step evaluation method; it takes account of the aspects that are important to a specific community, in a rapid manner. It also confirms that it is possible to engage stakeholders in a dialogue about Online Community performance, thus providing data from them to facilitate future decisions.

40|$|Concepts {{embraced by}} the term {{coherence}} {{have been identified as}} central to fields such as quantum physics, physiology, and social science. There are different types of coherence, although the term always implies a harmonious relationship, correlations and connections between the various parts of a system. A specific measure derived from heart rate variability (HRV) provides a measure of physiological coherence. Another type of coherence, social coherence, relates to the harmonious alignment between couples or pairs, family units, small groups, or larger organizations in which a network of relationships exists among individuals who share <b>common</b> <b>interests</b> and <b>objectives.</b> A high degree of social coherence is reflected by stable and harmonious relationships, which allows for the efficient flow and utilization of energy and communication required for optimal collective cohesion and action. Social coherence requires that group members are attuned and are emotionally connected with each other, and that the group’s emotional energy is organized and regulated by the group as a whole. A number of studies are reviewed which have explored various types of synchronization in infants, pairs and groups, indicating that feelings of cooperation, trust, compassion and increased prosocial behaviors depends largely on the establishment of a spontaneous synchronization of various physiological rhythms between individuals. This article discusses a new application using HRV monitoring in social coherence research and the importance of physiological synchronization in group developmental processes and dynamics. Building on the extensive body of research showing that providing feedback of HRV coherence level at the individual level can improve self-regulation, we suggest the following hypotheses: (1) providing feedback of individual and collective HRV coherence and the degree of heart rhythm synchronization will increase group coherence, and heart rhythm synchronization among group members. (2) Training in techniques to increase group coherence and heart rhythm synchronization will correlate with increased prosocial behaviors, such as kindness and cooperation among individuals, improved communication, and decreases in social discord and adversarial interactions. (3) Biomagnetic fields produced by the heart may be a primary mechanism in mediating HRV synchronization among group members. Data supporting each of the hypothesis is discussed...|$|R

Local municipalities typically provide public benefits at taxpayer expense; private entities usually afford private benefits at the consumer’s expense. Like both public and private entities, <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> communities can experience the problem of financial distress. The ultimate solution to financial distress is relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Private entities are eligible for relief under chapter 11; public entities—municipalities—are eligible for relief under chapter 9. Chapter 9 affords municipalities significant protections compared to private entities under chapter 11 because of the irreducible political sovereignty of municipalities. Nonetheless, even though <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> communities also provide public goods, they are eligible for relief only under chapter 11 and thus lack the protections afforded by chapter 9.
