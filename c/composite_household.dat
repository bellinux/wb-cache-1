His infantry consisted of the 2nd Berkshires, 1st Royal Irish, 2nd Wiltshires, 2nd Worcesters, 1st Essex, and 1st Yorkshires; his cavalry, of the 10th Hussars, the 6th Dragoon Guards, the Inniskillings, the New Zealanders, the N.S.

At the risk of tedium I have repeated the units of this force, because there are no operations during the war, with the exception perhaps of those of the Rhodesian Column, concerning which it is so difficult to get a clear impression. The fluctuating forces, the vast range of country covered, and the petty farms which give their names to positions, all tend to make the issue vague and the narrative obscure. The British still lay in a semicircle extending from Slingersfontein upon the right to Kloof Camp upon the left, and the general scheme of operations continued to be an enveloping movement upon the right. General Clements commanded this section of the forces, while the energetic Porter carried out the successive advances. The lines had gradually stretched until they were nearly fifty miles in length, and something of the obscurity in which the operations have been left is due to the impossibility of any single correspondent having a clear idea of what was occurring over so extended a front.|$|E

In the same spirit, homogeneity of degree zero is being considered. Our approach employs nonseparable models and is centered around a conditional independence assumption, which is sufficiently general to allow for endogenous regressors. It is the only substantial assumption a researcher has to specify in this model, and has to be evaluated with particular care. Finally, we apply all concepts to British household data: We show that rationality is an acceptable description for large parts of the population, regardless of whether we test on single or <b>composite</b> <b>households.</b> ...|$|R

The Blues under Sir John French were left on the road: the line of retreat was blocked by De Wet who moved {{to cut off the}} convoys sent along the Thaba Nchu-Bloemfontein Road. Still in Broadwood's brigade, the Household Cavalry Regiment marched to Krantz Kraal to join an infantry brigade and divisional commander Major-General Ian Hamilton who marched on 30 April. During the night 4th Cavalry brigade was sent up as reinforcement and the Boers now heavily outnumbered by Broadwoood on the flank, beat a hasty retreat on 1 May, but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the cavalry. These brilliant marches covered hundreds of miles, such as the latter from Kaalfontein to Thaba Nchu. But the next month another 300 miles would be traversed interspersed with episodic periods of fierce fighting. On 3 May Broadwood despatched a squadron led by Viscount Sudley, a Captain in the Royal Horse Guards to gallop to exploit between two converging enemy forces of 4,000 and 1,000 men respectively over the Brandfort Ridge through a gauntlet of fire left and right. Lieutenant Rose was a casualty. The decisive action drove off the Boer infantry and enabled Broadwood to capture Welkom Farm on the Vet River the following day. Hon Charles Wyndham, also a Lieutenant, attached to the Blues, but initially a Life Guard was wounded in the skirmish at Kopje. On 10 May the Blues detachment under Colonel Fenwick bivouacked in the east of Ventersburg township, Two days later French's Winburg Column was able wheel round to capture the Boer HQ at Kroonstad with 1st and 4th Cavalry brigades. On 5 June the Household Cavalry Regiment occupied Poort north of Pretoria in an advanced position ahead of brigade. Roberts and Hamilton insisted on an arduous march in which the army lost 9,000 men, falling disproportionately on the Cavalry who lost 30% of their strength in 34 days.|$|E

40|$|Diversification of {{livelihoods}} is {{a commonly}} applied strategy {{for coping with}} economic and environmental shocks and instrumental in poverty reduction. In this paper, we have assessed the role of livelihood diversification in household well-being in Humla, a remote mountain district in west Nepal. Employing the data produced from household surveys, we developed a <b>composite</b> <b>household</b> well-being index incorporating four components and 15 indicators, and measured the effect of diversification on it. Results suggested a uniform pattern of diversification {{in terms of the}} number of activities undertaken for livelihoods but a highly varying degree of resultant well-being across households. Analysis showed that well-being was not associated with diversification per se but rather on a households' involvement in ‘high return sectors’ such as trade or salaried job. Because involvement in these remunerative sectors is determined by various financial, social and human capitals, poor households were unable to combat the entry barrier and were prevented from getting access to them. In this way, livelihood diversification was found to have a highly skewed effect leading to inequality of income and well-being. This, in turn, is likely to risk depriving the poor households from exploiting new economic opportunities even in the future...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is the {{pioneering}} application of the Harmonised EU Consumer Survey (CS) in tracking poverty levels in Croatia. As opposed to the annual EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) variables, CS offers considerable benefit by providing monthly information on the financial position of consumers. The interest lies in calculating a CS-based <b>composite</b> indicator of <b>household</b> financial distress using factor analysis. The newly proposed indicator could serve as a timely indicator of cumulous socio-economic problems in Croatia, as well as in all other EU member states, and in that way significantly complement the EU-SILC data. The harmonised European CS offers three questions pointing to the financial situation of households (Q 1 : Financial situation over last 12 months, Q 2 : Financial situation over the next 12 months, and Q 12 : Statement on financial situation of the household). The main advantage of these questions is their monthly frequency, providing better detailed information than annual EU-SILC data on prevailing social trends. Factor analysis calculated the new CS <b>composite</b> indicator of <b>household</b> financial distress based on three selected CS variables, as mentioned above. One factor was extracted, the factor scores were calculated, and then compared to the chosen variables from the EU-SILC data...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{dimension of}} poverty is access to food. Household food security implies {{access to the}} food needed for a healthy and productive life. Lack of access to and/or impaired utilization of food contribute to household food insecurity. This study compares the usefulness of a standardized food insecurity scale for determining the food insecurity status of rural and urban households in Bangladesh and Uganda, and for predicting poverty status. The analysis uses data from the IRIS <b>Composite</b> Survey <b>Household</b> Questionnaire (2004), which consists of 1, 587 households (approximately 800 households in each country). The coping mechanisms adopted {{in the presence of}} food shortages represent the building blocks {{for the development of the}} scale (7 items). In order to assess the suitability of the scale as an estimator of the households? poverty status, the benchmark indicator ?daily expenditures per capita? and its relation to the corresponding poverty line serves as the basis for evaluation for each country. The scale provides the means for classifying the households into 3 main groups: Non Food Insecure, Moderately Food Insecure, and Severely Food Insecure. The reliability of the scale is measured via the Cronbach?s Alpha statistic. In addition, the scale is used in regression analysis in order to predict per capita daily expenditures and the poverty incidence. The results show that food insecurity does not always reflect (income) poverty. However, the use of the scale as a predictor of poverty status produces rough estimates of poverty incidence that could be useful as background information. The differentiation of households according to their food security status may be valuable for focusing and developing improved food insecurity mitigation strategies...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} domestic occupancy {{and demand}} {{model with a}} 1 -min resolution has been developed which better captures the influence of different occupant behaviours than previous models. The occupancy model includes the fundamental link between occupancy and demand, and differentiates between different types and sizes of households.

A novel method for identifying appliance use events and linking use to an occupancy profile has been developed that accounts for household specific appliance usage using an event-based approach calibrated directly from measured data. The method {{has been shown to}} perform better than both per-timestep probability models and models calibrated from time-use survey activity diaries. To further capture individual household behaviours, the demand model incorporates additional factoring to account for income and random behavioural influences. Whilst improving differentiation of individual household energy usage, due to limitations in the available data, the model incorporates some occupancy and use behaviour factors that are a <b>composite</b> of multiple <b>households,</b> leading to some behaviour averaging in the model output; consequently the model is best employed for energy demand assessment of multiple households...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{some results}} {{of the first three}} years of an {{on-going}} research project on nutrient balances in a composite swidden agroecosystem. In a <b>composite</b> swiddening system, <b>households</b> simultaneously cultivate both swidden fields on hill slopes and paddy fields in the valleys. The study is being carried out in Ban Tat, a small settlement of Da Bac Tay ethnic minority people in Hoa Binh Province in Vietnam’s Northern Mountain Region. Nutrient inputs and outputs for a swidden field on a hill slope and a wet rice field in the valley below it were recorded and nutrient balances for each subsystem calculated. The swidden had large nega-tive balances for N, P, and K in all years of the experiment whereas in the paddy field only K was in serious deficit. Nutrients lost from the swidden field constituted a major source of inputs into the paddy field. This suggests that the sustainability of wet rice agriculture in the valleys is heavily dependent on interactions with the hill slopes. At the level of the composite swidden system as a whole, nutrient inputs and outputs were not in balance. Outputs of N exceeded inputs by 159 kg/ha and outputs of K exceeded inputs by 867 kg/ha.

40|$|Background: Although {{historically}} tuberculosis (TB) {{has been}} associated with poverty, few analytical studies from developing countries have tried to: 1. assess the relative impact of poverty on TB after the emergence of HIV; 2. explore the causal mechanism underlying this association; and 3. estimate how many cases of TB could be prevented by improving household socioeconomic position (SEP). Methods and Findings: We undertook a case-control study nested within a population-based TB and HIV prevalence survey conducted in 2005 – 2006 in two Zambian communities. Cases were defined as persons (15 + years of age) culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Controls were randomly drawn from the TB-free participants enrolled in the prevalence survey. We developed a <b>composite</b> index of <b>household</b> SEP combining variables accounting for four different domains of household SEP. The analysis of the mediation pathway between household SEP and TB was driven by a pre-defined conceptual framework. Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions (aPAF) were estimated. Prevalent TB was significantly associated with lower household SEP [aOR = 6. 2, 95 %CI: 2. 0 – 19. 2 and aOR = 3. 4, 95 %CI: 1. 8 – 7. 6 respectively for low and medium household SEP compared to high].

40|$|European {{politicians}} {{encourage the}} income diversification of rural households through various measures. Although {{being aware of}} farm households’ potential for non-farm income diversification seems important for finely-targeting such policy measures, no attempt has thus far been made to summarise the various determinants of income diversification in a single figure. This contribution aims to close this gap. A composite fuzzy indicator that measures farm household potential for non-farm income diversification is developed and applied to 1, 053 farm households in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia. The indicator summarises the incentives of and capacities for non-farm income diversification on the individual household member level, and on the household and regional levels to a single measure using fuzzy logic methodology. The composite fuzzy indicator performs well, and {{the results for the}} single farm households can easily be retraced. The indicator not only singles out the households that have the potential for non-farm income diversification, but also shows the reasons for this. Thus, the result for 1, 053 farm households is not only that most of them have a high potential for non-farm income diversification, but also that the majority of these households are pushed in diversification due to the smallness of their farms. Only a few of the farm households act under pull conditions, i. e. diversification is not a necessity, but they could opt for profitable non-farm employment due to favourable age, education, and regional conditions.

This force consisted of the Carabineers, New South Wales Lancers, Inniskillings, <b>composite</b> regiment of <b>Household</b> Cavalry, 10th Hussars, with some mounted infantry and two batteries of Horse Artillery, making a force of nearly three thousand sabres. To this were added the 9th and 12th Lancers from Modder River, the 16th Lancers from India, the Scots Greys, which had been patrolling Orange River from the beginning of the war, Rimington's Scouts, and two brigades of mounted infantry under Colonels Ridley and Hannay.

40|$|Abstract: Greywater (GW) is {{household}} wastewater effluent {{originating from}} baths, showers, kitchen and hand wash basins and laundry and constitutes 50 - 80 % of indoor household water use. It represents water that can potentially be intercepted at the household level for use. In Kenya, GW use is practiced on an informal basis to supplement irrigation water, either in urban gardens in middle to upper income suburbs or in food gardens in lower income informal, periurban and rural areas. However, the reuse of greywater for irrigation without any significant pre-treatment poses a potential risk to {{both human and}} environmental health due to microbial and chemical contamination. This study investigated the potential of a low cost greywater treatment (GWT) system for safe greywater reuse by households. The system comprises of discrete units of barrels that allows for filtration, flocculation, sedimentation and disinfection. GWT system produced water with both pH and electrical conductivity suitable for irrigation according to WHO guidelines. It was also efficient at eliminating Salmonella sp. and reducing total coli form in <b>composite</b> greywater from <b>households</b> in Homa Bay after the effluent was disinfected with commercial disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). The cleaned greywater had a total coli form count (2. 5 x 106 cfu/ 100 ml) comparable to 0 –> 2. 4 106 cfu/ 100 ml obtained when greywater was treated using an expensive biological aerated filter (BAF). Fecal coli form counts (2. 1 102 cfu/ 100 ml) compare well with 103 cfu/ 100 ml provided in WHO guidelines for public parks and crops likely to be eaten uncooked. The treatment {{had no effect on}} dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity and electrical conductivity.

Chapman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 120 pages, appendices A-C. The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine the relationships among household, individual, and commune factors and secondary school completion in Vietnam. The study involves a secondary data analysis of the 2006 Vietnam Living Standards Survey which contained extensive variables in its education section. The findings from regression analyses are as follows. First, academic achievement of students is the strongest factor among nine independent variables, having a statistically significant positive association with secondary school completion at the national level. Second, economic status, a <b>composite</b> variable of <b>household</b> income, expenditures for schooling, and commune wealth, has a statistically positive relationship with secondary school completion at the national level. Third, parents' education level is another positive factor associated with secondary school completion at the national level. Fourth, wages in rural areas have statistically negative relationship with lower secondary school completion. Fifth, there is no statistical association between secondary school completion and gender, ethnicity, and residence (rural/ urban). The first three findings should be interpreted with caution due to specification error and the nature of their bivariate correlations. It appears that the impact of academic achievement may be biased upwards because missing data were not random. In addition, the economic status and parents' education level variables are statistically significant factors but this result is obtained when academic achievement was removed from regression analyses because of considerable missing data. Based on bivariate correlations, these three variables show only moderate and weak relations, suggesting that Vietnam is doing relatively well in providing secondary education for all except for those in remote areas (particularly diverse ethnic groups). Though this study finds no statistical relationship among ethnicity, residence, and school completion in regression models, there is considerable mean difference in secondary school completion by ethnicity and residence in descriptive statistics which has important implications for national educational policy. Based on the findings of this study, various other important policy implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Worldwide {{one billion}} {{people are living}} in slum {{communities}} and experts projected that this number would double by 2030. Slum populations, which are increasing {{at an alarming rate}} in Bangladesh mainly due to rural-urban migration, are often neglected and characterized by poverty, poor housing, overcrowding, poor environment, and high prevalence of communicable diseases. Unfortunately, comparisons between women living in slums and those not living in slums are very limited in Bangladesh. The objectives of the study were to examine the association of living in slums (dichotomized as slum versus non-slum) with selected public health-related variables among women, first without adjusting for the influence of other factors and then in the presence of socio-economic variables. Methods Secondary data was used in this study. 120 women living in slums (as cases) and 480 age-matched women living in other areas (as controls) were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2004. Many socio-economic and demographic variables were analysed. SPSS was used to perform simple as well as multiple analyses. P-values based on t-test and Wald test were also reported to show the significance level. Results Unadjusted results indicated that a significantly higher percent of women living in slums came from country side, had a poorer status by household characteristics, had less access to mass media, and had less education than women not living in slums. Mean BMI, knowledge of AIDS indicated by ever heard about AIDS, knowledge of avoiding AIDS by condom use, receiving adequate antenatal visits (4 or more) during the last pregnancy, and safe delivery practices assisted by skilled sources were significantly lower among women living in slums than those women living in other areas. However, all the unadjusted significant associations with the variable slum were greatly attenuated and became insignificant (expect safe delivery practices) when some socio-economic variables namely childhood place of residence, a <b>composite</b> variable of <b>household</b> characteristics, a <b>composite</b> variable of mass media access, and education were inserted into the multiple regression models. Taken together, childhood place of residence, the composite variable of mass media access, and education were the strongest predictors for the health related outcomes. Conclusion Reporting unadjusted findings of public health variables in women from slums versus non-slums can be misleading due to confounding factors. Our findings suggest that an association of childhood place of residence, mass media access and public health education should be considered before making any inference based on slum versus non-slum comparisons. </p...|$|R
40|$|Among {{various types}} of {{electrical}} energy storage devices, supercapacitors (high power but low energy) and batteries (high energy but low power) are extensively studied. Present work aims to develop an electrode material that combines the advantages of both supercapacitors and batteries. This was realized by rational design of the microstructure of the composite material made of aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) and a pseudocapacitive component which {{in this study is}} mainly polyaniline (PANI). Other affecting factors including electrolytes, configuration of the cell and so on are temporarily not included in this study. Initial study on the composite materials made of PANI and powder CNTs through chemical reactions has shown that the loading of PANI varied the π-π interaction between PANI and CNTs which could cause the change in the oxidation stability of the composite materials. Deposition of PANI on ACNTs via electrochemical polymerization shows better control over the morphology and microstructure of the composite materials than via chemical polymerization. ACNTs were successfully synthesized on Ti and Al substrates in present work. PANI was firstly electrochemically polymerized on the ACNTs/Ti templates by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). A systematic study on the composite materials containing various loadings of PANI has shown: The specific capacitance based on PANI phase reached 1100 F/g when the PANI film is thinner than 11 nm, which is approaching the limited value that PANI can provide. After 2000 cycles of charge-discharge at 2. 0 A/g, the reduction in the discharge capacitance of the composites containing 63. 3 % and 21. 4 % of PANI was 7. 1 % and 3. 3 %, A principle of designing the optimal microstructure of the composite materials towards high specific power and specific energy and good cycling stability was developed: high loading and thin layer of PANI should be obtained at the same time. This principle was realized by depositing a 9 nm of PANI on much smaller ACNTs (9 nm in diameter) which were facilely synthesized on household aluminum foil. A highly flexible symmetric supercapacitor built from the 63. 8 % wt. PANI/ACNTs <b>composite</b> material on <b>household</b> Al current collector exhibited a high specific capacitance of 705. 8 F/g at 0. 1 A/g. A small specific capacitance decay of about 5. 3 % from 0. 1 A/g to 5. 0 A/g indicated a good rate performance. The average specific energy and average specific power were found to be 18. 9 Wh/kg and 220. 1 W/kg at 1. 0 A/g. The internal resistance of the device at 1. 0 A/g was calculated to be 1. 3 Ω, leading to the maximum specific power of 11. 3 kW/kg. 96 % of the initial capacitance was kept after 2000 cycles of charge-dishcarge at 1. 0 A/g. The high specific energy of 72. 4 Wh/kg and high specific power of 24. 9 kW/kg were obtained with an organic electrolyte, namely, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) at 1. 0 A/g. The coin-cell showed a reduction of ~ 5 % in the capacitance after 2000 cycles of charge-discharge from 0 to 2. 5 V at 1. 0 A/g. A smarter design on the supercapacitor device was also proposed in present work aiming to enhance the performance and reduce the cost of the device.
