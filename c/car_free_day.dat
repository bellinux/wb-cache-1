50|$|End of the Road (1991) {{was written}} {{as an attempt}} to pull {{together}} all the rich body of information and ideas being generated by the New Mobility project, in an easily readable form, addressed to the general public, and put into jargon-free and vivid language not generally found in the transportation literature. Zuckermann followed this up with a number of other EcoPlan projects such as co-author of a children's book, Family Mouse Behind the Wheel (1992), as well as taking a leading role in The Commons <b>Car</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Days</b> program. His book Alice in Underland (2000) looks at today's technology and society matters (and manners) from a perspective somewhat different from that usually encountered in the literature.|$|R
40|$|Car-free {{development}} has been discussed {{in different parts of}} the world as a sustainable mobility strategy. Nonetheless, real efforts are limited temporally, such as on annual <b>Car</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Days,</b> and spatially, such as to car-free housing in the suburbs of small to medium scale European cities or car-free zones within the central business districts of large cities. The experience of Discovery Bay, Hong Kong, is being analysed in this paper to demonstrate that car-free development can and has happened in compact cosmopolitan cities like Hong Kong since the 1980 s. The population living in this car-free {{development has}} reached over 12, 000 in 2014. A virtuous cycle of car-free development, building upon people’s underlying environmental and social values, can be sustained by coordinated transport and land use planning to satisfy diverse needs and through local participation. Nonetheless, many challenges of “car encroachment” still lie ahead...|$|R
