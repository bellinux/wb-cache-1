5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its {{popularity}} in Japan is synonymous with RPGs. While the game's elements had been present in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set the template for others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> video game development by making scenario writers far more important.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a series of small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> production.|$|E

The decree <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated {{in the fall of}} 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale American support began {{during the}} Kennedy Administration {{in the early}} 1960s, {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of {{helicopters}} <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the Viet Cong. These tactics, combined with the use of armored personnel carriers, took a heavy toll on various fledgling Viet Cong units. The lightly armed Viet Cong had no weaponry capable of stopping the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing {{similar to that used}} in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra traffic lane, bringing the total number of lanes to seven.|$|E
5|$|Loxton had an {{unproductive}} {{time during the}} 1950–51 Australian season. He lost his Test place after three matches, and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62. In the first match of the season, he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown's touring team, a portent of the coming season. However, he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests, scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3/24 against New South Wales. The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm that completely <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the pitch after the first day. The Australian all-rounder had by then {{been the victim of}} a spectacular catch by England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, making 24 in Australia's 228. He picked up five catches—his first Test catches in his tenth match—as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen, who made 7/68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface. Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings, unable to cope with the conditions, as did most of his compatriots. Australia collapsed to 3/0 before reaching 7/32, at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting. England fell to 6/30 at stumps in pursuit of 193. Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours, while only 102 runs had been scored. Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs.|$|E
5|$|The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the war. The Persians did {{not attempt}} to attack the isthmus by land, {{realising}} they probably could not breach it. This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis. However, as successful as this was, {{there was no need for}} the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign. Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance. In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus. Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.|$|E
