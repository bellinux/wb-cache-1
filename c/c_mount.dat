50|$|A <b>C</b> <b>mount</b> {{is a type}} of {{lens mount}} {{commonly}} found on 16 mm movie cameras, closed-circuit television cameras, machine vision cameras and microscope phototubes.|$|E
50|$|The Camera is {{configured}} for <b>C</b> <b>mount</b> {{lenses and}} starting in 1927, {{was equipped with}} a three lens turret (Model C). Early turret models used a variable drum finder (Models D and DA) or sets of separate finder lenses matched to each focal length on later cameras (Models DL and DR).|$|E
50|$|Static image {{acquisition}} {{is the most}} common form. Almost all microscopes can be easily adapted to accept a digital camera via a <b>C</b> <b>mount</b> adaptor.

5000|$|C-mount lenses {{provide a}} male thread, which mates {{with a female}} thread on the camera. The thread is {{nominally}} 1.000 in in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as [...] "1-32 UN 2A" [...] in the ANSI B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The flange focal distance is 17.526 mm for a <b>C</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
50|$|MFT {{shares the}} {{original}} image sensor size and specification with the Four Thirds system, designed for DSLRs. Unlike Four Thirds, the MFT system design specification {{does not provide}} space for a mirror box and a pentaprism, which facilitates smaller body designs and a shorter flange focal distance, and hence smaller lenses. With adapters, most lenses {{can be used on}} MFT camera bodies, including those produced by Canon and Nikon, and lenses produced for cinema, e.g., PL mount or <b>C</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Digital Bolex {{camera was}} the second camera to utilize Adobe's CinemaDNG open RAW file format after the Swedish-made Ikonoskop which debuted in 2008. Both cameras utilize a Kodak-designed CCD sensor. The Digital Bolex D16 shoots raw still frames per second instead of a {{traditional}} video stream. In addition to its raw capabilities, the camera is notable for its Super 16mm sized sensor, allowing the usage of vintage 16mm lenses with no crop, and its unique crank wheel encoder. The Digital Bolex is the only digital cinema camera with a native <b>C</b> <b>mount,</b> {{a nod to the}} original Bolex 16mm film cameras.|$|E

During his service time, Bullard fought in several battles including a major engagement near Walla Walla in eastern Washington. When his enlistment expired, Bullard returned to his farm in Pacific County.|$|R

5000|$|The shallow but wide MFT {{lens mount}} also allows {{the use of}} {{existing}} lenses including Leica M, Leica R, and Olympus OM system lenses, via Panasonic and Olympus adapters. Aftermarket adapters include Leica Screw Mount, Contax G, <b>C</b> <b>mount,</b> Arri PL mount, Praktica, Canon, Nikon, and Pentax, amongst others. In fact, almost any still camera, movie or video camera interchangeable lens that has a flange focal distance greater than or marginally less than 20 mm can often be used on MFT bodies via an adapter. While MFT cameras can use many of these [...] "legacy" [...] lenses only with manual focus and aperture control mode, hundreds of lenses are available, even those designed for cameras no longer in production.|$|E
