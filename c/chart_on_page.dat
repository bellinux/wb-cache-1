5000|$|After Charles Pascal's {{report in}} 2009, Ontario's Ministry of Education decided to {{implement}} a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program. As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are {{the heart of the}} program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or [...] "pretense" [...] play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication.

40|$|Good {{classroom}} instruction is no accident. Two powerful tools for analyzing {{the quality of}} student instruction are the Instructional Hierarchy and the Learn Unit. Instructional Hierarchy. As students are taught new academic skills, they go {{through a series of}} predictable learning stages. At the start, a student is usually halting and uncertain as he or she tries to use the target skill. With teacher feedback and lots of practice, the student becomes more fluent, accurate, and confident in using the skill. It can be very useful to think of these phases of learning as a hierarchy (See <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 2). The learning hierarchy (Haring, Lovitt, Eaton, & Hansen, 1978) has four stages: acquisition, fluency, generalization, and adaptation: 1. Acquisition. The student has begun to learn how to complete the target skill correctly but is not yet accurate or fluent in the skill. The goal in this phase is to improve accuracy. 2. Fluency. The student is able to complete the target skill accurately but works slowly. The goal of this phase is to increase the student’s speed of responding (fluency). 3. Generalization. The student is accurate and fluent in using the target skill but does not typically use it in different situations or settings. Or the student may confuse the target skill with ‘similar ’ skills. The goal of this phase is to get the student to use the skill in the widest possible range of settings and situations, or to accurately discriminate between the target skill and ‘similar ’ skills...|$|E

P & G and Unile-ver have a range of global brands achiev-ing success in different international mar-kets. On the other hand, Singapore Airlines is a successful corporate brand in South East Asia, while Airasia is similar but a budget airline. Although companies like P & G and Unile-ver, favour a multi brand strategy, others use a strategy of extending their brands as illustrated below: There are advantages and disadvantages in brand extensions, not withstanding, build-ing great brands is a company’s greatest challenge and ultimately its greatest asset. Branding is about endowing products and services with the power of brand equity. Brand equity came up in the ‘ 80 s. On the good side, brand equity has elevated the importance of the brand in marketing strategy. On the bad side, brand equity has been defined in a number ways and for different purposes, without a common viewpoint. Brand Equity Brand equity is the added value endowed on products and services. It may be reflect-ed in the way consumers think, feel, and act with respect to the brand, {{as well as in the}} prices, market share, and profitability the brand commands for the firm (Kotler et al, 2012).

40|$|The daily {{effective}} {{federal funds}} rate contains noise—that is, departures from the target level established by the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) that reflect idiosyncratic conditions in the interbank loan market. Averaging the daily data across a month or quarter {{is one way to}} cancel most of this noise, and, for this reason, the monthly or quarterly average of the daily {{federal funds rate}} has become a widely used measure of monetary policy. The first <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 10 of this publication, for example, plots a quarterly average as the actual federal funds rate in a Taylor rule description of monetary policy. The monthly average is also the benchmark for payoffs in the federal funds futures market. One often-neglected consequence of monthly averaging, however, is that any change in the target federal funds rate will affect the monthly average for two months. For example, if the FOMC raised the target by 50 basis points precisely halfway through this month, then the monthly average for this month will rise by 25 basis points relative to last month, and next month’s average will also exceed this month’s average by 25 basis points, all else equal. Similarly, if the FOMC raised the target by 50 basis points threequarters of the way through this month, then the expected monthly average for the next month would rise by 37. 5 basis points. To gauge how strongly target changes in one month affect the change in the monthly average funds rate from that month to the next, I estimated two regressions of the change in the monthly average on its own lagged value. In one regression, I also included information about how the size and timing of any target change in the previous month would affect this month’s average. The sample period covere...|$|E
40|$|International {{students}} {{are those who}} have crossed borders for the purpose of study. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the OECD and EUrOSTaT define international students as those who are not residents of their country of study or those who received their prior education in another country. When data on international {{students are}} not available, data on foreign students are used. Foreign students are defined according to their citizenship. International students are thus a subset of foreign students. How is international student mobility shaping up? The internationalisation of tertiary education has gone hand in hand with its expansion. Mapping the international student intake. The number of students enrolled in tertiary education outside their country of citizenship has sharply increased over the last decades, reflecting the expansion of tertiary education systems worldwide and the globalisation of economies and societies. as most students who study abroad choose to do so in OECD countries, the expansion of tertiary education outside the OECD area has fuelled its intake of foreign students. The number of students enrolled in tertiary education outside their country of citizenship increased more than threefold, from 1. 3 million in 1990 to nearly 4. 3 million in 2011, representing an average annual growth rate of almost 6 %. This is a greater increase than the overall rise in tertiary enrolments globally. Contrary to what some observers expected, there has been no decline in the growth rate of international students during the global economic crisis (see <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 2). among the benefits of studying abroad perceived by an increasing number of students are the cultural enrichment and improved language skills, high-status qualifications, and a competitive edge to access better jobs. Studying abroad helps students to expand their knowledge of other societies, languages, cultures and business methods, and to leverage their labour market prospects (OECD, 2004). Moreover, declines in the costs of international travel and communications also make it easier for students to study abroad...|$|E

Orcus and Demogorgon are said to command all the other demons {{described in}} the book, although they are but two of the many Eternals of the Sphere of Entropy. Orcus (also called The Goat, Master of the Dead, Lord of Darkness, and The Black Prince) commands all mortals of the Sphere of Entropy, which includes undead monsters, and he also commands a small body of loyal Immortals. The book notes that Demogorgon can even command Orcus, although he requires great and sufficient cause to do so. In this version, Orcus attacks with any convenient weapons, wielding one in each hand. In Wrath of the Immortals (1992), Orcus's history was fleshed out somewhat; he was said to have been a devil swine (a kind of shape-shifter who changes between the form of a fat human and a wild pig) in the long-ago kingdom of Traldara on the world of Mystara. His hatred for all life was sufficient to draw the attention of the Immortal Thanatos, who sponsored Orcus's own successful bid for Immortality.

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} facilities have opted {{to follow the}} path towards a “ 5 S ” workplace organi-zational and housekeeping methodology as part of continuous improvement or lean manufactur-ing processes. 5 S is a system to reduce waste and optimize productivity through maintaining an orderly workplace and using visual cues to achieve more consistent operational results (see <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 3). The term refers to five steps – sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain – that are also sometimes known as the 5 pillars of a visual workplace. 5 S programs are usually implemented by small teams working together to get materials closer to operations, right at workers ’ fingertips and organized and labeled to facilitate operations with the smallest amount of wasted time and materials. The 5 S system is {{a good starting point}} for all improvement efforts aim-ing to drive out waste from the manu-facturing process, and ultimately improve a company’s bottom line by improving products and services, and lowering costs. Many companies are seeking to making operations more efficient, and the concept is especially attractive to older {{manufacturing facilities}} looking to improve the bottom line by reducing their costs. “A place for everything, and everything in its place ” is the mantra of the 5 S method, and stor-age and workspace systems such as those provid-ed by Lista International allow improved organi-zation and maximum use of cubic space for the highest density storage. The result is an improved manufacturing process and the lowest overall cost for goods produced. The 5 Pillars of a Visual Workplace Implementing the 5 S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace in its existing configuration. It is typically the first lean method that organizations implement. This lean method encour-ages workers to improve their working conditions and helps them to learn to reduce waste, unplanned downtime, and in-process inventory.

The possibility of a society without psychological altruism [...] Chapter 7. General conclusions, policy implications, and further research. The literature on altruism is often quite broad in that it advocates the existence as well as the importance of altruism in economic decisions. However, altruism is unlikely to be included as an important factor in many well-being models. The main thesis advanced in this study is that altruism cannot be excluded from a well-being model, otherwise the model will not be able reflect the actual capability of a society to acquire well-being. Through its ability to both utilise the potential of the resources available and produce positive social externalities, the absence of altruism could undermine the ability of the resources to support the well-being of its members. Our models also include resources, social interaction, culture, social capital, and institution because of their obvious role in influencing well-being. The literature in economics has long acknowledged the importance of these variables in well-being and yet a comprehensive analysis of their inter-relationships in influencing well-being has not been extensively explored. This study may be the first comprehensive inquiry into the inter-relationships among these variables using economics principles. On one hand, the unclear importance of altruism in well-being is caused by the obscure relationship between altruism and transfer behaviour. On the other hand, some altruism models face limitations in their acceptance of the possibility of altruism being extended to people beyond family members. Through mathematical models, this study provides a solution to these problems in two ways. First, inspired by 'Varieties of Altruism' from Phillip Kitcher in 2010, the relationship between psychological and behavioural altruism is precisely defined. Second, the imperfect information assumption is applied in the model. The originality of this study comes mainly from the following areas. First, this dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis showing the mechanism of how altruism influences multidimensional well-being through social interaction, culture, social capital, and institution. Second, the models explain empirical studies by showing that the positive relationship between altruism and well-being is only relevant for people who perceive themselves as having less resource than others. Third, the models show a low behavioural altruism trap, which explains the difficulty in performing a purely altruistic transfer to others. Fourth, an alternative measure for institution is introduced using the reliability and predictability of behaviour. Fifth, an alternative measure for social capital is offered using the coherence of a society as the core definition of social capital. Sixth, the altruism models developed in this study allow a misperception of own and others' resources. Seventh, the models show that the average level of psychological altruism in a society cannot be assumed to be always equal to zero. Eighth, the relationship between psychological and behavioural altruism is explicitly shown in the models.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focusing on analysing the concept and creation of fashion brand, based besides theoretical literature also on the empirical research: interviews conducted with people behind {{the process of developing}} and launching new international fashion brand Monton. For analysing three main questions were set out: ·How experts define fashion? ·How the concept of fashion brand is understood and which are linked terms? ·Why Montin was created? To analyze the topic and find answers this thesis takes a look at first on the theoretical literature written on the topic of fashion, branding and on the theories of culture and society (culture industry, consumer culture, postmodernity etc). After having distinguished fashion and brand into two theoretical parts in order to unite them to form the concept of fashion brand, the author has pointed out the cultural and same time economical nature of fashion (fashion as one of the culture industries), succeeding then with contrasting fashion and clothing. Distinguishing fashion as the constant and systematic change in garment styles, contrasting it with clothing which refers to more stable and functional system of garments. Brand has been seen as also from one side cultural and from the other economic concept, which encompasses some added values and distinguishes products from each other, thus giving reason consumers to pay more for branded products, as opposed to labels which don't have any extra value. Therefore there can exist both clothing and fashion brands, which are contrasted with labels. There thus exist different levels of brands in the garment industry, which make it possible for consumers to get better experiences and companies to earn bigger revenues. Empirical material analyzed interviews, focusing on interviewees understanding on brands, fashion, clothing and fashion/clothing bands and on the process of creation of Monton, which was mainly undertaken to ensure and enable the future growth and development of the company. Interviewees distinguished in branding two viewpoints - brand as a benefit for the company and brand as a consumers vision. First being seen very rationally and economically as just a way to earn money for the company, though also being means for giving assuredness for employees and company. The second one (concept of brand as a consumers vision) sees the brand as something more which is placed in consumers mind, an added value, a way of living, not just as a means to create bigger sales. Fashion was defined as an experience and clothing as the functional covering of body. When discussing the question of fashion/clothing brand, then all interviewees distinguished clothing from fashion and brand from label, which is visualized as <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 56 - 57. But the same time it was interesting that many of them didn't think it being possible for clothing to be a brand and thought of clothing as only a label (as branding being only the thing for fashion). But as it {{can be seen from the}} chart and from the theoretical part, then also clothing brands and fashion labels can exist. From interviews was clearly detectable also two interwined dimensions: culture and economy, when talked about fashion and clothing and about brand and label. These three polarisations can be drawn as one chart, so making visible the relation between three. To sum up then it was found that there exists a difference between fashion and clothing, as it exists between brand and label. Based on these features a matrix can be drawn (fashion and clothing vs brand and label), which shows different levels of branding in garment indusrty and if placing it onto culture-economy axis, it reveals the relation of clothing and fashion brands and labels as being a part of the concept of culture industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{numbers that}} appear in tables of {{physical}} and chemical constants. and similar tabulations, the digit 1 appears as first digit almost three times more often, as one would expect, This phenomenal distribution of first digit is known at least for over 30 years when the physicist Frank Benford published a paper on this subject In his paper 5 Benford offered a general "law of anomalous numbers. The probability that a random decimal begins with digit p is fT log (p + 1) - log p, where logarithms are based on 10. Now the mathematician Ralph A. Raimi has, in [2], recently concerned himself with analysis of this number phenomenon, but did not refer to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. It seems that the first digits of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers tend to obey very closely the formula of probability offered by Benford. The <b>chart</b> <b>on</b> the following <b>page</b> shows the relation of frequencies for the first 100 Fibonacci Numbers and the first 100 Lucas numbers with frequencies of Benford's law. It {{would be interesting to}} make use of much more than 100 Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for the purpose of further analyzing Benford 7 s law...|$|R

The Fellows were encouraged to continue to contribute because after 1,000 planes had been certified by the Air Ministry and paid for, the Fellow was promoted from PUFF (Soplito) to GUST (Rafaga) and given another distinctive badge. And so the quest for funds through fun went on: with 2,500 planes down and paid for, the GUST became a GALE (Vendaval); 5,000 planes created a HURRICANE (Huracán), 6,500 a TORNADO (Tornado) and 8,000 a TYPHOON (Tifón). With each promotion, a further distinctive badge was issued. 10,000 planes downed and paid for entitled Fellows to obtain the honour: THE ORDER OF THE BELLOWS and were given their wings; wings were added to a special badge depicting a bellows. It was a further masterstroke that the incentive of promotion encouraged continuing monthly payments.|$|R
