40|$|We {{report the}} design, {{chemical}} synthesis, and structural and functional characterization {{of a novel}} reagent for protein sequence analysis by the Edman degradation, yielding amino acid derivatives rapidly detectable at high sensitivity by ion-evaporation mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that the reagent 3 -[4 '(ethylene-N,N,N-trimethylamino) phenyl]- 2 -isothiocyanate is chemically stable and shows coupling and cyclization/cleavage yields comparable to phenylisothiocyanate, the standard reagent in <b>chemical</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis, under conditions typically encountered in manual or automated sequence analysis. Amino acid derivatives generated with this reagent were detectable by ion-evaporation mass spectrometry at the subfemtomole sensitivity level at a pace of one sample per minute. Furthermore, derivatives were identified by their mass, thus permitting the rapid and highly sensitive determination of the molecular nature of modified amino acids. Derivatives of amino acids with acidic, basic, polar, or hydrophobic side chains were reproducibly detectable at comparable sensitivities. The polar nature of the reagent required covalent immobilization of polypeptides prior to automated sequence analysis.

40|$|An {{improved}} chemical method, {{capable of}} derivatizing all natural amino acids to their corresponding thiohydantoins, is described. This involves activation by acetyl chloride in TFA followed by derivatization with ammonium thiocyanate. Possible interference of reactive side chains was investigated by reacting N-acetylamino acids {{as well as}} several peptides with propionyl chloride instead of acetyl chloride. The products were characterized by PDMS mass spectrometry and 1 H-NMR. This chemical method allows, for the first time, complete derivatization of N-acetylproline to proline thiohydantoin. Applying this chemistry to peptides with a C-terminal proline, the yields for formation of proline thiohydantoin were found to be up to 60 %, depending on the peptide sequence. The previous inability to derivatize C-terminal proline to thiohydantoin was thought to stem from the fact that proline cannot form the oxazolonium ion required for efficient reaction with the thiocyanate ion. However, we have found mass spectrometric evidence for the existence of a proline oxazolonium ion, under basic as well as under acidic conditions. This improvement in derivatization of C-terminal amino acids including proline is a major step forward {{in the development of a}} general <b>chemical</b> C-terminal <b>sequencing</b> <b>method</b> that permits the C-terminal sequence analysis of proteins of any amino acid composition...|$|R

The differences resulted in 26 amino acid substitutions distributed over the six proteins. The sequence changes were compared to the sequences of other known influenza type B wt viruses to pinpoint those changes that were unique to the ca B/Ann Arbor/ 1 / 66 virus. Of the 26 amino acid differences, only 11 were unique to the cold-adapted virus. These unique sites were distributed among five of the six genes. The NS protein had no amino acid substitutions. The sequence changes are discussed in terms of their probable mode of origin and selection, and in terms of their importance to the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, and attenuation phenotypes of ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 virus. The sequence and organization of the PB 2 gene and predicted protein are also given. The PB 2 gene was 2396 nucleotides long, and it encoded a predicted protein of 770 amino acids with a molecular weight of 88, 035 Da for the wt virus and 88, 072 Da for the ca virus.
