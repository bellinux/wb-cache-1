50|$|Real Balompédica Linense's {{original}} date of founding {{is somewhat}} disputed {{with the club}} and current Chairman believing it to have been formed on September 12, 1912. This is now commonly accepted due to a document of the Andalusia Football Federation which had this date in its official yearbook. However prior to this document being rediscovered it was {{believed to have been}} founded in 1921 when it was registered and started competing. The club was a merger of several amateur clubs from La Línea and possibly Gibraltar. On the 8th of December 1921 Balompédica Linense played and won its debut match, played against Club Racing Santander. 9 months later, on September 5, 1922 the club joined the South Regional Federation. In the same year the club also added the distinction of Real to its name, thus creating the present name of Real Balompédica Linense.For the first years of competition the club played its matches at the Aurora Sports Field. As the club began participation in official competitions it became necessary for it to have a <b>custom</b> <b>field.</b> Thus the club opened the San Bernardo Estadio, playing its first match at the ground on 17 October 1926, being defeated 2-1 by FC Malagueno.|$|E

The IR projector generates {{scenes of}} moving objects and standing landscapes for hardware {{in the loop}} (HWIL) sensor testing to simulate real world scenarios.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a stack ventilated building compared with two other building designs have been predicted numerically for ventilation and thermal comfort effects in a typical climate of Beijing, China. The buildings were configured based on natural ventilation. Using actual building sizes, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models were developed, simulated and analysed in Fluent, an ANSYS platform. This paper describes the general design consideration that has been incorporated, the ventilation strategies and the variation in meshing and boundary conditions. The predicted {{results show that the}} ventilation flow rates are important parameters to ensure fresh air supply.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multichannel, ultra-low-noise arbitrary signal generation platform for emulating {{a wide range}} of different biopotential signals (e. g. ECG, EEG, etc). This is intended for use in the test, measurement and demonstration of bioinstrumentation and medical devices that interface to electrode inputs. The system is organized in 3 key blocks for generating, processing and converting the digital data into a parallel high performance analogue output. These blocks consist of: (1) a Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi 3) board; (2) a <b>custom</b> <b>Field</b> Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board with low-power IGLOO Nano device; and (3) analogue board including the Digital-to-Analogue Converters (DACs) and output circuits. By implementing the system this way, good isolation can be achieved between the different power and signal domains. This mixed-signal architecture takes in a high bitrate SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) stream, recodes and packetizes this to drive two multichannel DACs, with parallel analogue outputs that are then attenuated and filtered. The system achieves 32 -parallel output channels each sampled at 48 kS/s, with a 10 kHz bandwidth, 110 dB dynamic range and uV-level output noise...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the CERTS Microgrid Laboratory Test Bed project was to enhance the ease of integrating small energy sources into a microgrid. The project accomplished this objective by developing and demonstrating three advanced techniques, collectively {{referred to as the}} CERTS Microgrid concept, that significantly reduce the level of <b>custom</b> <b>field</b> engineering needed to operate microgrids consisting of small generating sources. The techniques comprising the CERTS Microgrid concept are: 1) a method for effecting automatic and seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded modes of operation; 2) an approach to electrical protection within the microgrid that does not depend on high fault currents; and 3) a method for microgrid control that achieves voltage and frequency stability under islanded conditions without requiring high-speed communications. The techniques were demonstrated at a full-scale test bed built near Columbus, Ohio and operated by American Electric Power. The testing fully confirmed earlier research that had been conducted initially through analytical simulations, then through laboratory emulations, and finally through factory acceptance testing of individual microgrid components. The islanding and resychronization method met all Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1547 and power quality requirements. The electrical protections system was able to distinguish between normal and faulted operation. The controls were found to be robust and under all conditions, including difficult motor starts. The results from these test are expected to lead to additional testing of enhancements to the basic techniques at the test bed to improve the business case for microgrid technologies, as well to field demonstrations involving microgrids that involve one or mroe of the CERTS Microgrid concepts...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{trichlorofluoromethane}} (C 1 ₃CF) as a refrigerant, aerosol-can propellant, and foam-blowing agent {{leads to}} the subsequent release of C 1 ₃CF into the atmosphere. During the mid- 1970 's, the build-up of C 1 ₃CF in the stratosphere resulted in much atmospheric research investigating {{the destruction of the}} earth's ozone layer by C 1 ₃CF. C 1 ₃CF enters the hydrologic cycle during precipitation. Hydrologic investigations led to the detection of C 1 ₃CF in ground water and postulation of C 1 ₃CF as a tracer and age dating technique. The Edwards Aquifer in the vicinity of San Antonio, Texas, was chosen as a test case for demonstration of C 1 ₃CF as an environmental tracer. The aquifer has been modeled for mass transport using extensive tritium measurements to calibrate and verify a discrete-state model (DSM). The DSM was the first successful attempt at modeling both flow and mass transport in that aquifer. Without changing the calibration, the DSM was used to model the input-output and predict the concentration of C 1 ₃CF in the aquifer. Field sampling of surface water, well discharge, springs, and the atmosphere was done in 1977 in order to compare actual with predicted results. C 1 ₃CF was measured using a <b>custom</b> <b>field</b> operable gas chromatograph (FOGC). The FOGC has a solute-stripping bottle, a backflushing column, a pulsed electron capture detector, and an automatic peak-window integrator. The theoretical detection limit is 10 ⁻⁴ grams per second. The FOGC was calibrated for a dynamic range of 0. 25 to 300 picograms, using a permeation tube and dynamic gas sampler. The FOGC can measure C 1 ₃CF in ground waterat concentrations of 0. 01 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) within 2 percent. Analysis and interpretation of the ground-water data indicated two distinct associations [...] regional data points and plume data points. The regional data points fell into two separate groups, those above and those below the lower calibration limit. The data points were high in the recharge areas, intermediate {{in the center of the}} aquifer, lower at the discharge points (springs), and below the calibration limit in areas of low circulation in the aquifer. Comparison of the regional data with other investigations indicates that the C 1 ₃CF technique works. The data points in the plume area indicate artificial introduction of C 1 ₃CF into the aquifer near San Antonio. The distribution of the concentrations follows the flow paths toward the springs and confirms the movement of ground water as determined from previous investigations utilizing other techniques. The artificial introduction of C 1 ₃CF may have been accidental or intentional. It appears that about 15 liters C 1 ₃CF would be required to produce the concentrations detected. Air sample concentrations of C 1 ₃CF (0. 42 pg/ml) were about half those reported for recent global measurements. Surface water concentrations of C 1 ₃CF (0. 12 pg/ml) were very close to recent global measurements (0. 13 pg/ml), but below the input to the model (0. 34 pg/ml). The data indicate that the C 1 ₃CF technique is workable in the Edwards Aquifer and should be in other systems containing water recharged during the last 30 years. The consistency of the data indicates that the technique probably is more usable than tritium because of the much simpler input function. The FOGC is appealing because of its portability, low cost, and ease of operation...|$|E
