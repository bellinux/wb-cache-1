5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had {{turned against the}} Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though the evidence was circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. <b>Certain</b> <b>he</b> would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E
25|$|His {{contribution}} to the canal system was huge, and since {{he was responsible for}} three of the four longest canal tunnels built, he was probably the first great tunnelling engineer.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the original fortress was probably ordered by King Canute I, although this is not totally <b>certain.</b> <b>He</b> reigned 1167–1195 and had fortresses built on the Swedish east coast as defence against enemies {{from the other side}} of the Baltic Sea. During the 13th to 15th centuries, additions and changes were made. For example, new towers were built, and a new and thicker wall was constructed. The fortress was damaged on a number of occasions during these centuries, including in 1361, when King Valdemar IV (Atterdag) of Denmark attacked Borgholm.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having {{problems}} with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724 a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In {{the first week of}} October, restless and <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects.

Based on the photograph, the China Daily later reported that the Great Wall {{can be seen from}} 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look. However, the resolution of a camera can be much higher than the human visual system, and the optics much better, rendering photographic evidence irrelevant to the issue of whether it is visible to the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|Although {{technically}} {{an appeal}} {{is required for}} the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may walk off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand his ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where he considers he might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where {{it is not clear whether}} the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that he is out, if in his own mind he is <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> was out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanlike behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Boyer {{told the}} police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She claimed that after they left a local nightclub together, she had {{repeatedly}} requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She claimed that once {{in one of the}} motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a moment, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She claimed that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called police.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September, Haig met General Hubert Gough (Fifth Army) and General Herbert Plumer (Second Army) {{to explain}} his intentions. After the {{victories}} of 20 and 26 September, the fine weather, the disarray of the German defenders and the limited prospect of German reinforcements from the Russian front, Haig decided that the attack on 4 October would conclude the period of strictly limited advances. The following step would be a deeper advance, with provision made for exploitation. Haig wanted reserve formations of infantry, artillery, cavalry and tanks {{to be ready to}} extend a successful attack. Gough and Plumer replied {{over the next couple of}} days, that they felt that Haig's proposals were premature and that exploitation would not be feasible until Passchendaele ridge had been captured from Passchendaele northwards to Westroosebeke. Gough and Plumer thought that this would probably take two more steps at three-day intervals and then another four days to repair roads over the captured ground. Haig considered that although a collapse of the German defence was a condition for exploitation of the attack due on 10 October which was not <b>certain,</b> <b>he</b> desired the arrangements to be made, since they would be available for a later date.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September, Sir Douglas Haig had met Plumer and the Fifth Army {{commander}} General Hubert Gough {{to explain}} his intentions, {{in view of the}} victories of 20 and 26 September, the fine weather, disarray among the German defenders and the limited prospect of German reinforcements arriving from the Russian front. Haig judged that the next attack, due on 6 October, would conclude the period of strictly limited advances. The following step would be a deeper advance, with provision made for exploitation. Haig wanted XV Corps on the Belgian coast and the amphibious force of Operation Hush readied, in case of a general withdrawal by the Germans. Reserve formations of infantry, artillery, cavalry and tanks were to be made ready behind the Fifth and Second armies, to exploit a successful attack. Gough and Plumer replied {{over the next couple of}} days, that they felt that the proposals were premature and that exploitation would not be feasible until Passchendaele ridge had been captured as far as Westroosebeke. Capturing the ridge would probably take two more steps at three-day intervals, followed by another four days to repair roads over the captured ground. Haig explained that although exploitation of the attack due on 10 October was not <b>certain,</b> <b>he</b> desired the arrangements to be made since they could be used at a later date.|$|E

500|$|Thorpe's {{relatively}} peaceful interlude {{ended in}} October 1977 when Newton, released from prison, sold {{his story to}} the London Evening News. Newton's claim {{that he had been}} paid [...] "by a leading Liberal" [...] to kill Scott caused a sensation, and led to a prolonged police investigation. [...] Throughout this period Thorpe endeavoured to continue his public life, in and out of parliament. [...] In the House of Commons on 1 August 1978, when it appeared <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> would face criminal charges, he asked the Attorney-General what sum of capital possessed by an applicant would prevent him from receiving legal aid. The next day he made his final speech in the House, during a debate on Rhodesia.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe {{accepted}} {{the invitation of}} his local party to fight the North Devon seat, {{against the advice of}} friends who were <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> would lose. His campaign was largely ignored by the national party; of its leading figures only John Pardoe, the MP for North Cornwall visited the constituency. Thorpe, supported by his wife, his mother and some loyal friends, fought hard, although much of his characteristic vigour was missing. He lost to his Conservative opponent by 8,500 votes. Overall, the Conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Afterwards, Thorpe confessed to the Daily Mail that he had not [...] "expected to get hammered. You never do". The Liberal Party's share of the national vote fell to 13.8%, and its total seats from 13 to 11. [...] Dutton attributes much of the fall in the Liberal vote to the lengthy adverse publicity generated by the Thorpe affair.|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon's {{impetus to}} create [...] "Hush" [...] was his {{reaction}} to hearing that the primary reason behind Buffys success was the dialogue. He {{felt that he was}} stagnating as a director, turning into a [...] "hack" [...] by making formulaic episodes. Whedon tended to concentrate so much on the visual aspects of the series' production that he was chastised by Fox executives in earlier seasons. Thus, writing and producing [...] "Hush" [...] depended almost solely on visuals and not on dialogue, a prospect that Whedon found terrifying, worried that viewers would find the episode boring. Much like the fourth-season finale [...] "Restless"—which consisted almost entirely of dream sequences—and the sixth season musical [...] "Once More, with Feeling", Whedon was <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> would fail at attempting to present the show in such a novel way. Initially, this was to be the episode where Riley and Buffy have sex, and Whedon took comfort in that plan because he knew people would not mind the silence, but ultimately he decided it was too early for the characters to sleep together, and he scrapped the idea.|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers.

When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was <b>certain</b> <b>he</b> would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would tell him he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious.

500|$|The {{sight of}} the {{approaching}} Allied line forced Soult's hand—if Cole's division was not stopped, defeat was <b>certain.</b> <b>He</b> sent four regiments of Latour-Maubourg's dragoons to charge the Portuguese section of Cole's line, and committed the whole of Werlé's reserve to protect VCorps' flank. [...] The dragoons swept down on Harvey's Portuguese brigade fully expecting to destroy it as they had Colborne's. The inexperienced Portuguese, however, stood firm and drove away the cavalry without even forming square. Having once been repulsed, Latour-Maubourg's dragoons made no further attack on Cole's division, and the Allied line marched on. The Fusilier brigade and Lusitanian Legion on the division's left soon encountered Werlé's brigade, which outnumbered them two to one. [...] Despite his advantage in numbers, Werlé had formed his nine battalions into three columns of regiments, and could not bring as many muskets to bear as the Allies. Three separate regimental musket duels ensued, as the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers and the two battalions of the 7th Fusiliers each took on a column. [...] During the fire-fight the French tried once more to extend into line, but as before the concentrated Allied fire prevented their deployment. After 20–30 minutes of bitter conflict they finally broke and ran. [...] The Fusiliers had lost more than half their numbers, mainly to artillery fire, while Werlé's brigade had suffered 1,800 casualties.|$|E
