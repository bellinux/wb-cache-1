50|$|A {{justice of}} the peace, in making a {{determination}} as to whether there is reasonable cause to believe that someone is apparently suffering from a mental disorder of the sort described in section 16, is performing a judicial function and, as such, is not a <b>compellable</b> <b>witness</b> where summonsed to testify at a coroner's inquest.|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the effect of}} the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the rule of spousal incompetency in criminal proceedings. The rule is arguably under-inclusive, in that it is not available to protect opposite-sex couples who are not legally married or same-sex couples; on the other hand, the rule is arguably offensive to the modem conception of marriage. The Charter arguments for each of these positions are considered, and it is submitted that the Charter requires the rule of spousal incompetency, whatever it is, to apply equally to legally married couples, to cohabitants, and to same-sex couples. A rule of spousal incompetency that arguably reconciles the modem conception of marriage with the interest protected by the rule of spousal incompetency is then considered. This rule would make the spouse a competent but not <b>compellable</b> <b>witness</b> for the prosecution. Various considerations of law and policy militate against giving the spouse this decision; the real choice is between maintaining the existing rule of incompetency and making the spouse competent and compellable for the Crown. It is submitted that the arguments on either side of this choice are so evenly balanced that any change should be made by Parliament rather than by the courts...|$|E
5000|$|Distinguishing Leach, the Court of Criminal Appeal held in R v Lapworth (1930) that spouses were {{nevertheless}} <b>compellable</b> <b>witnesses</b> for {{the prosecution}} in cases of personal violence, {{on the basis that}} the common law position prior to the 1898 Act had not been unaffected by its entry into law. However, in Hoskyn v Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1978) the House of Lords overruled Lapworth, ending the personal violence exception in favour of spouses being competent but not <b>compellable</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{for the prosecution}} in all cases. In reaching this view, judges were swayed by the special status of marriage, and the [...] "natural repugnance" [...] that the public would feel at seeing a wife give evidence against her husband {{in a wide range of}} scenarios.|$|R
25|$|On 27 February 2012 Andrea Gilroy, David Gilroy's wife, {{was cited}} as a witness by the Crown. As she took the stand, the trial judge Lord Bracadale {{explained}} {{that she had the}} right not to give evidence against her husband if she did not wish. She declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an accused person in Scotland, are competent and <b>compellable</b> <b>witnesses</b> for the prosecution.|$|R
40|$|In 1986 the Australian Law Reform Commission {{found that}} Aboriginal spouses who married {{traditionally}} were <b>compellable</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{against each other}} in criminal trials, despite the privileging of spouses as non‐compellable within the common law. The basis of this was that they were not recognised as husbands and wives according to the laws of evidence. The Commission argued that failure to extend the common law rule of inter‐spousal non‐compellability to traditional spouses gave the impression that the law cared only about the stability of Marriage Act (1961) marriages, despite the continuing importance of traditional marriages. This article traces a debate about the compellability of Aboriginal spouses (wives) back to 1930 s and 40 s Australia. Seeing this as symptomatic of the legal injustices faced by Indigenous people, humanitarians and white women reformers were calling for human rights and legal equality. Now, the Law Reform Commission is arguing that the way to ensure this is to first recognise customary law. Then, reformers came up against a bureaucracy and legal fraternity prepared to recognise neither Indigenous customary law, Indigenous women’s legal equality nor human rights. 16 page(s...|$|R
