50|$|Most {{scientists}} believe that this <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> caused the major extinction event that took place during this time. In fact, the Hirnantian (also known as the End Ordovician and the Ordovician-Silurian) mass extinction event represents the second largest such event in geologic history. Approximately 85% of marine (sea-dwelling) species died. Only the End Permian mass extinction was larger. Unlike many smaller extinction events, however, the long-term consequences of the End Ordovician event were relatively small. Following the <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation,</b> the climate returned to its previous state, and the species that survived soon (within two or three million years) evolved into species {{very similar to the}} ones that existed before.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> and {{sea level}} changes leading to contraction {{and expansion of}} the tropical rain contributed to the extinction and genetic divergence of species in the region.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{there was}} a major <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> during the Hirnantian, which is believed to have caused a major mass extinction event. When the Hirnantian stage began, the Earth's climate was hot and sea-levels were substantially higher than today. The seas were filled with a diverse fauna. However, there is considerable evidence to indicate that many of these species were already in trouble when the Hirnantian began, and that overall biological diversity was already in sharp decline.|$|E

50|$|Australia {{separated}} from Gondwana 99 Ma, and initially remained warm and humid with rainforest vegetation. Inland Australia had systems of {{rivers and lakes}} with abundant wildlife. Fossil birds, platypus, frogs and snakes are present from this period. From 30 Ma {{there was a period}} of global cooling, and from 15 Ma the Antarctic ice sheet formed. Sand deserts and large inland salt lakes formed within the last 5 Ma. <b>Climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> during the Pleistocene over the last million years led to repeated phases of glaciation with lower sea levels that linked Australia to New Guinea, and warmer interglacial periods with higher sea levels.|$|E
40|$|Background: The Pleistocene <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations</b> are {{considered}} as a major driving force of intraspecific divergence and speciation. During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates {{the consequences of the}} <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations</b> on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations</b> can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations</b> on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillations</b> can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization. © 2013 Lecocq et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

50|$|The shallowness of {{the links}} between the Bras d'Or Lake and the Atlantic Ocean have {{resulted}} in a complex post-glacial history. Final melting of glacial ice probably occurred about 10,000 years after the Younger Dryas <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation.</b> The first sediments deposited above glacial till in {{the central part of the}} lake, probably 10,000 to 9,000 years ago, contain dinocysts that indicate some penetration of marine water into the lake. The relatively high sea level inferred at this time reflects the continuing depression of the land from loading by glacial ice. Rebound from this depression cut off marine-water influx from about 9,000 to 4,500 years ago. As a result, for many thousands of years the Bras d'Or Lakes were fresh and relatively stable in size, water level and shoreline and were divided into a series of smaller lakes connected by rivers. East Bay was for the most part dry land during this period but the deeper area in the western part of the present bay was even then a significant bay off the main body of the largest of these lakes. Well-preserved and recognizable submerged coastal landforms are common in this part of East Bay. Clearly discernible tombolos, spits, and barrier beaches are present at this former coastline, 25 - 23 m below present lake water levels. To the east, the present deep section of the bay east of the McPhee Islands was also a small lake, separated from the other lakes by a section of dry land, connected by a stream.Late Holocene subsidence resulted in a renewed influx of marine water in the last 4,500 years. The effects of this subsidence are seen in the transgressive character of many of the shoreline features.|$|E

BP from sediment sequences of Lakes Accesa in Tuscany (north-central Italy) and Maliq (Albania) in the central Mediterranean. The available data {{make it possible to}} recognise a tripartite <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> between c. 4300 – 3800 cal. BP. A phase characterised by drier conditions at c. 4100 – 3950 cal. BP appears to have been bracketed by two phases marked by wetter conditions and dated to c. 4300 – 4100 and 3950 – 3850 cal. BP, respectively. The deposition of theAvellino tephra occurred during the first humid phase, slightly before 4300 cal. BP, and that of an interplinian tephra AP 2 -AP 4 (or Pr 1) around 4050 cal. BP during the dry intermediate phase. This dry median episode {{may be related to the}} so-called ‘ 4. 2 ka event’ observed in tropical areas as well as in northwestern Italy. A comparison of the Accesa lake-level record with palaeoclimatic terrestrial and marine records suggests that this complex <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> around 4300 – 3800 cal.

40|$|The present earth {{warming up}} is often {{explained}} by the atmosphere gas greenhouse effect. This explanation is in contradiction with the thermodynamics second law. The warming up by greenhouse effect is quite improbable. It is cloud reflection that gives to the earth s ground its 15 degres C mean temperature. Since {{the reflection of the}} radiation by gases is negligible, the role of the atmosphere greenhouse gases in the earth warming up by earth radiation reflection loses its importance. We think that natural climatic oscillations contribute more to earth climatic disturbances. The oscillation that we hypothesize to exist has a long period (800 to 1000 years). The glacier melting and regeneration cycles lead to variations in the cold region ocean water density and thermal conductibility according to their salinity. These variations lead one to think about a macro climate oscillating between maximum hot and minimum cold temperatures. This oscillation is materialized by the passages of the planet through hot, mild, and cold eras, leading to the great season <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> phenomenon (GSCO). Thus, our planet lives four great seasons a great spring, a great summer, a great winter and a great autumn/fall, making a great year embracing our four small classical yearly seasons. The probabilistic character of the parameters that are at the origin of this <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> makes the long-term prediction less precise but the deterministic tendencies and the resonance phenomena give precious information on our planet climatic future. The present warming up is well interpreted in the frame of the great season <b>climatic</b> <b>oscillation</b> theory. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table...|$|E
