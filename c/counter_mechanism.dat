40|$|Abstract — The {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunications}} system uti-lizes a three-level location-management strategy {{to reduce the}} net costs of location update and paging in the packet-switched service domain. Within a communication session, a mobile station (MS) is tracked at the cell level during packet transmission. In the idle period of an ongoing session, the MS is tracked at the UTRAN registration area (URA) level to avoid frequent cell updates while still keeping the radio connection. If the MS is not in any com-munication session, the MS is tracked at the routing-area (RA) level. The inactivity <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> was proposed in 3 GPP 25. 331 to determine when to switch between the three location-tracking modes. In this mechanism, two inactivity counters are used to count the numbers of cell and URA updates in an idle pe-riod between two packet transmissions. If the number of cell up-dates reaches a threshold 1, the MS is switched from cell tracking to URA tracking.

In accordance with this observation, ectopic expression of IMP 1 severely diminishes Rev-dependent expression of CAT enzyme and disturbs HIV- 1 RNA expression by causing accumulation of the multiple spliced viral RNA. Results of mutagenesis analysis further reveal that the KH 4 domain represents the key element of IMP 1 in modulating HIV- 1 RNA expression.

However, with this increased openness, the fear of rogue programs written to propagate from one phone to another becomes ever more real.

The counter-mechanism continually extracts a social relationship graph between mobile phones via {{an analysis of the}} network traffic. As {{people are more likely to}} open and download content that they receive from friends, this social relationship graph is representative of the most likely propagation path of a mobile worm.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} achieve high {{end-to-end}} throughput in a multihop wireless ad hoc network, TD/CDMA has been chosen as the Medium Access Control (MAC) scheme due to its support for high network throughput in a multihop environment. The associated power control and scheduling problem {{needs to be addressed}} to optimize the operations of TD/CDMA. In this paper, cluster based architecture is introduced to provide centralized control within clusters, and the corresponding power control and scheduling schemes are derived to maximize a network utility function and guarantee the minimum rate required by each traffic session. Because the resulted optimal power control reveals bang-bang characteristics, i. e., scheduled nodes transmit with full power while other nodes remain silent, the joint power control and scheduling problem is reduced to a scheduling problem. In {{order to achieve}} a balance between throughput and fairness, proportional fair scheduling is considered. The multi-link version of the proportional fair scheduling algorithms for multihop wireless ad hoc networks are proposed. In addition, a generic token <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> is employed to satisfy the minimum rate requirements. Approximation algorithms are suggested to reduce the computational complexity. In networks that are lack of centralized control, distributed scheduling algorithms are also derived and fully distributed implementation is provided.

40|$|Cryptographic puzzles are {{promising}} techniques for mitigating DDoS attacks via decreasing the incoming rate of service eligible requests. However, existing cryptographic puzzle techniques have several shortcomings {{that make them}} less appealing {{as a tool of}} choice for DDoS defense. These shortcomings include: (1) the lack of accurate models for dynamically determining puzzle hardness; (2) the lack of an efficient and effective <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> for puzzle solution replay attacks; and (3) the wastefulness of the puzzle computations in terms of the clients' computational resources. In this thesis, we provide a puzzle based DDoS defense framework that addresses these shortcomings. Our puzzle framework includes three novel puzzle mechanisms. The first mechanism, called Puzzle+, provides a mathematical model of per-request puzzle hardness. Through extensive experimental study, we show that this model optimizes the effectiveness of puzzle based DDoS mitigation while enabling tight control over the server utilization. In addition, Puzzle+ disables puzzle solution replay attacks by utilizing a novel cache algorithm to detect replays. The second puzzle mechanism, called Productive Puzzles, alleviates the wastefulness of computational puzzles by transforming the puzzle computations into computations of meaningful tasks that provide utility. Our third puzzle mechanism, called Guided Tour Puzzles, eliminates the wasteful puzzle computations all together, and adopts a novel delay-based puzzle construction idea. In addition, it is not affected by the disparity in the computational resources of the client machines that perform the puzzle computations. Through measurement analysis on real network testbeds as well as extensive simulation study, we show that both Productive Puzzles and Guided Tour Puzzles achieve effective mitigation of DDoS attacks while satisfying no wasteful computation requirement. Lastly, we introduce a novel queue management algorithm, called Stochastic Fair Drop Queue (SFDQ), to further strengthen the DDoS protection provided by the puzzle framework. SFDQ is not only effective against DDoS attacks at multiple layers of the protocol stack, it is also simple to configure and deploy. SFDQ is implemented over a novel data structure, called Indexed Linked List, to provide enqueue, dequeue, and remove operations with O(1) time complexity...|$|E

The convergence of the wireless evolutionary systems and the Internet aims to offer seamless IP multimedia services to mobile hosts across a variety of heterogeneous access technologies such as UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, Wireless LANs and emerging 4 G systems. This will meet the demands of both enterprise and public environments, anywhere and anytime. One of the research challenges for next-generation all-IP wireless systems is the design of the intelligent mobility management techniques that take advantage of IP-based technologies to achieve global roaming among heterogeneous networks. This thesis addresses mobility management issues in the evolving all-IP wireless networks, namely beyond 3 G networks, with particular-emphasis on inter-system handover management and location management. The cross-layer solutions for vertical handover management are considered with special focus on seamless IP Multimedia service continuity. A novel cross-layer signalling design is proposed to enable the communication between Mobile IP and SIP, which enhances the mobility support for real time multimedia services in pure IP wireless networks. Having carefully investigated the seamless IP Multimedia service continuity support in UMTS-WLAN interworking scenarios, an improved cross-layer solution is proposed and analysed, which is designed for better coordination between the link layer, network layer and application layer. The location management strategies in UMTS and future networks are studied. An improved local anchor scheme is proposed for UMTS networks for reducing the signalling cost.

40|$|Prostaglandins (PG) are {{ubiquitous}} lipid mediators {{that play}} key roles in pathophysiological responses to infections. They {{are considered to}} have both pro and anti-inflammatory roles depending upon the time of inflammation, the receptors that they bind to and the tissues that they act upon. Hence given their pleiotropic effects, a perfect balance between the pro and anti-inflammatory functions of PGs are required {{to ensure that a}} controlled timely immune response is elicited to mediate protection and to avoid immunopathology. PGD 2 is one such PG that was reported to increase with age in the lungs of mice and to mediate an anti-inflammatory effect thereby blunting the immune response following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Increase in PGD 2 with age incapacitates respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to migrate from lungs to the draining lymph node following SARS-CoV infection due to down regulation of CCR 7 (a receptor for chemokines CCL 19 / 21). Migration of rDCs to draining lymph nodes requires high expression of CCR 7 and it 2 ̆ 7 s binding to CCL 19 / 21, a chemokine that mediates migration of dendritic cells along its gradient. Although increase in levels of PGD 2 might prove beneficial in high inflammatory conditions, {{it should be noted that}} high levels of such a potent anti-inflammatory mediator during the initiation of an immune response could prove detrimental. In chapter II of this thesis I show that age-related increases in oxidative stress result in the upregulation of a single phospholipase (PLA 2) group II D (G 2 D) (PLA 2 G 2 D) with anti-inflammatory roles. PLA 2 G 2 D functions by releasing Arachidonic acid (AA) from the lipid membrane, which will be further metabolized to other pro-resolving/ anti-inflammatory lipid mediators including PGD 2. I show that inducing oxidative stress in young mice as well as in human peripheral blood macrophages, results in the upregulation of PLA 2 G 2 D (probably as a <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> against oxidative stress). Also increase in the expression levels of this gene during the course of SARS-CoV infection results in the upregulation of PGD 2, which is completely abrogated in Pla 2 g 2 d-/- mice.

PGD 2 is also a major PG in the brain and its role has been investigated in many non-infectious setting such as stroke and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 disease. The PGD 2 binding to one of its receptors DP 1 has been shown to have primarily a neuro-protective role.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{allocation of}} power {{is a major concern}} in today’s wireless communications systems. Due to the high demand in data rate and the scarcity of wireless resources such as power, the multi-user communication systems like the multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC) have become highly competitive environments for the users as well as the system itself. Theory of microeconomics and game theory provide the good analytical manner for the selfish and social welfare conflict problems. Instead of maximizing the system sum rate, our proposed system deals with fulfilling the utility (rate) requirement of all the users with efficient power allocation. The users formulate the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) based quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. We propose the framework to allocate the power to each user with universal pricing mechanisms. The prices act as the control signal and are assumed to be some virtual currency in the wireless system. They can influence the physical layer operating points to meet the desired utility requirements. Centralized and distributed power allocation frameworks are discussed separately in the thesis with different pricing schemes. In wireless systems we have users that are rational in the game theoretic sense of making decisions consistently in pursuit of their own individual objectives. Each user’s objective is to maximize the expected value of its own payoff measured on a certain utility scale. Selfishness or self-interest is an important implication of rationality. Therefore, the mobiles which share the same spectrum have incentives to misinterpret their private information in order to obtain more utility. They might behave selfishly and show also malicious behavior by creating increased interference for other mobiles. Therefore, it is important to supervise and influence the operation of the system by pricing and priority (weights) optimization. In the centralized resource allocation, we study the general MAC and BC (with linear and nonlinear receiver) with three types of agents: the regulator, the system optimizer and the mobile users. The regulator ensures the QoS requirements of all users by clever pricing and prevents cheating. The simple system optimizer solves a certain system utility maximization problem to allocate the power with the given prices and weights (priorities). The linear and nonlinear pricing mechanisms are analyzed, respectively. It is shown that linear pricing is a universal pricing only if successive interference cancellation (SIC) for uplink transmission or dirty paper coding (DPC) for downlink transmission is applied at the base station (BS). For MAC without SIC, nonlinear pricing which is logarithmic in power and linear in prices is a universal pricing scheme. The prices, the resulting cost terms, the optimal power allocation to achieve the QoS requirement of each user in the feasible rate region are derived in closed form solutions for MAC with and without SIC using linear and nonlinear pricing frameworks, respectively. The users are willing to maximize their achievable rate and minimize their cost on power by falsely reporting their channel state information (CSI). By predicting the best cheating strategy of the malicious users, the regulator is able to detect the misbehavior and punish the cheaters. The infinite repeated game (RG) is proposed as a <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> with the trigger strategy using the trigger price. We show that by anticipating the total payoff of the proposed RG, the users have no incentive to cheat and therefore our framework is strategy-proof. In the distributed resource allocation, each user allocates its own power by optimizing the individual utility function. The noncooperative game among the users is formulated. The individual prices are introduced to the utility function of each user to shift the Nash equilibrium (NE) power allocation to the desired point. We show that by implicit control of the proposed prices, the best response (BR) power allocation of each user converges rapidly. The Shannon rate-based QoS requirement of each user is achieved with minimum power at the unique NE point. We analyse different behavior types of the users, especially the malicious behavior of misrepresenting the user utility function. The resulting NE power allocation and achievable rates of all users are derived when malicious behavior exists. The strategy-proof mechanism is designed using the punishment prices when the types of the malicious users are detected. The algorithm of the strategy-proof noncooperative game is proposed. We illustrate the convergence of the BR dynamic and the Price of Malice (PoM) by numerical simulations. The uplink transmission within the single cell of heterogeneous networks is exactly the same model as MAC. Therefore, the results of the pricing-based power allocation for MAC can be implemented into heterogeneous networks. Femtocells deployed in the Macrocell network provide better indoor coverage to the user equipments (UEs) with low power consumption and maintenance cost. The industrial vendors show great interest in the access mode, called the hybrid access, in which the macrocell UEs (MUEs) can be served by the nearby Femtocell Access Point (FAP). By adopting hybrid access in the femtocell, the system energy efficiency is improved due to the short distance between the FAP and MUEs while at the same time, the QoS requirements are better guaranteed. However, both the Macrocell base station (MBS) and the FAP are rational and selfish, who maximize their own utilities. The framework to successively apply the hybrid access in femtocell and fulfill the QoS requirement of each UE is important. We propose two novel compensation frameworks to motivate the hybrid access of femtocells. To save the energy consumption, the MBS is willing to motivate the FAP for hybrid access with compensation. The Stackelberg game is formulated where the MBS serves as the leader and the FAP serves as the follower. The MBS maximizes its utility by choosing the compensation prices. The FAP optimizes its utility by selecting the number of MUEs in hybrid access. By choosing the proper compensation price, the optimal number of MUEs served by the FAP to maximize the utility of the MBS coincides with that to maximize the utility of the FAP. Numerous simulation results are conducted, showing that the proposed compensation frameworks result in a win-win solution. In this thesis, based on game theory, mechanism design and pricing framework, efficient power allocation are proposed to guarantee the QoS requirements of all users in the wireless networks. The results are applicable in the multi-user systems such as heterogeneous networks. Both centralized and distributed allocation schemes are analyzed which are suitable for different communication scenarios.

Es wird ein Framework entworfen, um die Leistungsallokation mittels universellen Pricing-Mechanismen umzusetzen. In der Dissertation werden zentralisierte und verteilte Leistungsallokationsalgorithmen unter Verwendung verschiedener Pricing-Ansätze diskutiert. Die Nutzer in Funksystemen handeln rational im spieltheoretischen Sinne, indem sie ihre eigenen Nutzenfunktionen maximieren. Die mobilen Endgeräte, die dasselbe Spektrum nutzen, haben den Anreiz durch bewusste Fehlinterpretation ihrer privaten Informationen das eigene Ergebnis zu verbessern. Daher ist es wichtig, die Funktionalität des Systems zu überwachen und durch Optimierung des Pricings und Priorisierungsgewichte zu beeinflussen. Für den zentralisierten Ressourcenallokationsansatz werden der allgemeine Mehrfachzugriffskanal (Multiple Access Channel, MAC) und der Broadcastkanal (BC) mit linearen bzw. nichtlinearen Empfängern untersucht. Die Preise, die resultierenden Kostenterme und die optimale Leistungsallokation, mit der die QoS-Anforderungen in der zulässigen Ratenregion erfüllt werden, werden in geschlossener Form hergeleitet. Lineare und nichtlineare Pricing-Ansätze werden separat diskutiert. Das unendlich oft wiederholte Spiel wird vorgeschlagen, um Spieler vom Betrügen durch Übermittlung falscher Kanalinformationen abzuhalten. Für die verteilten Ressourcenvergabe wird das nichtkooperative Spiel in Normalform verwendet und formuliert. Die Nutzer wählen ihre Sendeleistung zur Maximierung ihrer eigenen Nutzenfunktion. Individuelle Preise werden eingeführt und so angepasst, dass die QoS-Anforderungen mit der Leistungsallokation im eindeutigen Nash-Gleichgewicht erfüllt werden. Verschiedene Arten des Nutzerverhaltens werden bezüglich der Täuschung ihrer Nutzenfunktion analysiert, und ein Strategy-Proof-Mechanismus mit Strafen wird entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse für den MAC sind anwendbar auf heterogene Netzwerke, wobei zwei neuartige Ansätze zur Kompensation bereitgestellt werden, die den hybriden Zugang zu Femtozell-Netzwerken motivieren. Mithilfe des Stackelberg-Spiels wird gezeigt, dass die vorgeschlagenen Ansätze in einer Win-Win-Situation resultieren...|$|E

50|$|The main {{mechanism}} of action for anatoxin-a(S) is by irreversibly inhibiting the active site of acetylcholinesterase leading to excess acetylcholine in the parasympathetic and peripheral nervous systems; inducing poisoning via nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation. Treatment of afflicted case by atropine has attested to suppress the muscarinic mediated toxicity; which prevents the namesake salivation that similarly reacts to prevent the toxin's other poisoning symptoms which include lacrimation, urinary incontinence and defecation. Atropine will not, however, <b>counter</b> another <b>mechanism</b> of the compounds toxicity as it also mediates a nicotinic adverse toxicity affecting muscle tremors, fasciculation, convulsions and respiratory failure.|$|R
40|$|Chronic mucosal {{inflammation}} {{is associated}} with a greater risk of gastric cancer (GC) and, therefore, requires tight control by suppressive <b>counter</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Gastrokine- 2 (GKN 2) belongs to a family of secreted proteins expressed within normal gastric mucosal cells. GKN 2 expression is frequently lost during GC progression, suggesting an inhibitory role; however, a causal link remains unsubstantiated. Here, we developed Gkn 2 knockout and transgenic overexpressing mice to investigate the functional impact of GKN 2 loss in GC pathogenesis. In mouse models of GC, decreased GKN 2 expression correlated with gastric pathology that paralleled human GC progression. At baseline, Gkn 2 knockout mice exhibited defective gastric epithelial differentiation but not malignant progression. Conversely, Gkn 2 knockout in the IL- 11 /STAT 3 -dependent gp 130 [superscript F/F] GC model caused tumorigenesis of the proximal stomach. Additionally, gastric immunopathology was accelerated in Helicobacter pylori–infected Gkn 2 knockout mice and was associated with augmented T helper cell type 1 (Th 1) but not Th 17 immunity. Heightened Th 1 responses in Gkn 2 knockout mice were linked to deregulated mucosal innate immunity and impaired myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Finally, transgenic overexpression of human gastrokines (GKNs) attenuated gastric tumor growth in gp 130 [superscript F/F] mice. Together, these results reveal an antiinflammatory role for GKN 2, provide in vivo evidence that links GKN 2 loss to GC pathogenesis, and suggest GKN restoration as a strategy to restrain GC progression...|$|R
40|$|Microarray {{analysis}} was used to identify genes whose expression in the mammary gland of Holstein-Friesian dairy cows was affected by the nonconservative Ala to Lys amino acid substitution at position 232 in exon VIII of the diacylglycerol-O-transferase 1 (DGAT 1) gene. Mammary gland biopsies of 9 homozygous Ala cows, 13 heterozygous cows (Ala/Lys), and 4 homozygous Lys cows in midlactation were taken. Microarray ANOVA and factor analysis for multiple testing methods were used as statistical methods to associate the expression level of the genes present on Affymetrix bovine genome arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with the DGAT 1 gene polymorphism. The data was also analyzed at the level of functional modules by gene set enrichment analysis. In this small-scale experimental setting, DGAT 1 gene polymorphism did not modify milk yield and composition significantly, although expected changes occurred in the yields of C 14 : 0, cis- 9 C 16 : 1, and long-chain fatty acids. Diacylglycerol-O-transferase 1 gene polymorphism affected the expression of 30 annotated genes related to cell growth, proliferation, and development, remodeling of the tissue, cell signaling and immune system response. Furthermore, the main affected functional modules were related to energy metabolism (lipid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, citrate cycle, and propanoate metabolism), protein degradation (proteosome-ubiquitin pathways), and the immune system. We hypothesize that the observed differences in transcriptional activity reflect <b>counter</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of mammary gland tissue to respond to changes in milk fatty acid concentration or composition, or bot...|$|R
