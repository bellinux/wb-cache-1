Two approaches to <b>the</b> probabilistic <b>uncertainty</b> analysis of FRFs are developed. <b>The</b> first <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in <b>the</b> response at discrete frequencies, giving pointwise <b>uncertainty</b> intervals. <b>The</b> second <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in an entire FRF across a frequency range, giving an <b>uncertainty</b> envelope function. <b>The</b> methods are demonstrated and compared to alternative approaches in a practical case study...|$|R

50|$|Lasso is able {{to achieve}} both of these goals by forcing {{the sum of the}} {{absolute}} value of the regression coefficients to be less than a fixed value, which forces certain coefficients to be set to zero, effectively choosing a simpler model that does not include those coefficients. This idea is similar to ridge regression, in which the sum of the squares of the coefficients is forced to be less than a fixed value, though in the case of ridge regression, this only shrinks the size of the coefficients, it does not set any of them to zero. However, data is expensive; models performing the complete selection of coefficients (setting them to zero) can ignore irrelevant information from datasets. Probabilistic approaches that penalize, and select regression coefficient based on the information from the data combined with prior knowledge (Multilevel Bayesian LASSO) may outperform the classical LASSO model, given that all information are used <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the data, instead of simply setting them directly to zero.|$|E

A significant figure, since individuals over 5 m are considered rare, making the Bhitarkanika Park a suitable habitat for large individuals.

50|$|The {{future of}} ringed seal {{populations in the}} Arctic and Sub Arctic is uncertain, but two main {{projections}} surface based around habitat and predators. The first projection focuses on the direct {{effects of climate change}} on sea-ice and the limited environment that it will provide the ringed seal with. The majority of past research has been focused around this main idea of quicker melting sea ice leading to lower ringed seal populations from lack of breeding areas. Yet what most research has not also taken into account is the quick drop in polar bear populations. As the main predator to ringed seals, the polar bear’s extinction in the coming years will allow for ringed seal populations to flourish. In the end, ringed seals are estimated to thrive with no polar bears present in the Arctic and Sub Arctic. Although this predator factor is involved with more recent research, it does not necessarily mean this will be the outcome, <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in such projections. Overall, ringed seals populations will fluctuate regardless of each potential outcome and climate change is certain to affect not only the ringed seal but all Arctic and Sub Arctic animal populations.|$|E
50|$|Humanist ecology {{naturally}} favours {{the permanent}} adaptation {{and the best}} possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the human mind, any representation belongs to the domain of belief, <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with belief but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This school of thought accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.|$|E

Since the peak EWT value is about 34 mm/yr in Fig.  4 b and 24 mm/yr in Fig.  4 a, that means the differences between the peak EWT value in Fig.  4 a, b are larger than their uncertainties and thus enough to be resolved.
