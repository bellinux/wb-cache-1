50|$|Paper <b>credentials</b> are {{documents}} that {{attest to the}} identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called {{the subject of the}} <b>credentials.</b> Some common paper <b>credentials</b> include passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards.

40|$|Abstract. Anonymous <b>credential</b> system promise efficient, {{ubiquitous}} {{access to}} digital services while preserving user privacy. However, their diffusion is impaired {{by the lack}} of efficient revocation techniques. Traditional <b>credential</b> revocation measures based on certificate revocation lists or online certification authorities do not provide privacy and cannot be used in privacy-sensitive contexts. Existing revocation techniques specifically geared towards anonymous <b>credential</b> systems are more involved – for the <b>credential</b> issuer, users, as wells as <b>credential</b> consumers – as users have to prove that their <b>credential</b> is still valid, e. g., not included in a revocation list. We introduce a novel, non-interactive technique to update issuer-controlled attributes of anonymous <b>credentials.</b> Revocation is implemented by encoding the validity time of a <b>credential</b> into one of these attributes. With the proposed protocol, <b>credential</b> issuers can periodically update valid <b>credentials</b> off-line and publish a small per-credential update value on a public bulletin-board. Users can later download their values and re-validate their <b>credentials</b> to prove possession of a valid <b>credential</b> for the current time period. Our solution outperforms all prior solutions for <b>credential</b> revocation in terms of communication and computational costs for the users and <b>credentials</b> consumers and the issuer’s effort is comparable to the best prior proposals. ...|$|R
40|$|A central task in {{the context}} of logic-based {{decentralized}} authorization languages is that of gathering <b>credentials</b> from <b>credential</b> providers, required by the resource guard’s policy to grant a user’s access request.

The specification is used to gather <b>credentials</b> from <b>credential</b> providers in a single pass, without involving any communication with the resource guard. The <b>credentials</b> gathered thus are pushed to the resource guard at authorization time. This approach decouples authorization from <b>credential</b> gathering, and, in comparison to server-side pull methods, reduces the number of messages sent between participants, and allows for environments in which some <b>credential</b> providers are unknown or unavailable to the resource guard at authorization time. ...|$|R
25|$|Paramedics in {{countries}} that follow the Anglo-American model normally function under the authority (medical direction) {{of one or more}} physicians charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. <b>Credentialing</b> may occur {{as the result of a}} State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, <b>credentialing</b> may occur by means of a College of Paramedicine. In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating health profession. The final common method of <b>credentialing</b> is through certification by a Medical Director and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of standing order protocols (off-line medical control) and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.|$|E

40|$|Various {{research}} efforts are in progress to enforce <b>credential</b> based access control using XACML standard.

The use of various types of <b>credentials</b> in access control policy specification provides easy and immediate access to unknown user in open access environment. Fine grained access control in closed administrative domain is achieved using Identity <b>Credential</b> and the attributes associated with the <b>credentials.</b> In this paper, we propose extensions to the XACML standard that support credential-based hybrid access control.

40|$|Abstract — Jobs on the Grid require {{security}} <b>credentials</b> {{throughout their}} run for accessing secure Grid resources, such as GridFTP data repositories. However, delegating long-lived <b>credentials</b> to long-running jobs brings {{an increased risk}} that a <b>credential</b> will be compromised and misused. Additionally, {{it is often difficult}} to predict the run-time of jobs on the Grid, due to changes in application performance and resource load, making it difficult to set the lifetime of the delegated <b>credential</b> in advance. We have developed a solution to this problem for the EU DataGrid project using the MyProxy online <b>credential</b> repository and have further evolved it during the EGEE project. Users store their long-lived <b>credentials</b> in a dedicated MyProxy server and delegate short-lived <b>credentials</b> to their jobs. When a job’s <b>credential</b> nears expiration, the Workload Management System retrieves a new short-lived <b>credential</b> from the MyProxy server on the user’s behalf and uses it to refresh the job’s <b>credential.</b> The MyProxy server’s policy specifies which services may obtain <b>credentials</b> on the user’s behalf, and all operations are logged at the MyProxy server, where access to <b>credentials</b> may be restricted if a compromise is detected or suspected. This system has been used for <b>credential</b> renewal in Grids in Europe for over three years.
