Those insurance companies {{which could be}} connected to T, such as Royal & Sun Alliance, alleged that their policies excluded liability for asbestos-related claims, although this was in breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. Insurers stated that instead they had an [...] "understanding" [...] that T itself would settle asbestos claims and, [...] "in return for premiums received, the insurers would, however, issue a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Insurance</b> which complied with {{the terms of the}} Employers' Liability Act, thereby enabling T to continue trading." [...] By 2003, no payments had been received by UK claimants and a request to the government to set up an interim compensation scheme was rejected, as was a request to the US Creditors' Committee of Federal-Mogul to make hardship payments to UK victims.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Submission {{of study}} {{protocols}} to research ethics committees (RECs) constitutes {{one of the}} earliest stages at which planned trials are documented in detail. Previous studies have investigated the amendments requested from researchers by RECs, but the type of issues raised during REC review have not been compared by sponsor type. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify recurring shortcomings in protocols of drug trials based on REC comments and to assess whether these were more common among industry-sponsored or non-industry trials. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 226 protocols of drug trials approved in 2010 - 2011 by three RECs affiliated to academic medical centres in The Netherlands. For each protocol, information on sponsorship, number of participating centres, participating countries, study phase, registration status of the study drug, and type and number of subjects was retrieved. REC comments were extracted from decision letters sent to investigators after review and were classified using a predefined checklist that was based on legislation and guidelines on clinical drug research and previous literature. RESULTS: Most protocols received comments regarding participant information and consent forms (n = 182, 80. 5 %), methodology and statistical analyses (n = 160, 70. 8 %), and supporting documentation, including trial agreements and <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> (n = 154, 68. 1 %). Of the submitted protocols, 122 (54. 0 %) were non-industry and 104 (46. 0 %) were industry-sponsored trials. Non-industry trials more often received comments on subject selection (n = 44, 36. 1 %) than industry-sponsored trials (n = 18, 17. 3 %; RR, 1. 58; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 2. 47), and on methodology and statistical analyses (n = 95, 77. 9 % versus n = 65, 62. 5 %, respectively; RR, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 1. 37). Non-industry trials less often received comments on supporting documentation (n = 72, 59. 0 %) than industry-sponsored trials (n = 82, 78. 8 %; RR, 0. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 72 to 0. 95). CONCLUSIONS: RECs identified important ethical and methodological shortcomings in protocols of both industry-sponsored and non-industry drug trials. Investigators, especially of non-industry trials, should better prepare their research protocols in order to facilitate the ethical review process...|$|R

40|$|Compulsory insurance” is not {{a recent}} {{invention}} in insurance law; rather, from traditional motor vehicle insurance to newly developed international Conventions, there is continuing expansion in ways of applying the compulsory insurance obligation. However, there lacks a holistic study, and this paper aims to fill this research gap by studying compulsory insurance obligations in different insurance practices.

40|$|The {{text of the}} International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks {{was finally}} adopted at the International Conference held from 14 to 18 May, 2007 in the United Nations Office at Nairobi in Kenya (UNON). The Convention shall enter into force twelve months after having been signed and {{approved}} by ten States. The new Convention will provide a legal frame for the States Parties in removing existing and future wrecks located beyond the territorial sea (within their sovereign rights). First of all it is the exclusive economic zone which we discuss in the paper, or if a state has not established the Zone, it is the territory just beyond the territorial seas which extends not more than 200 NM from the starting lines for determining the size of territorial seas. Although the number of maritime accidents has been reduced recently, {{it has been estimated}} that there are more than 1 300 abandoned wrecks around the world today that pose potential hazards to safe navigation, utilization of the living resources, as well as to the marine environment. In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Republic of Croatia established Protected Ecological and Fishing Zone comprising sovereign rights characteristic for exclusive economic zones such University of Split, Faculty of Maritime Studies, Split, Croatia e-mail: ranka@pfst. hr a. Adriatic Institute Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb, Croatia as sovereign right of researching, utilization and conservation of the living resources beyond the outer borders of the territorial sea, as well as their management, and the jurisdiction with regard to the scientific research of the sea and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The Adriatic Sea falls into the category of closed or semi-closed seas by the definition of the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, and therefore if compared with larger seas, the consequences of pollution would be much greater due to its small size. That is why the adoption of the Convention on the Removal of Wrecks is of great importance to Croatia. The provisions of the Convention oblige the master and the operator of a ship to notify the endangered state party immediately about the accident which may cause a shipwreck, and the state must inform the mariners and other coastal states about the hazard posed by wrecks. The most important fact is that the Convention requires compulsory security for vessels of 300 BT. The vessels of 300 BT are obliged to have the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance,</b> or some other financial security as a cover for owner’s liability for the damage caused by the removal of the wreck...|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} asked to inform you of the status of the Avitrol Bird Management Process {{developed}} by Phillips Petroleum Company. The Avitrol method of bird control is available to all pest control operators throughout the United States through a licensing arrangement with Phillips. At the start of our marketing program, exclusive licenses were offered to pest control operators on a territorial basis, with each licensee being permitted to grant sublicenses in his territory. This program did not prove satisfactory, because not enough pest control operators were sublicensed to make the process available when and where needed. Beginning {{in the latter part of}} 1967 the licensing policy was changed and no longer is licenses granted on an exclusive basis—all are non-exclusive, and licensees are not restricted to a specific territory of operation within the United States. The licensee has no accounting or reporting chores such as a license agree-ment usually requires, because the price he pays for treated grain includes all royalty. Each licensee does need to provide us a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> liability <b>insurance</b> indicating adequate coverage and show that he is financially solvent. As of this date the Avitrol process is licensed to approximately 80 pest control companies who have over three hundred branches throughout the U. S. A. There are two licensees for the process in Canada—one in Ontario and one in Quebec. We have registered with the United States Department of Agriculture eleven labels which cover various types of grains such as corn, sorghum, rice, etc., for control of sparrows, feral pigeons, certain blackbirds, and crows; and bread and French fried potatoes for starlings in foodlots, and gulls on and around airports...|$|R
