5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow <b>crawling,</b> with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and <b>crawling.</b> When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During <b>crawling,</b> the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crawling</b> with an {{alternating}} gait, hawksbill tracks left in {{the sand}} are asymmetrical. In contrast, the green sea turtle and the leatherback turtle have a more symmetrical gait.|$|E
5|$|Hydras {{and some}} sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: {{creeping}} like snails, <b>crawling</b> like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.|$|E

25|$|The front <b>crawl</b> or forward <b>crawl,</b> {{also known}} as the Australian <b>crawl</b> or American <b>crawl,</b> is a {{swimming}} stroke usually regarded as the fastest of the four front primary strokes. As such, the front <b>crawl</b> stroke is almost universally used during a freestyle swimming competition, and hence freestyle is used metonymically for the front <b>crawl.</b> It is one of two long axis strokes, the other one being the backstroke. Unlike the backstroke, the butterfly stroke, and the breaststroke, the front <b>crawl</b> is not regulated by the FINA. This style is sometimes referred to as the Australian <b>crawl</b> although this can sometimes refer to a more specific variant of front <b>crawl.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, <b>crawling</b> insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude <b>crawling</b> insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against <b>crawling</b> insect predators.|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were <b>crawling</b> on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates <b>crawling</b> around on land and near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common in the water.|$|E
40|$|<b>Crawl</b> {{spaces are}} known to be risky constructions for both the building’s {{structural}} components and the indoor environment. In Sweden, <b>crawl</b> spaces were popular before the 1940 ’s and again in the mid 1960 ’s and 1980 ’s. The aim {{of this paper is to}} look at why <b>crawl</b> spaces are still being used in today’s constructions from a Swedish perspective and give reasons why some types of <b>crawl</b> spaces fail. There are four different types of <b>crawl</b> spaces: plinth, outdoor ventilated, indoor ventilated, unventilated and suspended <b>crawl</b> space foundations, four of which are currently available to builders and one traditional design. Due to all the negative publicity associated with outdoor ventilated <b>crawl</b> spaces and the fact that this publicity refers to them only as <b>crawl</b> spaces, two other types of <b>crawl</b> spaces that function well are looked negatively upon. If designed and constructed correctly, the indoor air ventilated <b>crawl</b> space can be a cheaper alternative with many advantages over an outdoor air ventilated <b>crawl</b> space...|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>crawl</b> space {{thinking}} has reconsidered {{the usage of}} <b>crawl</b> space vents in the home. While <b>crawl</b> space vents do allow outside air to ventilate into the home, the ability of that air to dry out the <b>crawl</b> space is debatable. [...] In areas with humid summers, during the summer months, the air vented into a <b>crawl</b> space will be humid, and as it enters the <b>crawl</b> space, which has been cooled naturally by the earth, the relative humidity of the air will rise. In those cases, <b>crawl</b> space vents can even increase the humidity level of a <b>crawl</b> space and lead to condensation on cool surfaces within, such as metal and wood. [...] In the winter, <b>crawl</b> space vents should be shut off entirely, {{to keep out the}} cold winter air which can cool hot water pipes, furnaces, and water heaters stored within. During rainy weather, <b>crawl</b> space vents bring wet air into the <b>crawl</b> space, which will not dry the space effectively.|$|R

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug <b>crawling</b> across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug <b>crawling</b> across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

50|$|The tiger <b>crawl</b> is {{essentially}} a highly accelerated combination between <b>crawl</b> and leopard <b>crawl.</b> It uses the hands and the knees/feet depending upon the situation, while maintaining a silhouette almost as small {{as that of the}} leopard <b>crawl.</b> This is relatively fast gait but can take large amounts of energy.|$|R
5|$|Australian <b>Crawl</b> (often called Aussie <b>Crawl</b> or The <b>Crawl</b> by fans) were an Australian {{rock band}} founded by James Reyne (lead vocals/piano), Brad Robinson (rhythm guitar), Paul Williams (bass), Simon Binks (lead guitar) and David Reyne (drums) in 1978. David Reyne soon left and was {{replaced}} by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front <b>crawl</b> swimming style also known as the Australian <b>crawl.</b>|$|R
5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The <b>crawling</b> arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant <b>crawling</b> inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult <b>crawling</b> water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullevål and Berg stations, when a train ran over a 33-year-old man {{walking in the}} tracks. In 2002, a 24-year-old man was {{run over by a}} metro train approaching the station. The man survived the accident with minor wounds. In 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found <b>crawling</b> around on the tracks between the platforms. The police removed him from the station and sent him home in a taxi.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between <b>crawling</b> and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when <b>crawling</b> under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, {{the rate}} of {{exchange}} depreciation was fixed with a tablita, an active <b>crawling</b> peg {{that was based on}} a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation.
