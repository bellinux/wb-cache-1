40|$|One exact and two {{heuristic}} algorithms {{for determining}} the generators, orbits and order of the graph automorphism group are presented. A basic tool of these algorithms is the well-known individualization and refinement procedure. A search tree {{is used in the}} algorithms - each node of the tree is a partition. All nonequivalent discreet partitions derivative of the selected vertices are stored in a coded form. A new strategy is used in the exact algorithm: if during its execution some of the searched or intermediate variables obtain a wrong value then the algorithm continues from a new start point losing some of the results determined so far. The algorithms has been tested on one of the known benchmark graphs and shows lower running times for some graph families. The heuristic versions of the algorithms are based on determining some number of discreet partitions derivative of each vertex in the selected cell of the initial partition and comparing them for an automorphism - their search trees are reduced. The heuristic algorithms are almost exact and are many times faster than the exact one. The experimental tests exhibit that the worst-cases running time of the exact algorithm is exponential but it is polynomial for the heuristic algorithms. Several cell selectors are used. Some of them are new. We also use a chooser of <b>cell</b> <b>selector</b> for choosing the optimal <b>cell</b> <b>selector</b> for the manipulated graph. The proposed heuristic algorithms use two main heuristic procedures that generate two different forests of search trees. Comment: 47 pages; 1. Entirely revised 2. Algorithms analysis removed 3.

40|$|The individualization-refinement {{paradigm}} {{provides a}} strong toolbox for testing isomorphism of two graphs and indeed, the currently fastest implementations of isomorphism solvers all follow this approach. While these solvers are fast in practice, from a theoretical point of view, no general lower bounds concerning {{the worst case}} complexity of these tools are known. In fact, it {{is an open question}} whether individualization-refinement algorithms can achieve upper bounds on the running time similar to the more theoretical techniques based on a group theoretic approach. In this work we give a negative answer to this question and construct a family of graphs on which algorithms based on the individualization-refinement paradigm require exponential time. Contrary to a previous construction of Miyazaki, that only applies to a specific implementation within the individualization-refinement framework, our construction is immune to changing the <b>cell</b> <b>selector,</b> or adding various heuristic invariants to the algorithm. Furthermore, our graphs also provide exponential lower bounds in the case when the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is used to replace the standard color refinement operator and the arguments even work when the entire automorphism group of the inputs is initially provided to the algorithm.

40|$|During animal development, complex {{patterns}} of gene expression provide positional information within the embryo. To {{better understand the}} underlying gene regulatory networks, the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project (BDTNP) has developed methods that support quantitative computational analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) gene expression in early Drosophila embryos at cellular resolution. We introduce PointCloudXplore, an interactive visualization tool that supports visual exploration of relationships between different genes’ expression {{using a combination of}} established visualization techniques. Two aspects of gene expression are of particular interest: (i) gene expression patterns defined by the spatial locations of cells expressing a gene, and (ii) relationships between the expression levels of multiple genes. PointCloudXplore provides users with two corresponding classes of data views: (i) Physical Views based on the spatial relationships of cells in the embryo, and (ii) Abstract Views that discard spatial information and plot expression levels of multiple genes with respect to each other. <b>Cell</b> <b>Selectors</b> highlight data associated with subsets of embryo cells within a View. Using linking, these selected cells can be viewed in multiple representations.

5000|$|PRAM <b>cell</b> <b>selectors</b> can use various devices: diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs. Using a diode or a BJT {{provides}} {{the greatest amount}} of current for a given cell size. However, the concern with using a diode stems from parasitic currents to neighboring cells, as well as a higher voltage requirement, resulting in higher power consumption. The chalcogenide resistance being a necessarily larger resistance than the diode entails that the operating voltage must exceed 1 V by a wide margin to guarantee adequate forward bias current from the diode. Perhaps the most severe consequence of using a diode-selected array, in particular for large arrays, is the total reverse bias leakage current from the unselected bit lines. In transistor-selected arrays, only the selected bit lines contribute reverse bias leakage current. The difference in leakage current is several orders of magnitude. A further concern with scaling below 40 nm is the effect of discrete dopants as the p-n junction width scales down. Thin film-based selectors allow higher densities, utilizing <4F^2 cell area by stacking memory layers horizontally or vertically. Often the isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors if the on/off ratio for the selector is not sufficient, limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture. Chalcogenide-based threshold switch has been demonstrated as a viable selector for high density PCM arrays ...|$|R

This paper pro-poses neural fuzzy control for radio resource management in hierarchical cellular systems supporting multimedia services. A neural fuzzy resource manager (NFRM) is designed, which mainly contains a neural fuzzy channel allocation processor (NFCAP), and NFCAP is in a two-layer architecture: a fuzzy <b>cell</b> <b>selector</b> (FCS) in the first layer and a neural fuzzy call-admission and rate controller (NFCRC) in the second layer. The FCS chooses not only the handoff failure probabilities and the resource availabilities in both microcell and macrocell but also the mobility of user as input linguistic variables. The NFCRC takes the handoff failure probability and the resource availability of the selected cell as input variables to perform call admission control and rate control for the call. Simulation results show that NFRM can always guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirement of handoff failure probability for all traffic loads. Also, NFRM improves the system utilization by 31. 1 % while increasing the handoff rate by 2 % over the overflow channel allocation (OCA) scheme [3]; it enhances the system utilization by 6. 3 % and 1. 4 %, and still reduces the handoff rate by 14. 9 % and 6. 8 %, {{as compared to the}} combined channel allocation (CCA) scheme [20], [21] and fuzzy channel allocation control (FCAC) scheme [9], respectively, under a predefined QoS constraint.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a protocol for clinical grade generation of immature DC in a closed-systern. Aphereses were performed with the Cobe Spectra (TM) continuous flow cell separator and material was derived from one volume of blood processed. Optimisation of a 3 -phase collection autoPBSC technique significantly improved the quality of the initial mononuclear cell (MNC) product. Monocytes were then enriched from MNC by immunomagnetic depletion of CD 19 + B cells and CD 2 + T cells and partial depletion of NK cells using the Isolex 3001 Magnetic <b>cell</b> <b>selector.</b> The quality of the initial mononuclear cell product was found to determine the outcome of monocyte enrichment. Enriched monocytes were Cultured in Opticyte gas-permeable containers using CellGro serum-free medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL- 4 to generate immature DC. A seeding concentration of 1 x 10 (6) was found optimal in terms of DC phenotype expression, monocyte percentage ill Culture, and cell viability. The differentiation pattern favours day 7 for harvest of immature DC. DC recovery, viability, as well as phenotype expression after cryopreservation of immature DC was considered in this study. DC were induced to maturation and evaluated in FACS analysis for phenotype expression and proliferation assays. Mature DC were able to generate an allogeneic T-cell response as well as an anti-CMV response as detected by proliferation assays. These data indicate that the described large-scale GMP-compatible system results in the generation of stable DC derived from one volume of blood processed, which are qualitatively and quantitatively sufficient for clinical application ill immunotherapeutic protocols...|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent that articular cartilage growth is achieved by apposition from the articular surface. For such a mechanism to occur, a population of stem/progenitor cells must reside within the articular cartilage to provide transit amplifying progeny for growth. Here, {{we report on the}} isolation of an articular cartilage progenitor cell from the surface zone of articular cartilage using differential adhesion to fibronectin. This population of cells exhibits high affinity for fibronectin, possesses a high colony-forming efficiency and expresses the <b>cell</b> fate <b>selector</b> gene Notch 1. Inhibition of Notch signalling abolishes colony forming ability whilst activated Notch rescues this inhibition. The progenitor population also exhibits phenotypic plasticity in its differentiation pathway in an embryonic chick tracking system, such that chondroprogenitors can engraft into a variety of connective tissue types including bone, tendon and perimysium. The identification of a chondrocyte subpopulation with progenitor-like characteristics will allow for advances in our understanding of both cartilage growth and maintenance as well as provide novel solutions to articular cartilage repair...|$|R
40|$|A {{chondrocyte}} progenitor population {{isolated from}} the surface zone of articular cartilage presents a promising cell source for cell-based cartilage repair. In this study, equine articular cartilage progenitor cells (ACPCs) and equine bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) were compared as potential cell sources for repair. Clonally derived BMSCs and ACPCs demonstrated expression of the <b>cell</b> fate <b>selector</b> gene, Notch- 1, and the putative stem cell markers STRO- 1, CD 90 and CD 166. Chondrogenic induction revealed positive labelling for collagen type II and aggrecan. Collagen type X was not detected in ACPC pellets but was observed in all BMSC pellets. In addition, {{it was observed that}} BMSCs labelled for Runx 2 and matrilin- 1 antibodies, whereas ACPC labelling was significantly less or absent. For both cell types, osteogenic induction revealed positive von Kossa staining in addition to positive labelling for osteocalcin. Adipogenic induction revealed a positive result via oil red O staining in both cell types. ACPCs and BMSCs have demonstrated functional equivalence in their multipotent differentiation capacity. Chondrogenic induction of BMSCs resulted in a hypertrophic cartilage (endochondral) phenotype, which can limit cartilage repair as the tissue can undergo mineralisation. ACPCs may therefore be considered superior to BMSCs in producing cartilage capable of functional repair...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{approach}} that allows for the rapid identification of proteins mediating phosphorylation in signaling cascades after specific stimulation. As a proof of concept, we used the interferon- γ (IFN-γ) -induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription- 1 (Stat 1) in a human promonocytic cell line, which was previously shown to be deficient in this signaling pathway. By using retroviral cDNA expression libraries, transduced <b>selector</b> <b>cells</b> expressing single cDNAs were stimulated with IFN-γ, then fixed, permeabilized and stained intracellularly for phospho-Stat 1 levels. Cells responding to the stimulation, which showed increased levels of phosphorylated Stat 1, were enriched using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Genomic DNA was isolated from the enriched cell population {{and served as a}} template for cDNA amplification using PCR. After only one round of selection, a cDNA encoding the β-chain of the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR 2) was obtained and demonstrated to restore the selected phenotype. The approach now allows one to use phospho-events as reporters, alone or in tandem, for screening of signaling network states, overcoming a prior need to rely on the reporter genes that are often only indirect measures of phenotypes desired in a screen...|$|R
40|$|Central {{regulators}} of <b>cell</b> fate, or <b>selector</b> genes, {{establish the}} identity of cells by direct regulation of large cohorts of genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, foregut (or pharynx) identity relies on the FoxA transcription factor PHA- 4, which activates different sets of target genes at various times and in diverse cellular environments. An outstanding question is how PHA- 4 distinguishes between target genes for appropriate transcriptional control. We have used the Nuclear Spot Assay and GFP reporters to examine PHA- 4 interactions with target promoters in living embryos and with single cell resolution. While PHA- 4 was found throughout the digestive tract, binding and activation of pharyngeally expressed promoters was restricted to a subset of pharyngeal cells and excluded from the intestine. An RNAi screen of candidate nuclear factors identified emerin (emr- 1) as a negative regulator of PHA- 4 binding within the pharynx, but emr- 1 did not modulate PHA- 4 binding in the intestine. Upon promoter association, PHA- 4 induced large-scale chromatin de-compaction, which, we hypothesize, may facilitate promoter access and productive transcription. Our results reveal two tiers of PHA- 4 regulation. PHA- 4 binding is prohibited in intestinal cells, preventing target gene expression in that organ. PHA- 4 binding within the pharynx {{is limited by the}} nuclear lamina component EMR- 1 /emerin. The data suggest that association of PHA- 4 with its targets is a regulated step that contributes to promoter selectivity during organ formation. We speculate that global re-organization of chromatin architecture upon PHA- 4 binding promotes competence of pharyngeal gene transcription and, by extension, foregu...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of neural cell {{diversity in the}} developing central nervous system relies on mechanisms that provide spatial and temporal information to neural progenitor cells. The deployment of morphogen gradients is an important strategy to impart spatial information {{to the field of}} responding cells. In this process, cells translate different concentrations of signal into the expression of distinct sets of cell fate-determining transcription factors, which determine cell fate as progenitors leave the cell cycle and differentiate into neurons. However, the mechanisms by which time regulates cell fate determination are poorly understood. The aim of this thesis is to better understand the mechanisms of spatial and temporal patterning in the specification of neural cell types. In the ventral half of the neural tube, the graded activity of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been proposed to specify the patterned {{generation of}} distinct neuronal subtypes. It remains unclear, however, whether non-graded mechanisms of Shh signaling also contribute to this process. We show that Shh-induced Nkx 2 proteins intrinsically amplify Shh responses and that this activity is important to specify floor plate (FP) and V 3 fates in the ventral spinal cord. Conversely, Pax 6 antagonizes Shh signaling and constrains its inductive activity over time. Furthermore, our data suggest that the spatial patterning of FP and V 3 cells reflects a switch of neuronal potential in neural progenitors and not a requirement for different concentrations of Shh. Together, this study indicates that the output of graded Shh signaling depends on dynamic and non-graded changes of competence in responding cells. At the hindbrain level, the progenitor domain dorsally abutting the FP generates visceral motor neurons (vMN) at early stages of development. To better understand the genetic program of vMN specification, we studied the role of proteins expressed in vMN progenitors during this process. We show that Nkx 2. 2 is sufficient to activate the expression of Phox 2 b, an important determinant of vMN fate. Moreover, the redundant activities of Nkx 6. 1 and Nkx 6. 2 proteins are not required for the generation of vMNs, but are important to prevent the parallel activation of dorsal cell fate differentiation programs and to ensure proper migration and axonal projection of vMNs. Thus, our data establish complementary roles for Nkx 2. 2 and Nkx 6 proteins in the establishment of vMN identity. In contrast to spatial patterning, the mechanisms that regulate the sequential generation of distinct cell types from a common pool of progenitors remain poorly resolved. To better understand these mechanisms we analyzed the sequential generation of vMN and serotonergic neurons (5 HTN) from a common pool of Nkx 2. 2 + progenitors in the ventral hindbrain, and found that the temporal specification of these cell types depends on the integrated activities of Nkx and Hox proteins to regulate the temporal expression of Phox 2 b. In turn, Phox 2 b functions as a <b>cell</b> fate <b>selector</b> promoting vMN and repressing 5 HTN fate. To further understand the vMN-to- 5 HTN switch, we screened for factors that could regulate this process, and identified Tgfβ 2 as a signal that executes the switch through a temporal cross-repressive interaction with Phox 2 b. Moreover, we show that prolonged Shh activity establishes the initial period of vMN fate and induces Tgfβ 2 expression with a temporal delay. Together, our studies reveal that a Shh-Tgfβ signaling relay mechanism regulates the sequential generation of vMNs and 5 HTNs in a dynamic process that can be modulated by determinants controlling spatial patterning...|$|R
