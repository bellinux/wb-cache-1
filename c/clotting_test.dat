The <b>clotting</b> <b>test</b> performed immediately after the specimens are mixed may show correction because the antibody has not had time to inactivate its target factor.

Nonspecific inhibitors like the lupus anticoagulant usually are not time dependent; the immediate mixture will show prolongation. Many specific factor inhibitors are time dependent, and the inhibitor will not be detected unless the test is repeated after incubation (factor VIII inhibitors are notorious for this).|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the in vitro effects of Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate (STS) and Polidocanol (POL) on <b>clotting</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>clotting</b> factors, platelets and microparticles. Materials and methodsPlatelet rich (PRP) and platelet poor (PPP) plasmas were incubated with varying concentrations of STS and POL. <b>Clotting</b> <b>tests,</b> platelet/plasma turbidity, and microparticle studies were performed. Specimens were mixed with individual factor deficient plasmas and clotting factor activities were studied. ResultsSTS at high concentrations (> 0. 3 %) destroyed platelets, microparticles and the clotting factors V, VII and X. It prolonged all <b>clotting</b> <b>tests</b> including prothrombin time (PT), activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), non-{{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (NAPTT), thrombin time (TT), factor Xa clotting time (XACT) and surface activated clotting time (SACT). Higher concentrations of POL were required to achieve some anticoagulant activity. Low sclerosant concentrations shortened XACT and SACT, and induced release of procoagulant platelet derived microparticles. Increased exposure time resulted in increased procoagulant activity. STS at concentrations higher than 0. 5 % precipitated a complex containing apolipoprotein b and fibrinogen. ConclusionsDetergent sclerosants affect the clotting mechanism by interfering with clotting factor activities, procoagulant phospholipids and platelet derived microparticles.

40|$|Thrombin is the {{key enzyme}} of {{coagulation}} and thrombin generation is the central haemostatic process. Current <b>clotting</b> <b>tests</b> (PT, aPTT) measure the time at which the first fibrin filaments appear after activation of coagulation. Yet, more than 95 % of thrombin is generated after clot detection, which underlies the poor sensitivity of usual <b>clotting</b> <b>tests</b> {{for the detection of}} many hemorragic or thrombotic diseases. Thrombinography measures the kinetics of thrombin generation and inactivation during ex vivo coagulation, in standardized conditions. Thrombin generation is reduced in hemophiliacs and in patients under anticoagulant treatment. Thrombin activity is raised in hypercoagulable states, such as antithrombin deficiency, protein C and S deficiency, facteur V Leiden and in women under oral contraceptives. Thrombin generation is delayed but amplified in the presence of lupus anticoagulants.

The NO releasing behavior study of PU-Cys film demonstrated that endogenous NO could be continuously released from PU-Cys film and the accumulated releasing amount within 3 h added up to 1. 06 nmol/cm 2.

It gave valuable information particularly with respect to differentiate the inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint diseases. This study included 115 synovial fluids obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the swollen knee from the patients in the period between 2003 and 2008. At our department the urgent cytological examination of the synovial fluids consisted of macroscopic analysis that includes volume, colour, clarity, viscosity and mucin <b>clot</b> <b>test,</b> native microscopic analysis for crystals and tissue fragments, counting the total nucleated cell count and semiquantitative microscopic analysis for neutrophil granulocyte percentage on the slides stained with Hemacolor rapid staining.

In inflammation the total nucleated cell count and the neutrophil granulocyte percentage was greater than in non-inflammation, the clarity was only translucent and opaque, the viscosity was low and the mucin <b>clot</b> <b>test</b> was negative. In non-inflammatory diseases the clarity varied from transparent to opaque, the total nucleated cell count and the neutrophil granulocyte percentage was smaller than in inflammatory diseases, the viscosity was high and consequently the mucin test was highly positive in all samples.
