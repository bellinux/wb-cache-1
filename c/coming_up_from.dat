5|$|On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the {{threshold}} of Suk El Gharb, a village defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda, Yarze, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene. The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a {{reduction in the number of}} attacks on the Marines.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, both boats {{wanted to be the}} first one of the season to arrive in Hazelton. Captain Bonser started out in Hazelton first, and while he was wooding-up 105 miles upstream, he saw Mount Royal with Captain Johnson at the helm <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> behind. Wooding-up was {{immediately}} ceased and Hazelton pulled into the stream as Mount Royal approached and they raced bow to bow. Slowly Mount Royal gained on Hazelton. Captain Bonser was having none of it and he rammed Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged Hazelton’s stern at Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the pilothouse unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defense that it was an accident.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on December 31, about 6 a.m., Confederate William J. Hardee struck first, {{attacking the}} Union's right flank with the {{division}} of Maj. Gen. John P. McCown, before many in Union Brig. Gen. Richard W. Johnson's division had finished their breakfast. This was the third major battle, after Fort Donelson and Shiloh, in which an early morning attack caught a Union army by surprise. The 10,000 Confederates who massed on their left attacked in one massive wave. McCook's deceptive campfires and the relative inexperience of McCown caused his division to drift away to the left, which left {{a gap in the}} front, but the gap was filled seamlessly by the division <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his rear, under Maj. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne. These two divisions swept all resistance aside. Several artillery batteries were captured without having time to fire a shot. Johnson's division, on the right, suffered over 50% casualties. His neighboring Union division to the left, under Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, was able to hold only briefly.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{officers}} {{arrived at the}} front of the car, Dexter Bostic, 34, opened fire from the passenger's seat with a [...]45 caliber handgun, striking Timoshenko once in the face and once in the throat.

500|$|Nell on {{the other}} hand is a smart and {{responsible}} girl, age seventeen {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She too goes through character development. Initially, as one reviewer put it, Nell is filled with a [...] "maelstorm of angst" [...] as she tries to figure out her relationship with Brooke and both [...] "shocked and intrigued" [...] by Brooke's eccentric behaviour. Though she expresses herself as in the control of most situations, in fact she is not, especially when Brooke is involved. One reviewer noted that Nell's voice in the novel is not altogether convincing, saying [...] "the levels of diction and spelling here seem rather high to be <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the kitchen". The centrality of Nell in the novel was inspired by a postcard that Dawson bought which showed the maids from The Orchard during Brooke's stay. Though inspired by real individuals, Nell's character primarily draws inspiration from many individuals in Dawson's own life. The name Nell Golightly is a mix of two names: Izzie Golightly, a close friend of Dawson's mother, and Nelly Boxall, Virginia Woolf's servant.|$|E
