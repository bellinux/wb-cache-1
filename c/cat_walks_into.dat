5000|$|They filmed {{the actor}} {{carrying}} a bag that contained {{some kind of}} moving mechanism, {{to make it look}} like it was full of <b>cats.</b> He <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the lake, pushed the bag underwater, and fell in. At that point, some phony mechanical rats were attached to him for closeups. When the guy at the hamburger stand runs over the lake... that guy was actually running on a plexiglass bridge under the water; it made it look like he was actually running across the surface of the lake. All of the stuff with the live rats was shot back in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Dirk soon deduces that events {{all seem}} to connect with 5 December 1994, as that is the date where Susan broke up with Gordon because he missed a date (due to Dirk accidentally running Gordon over in his Austin Princess, when trying to escape an angry Richard), and the date on which Mrs Jordan's first <b>cat,</b> George, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> her house. Recalling the {{equipment}} that he and Richard found in a warehouse near Susan's house, Dirk deduces that Gordon Way had developed a time machine {{to go back and}} save his relationship with Susan before it went wrong, with Mrs Jordan's cat getting into the machine with him and being sent back to the past (meaning that Mrs Jordan's two cats were actually the same cat).|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Steve Leggett awarded the album 4 stars and stated [...] "Trumpeter Donald Byrd and {{baritone}} saxophonist Pepper Adams {{worked together on}} several recordings between 1958 and 1961, and The <b>Cat</b> <b>Walk</b> is among the best... Byrd's playing throughout is typically sleek and lyrical, and Adams' sturdy, husky baritone sound is the perfect counterbalance, making The <b>Cat</b> <b>Walk</b> an essential Byrd purchase".|$|R

5000|$|Unlike most mammals, when <b>cats</b> <b>walk,</b> {{they use}} a [...] "pacing" [...] gait; that is, they move the two legs {{on one side of}} the body before the legs on the other side.
