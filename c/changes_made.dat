5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from Monotype and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at different sizes by modifying Griffo's original single-size design, a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> were looser spacing, higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus {{proved the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> to his army, by defeating Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.|$|E
5|$|Comair {{discovered}} {{after the}} accident that all of its pilots had been using an airport map that did not accurately reflect <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> to the airport layout during ongoing construction work.

5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911. Shortly after completion she ran aground off the Romanian port of Constanţa in October 1911, but was only slightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> {{to the basic}} design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} {{occupation}} of the country by the Russian Bolsheviks, Belarus became a Soviet Republic (USSR), and a new constitution was adopted. Belarus continued to use this constitution until it – along with Russia, Ukraine, and the Transcaucasus – signed a treaty to form the Soviet Union. Now the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR), the country adopted its first Soviet-era constitution in 1927, complementing the recently adopted Soviet Constitution. After a re-adoption in 1937, the Byelorussian SSR adopted its last Soviet-era constitution in 1978, mainly to reflect <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> in the 1977 Soviet Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, it was {{revealed}} that a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack, since only 32,767 different keys were generated. The security weakness was caused by <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> in 2006 by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings. The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates.|$|E
5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any <b>changes</b> <b>made</b> in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
