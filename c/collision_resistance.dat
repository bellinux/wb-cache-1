50|$|Symmetric {{algorithms}} {{usually have}} a strictly defined security claim. For symmetric ciphers, it is typically equal to the key size of the cipher — equivalent {{to the complexity of}} a brute-force attack. Cryptographic hash functions with output size of n bits {{usually have a}} <b>collision</b> <b>resistance</b> security level n/2 and preimage resistance level n. This is because the general birthday attack can always find collisions in 2n/2 steps. For example, SHA-256 offers 128-bit <b>collision</b> <b>resistance</b> and 256-bit preimage resistance.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{the basic}} {{security}} of cryptographic hash functions {{can be seen}} from three different angles: pre-image resistance, second pre-image resistance, and <b>collision</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the hash {{function}} literature, this is commonly termed a hash collision. A {{hash function}} where collisions {{are difficult to}} find {{is said to have}} <b>collision</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} some {{exceptions}} to this. The Phelix and Helix are 256-bit ciphers offering a 128-bit security level. The SHAKE variants of SHA-3 are also different: for a 256-bit output size, SHAKE-128 provides 128-bit security level for both <b>collision</b> and preimage <b>resistance.</b>|$|R

50|$|In practice, <b>collision</b> <b>resistance</b> is {{insufficient}} for many practical uses.In addition to <b>collision</b> <b>resistance,</b> {{it should be}} impossible for an adversary to find two messages with substantially similar digests; or to infer any useful information about the data, given only its digest. In particular, should behave {{as much as possible}} like a random function (often called a random oracle in proofs of security) while still being deterministic and efficiently computable.

50|$|<b>Collision</b> <b>resistance</b> implies second-preimage resistance, {{but does}} not {{guarantee}} preimage resistance. Conversely, a second-preimage attack implies a collision attack and (trivially, since, in addition to x′, x is already known right from the start), a preimage attack.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collision</b> <b>resistance</b> implies second pre-image resistance, {{but does}} not imply pre-image resistance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} secure yet {{efficiently}} implementable cryptographic algorithms {{is a fundamental}} problem of cryptography. Lately, lightweight cryptography – optimizing the algorithms to fit the most constrained environments – has received {{a great deal of}} attention, the recent research being mainly focused on building block ciphers. As opposed to that, the design of lightweight hash functions is still far from being well-investigated with only few proposals in the public domain. In this article, we aim to address this gap by exploring the design space of lightweight hash functions based on the sponge construction instantiated with present-type permutations. The resulting family of hash functions is called spongent. We propose 13 spongent variants – for different levels of collision and (second) preimage resistance as well as for various implementation constraints. For each of them we provide several ASIC hardware implementations- ranging from the lowest area to the highest throughput. We make efforts to address the fairness of comparison with other designs in the field by providing an exhaustive hardware evaluation on various technologies, including an open core library. We also prove essential differential properties of spongent permutations, give a security analysis in terms of <b>collision</b> and preimage <b>resistance,</b> as well as study in detail dedicated linear distinguishers...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{if it is}} not {{to satisfy}} the foreign powers we make this assurance, to what power at home is it that we pay all this humiliating court? Not to the old Whigs or to the ancient Tories of this kingdom,--if any memory of such ancient {{divisions}} still exists amongst us. To which of the principles of these parties is this assurance agreeable? Is it to the Whigs we are to recommend the aggrandizement of France, and the subversion of the balance of power? Is it to the Tories we are to recommend our eagerness to cement ourselves with the enemies of royalty and religion? But if these parties, which by their dissensions have so often distracted the kingdom, which by their union have once saved it, and which by their <b>collision</b> and mutual <b>resistance</b> have preserved the variety of this Constitution in its unity, be (as I believe they are) nearly extinct by the growth of new ones, which have their roots in the present circumstances of the times, I wish to know to which of these new descriptions this Declaration is addressed. It can hardly be to those persons who, in the new distribution of parties, consider the conservation in England of the ancient order of things as necessary to preserve order everywhere else, and who regard the general conservation of order in other countries as reciprocally necessary to preserve the same state of things in these islands. That party never can wish to see Great Britain pledge herself to give the lead and the ground of advantage and superiority to the France of to-day, in any treaty which is to settle Europe. I insist upon it, that, so far from expecting such an engagement, they are generally stupefied and confounded with it. That the other party, which demands great changes here, and is so pleased to see them everywhere else, which party I call Jacobin, that this faction does, from the bottom of its heart, approve the Declaration, and does erect its crest upon the engagement, there can be little doubt. To them it may be addressed with propriety, for it answers their purposes in every point.|$|R

50|$|Not all uses of {{cryptographic}} hash functions require random oracles: schemes that require {{only one or}} more properties having a definition in the standard model (such as <b>collision</b> <b>resistance,</b> preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, etc.) can often be proven secure in the standard model (e.g., the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem).|$|E

50|$|Concatenating outputs from {{multiple}} hash functions provides <b>collision</b> <b>resistance</b> {{as good as}} the strongest of the algorithms included in the concatenated result.

50|$|Informally, these {{properties}} {{mean that}} a malicious adversary cannot replace or modify the input data without changing its digest. Thus, if two strings have the same digest, one can be very confident that they are identical.
