As the resolution is increased, the UHDTV requires a transmission technology to support very high data transfer rate.

HFC <b>CATV</b> <b>networks</b> are shared medium access networks, employing the coaxial bus principle between an optical network terminator and the subscriber. To realize access in the upstream direction, a multiple access scheme based on CDMA can be used. However, before access is granted in the upstream direction, each cable modem connected to the coaxial bus needs to undergo a startup procedure at activation of the modem to determine timing and physical layer related settings.

40|$|Hybrid fiber-coax <b>CATV</b> <b>networks</b> are {{considered}} a promising infrastructure {{for the implementation of}} future interactive services. Efficient utilization of the available CATV spectrum requires a communication system which is dedicated to the specific properties of these networks. This paper presents the physical layer of a bidirectional communication system for HFC <b>CATV</b> <b>networks</b> which is based on CDMA, a technique that has a certain robustness to the ingress noise found in the CATV bandwidth. Because the application of asynchronous CDMA results in a poor spectral efficiency, a transmission scheme based on synchronous CDMA is adopted. Using synchronous CDMA and QPSK modulation, a capacity of 64 channels of 64 kbit/s each can be achieved in a bandwidth of 6 MHz. It is found that small synchronization errors can be tolerated without significant performance degradation. Next, a description is given of the cable modems responsible for the communication between subscribers and a CATV headend. The design exploits the typical CATV network configuration to enable a cost-effective hardware realization. Sensitivity of system performance to linear distortion is investigated by computer simulation. Especially linearly varying group delay and uneven amplitude response are shown to be potential causes of performance degradatio...|$|E
