40|$|Imitation {{is seen by}} many {{researchers}} as {{the driving force of}} human evolution and as a primary factor controlling the development of culture (Legare & Nielsen, 2015). The ontogeny of imitative behavior has been heavenly debated and has inspired a host of theoretical accounts. While an inborn mechanism that translates observed in performed behavior is losing evidential support, a more flexible associative learning mechanism has been proposed that not only explains imitation but also more complex (non-similar) types of behavior such as <b>complementary</b> <b>actions.</b> <b>Complementary</b> <b>actions</b> can be defined as behavioral responses towards an observed action (shaking hands or catching a ball) that can be dissimilar to the observed action. In my thesis I try to find evidence for principles of associative learning specifically applied to <b>complementary</b> <b>actions.</b> I found that <b>complementary</b> <b>actions</b> direct attention to response-relevant objects, that <b>complementary</b> <b>actions</b> are activated irrespective of perceived personal space and that <b>complementary</b> <b>actions</b> modulate perspective taking. Also, I have found that (neural) motor regions are inherently predictive which might facilitate the preparation of <b>complementary</b> <b>actions.</b> The results partly support the associative learning view and provide novel questions for the literature discussing the limits on imitation behavior. We suggest that while imitation is abundant, it is one of outcomes of associative learning and does not inherently provide the positive characteristics that many have attributed it to...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{finding in}} {{imitation}} literature {{is that people}} perform their actions more readily if they are congruent with the behavior of another person.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} reports that perceiving body movements of other people activates motor representations in the observer's brain. This automatic resonance mechanism appears to be imitative in nature. However, action observation does not inevitably lead to symmetrical motor facilitation: mirroring the observed movement might be disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions. In two experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether the excitability of the corticospinal system was selectively modulated by the social dimension of an observed action. We recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from right-hand muscles during the observation of an action sequence which, depending on context, {{might or might not}} elicit a complementary response. The results demonstrate a differential motor facilitation depending on action context. Specifically, when the context called for a <b>complementary</b> <b>action,</b> the excitability pattern reflected the under-threshold activation of a <b>complementary</b> <b>action,</b> whereas when the context did not imply acting in a complementary manner, the observer's corticospinal activity reflected symmetrical motor resonance. We contend that the mechanisms underlying action observation are flexible and respond to contextual factors that guide the social interaction between individuals beyond emulation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that perceiving another’s body {{movements}} activates corresponding motor representations in an observer’s brain. It is nevertheless true that in many situations simply imitating another’s actions would not be an effective or appropriate response, as successful interaction often requires complementary rather than emulative movements. At what point does the automatic tendency to mirror another’s actions become the inclination to carry out appropriate, complementary movements? In the present study, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to explore corticospinal excitability in participants observing action sequences evoking imitative or complementary movements. TMS was delivered at five time points corresponding to different moments in time when key kinematic landmarks characterizing an observed action occurred. A variation in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) confirmed that the motor system flexibly shifts from imitative to <b>complementary</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. That shift appears to take place very precociously in time. Observers are attuned to advance movement information and can use it to anticipate a future course of action and to prepare for an appropriate, <b>complementary</b> <b>action.</b> Altogether, these findings represent a step forward in research concerning social action-perception coupling mechanisms providing important data to better understand the role of predictive simulation in social contexts...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{different}} forms of co-action give rise to feelings of solidarity. We propose that (a) coordinated action elicits a sense of solidarity, and (b) the process through which such solidarity emerges differs for {{different forms of}} co-action. We suggest that whether solidarity within groups emerges from uniform action (e. g. synchronizing, as when people speak in unison) or from more complementary forms of action (e. g. alternating, when speaking in turns) has important consequences for the emergent position of individuals within the group. Uniform action relies on commonality, leaving little scope for individuality. In <b>complementary</b> <b>action</b> each individual makes a distinctive contribution to the group, thereby increasing {{a sense of personal}} value to the group, which should contribute to the emergence of solidarity. The predictions receive support from five studies, in which we study groups in laboratory and field settings. Results show that both complementary and uniform co-action increase a sense of solidarity compared to control conditions. However, in the <b>complementary</b> <b>action</b> condition, but not in the uniform action (or synchrony) condition, the effect on feelings of solidarity is mediated by a sense of personal value to the group...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many daily {{activities}} involve performing an action while simultaneously encoding other events. This is particularly interesting during complementary {{forms of social}} interactions wherein two (or more) individuals coordinate their joint actions in a balanced way. But despite interest, relevance, and theoretical development on how people represent their own and other person’s actions, {{there is still a}} considerable lack of understanding of the cognitive mechanisms and neural networks governing interactive performance. Aims: The aim of this survey will be to determine the neural bases and critical processes underlying such conditions and how they modulate performance during social interactions.

The idea that observing an action automatically triggers an inclination to execute it was largely based on the fact that most studies did not explicitly challenge the automaticity and flexibility of the visuomotor transformation process.

40|$|The {{idea that}} observing an action {{triggers}} an automatic and obligatory activation of an imitative {{action in the}} motor system of the observer has recently been questioned by studies examining complementary actions. Instead of a tendency for imitation, cooperative settings may facilitate the execution of dissimilar actions, resulting in a relative disadvantage for imitative actions. The present study aimed at clarifying the contribution of associative learning and interference of task representations to the reversal of congruency effects. To distinguish between the two, an experiment was designed, in which we increased the effects of associative learning and minimized the effects of task interference. Participants completed a series of imitation and <b>complementary</b> <b>action</b> runs, in which they continuously imitated or complemented {{the actions of a}} virtual co-actor. Each run was alternated with a test run showing the same actions but including color-cues, and the participants were instructed to respond to color instead of the actor’s posture. Reaction times to test runs showed no reversal of facilitation effects between the imitation and <b>complementary</b> <b>action</b> conditions. This result strongly argues that associative learning cannot adequately account for reversed facilitation effects. Our study provides additional support for action–perception models that allow flexible selection of action–perception coupling and challenges the existing models purely based on stimulus–response associations...|$|E

At the fourteenth week of gestation, twin fetuses already display {{interactive}} movements specifically directed towards their co- twin. Readiness for social interaction is also clearly expressed by the newborn who imitate facial gestures, suggesting {{that there is a}} common representation mediating action observation and execution. While actions that are observed and those that are planned seem to be functionally equivalent, it is unclear if the visual representation of an observed action inevitably leads to its motor representation. This is particularly true with regard to <b>complementary</b> <b>actions</b> (from the Latin complementum; i. e. that fills up), a specific class of movements which differ, while interacting, with observed ones.

40|$|Human {{beings have}} a strong {{tendency}} to imitate. Evidence from motor priming paradigms suggests that people automatically tend to imitate observed actions such as hand gestures by performing mirror-congruent movements (e. g., lifting one’s right finger upon observing a left finger movement; from a mirror perspective). Many observed actions however, do not require mirror-congruent responses but afford complementary (fitting) responses instead (e. g., handing over a cup; shaking hands). Crucially, whereas mirror-congruent responses don't require physical interaction with another person, <b>complementary</b> <b>actions</b> often do. Given that most experiments studying motor priming have used stimuli devoid of contextual information, this space or interaction-dependency of complementary responses {{has not yet been}} assessed. To address this issue, we let participants perform a task in which they had to mirror or complement a hand gesture (fist or open hand) performed by an actor depicted either within or outside of reach. In three studies, we observed faster reaction times and less response errors for complementary relative to mirrored hand movements in response to open hand gestures (i. e., ‘hand-shaking’) irrespective of the perceived interpersonal distance of the actor. This complementary effect could not be accounted for by a low-level spatial cueing effect. These results demonstrate that humans {{have a strong}} and automatic tendency to respond by performing <b>complementary</b> <b>actions.</b> In addition, our findings underline the limitations of manipulations of space in modulating effects of motor priming and the perception of affordances...|$|R

This automatic resonance mechanism appears to be imitative in nature. However, action observation does not inevitably lead to symmetrical motor facilitation: Mirroring the observed movement might be disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions.
