40|$|The reduced {{attractiveness}} of investments in reliable power plants {{under conditions of}} liberalized markets and the transition towards renewable energies has brought a discussion on capacity policies to Europe. We use a partial equilibrium model to compare important effects of three basic policies. A strategic reserve policy and a capacity market policy with administratively set capacity targets, and the obligation of generators to hold certificates of reliable capacities {{in relation to their}} supply. We find important differences of policies for consumers and producers that are depending on existing power plant structure and the elasticity of demand particularly in the medium term perspective until the year 2023. In the longer term until 2033 the results differ less pronounced. However, for the German case we demonstrate the potential to effectively reduce the burden on the economy to achieve a prescribed target through the implementation of a <b>capacity</b> <b>certificate</b> system...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the audiometric profile of civilian pilots {{according to the}} noise exposure level. METHODS This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3, 130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional <b>capacity</b> <b>certificate</b> in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6, 000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods > 5, 000 flight hours and > 10 years of flight service. RESULTS A total of 29. 3 % pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12. 8 % and predominant in the left ear (23. 7 %). The number of pilots with suspected hearing loss increased as the noise exposure level increased. CONCLUSIONS Hearing loss in civilian pilots {{may be associated with}} noise exposure during the period of service and hours of flight...|$|E
40|$|This article {{formally}} {{analyzes the}} various corrective mechanisms {{that have been}} proposed and implemented to alleviate underinvestment in electric power generation. It yields three main analytical findings. First, physical <b>capacity</b> <b>certificates</b> markets implemented in the United States restore optimal investment {{if and only if}} they are supplemented with a "no short sale" condition, i. e., producers can not sell more certificates than they have installed capacity. Then, they raise producers’ profits beyond the imperfect competition level. Second, financial reliability options, proposed in many markets, are effective at curbing market power, although they fail to fully restore investment incentives. If "no short sale" conditions are added, both physical <b>capacity</b> <b>certificates</b> and financial reliability options are equivalent. Finally, a single market for energy and operating reserves subject to a price cap is isomorphic to a simple energy market. Standard peak-load pricing analysis applies: under-investment occurs, unless production is perfectly competitive and the cap is never binding. This analysis highlight the limitations of the corrective mechanisms. This suggest that policy makers should first and foremost control and reduce the exercise of market power, then use these mechanisms as interim remedial measures. ...|$|R
40|$|The mantra ‘work is {{good for}} health’ is {{familiar}} to those assisting in the rehabilitation of injured workers and is well supported in the literature. Regulators, workers compensation insurers and health professional bodies have taken steps {{over the last few}} years to promote early and safe return to work after a workplace injury. Improving direct access to physiotherapy and extending the role of physiotherapists to authorise work <b>capacity</b> <b>certificates</b> for injured workers will potentially facilitate early intervention, reduce absence from work in a cost-effective system while maintaining patient satisfaction. Several challenges to advancing the role of physiotherapists exist but are not insurmountable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} Swedish-Norwegian market for {{electricity}} certificates, {{which is a}} support scheme for investments in renewable electricity production. Producers investing in new renewable <b>capacity</b> receive <b>certificates</b> based on their actual production. Retailers of electricity are required to buy certificates for a proportion of their total sales. If a retailers obligation is not met, a penalty fee is imposed. The certificates are traded both bilaterally and as a financial instrument on the Nasdaq Commodity Exchange. The design and potential success of this multistate support mechanism will be {{of great interest to}} policy makers and green investors. The dynamic equilibrium model of Coulon, Khazaei, Powell (2014) is adapted to the Swedish market. It is found to replicate historical long-term trends and price levels well. Sensitivity analyses show that the key drivers of certificate prices are the penalty levels and the discount rate. Further it is shown that a higher rate of certificate price feedback on the investment rate dampens the price fluctuations around the trend line. The rate of feedback is uncertain, but is assessed to be larger than zero...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{tradable}} {{green certificate}} markets, a support scheme for investments in renewable electricity production. A case-study on the Swedish-Norwegian Electricity Certificate market is conducted. In this market producers investing in new renewable <b>capacity</b> receive <b>certificates</b> {{based on their}} actual production. These are sold to retailers of electricity, which are required to buy certificates for a proportion of their total sales. The design and potential success of this multistate support mechanism is {{of great interest to}} policy makers and green investors. A stochastic model based on dynamic programming is implemented to assess the performance of this market. A discussion on market dynamics, uncertainty and expectations forms the basis for the model choices. The main findings from the model include i) Price expectations are not formed easily, and hence, investment decisions have to be made under a lot of uncertainty, ii) Under the current market structure, prices are expected to start at today's level, while decreasing steadily towards zero in 2035 when the market is planned to end, iii) The prices are highly sensitive to changes in electricity consumption and generation of electricity, iv) Regulatory changes should be implemented carefully to avoid increased uncertainty and a consequent increase in price volatility and v) The price-based penalty further increases the volatility of the market. So far, the market has shown its ability to promote investments in renewable electricity production, however improvements of the market seem beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Coal-fired power {{stations}} {{are responsible for}} around a third of Germany's carbon emissions. Failure to reduce the persistently high level of coal-fired power generation threatens Germany's climate targets for 2020 and 2050 and undermines a sustainable energy transition. Calculations by DIW Berlin and other expert opinions prove that, in the long term, lignite, in particular, is no longer relevant for the German energy system. However, {{if there is no}} significant increase in the price of CO 2 emission certificates in the near future, a market-driven transition from coal to less CO 2 -intensive energy sources, such as natural gas, is unlikely to occur. Presently, a number of options for reducing the level of power generated by coal are being dicussed. Along with the reform of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), proposals also include minimum energy efficiency levels or greater flexibility requirements, national minimum prices for CO 2 emission <b>certificates,</b> <b>capacity</b> mechanisms, a residual emissions cap for coal-fired {{power stations}}, emissions performance standards, and network development planning that respects the climate targets. The proposals address both existing and planned coal power plants...|$|R
40|$|In many countries, {{the social}} {{insurance}} system is {{under pressure from}} an ageing population. An {{increasing number of people}} are on sickness benefits and disability pensions in Norway. The general practitioner (GP) is responsible for assessing work <b>capacity</b> and issuing <b>certificates</b> for sick leave based on an evaluation of the patient. Although many studies have analysed certified sickness absence and predictive factors, very few studies focus on the length of sick leave and no studies assess its variation between patients, GPs or geographical areas within a multilevel framework. This study aims to analyse factors explaining the variation in the length of certified sick leave and to disentangle patients, GPs and municipality sources of variation in sickness durations for the whole population of Norwegian workers in 2003. This study uses a unique Norwegian administrative data set that merges data from different sources. The study uses amatched patient—GP data set, and employs amultilevel random intercept model to separate out patient, GP and municipality-level explained and unexplained parts of the variation in the certified sickness durations. We find that all observed patient and GP characteristics are significantly associated with the length of sick leaves (LSL). However, 98 % of the variation in the LSL is attributed to patient factors rather than influenced by variations in GP practice or differences in municipality-level characteristics. Medical diagnosis is an important observed factor explaining certified sickness durations. Low variations across GPs may imply that the gatekeeping role of Norwegian GPs is weak compared with their advocate role. general practitioners (GPs); length of sick leave; multilevel regression models; matched GP—patient data...|$|R
40|$|In Norway, {{as in many}} countries, the {{national}} insurance system is under economic stress from demographic change impacting on the pensions versus contributions balance, and {{an increasing number of}} disability and sickness benefit claimants. The general practitioner (GP) is responsible for assessing work <b>capacity</b> and issuing <b>certificates</b> for sick leave based on an evaluation of the patient. Although many studies have analyzed certified sickness absence and predictive factors, no studies assess its variation between patients, GPs or geographical areas within a multilevel framework. Using a rich Norwegian matched patient-GP data set and employing a multilevel random intercept model, the study attempts to disentangle patient, GP and municipality-level variation in the certified sickness absence length for Norwegian workers in 2003. We find that most observed patient and GP characteristics are significantly associated with the length of sick leave (LSL) and medical diagnosis is an important observed factor explaining certified sickness durations. However, 98 % of the unexplained variation in the LSL is attributed to patient factors rather than influenced by variation in GP practice or differences in municipality-level characteristics. Our findings indicate that GPs practice variation does not matter much for the patients' LSL. Our results are compatible {{with a high degree of}} patient involvement in current general practice. Based on this understanding one may infer that GPs play an advocate role for their patients in Norway, where the patients' own wishes are important when decisions are made.

40|$|The Food Security Act of 1985 permits {{payment of}} farm program {{benefits}} {{in part with}} PIK certificates. PIK certificates can do things that cash alone cannot do. This special <b>capacity</b> gives PIK <b>certificates</b> special value. A market determined premium has existed for them from the beginning. Briefly during the harvest of 1986, premiums were as high as 30 percent. To date, premiums have rarely been much less than 5 percent. In this paper we will attempt {{to better understand the}} reasons for the PIK certificate premiums and explore an alternate design of the system that would, for the most part, eliminate them. A second objective {{of this paper is to}} understand how the special powers of PIK certificates are capable of changing the market environment itself. The fact that PIK certificates can acquire grain owned by the CCC, in the Farmer Owned Reserve, in the Special Producer Storage Loan Program, or under 9 -month loan at approximately current market prices is an important change in the rules. Previously, CCC inventory had been available to the market only at prices well above the loan rate, with minor exceptions pertaining to the condition of the grain. Farmer Owned Reserve inventory was available at prices at or above a trigger-release price. The traditional 9 -month loan program and the SPSLP tend to support prices at levels above the loan rate plus interest carrying charges. The availability of these supplies to the market via a new set of rules creates a radical new market environment, something closer to a free market (Kennedy) (Westcott and Hanthorn). Additional topics discussed include the role of PIK certificates toward alleviating storage shortages, toward creating a defacto marketing loan, and toward possible USDA control of regional markets.
