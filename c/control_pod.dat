The domesticated {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{originated}} in the Mesoamerican and Andean regions independently. Similar to other legume crops, the reduction of pod shattering represents a key domestication syndrome in the domesticated common bean. Understanding the genetic variation of common bean in relation to pod shattering is important for elucidating the underlying genetic mechanisms of parallel evolution (Don and Wang, 2015) and also because this will provide breeders with key tools to improve this trait, thus reducing yield loss (Santalla et al., 2004). Most of these {{studies have been conducted}} in cereals (Lin et al., 2012), while in legumes, the identification of pod-shattering genes lag far behind those of the cereal crops (Li and Olsen, 2016). In this study, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) <b>controlling</b> <b>pod</b> fiber in the ventral suture (string) and pod shattering in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between a cultivated common bean and wild nuña bean. F 2 : 7 flines were grown under short-day conditions and pod string and pod shattering were analysed at several developmental stages. Correlation analysis showed positive relationship among pod string and shattering. Multi-environment QTL mapping revealed that a major QTL on linkage group 2 (LG 02) <b>controlled</b> <b>pod</b> string and co-localized to pod shattering. In addition, minor QTLs related to pod string and pod shattering were identified on LGs 01, 03, 04 and 07. Genes underlying the pleiotropic QTL regions could be potential targets for improving shattering resistance performance through marker assisted selection. These QTLs not only provide useful information for isolating candidate genes involved in pod development but also mean potential targets for improving pod shattering resistance by marker assisted selection.

Objective: To {{find out the}} effect of neem seed extract and lambda-cyhalothrin application schedule for the effective and economic management of pod borer attacking chickpea. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted in High Barind Tract of northern Bangladesh with the application of neem seed extract @ 50 g-l (two and three spraying) and lambda-cyhalothrin. (Karate 2. 5 EC) @ 2 ml-l (two and three spraying) and untreated control. The seeds of BARI-Chola 5 chickpea were sown in rows with the spacing of 40 cm. At maturity, all the pods were collected from 10 randomly selected plants from middle rows of each plot. The damaged (bored) and total numbers of pod were counted. The grain yield loss (kg-ha) and percent pod damage were determined. The seed yield of each treatment was converted to kg-ha. Results: The lowest pod damage (2. 55 %) as well as grain yield loss (34. 90 kg-ha) were observed in the treatment where lamda cyhalothrin applied three times at 7 days interval from flowering stage. Chickpea seed yield was maximum (1338 kg-ha) with lamda cyhalothrin sprayed thrice which was identical to sprayed twice (1280 kg-ha).
