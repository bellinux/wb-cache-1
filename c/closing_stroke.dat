2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the <b>closing</b> <b>stroke</b> of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{difference}} between the Lee and the Mauser designs {{was the use of}} [...] "cock-on-closing", which also helped to speed cycling by making the initial opening of the breech very easy. The <b>closing</b> <b>stroke,</b> which is generally more forceful than the opening stroke, cocks the rifle, adding to the ease of use. The Lee design also featured a shorter bolt travel and a 60-degree rotation of the bolt; these attributes also led to faster cycle times.|$|E
5000|$|The {{males in}} this species stridulate, rubbing their {{forewings}} over each other, creating enough friction {{to produce a}} [...] "song". This song, {{also known as a}} calling song, is the male's way of attracting conspecific females to mate with. The song of the long-winged can be heard between frequencies of 8 kHz to 19 kHz and from a distance of 4 - 5 m from the source. The song consists of trisyllabic echeme, a first-order assemblage of syllables, each with a short opening hemisyllable followed by a longer closing hemisyllable. The hemisyllables are the sounds produced by the upward (opening) and downward (<b>closing)</b> <b>stroke</b> of the forewings. The first two syllables are between 15 ms and 16 ms while the third lasts about 25 ms while the opening hemisyllable of the first syllable is very strong and distinctive and that of the third syllable is quiet and soft. These different aspects come together to make a distinct song that can overall be described as a soft sizzling sound.|$|E

In the intact male, nerve potentials from the CCS during the <b>closing</b> <b>stroke</b> are demonstrated. In the lesioned male, syllable shortenings and missing syllables {{can be traced}} to abnormalities in the wing motion: irregular stops ('sticking'), anomalously high closing speeds with sound emission ('overspeed'), or high closing speeds without sound emission ('slipping') are observed.

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} continuous-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (composite sheets) compared with sheet steel or aluminum {{is that the}} forming process can be integrated directly into the injection molding process. To do so, the composite sheet is heated by contact or infrared heating to a suitable temperature, then formed with the <b>closing</b> <b>stroke</b> of the injection molding tool, and subsequently back molded. In this way {{it is possible to}} achieve a high level of functional integration, because functional elements such as snap hooks and clips can be directly integrated as part of the molded component without the need for any additional process steps after finishing the part. This study investigates the influence of key material properties on the strength of the bond between such a composite sheet and the back-molded thermoplastic component, determined with a peel test...|$|E

40|$|This {{work is the}} {{prosecution}} of a theoretical research which proposed a method to control the Otto engine load {{by means of a}} variable valve timing. As can be predicted, the early closing of the inlet valve allows to lower the engine load with reduced air-throttling, so that a fuel economy can be obtained. A hydraulic system was designed to perform the variable valve timing as follows.

40|$|Abstract Background In equine {{dentistry}} periodontal diseases, especially periapical inflammation, {{are frequently}} occurring problems. Anachoresis {{is believed to}} be the most common cause for the development of such disorders. Nevertheless, there is still no substantiated explanation why settlement of pathogen microorganisms occurs in equine periodontal tissues. It is expected that excessive strains and stresses occurring in the periodontal ligament (PDL) during the horse’s chewing cycle might be a predisposing factor. In this study this assumption was examined by finite element (FE) analyses on virtual 3 -D models of equine maxillary and mandibular cheek teeth, established on the basis of μCT datasets. Calculations were conducted both under conditions of closing and power stroke. Results Results showed a uniform distribution of low stresses and strain energy density (SED) during <b>closing</b> <b>stroke,</b> whereas during power stroke an occurrence of high stresses and SED could be observed in the PDL near the alveolar crest and in periapical regions. Conclusion The concentration of forces during power stroke in these specific areas of the PDL may cause local tissue necrosis and inflammation and thus establish a suitable environment for the settlement of microorganisms. </p...|$|E
40|$|Male Tettigoniidae emit {{sound to}} attract conspecific females. The sound is {{produced}} by stridulation. During stridulation the forewings open and close, but it is during the <b>closing</b> <b>stroke</b> that the scraper contacts the file teeth to generate the predominant sound components, which are amplified by adjacent wing cells specialized in sound radiation. The sounds usually exceed the sonic boundary and might occur above 40 kHz, reaching extreme ultrasonic frequencies of 150 kHz in some species. Here we test the hypothesis that Tettigoniidae species should prefer microhabitats that favour efficient signal transmission, i. e. {{that there is a}} relationship of sound frequency with the vertical distribution of the species (from ground to canopy) at Gorgona National Natural Park, Colombia. We sampled 16 trees and four different altitudinal levels between 1 and 20 m above the understory vegetation. We placed collecting blankets separated by vertical distances of 5 m, and knocked insects down using the technique known as fogging. We found no correlation between vertical distribution and carrier frequency, but there was a preference for open spaces (below the canopy and above the understory) in species using extreme ultrasound. This is the first quantitative description of the vertical distribution in neotropical species of the family Tettigoniidae and its relationship to the calling song frequency...|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{wave impedance}} approach for locating <b>close</b> lightning <b>strokes</b> based on single station observation was proposed and practiced. In the approach, a lightning stroke was modelled with an electrical dipole carrying current components in VLF/LF frequency bands. For a lightning stroke, {{the ratio of}} its electrical and magnetic fields at ground is theoretically {{a function of the}} frequency and distance to the stroke. Distance of the stroke can then be obtained by fitting the theoretical function with the observed data. The approach was examined by applying it to broadband VLF/LF electrical and magnetic fields observed simultaneously at one station for several strokes in ranges of 10 - 50 km. Furthermore, a prototypal single-station lightning location system (S-LLS), which can be analogized to a modified VLF/LF broadband magnetic direction-finder programmed with the proposed lightning stroke distance determining approach, was built up and tested. Comparisons of individual stroke locations with the local lightning location network show that the S-LLS has a good location accuracy of 0. 1 - 4 km for <b>close</b> <b>strokes</b> in ranges of 15 - 60 km, but has a poor location accuracy of 12. 4 - 26 km for distant strokes in ranges of 80 - 130 km.

40|$|Male field crickets {{generate}} {{calls to}} attract distant females through tegminal stridulation: the rubbing together of the overlying right wing which bears a file of cuticular teeth against the underlying left wing which carries a sclerotised scraper. During stridulation, specialised areas of membrane on both wings are set into oscillating vibrations to produce acoustic radiation. The location of females is {{unknown to the}} calling males and thus increasing effective signal range in all directions will maximise transmission effectiveness. However, producing an omnidirectional sound field of high sound pressure levels may be problematic due to the mechanical asymmetry found in this sound generation system. Mechanical asymmetry occurs by the right wing coming to partially cover the left wing during the <b>closing</b> <b>stroke</b> phase of stridulation. As such, it is hypothesised that the sound field on the left-wing side of the animal will contain lower sound pressure components than on the right-wing side {{as a result of}} this coverage. This hypothesis was tested using a novel method to accurately record a high resolution, three dimensional mapping of sound pressure levels around restrained Gryllus bimaculatus field crickets singing under pharmacological stimulation. The results indicate that a bilateral asymmetry is present across individuals, with greater amplitude components present in the right wing side of the animal. Individual variation in sound pressure to either the right or left-wing side is also observed. However, statistically significant differences in bilateral sound field asymmetry as presented here may not affect signalling in the field...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous cine and electromyographic {{records of}} freely feeding, unanesthetized golden hamsters show that their motion and muscular {{activity}} during mastication {{differ from those}} of albino rats (Weijs, ' 75). Rats show only propalinal motion while hamsters show lateral translation as well. The masticatory muscles of hamsters and rats are generally similar, but their molar dentitions differ. The interlocking molar cusps of hamsters restrict propalinal protrusion and retrusion when the molars are in occlusion; however, hamsters readily unlock occlusion by a twisting movement in the horizontal plane. Rats may perform propalinal movements even with the teeth in occlusion. In mastication the hamstery's jaw moves laterally as well as vertically and anteroposteriorly. Chewing orbits typically reverse after one to three orbits. Reversal begins {{at the start of the}} upstroke and involves a lateral shift in the opposite direction with the mouth closed. Electromyograms show that symmetric and asymmetric activities of closing protrusive and closing retrusive muscles produce a unilateral force couple on both sides. (This couple accompanies a midline <b>closing</b> <b>stroke.)</b> When the mouth is closed, unilateral activity of closing retrusors and closing protrusors also induces lateral translation. A bilateral force couple pits the retrusors of one side against the protrusors on the opposite side. Simultaneous with lateral excursion to the opposite side of midline and the action of these closing muscles, the anterior digastric and lateral pterygoid muscles of one side fire asymmetrically. The mandible moves downward coincidently with bilateral activity of the digastrics and lateral pterygoids. As the jaw opens further, activity differences of the lateral pterygoids accompany a shift of the mandible toward midline. At the end of the downstroke, all masticatory muscles studied are silent. The jaw returns to midline when the adductors fire asymmetrically at the start of closing. Trituration appears to coincide with an initial simple protrusion, which is subsequently accompanied by lateral translation. Different food types are reduced by distint chewing patterns with the differences clearest when the teeth are near occlusion. During gnawing the lateral pterygoids and digastrics fire longer, and the closing muscles fire less strongly. Chewing patterns in golden hamsters appear more generalized than those of rats; the differences may be directly associated with the ability of hamsters to store food in their cheek pouches...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Health Professions, Dept. of Communication Sciences and DisordersOlder adults speak 20 - 30 % {{slower than}} younger adults. A decline in articulatory speed {{capacity}} {{has often been}} suggested; however, direct investigations on speech motor performance have rarely been conducted. Therefore, this study sought to determine if jaw speed capacity is reduced in older adults. This study included 36 female participants in four age groups: young adult, middle-aged, young-old, and very old. Each participant completed a jaw oscillation task at seven metronome paces. Similar to previous studies on upper limb speed capacity, {{participants were asked to}} tap a fixed target with their jaw at each metronome beat. The metronome pace determined the jaw movement duration and the target determined the jaw movement excursions during the experimental conditions. Jaw peak speeds, excursion, and movement durations during the jaw <b>closing</b> <b>strokes</b> were compared between the four age groups. Study outcomes showed that jaw speed capacity was significantly lower in the youngest age group relative to all other age groups. Jaw speed capacity did not significantly differ between middle-aged, young-old, and very old adults. These findings contrasted previous reports of aging studies on limb speed capacity. Further, these findings on jaw speed capacity suggested that jaw peak speed may not be a factor that contributes to a slowed speaking rate in older adults. In the future, jaw speed capacity of male speakers needs to be investigated. Further, aging-related changes in tongue and lip speed capacities also should be determined to gain more comprehensive insights in physiologic factors that may affect speaking rates of older adults...|$|R
