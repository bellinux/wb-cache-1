The research examines seven independent variables, namely the variability of inventory, company size, leverage, gross margin and current ratio, inventory intensity and variability of cost of goods sold. While the dependent variable in this study is the FIFO and average methods. The population of the research is the trading and manufacturing company listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2008 - 2010. The sampling method used in this research are purposive non random sampling. Selected samples are trading and manufacturing company that reported the company's financial statements in a row in 2008 - 2010, using only one <b>method</b> of inventory <b>accounting.</b> In addition, samples were also taken on companies that use a <b>consistent</b> <b>method</b> of <b>accounting</b> for inventories during the period of observation.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the limitations of}} signalling by income increasing <b>accounting</b> <b>methods,</b> such as linear depreciation. Because legislation only allows the discrete choice between linear and accelerated depreciation, signalling by an income increasing <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> is only possible in industries where all firms perform well. The industry characteristics would not influence signalling by the depreciation method if legislation allowed all levels of depreciation. Moreover, successful firms would not signal their type by an income increasing <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> but by an income decreasing <b>accounting</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, the contracting structure, raising the capital by issuing new shares or by the sale of existent shares influences the tax rate environment needed to solve asymmetries in information.

40|$|The {{reasons why}} {{managers}} make certain <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> choices have been explored by accounting researchers for some time. For over ten years, {{much of this}} research {{has been driven by}} positive accounting theory, which is based on the underlying assumption that managers act rationally to maximize their own personal wealth when making <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> choices. This study is an initial attempt to extend positive accounting theory research to a not-for-profit setting; specifically, the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments by colleges and universities is examined. The three objectives of this study are: 1) to determine if the findings of previous research in positive accounting theory hold in the college and university industry, 2) to determine if other institutional characteristics are associated with the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> used for endowment investments, and 3) to provide information to policymakers regarding the accounting for long-term investment by not-for-profit organizations. Data were obtained from 162 four-year colleges and universities. Two regression models were developed to explain the variation in the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> used for investments. The first model contained five variables related to positive accounting theory and the second model contained five variables related to other institutional characteristics. The results of the first model indicate that the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments is related to the factors suggested by positive accounting theory. Government regulations and bonus plan provisions factors were significant and of the expected sign. The political costs factor was also significant but not of the expected sign. The debt covenants factor was not significant. The results of the second model indicate that the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments is related to other institutional characteristics. Specifically, the model found that location, asset allocation in equity investments, and the institution 2 ̆ 7 s auditor had a statistically significant influence on the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method.</b> The research indicates that there are systematic differences in the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for not-for-profit organizations similar to those explained by positive accounting theory for for-profit organizations.

The research produced a theoretical result: it identified groups of factors that determine the choice of tangible fixed asset <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> including a flow chart of the factor and <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> interaction, which can be used to develop a profit increasing or profit decreasing accounting policy. The factors are broken down into factors of the internal and external environment. Financial and human factors are attributable to the internal environment factors, while economic and technological factors are regarded as factors of the external environment. It was found that the financial leverage and the firm value maximization are the key factors in the financial factor group as they affect the management determination to opt for profit increasing tangible fixed asset <b>accounting</b> <b>methods,</b> while technological factors have an effect on profit decreasing tangible fixed asset accounting policy choice.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the implications of}} the discretion in the cut-off point in the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for research and development. Our research problem targets the issues to reduce the existing research gap: - "Does the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for research and development matter when a creditor evaluates a company for a credit granting decision?" - "How does the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for research and development matter in a credit granting decision?" Our study aims to answer these questions by investigating and analyzing the credit granting assessment and by interviewing creditors at the major banks in Sweden. Fictitious case scenarios provide in-depth information about how the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> matter for a credit granting decision. We develop this study by gathering existing material regarding accounting standards, the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> and the credit granting assessment. Previous studies about credit granting and the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> supplement the theoretical material. The approach to this study is a hermeneutic approach that tries to grasp the entire picture of the respondents' opinion about the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods.</b> To gain detailed and extensive information from the respondents, we use a qualitative research with semi-structured interviews. The research sample consists of experienced creditors at the largest banks in Sweden. This is to ensure relevant and informative answers on our questions. We utilise the four case scenarios to encourage the respondents to elaborate upon the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> for R&D. This provides detailed knowledge about how the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> matter for a credit granting decision. The respondent states that abnormal values in the R&D account are suspicious and that investigation and adjustments of these values occurs if necessary. From this summarised statement, we draw the conclusion that the <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> for R&D matter in a credit granting decision. However, we also establish that other factors are more influential on the decision. Furthermore, we find that the creditors examine the content of the R&D <b>account</b> because the <b>methods</b> and its content have different impact on the financial statements. The expense method indicates a negative impact on the credit granting decision if the company cannot carry the costs, while the recognition method gives an appearance of stronger financial statements. However, the recognition method also gives rise to suspicions if the company relies on previous achievements. We conclude that depending on the amount of R&D both methods can be perceived as an advantage and a disadvantage for a credit granting decision, however, our main finding suggests that a revaluation of the abnormal values in the R&D account occurs. From the support of our findings, we believe that our research has accomplished the objective of the study and we therefore believe that we have contributed to the existing knowledge in the subject. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{drawbacks}} of current social and environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> and to present a classification for developing a new accounting model. Design/methodology/approach – The various social and environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> are classified and discussed on the basis of various criteria such as the types of accounting principles and the content and information units utilized. Findings – Current social and environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> utilize different criteria, measurement units and principles, a fact that makes the information provided ambiguous and problematic for a reliable business-society dialogue under a common and understandable context. A new classification is presented based on specific criteria in the prospect of developing a new accounting model. Research limitations/implications – The proposed new classification aiming to develop a new accounting model is a theoretical proposition which should be validated and tested in practice with a series of case studies before it can be recommended as an alternative to current <b>accounting</b> <b>methods.</b> Originality/value – The paper attempts to highlight the drawbacks of the current social and environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> and proposes a new classification for the development of a new accounting model.

Previous studies have made efforts to evaluate direct GHG emissions of nations (a. k. a. production-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method)</b> and GHG emissions caused by the final consumption of nations (a. k. a. consumption-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method),</b> but overlooked downstream GHG emissions enabled by primary inputs of individual nations and sectors (a. k. a. income-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method).</b> Here we show that the income-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> reveals new GHG emission profiles for nations and sectors. The rapid development of mining industries drives income-based GHG emissions of resource-exporting nations (e. g., Australia, Canada, and Russia) during 1995 – 2009. Moreover, the rapid development of sectors producing basic materials and providing financial intermediation services drives income-based GHG emissions of developing nations (e. g., China, Indonesia, India, and Brazil) during this period. The income-based accounting can support supply side policy decisions and provide additional information for determining GHG emission quotas based on cumulative emissions of nations and designing policies for shared responsibilities...|$|R
