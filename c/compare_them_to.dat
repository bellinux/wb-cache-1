5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E

The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E

25|$|In April 2014, a {{first glimpse}} into the epigenetics of the Denisovan was gained with the {{publication}} of the full DNA methylation of the Denisovan and the Neanderthal. The reconstructed DNA methylation map allowed researchers to assess gene activity levels throughout the Denisovan genome and <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> modern humans and to the Neanderthal. The reconstruction was possible thanks to the natural degradation processes of ancient DNA, which leave different signals on methylated vs. unmethylated regions of the genome. The study found ≈200 genes that show distinct regulatory patterns in the Denisovan.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.|$|E

500|$|... "Ode on Indolence" [...] {{comprises}} six stanzas containing ten lines each. The poem discusses {{a morning}} of laziness {{on the part}} of the narrator, during which his attention becomes captivated by three figures he sees in a vision. Beginning with an epitaph taken from Matthew 6:28, the poet introduces the theme of indolence through an excerpt of Jesus's suggestion that God provides for the lilies of the field without making them toil. The poem describes the three figures as wearing [...] "placid sandals" [...] and [...] "white robes", which alludes to the Grecian mythology that commonly appears in the 1819 odes. The images pass the narrator three times, which causes him to <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> images on a spinning urn (line 7). In line 10, the narrator uses the word [...] "Phidian" [...] again as a reference to the Elgin marbles, whose creation was thought to have been overseen by Phidias, a Grecian artist. As the poem progresses, the narrator begins to discuss the intrusion upon his indolence by the figures of Love, Ambition, and Poesy, and he suggests that the images have come to [...] "steal away" [...] his idle days. In the final stanzas, the figure of Poesy is described as a daemon which Helen Vendler suggests poses a direct threat to the idleness the poet wishes to retain. In the final lines, the poet once again rejects the three images: [...] "Vanish, ye phantoms, from my idle spright, / Into the clouds, and never more return!" [...] (lines 39–40) with the intention of once again enjoying the laziness from which the poem obtains its title.|$|E

2500|$|Objective {{measures}} directly assess SA {{by comparing}} an individual's {{perceptions of the}} situation or environment to some [...] "ground truth" [...] reality. Specifically, objective measures collect data from the individual {{on his or her}} perceptions of the situation and <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> what is actually happening to score the accuracy of their SA at a given moment in time. Thus, this type of assessment provides a direct measure of SA and does not require operators or observers to make judgments about situational knowledge on the basis of incomplete information. Objective measures can be gathered in one of three ways: real-time as the task is completed (e.g., [...] "real-time probes" [...] presented as open questions embedded as verbal communications during the task – Jones & Endsley, 2000), during an interruption in task performance (e.g., situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT) – Endsley, 1995a, or the WOMBAT situational awareness and stress tolerance test mostly used in aviation since the late 1980s and often called HUPEX in Europe), or post-test following completion of the task.|$|E

[...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever said we were [...] "pro"." [...] They added that their job as game critics is not to be {{the best of the best}} at any one particular game, but to [...] "be ok at all types of games so we can review and <b>compare</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> help you decide if you want to play them." [...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E
