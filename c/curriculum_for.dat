5|$|The <b>Curriculum</b> <b>for</b> Excellence, Scotland's {{national}} school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework {{for children and}} young people from age 3 to 18. All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study Standard Grades, or Intermediate qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the <b>Curriculum</b> <b>for</b> Excellence. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. A small number of students at certain private, independent schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.|$|E

The programs' curricula are modified {{versions of the}} Core <b>Curriculum.</b> <b>For</b> example, the Fordham College Honors Program offers a Great Books curriculum with seminar-style classes and a senior research thesis in each student's major. Most honors students are inducted into the programs upon admission to the university, though some are invited {{at the end of}} their first year.

5|$|From 1865 until 1918, Briarcliff Manor served {{students}} up to {{the ninth}} grade. Before 1918, Briarcliff students who wanted to proceed to high school would attend the nearby Ossining High School. After 1918, Briarcliff introduced an advanced <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> high school students. In 1923, four students were {{the first in a}} Briarcliff school to receive high school diplomas. In 1928, with the entrance of additional high school students, an extension was added to the Spanish Renaissance-style Grade School for use as Briarcliff High School. The building was located adjacent to the Walter W. Law Memorial Park. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as Granite Springs.|$|E

In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school's offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students.

5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> the music education program.

Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film.

5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National <b>Curriculum</b> <b>for</b> primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

5|$|Robert Stebbins {{was born}} on March 31, 1915, in Chico, California, to parents Cyril Adelbert and Louise Stebbins (née Beck). His father, born in Wisconsin of English descent, was an {{instructor}} at Chico State Normal School who had also published on birds and agriculture, stressing the importance of gardening in education. The oldest of seven children, young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California. His mother, born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School, instilled a sense of artistry in Robert, painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time. When Stebbins was seven, {{his family moved to}} the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father worked on agricultural <b>curriculum</b> <b>for</b> children and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. Around the age of nine, his family moved to Southern California, living first in Pomona, then in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. Stebbins spent time hiking in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains, exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself. Stebbins attended North Hollywood High School, where his father taught hygiene and agriculture. Robert graduated in 1933. He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old. His early work consisted of cartoons: he drew illustrations on classmates' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines, winning several awards.|$|E
