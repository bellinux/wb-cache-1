50|$|A dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (DCP) is a {{metallic}} plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a tension device to a plate or by using a special dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate.</b> However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the tension device and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|E

50|$|Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) {{involves}} {{the implementation of}} implants to guide the healing process of a bone, {{as well as the}} open reduction, or setting, of the bone. Open reduction refers to open surgery to set bones, as is necessary for some fractures. Internal fixation refers to fixation of screws and/or plates, intramedullary bone nails (femur, tibia, humerus) to enable or facilitate healing. Rigid fixation prevents micro-motion across lines of fracture to enable healing and prevent infection, which happens when implants such as plates (e.g. dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate)</b> are used. Open Reduction Internal Fixation techniques often are used in cases involving serious fractures such as comminuted or displaced fractures or, in cases where the bone otherwise would not heal correctly with casting or splinting alone.|$|E
50|$|The plate (harp), {{or metal}} frame, of a piano is usually made of cast iron. A massive plate is advantageous. Since the strings vibrate from the plate at both ends, an insufficiently massive plate would absorb {{too much of}} the {{vibrational}} energy that should go through the bridge to the soundboard. While some manufacturers use cast steel in their plates, most prefer cast iron. Cast iron is easy to cast and machine, has flexibility sufficient for piano use, is much more resistant to deformation than steel, and is especially tolerant of <b>compression.</b> <b>Plate</b> casting is an art, since dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks about one percent during cooling. Including an extremely large piece of metal in a piano is potentially an aesthetic handicap. Piano makers overcome this by polishing, painting, and decorating the plate. Plates often include the manufacturer's ornamental medallion. In an effort to make pianos lighter, Alcoa worked with Winter and Company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an aluminum plate during the 1940s. Aluminum piano plates were not widely accepted, and were discontinued.|$|E

The surgical team successfully implanted a Synthes stainless steel Locking <b>Compression</b> <b>Plate</b> (LCP) and 27 screws into the colt's injured leg to span the comminuted fracture and joints. They used the LCP because its screws thread into the plate to provide maximum strength.

5000|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} is an orthopaedic {{surgical procedure}} {{which aims to}} correct a varus deformation with compartmental osteoarthritis. It is usually reserved for younger patients who are generally more active (1). Angular deformities were first described by Mikulicz-Radecki in 1880. He observed that the axis of the lower extremity passes through the three joints of the hip, knee and ankle in normal individuals and the knee center deviates from this line in angular deformities of the knee. In this case, the medial compartment will bear the weight in genuvarum and lateral compartment will bear weight in genuvalgum, and osteoarthritis will develop in the mentioned compartment. High tibial osteotomy was described first by Jackson in 1958 and has nowadays become a well-established surgery. Coventry, who was a pioneer in this field, has published many reports {{on the results of}} closed wedge HTO (2). Orthopedic dual sliding <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (ODSCP) was designed and introduced for open wedge high tibial osteotomies. The advantages over the conventional techniques are reducing the chance of accidental intra-articular extension of the osteotomy, eliminating the potential risk of unwanted translation or rotation of the bone, ability to readjust the alignment after surgery without the need to remove the bone screws (3). Since the population in most countries is becoming aged, the genuvarum and consequently the resulting osteoarthritis will increase, and if the patient fulfills the criteria, high tibial osteotomy is advisable (4).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{indications}} for surgical {{management of}} fractures {{of the shaft}} of the humerus are clear, but selecting the right implant for internal fixation of humeral fractures has been a dilemma. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six patients (mean age 40. 53 years) with fractures of the shaft of the humerus were followed for 12 to 24 months in a prospective study. Eighteen patients each underwent open reduction and internal fixation with <b>compression</b> <b>plating</b> and ante grade interlock nailing. Clinical and radiographic outcome measures included fracture healing, shoulder and elbow functions, need for additional procedures and any complication such as infection and recovery of radial nerve palsy. The results were analyzed statistically using the SPSS 11. 5 software, with parametric and nonparametric tests. Results: Nine of the fractures treated with <b>compression</b> <b>plating</b> and seven of those treated with interlock nailing achieved union within six months. Though {{there was no significant}} difference in union time between the treatment groups, patients operated with interlock nailing underwent more number of secondary bone grafting procedures to obtain union (six against two). There were 12 patients (66. 6 &#x 0025;) with excellent and good results in the plating group compared to four patients (25 &#x 0025;) in the nailing group.

40|$|With many {{important}} developments {{over the last}} century, nowadays orthopedic bone plate now excels over other types of internal fixators in bone fracture fixation. The developments involve the design, material and implementation techniques of the plates. This paper aims to review the evolution in implementation technique and biomaterial of the orthopedic bone plates. Plates were initially used to fix the underlying bones firmly. Accordingly, <b>Compression</b> <b>plate</b> (CP), Dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (DCP), Limited contact dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (LC-DCP) and Point contact fixator (PC-Fix) were developed. Later, the implementation approach was changed to locking, and the Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) plate was introduced as a result. Finally, {{a combination of both}} of these approaches has been used by introducing the Locking <b>Compression</b> <b>Plate</b> (LCP). Currently, precontoured LCPs are mainly used for bone fracture fixation. In parallel with structure and implementation techniques, numerous advances have occurred in biomaterials of the plates. Titanium and stainless steel alloys are now the most common biomaterials in production of orthopedic bone plates. However, regarding the biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability characteristics of Mg alloys, Ta alloys, SMAs, carbon fiber composites and bioceramics, these materials are considered as potentially suitable for plates. However, due to poor mechanical properties, they have very limited applications. Therefore, further studies are required in future to solve these problems and make them feasible for heavy-duty bone plates...|$|E

30|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) around the turn of this century was founded on the emerging body of evidence that both the bone blood supply and the fracture haematoma should be preserved to optimize the fracture healing process, especially in cases of extra-articular diaphyseal fractures (Tong and Bavonratanavech 2007; Wagner and Frigg 2006). This approach to management of closed diaphyseal fracture in clinical practice has been greatly facilitated by the widespread {{introduction of}} locking bridging plates, as well as new locked nailing technology that respects periosteal blood perfusion. Relative fracture stability can be achieved with a bridging locked plate fixation, leading to secondary bone union with callus formation. One advantage of locked plates is that they {{do not need to be}} accurately contoured to the surface of the underlying bone because the construct stability is largely due the angular stability of the locked screws, and it does not rely on friction between the undersurface of the plate and the bone as is the case with conventional bone plates such as the limited contact dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plates</b> (Babst et al. 2012). Consequently it has been proposed that locked plates produce less disruption of periosteal blood flow in the underlying cortical bone, although this has not been definitely demonstrated experimentally. However, the effects of locked plates and conventional bone plates on the fracture haematoma per se are likely to be similar, and depend more upon the surgical techniques used for fracture reduction and implant placement (Tong and Bavonratanavech 2007). Both locking plates and the limited contact dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plates</b> can be applied with <b>compression</b> <b>plates</b> function (absolute stability) or bridging plate function (relative stability), depending on the degree of fracture comminution.|$|R

40|$|Background: Nonunion of diaphyseal {{fractures}} of the humerus {{are frequently}} seen in clinical practice (incidence {{of up to}} 15 % in certain studies) and osteosynthesis using dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plates,</b> intra medullary nails and Ilizarov fixators have been reported previously. Locking <b>compression</b> <b>plates</b> (LCP) are useful {{in the presence of}} disuse osteoporosis, segmental bone loss and cortical defects that preclude strong fixation. We report a prospective followup study of the outcome of the use of LCP for humeral nonunion following failed internal fixation in which implants other than LCP had been used. Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients with nonunion of humeral shaft fractures following failed internal fixation were included in the study. The mean followup period was 3. 4 years (range: 2. 4 to 5. 7 years) and the minimum followup period was 2 years. Mean age of the patients was 41. 04 years (range: 24 to 57 years). All 24 patients underwent osteosynthesis using LCP and autologous bone grafting (cortico-cancellous iliac crest graft combined with or without fibular strut graft). Main outcome measurements included radiographic assessment of fracture union and pre and postoperative functional evaluation using the modified Constant and Murley scoring system. Results: 23 out of 24 fractures united following osteosynthesis. Average time to union was 16 weeks (range: 10 to 28 weeks). Complications included delayed union (n = 2), transient radial nerve palsy (n = 2) and persistent nonunion (n = 1).

40|$|Background: In a {{retrospective}} study we analysed intra-articular calcaneal fracture treatment by comparing results and complications related to fracture stabilization with nonlocking calcaneal <b>plates</b> and locking <b>compression</b> <b>plates.</b> Materials and Methods: We performed 76 osteosynthesis (67 patients) of intra-articular calcaneal fractures using the standard extended lateral approach from February 2004 to October 2007. Forty-two operations using nonlocking calcaneal plates (group A) were performed {{during the first}} three years, and 34 calcaneal fractures were stabilized using locking <b>compression</b> <b>plates</b> (group B) in 2007. In the Sanders type IV fractures, reconstruction of the calcaneal shape was attempted. Depending on the type of late complication, we performed subtalar arthroscopy in six cases, arthroscopically assisted subtalar distraction bone block arthrodesis in six cases, and plate removal with lateral-wall decompression in five cases. The patients were evaluated by the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale. Results: Wound healing complications were 7 / 42 (17 &#x 0025;) in group A and 1 / 34 (3 &#x 0025;) in group B. No patient had deep osseous infection or foot rebound compartment syndrome. Preoperative size of B&# 966;hler&#x 00 B 4;s angle correlated with postoperative clinical results in both groups. There were no late complications necessitating corrective procedure or arthroscopy until December 2008 in Group B. All late complications ccurred in Group A.
