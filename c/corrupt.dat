40|$|Image {{inpainting}} is {{a challenging}} problem as {{it needs to}} fill the information of the <b>corrupted</b> regions. Most of the existing inpainting algorithms assume that {{the positions of the}} <b>corrupted</b> regions are known. Different from the existing methods that usually make some assumptions on the <b>corrupted</b> regions, we present an efficient blind image inpainting algorithm to directly restore a clear image from a <b>corrupted</b> input. Our algorithm is motivated by the residual learning algorithm which aims to learn the missing infor- mation in <b>corrupted</b> regions. However, directly using exist- ing residual learning algorithms in image restoration does not well solve this problem as little information is available in the <b>corrupted</b> regions. To solve this problem, we introduce an encoder and decoder architecture to capture more useful information and develop a robust loss function to deal with outliers. Our algorithm can predict the missing information in the <b>corrupted</b> regions, thus facilitating the clear image restoration. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental demonstrate that our algorithm can deal with the <b>corrupted</b> regions of arbitrary shapes and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|Impulsive noise removal usually employs median filtering, {{switching}} median filtering, {{the total}} variation L 1 method, and variants. These approaches however often introduce excessive smoothing and {{can result in}} extensive visual feature blurring and thus are suitable only for images with low density noise. A new method to remove noise is proposed in this paper to overcome this limitation, which divides pixels into different categories based on different noise characteristics. If an image is <b>corrupted</b> by salt-and-pepper noise, the pixels are divided into <b>corrupted</b> and noise-free; if the image is <b>corrupted</b> by random valued impulses, the pixels are divided into <b>corrupted,</b> noise-free, and possibly <b>corrupted.</b> Pixels falling into different categories are processed differently. If a pixel is <b>corrupted,</b> modified total variation diffusion is applied; if the pixel is possibly <b>corrupted,</b> weighted total variation diffusion is applied; otherwise, the pixel is left unchanged. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is robust to different noise strengths and suitable for different images, with strong noise removal capability as shown by PSNR/SSIM results as well as the visual quality of restored images...|$|R

40|$|The {{robustness}} to {{noise and}} outliers {{is an important}} issue in linear representation in real applications. We focus on the problem that samples are grossly <b>corrupted,</b> which is also the 'sample specific' corruptions problem. A reasonable assumption is that <b>corrupted</b> samples cannot be represented by the dictionary while clean samples can be well represented. This assumption is enforced in this paper by investigating the coefficients of <b>corrupted</b> samples. Concretely, we require the coefficients of <b>corrupted</b> samples be zero. In this way, the representation quality of clean data can be assured without the effect of <b>corrupted</b> data. At last, a robust dictionary based data representation approach and its sparse representation version are proposed, which have directive significance for future applications.

5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company.

Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot.

40|$|Broadcast, {{also called}} Byzantine Agreement, is a multi-party {{computation}} primitive where a dealer sends his input value {{to a group}} of players. All players must agree on the same output value, even if a part of these players is <b>corrupted</b> by an adversary. Furthermore, when the dealer is not <b>corrupted,</b> the output value of the correct players must be the input value of the dealer. It has been proven that broadcast can be achieved if and only if {{less than a third of}} the players is <b>corrupted.</b> In the case where a PKI which allows players to sign messages is available, protocols have been proposed that achieve broadcast for any number of <b>corrupted</b> players. However, most of these protocols have the drawback that a single <b>corrupted</b> player who can break the signature scheme is sufficient to make the protocol fail.
