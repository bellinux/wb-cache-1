50|$|While {{looking at}} the {{regional}} cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using PET, researcher Semir Zeki directly demonstrated functional specialization within the visual cortex known as visual modularity. He localized regions involved specifically {{in the perception of}} colour and vision motion. For colour, visual area V4 was located when subjects were shown two identical displays, one being multicoloured and the other shades of grey. This was further supported from lesion studies where individuals were unable to see colours after damage, a disorder known as achromatopsia. Combining PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subjects viewing a moving <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> verses a stationary <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> located visual area V5, which is now considered to be specialized for vision motion. (Watson et al., 1993) This area of functional specialization was also supported by lesion study patients who's damage caused cerebral motion blindness.|$|E

5000|$|The hull was {{designed}} {{so that all the}} weight from the guns was upon the keel itself. Joshua Humphreys proposed that only live oak, a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships. The method was to use diagonal riders, eight on each side that sat at a 45 degree angle. These beams of live oak were about two feet wide and around a foot thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts. These ideas were considered revolutionary in the late 18th and early 19th century. A three-layer method was used in which the planks along the sides of the hull were laid horizontally across the frames, making a crossing or <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern.</b> The sides of the ship could be as thick as 25 inches, and were able to absorb substantial damage. The strength of this braced construction earned USS Constitution the nickname [...] "Old Ironsides".|$|E

The constrictions form the entrance and exit of a circular gate-defined ballistic stadium. Close to constrictions we observe sets of regular fringes creating a <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern.</b> Inside the stadium conductance fluctuations governed by chaotic dynamics of electrons are visible. The <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> allows us to determine the number of transmitted modes in the constrictions forming between the tip-induced potential and gate-defined geometry. Spatial investigation of the fringe pattern in a perpendicular magnetic field shows a transition from electrostatic to magnetic depopulation of magnetoelectric subbands.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the past}} decades, video coding {{technologies}} have greatly promoted {{the development of}} digital multimedia contents related industry. To satisfy the rapid increasing demand for high-definition (HD) and ultra-HD (UHD) video contents, a higher requirement for more efficient video coding has been brought forward. In this {{paper we propose a}} new approach for efficient video compression. We mainly focus on intraframe coding that performs compression techniques on any one of the frames in video sequence. A single pixel based lossless prediction (SPLP) along with downsampling and interpolation is used to achieve a better compression ratio compared to existing system. SPLP is an enhancement of H. 264 /MPEG- 4 standard, which employs pulse code modulation for better prediction. Along with SPLP, a <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> downsampling and adaptive weighted interpolation techniques are used to improve the performance...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method for}} the {{fish-eye}} lens calibration is presented. The method required only a 2 D calibration plane containing straight lines i. e., <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> without a priori knowing the poses of camera {{with respect to}} the calibration plane. The image of a line obtained from fish-eye lenses is a conic section. The proposed calibration method uses raw edges, which are pixels of the image line segments, in stead of using curves obtained from fitting conic to image edges. Using raw edges is more flexible and reliable than using conic section because the result from conic fitting can be unstable. The camera model used in this work is radially symmetric model i. e., bivariate non-linear function. However, this approach can use other single view point camera models. The geometric constraint used for calibrating the camera is based on the coincidence between point and line on calibration plane. The performance of the proposed calibration algorithm was assessed using simulated and real data. 1...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} whether glaucomatous visual field defect particularly the pattern standard deviation (PSD) of Humphrey visual field could {{be associated with}} visual evoked potential (VEP) parameters of patients having primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: Visual field by Humphrey perimetry and simultaneous recordings of pattern reversal visual evoked potential (PRVEP) were assessed in 100 patients with POAG. The stimulus configuration for VEP recordings consisted of the transient pattern reversal method in which {{a black and white}} <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> was generated (full field) and displayed on VEP monitor (colour 14 ”) by an electronic pattern regenerator inbuilt in an evoked potential recorder (RMS EMG EP MARK II). RESULTS: The results of our study indicate that there is a highly significant (P < 0. 001) negative correlation of P 100 amplitude and a statistically significant (P < 0. 05) positive correlation of N 70 latency, P 100 latency and N 155 latency with the PSD of Humphrey visual field in the subjects of POAG in various age groups as evaluated by Student’s t -test. CONCLUSION: Prolongation of VEP latencies were mirrored by a corresponding increase of PSD values. Conversely, as PSD increases the magnitude of VEP excursions were found to be diminished...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 60). H. 264 Advanced video coding is {{the newest}} video coding technique for wireless transmission. Video when transmitted over a network is susceptible to channel errors. In order to increase the robustness of the video new error resilient techniques are required. Hence a desired video codec has to accommodate the contradictory requirements which are coding efficiency, robustness to data loss {{as well as other}} limitations such as memory, bandwidth and complexity. My thesis is the study of prioritization scheme in H. 264 video encoded packets over wireless networks. The objective of this research is to efficiently exploit the existing error resiliency features in H. 264 like Data Partition, Flexible Macroblock Ordering, Constrained Intra Prediction, slice structure {{to come up with a}} priority scheme. Classification of macroblocks into slice groups is based on a variation of H. 264 /AVC <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> and Cumulative Mean Square Error (CMSE) of a macroblock scheme to transport packets based on their importance in decoding a video and also in playback. In my thesis different combination of loss patterns are studied. Losses in different frames are induced by prioritizing the slices on the CMSE value. PSNR values are used as a measurement of quality of the video. The different video sequences are chosen to get a wide range of results and to get a better insight of the importance of slices in the sequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{visually}} {{evoked potential}} (VEP) {{is the measure}} of cortically evoked electrical activity that provides information about {{the integrity of the}} optic nerve and the primary visual cortex. The analysis of P- 100 latency and amplitude measurement variability based on visual pathway conduction in VEP has been shown to have clinical utility. The reliable measurement of VEP techniques to do are less well developed. This work presents a technique for a reliable extraction P- 100 latency and amplitude using a wavelet based technique. The challenge of image registration (the process of correctly aligning two or more images accounting for all possible source of distortion) is of general interest in image processing. Several types of VEPs are routinely used in a clinical setting. These primarily differ in a mode of stimulus presentation [...] This registration can be carried out for VEP waveforms of the same subject taken at different times, waves taken under different modalities, and wave pattern which have only a partial overlap area. This research focused on investigating potential registration algorithms for transforming partially overlapping VEP waves which have only a partially overlapping waveform of the retina into a single overlapping composite waveform to aid physicians in assessment of retinal health, and on registering vectors from known common points in the images to be registered. All potential transforms between waveforms are generated, with the correct registration producing a tight cluster of data points in the space of transform coefficients. The technique has been applied to different types of retinal waveforms - B/W <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> (<b>pattern</b> reversal),B/W checker board (flash),LED Goggles (pattern reversal) and LED Goggles(flash) stimulations and the technique can be readily used to provide cross - modal...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a scalable Column-Row-Parallel ASIC architecture for 3 D wearable / portable medical ultrasound. It leverages programmable electronic addressing to achieve linear scaling for both hardware interconnection and software data acquisition. A 16 x 16 transceiver ASIC is fabricated and flip-chip bonded to a 16 x 16 capacitive {{micromachined ultrasonic transducer}} (CMUT) to demonstrate the compact, low-power front-end assembly. A 3 D plane-wave coherent compounding algorithm is designed for fast volume rate (62. 5 volume/s), high quality 3 D ultrasonic imaging. An interleaved <b>checker</b> <b>board</b> <b>pattern</b> with I&Q excitations is also proposed for ultrasonic harmonic imaging, reducing transmitted second harmonic distortion by over 20 dB, applicable to nonlinear transducers and circuits with arbitrary pulse shapes. Each transceiver circuit is element-matched to its CMUT element. The high voltage transmitter employs a 3 -level pulse-shaping technique with charge recycling to enhance the power efficiency, requiring minimum off-chip components. Compared to traditional 2 -level pulsers, 50 % more acoustic power delivery is obtained with the same total power dissipation. The receiver is implemented with a transimpedance amplifier topology and achieves a lowest noise efficiency factor in the literature (2. 1 compared to a previously reported lowest of 3. 6, in unit of mPa - [square root sign]mW/Hz). A source follower stage is specially designed to combine the analog outputs of receivers in parallel, improving output SNR as parallelization increases and offering flexibility for imaging algorithm design. Lastly, fault-tolerance is incorporated into the transceiver to deal with faulty elements within the 2 D MEMS transducer array, increasing yield for the system assembly. by Kailiang Chen. Thesis: Ph.
