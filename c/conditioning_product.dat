Today R 410 A is used to cover most air conditioning applications and all lower GWP alternatives presented to date have some degree of flammability with most being ASHRAE 34 flammability class 2 L. Â A novel R 410 A alternative refrigerant blend, R 452 B or DR 55, has recently been studied in a 4 ton RTU to determine the potential for compositional fractionation in various modes of operation. In addition, the ASHRAE flammability process needed to classify refrigerant flammability and flammability classification data for R 452 B will be presented in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. In {{addition}} to flowers, cut foliage and leafy stems are very valuable florist ma-terial. However, florist greens frequently first loses its ornamental {{value in a}} flower ar-rangement, since it quickly wilts, fades, or browns. That {{is why it is}} important to develop agents for conditioning cut the florist greens that would extend its vase life effectively and inhibit senescence. Here we report on the effect of growth regulators and commercially available conditioning products on the post-harvest longevity of cut stems of Weigela flor-ida 'Variegata Nana ' and certain processes associated with their senescence. Senescence of W. florida cut stems resulted in reduced post-harvest quality, decrease in relative water content (RWC) and an increase in electrolyte leakage (EL) in the leaf tissues. Chrysal Clear 2, applied {{in the form of a}} 24 -hour pre-treatment, was the most effective in extend-ing the longevity of cut stems of W. florida. The same <b>conditioning</b> <b>product</b> also had a beneficial effect on leaf tissue water content and the values of the chlorophyll fluores-cence parameters, including maximum quantum yield and actual photochemical activity. Conditioning of W. florida stems in a solution of gibberellic acid at a concentration of 0. 25 mg · dm- 3 had the most beneficial effect on the cytoplasmatic membranes. However, the highest contentes of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll “a ” and “b”), were found after the 24 -hour pre-treatment of W. florida stems in a solution of 0. 1 mmol · dm- 3 benzy-ladenine and Chrysal Clear 2.

The success of any organization depends {{on the quality of}} product especially right product produced. This work is to be done in small blow moulding company, which manufactures the Air duct for automobile air conditioners. The initial research shows the past trends of rejection is between 8 - 9 % which includes human error in material removal, wrong fitting of clamp, molding defects, etc. the need is to reduce that to compete in highest competitive market and to continuous satisfaction of customer. One of the successful tool for finding the failure mode and its effect in manufacturing process is PFMEA (Product failure mode effect analysis). By PFMEA we can find out how critical the process is and we can take action to reduce the failure in product and improve the manufacturing process. After the complete study of the manufacturing process and production data – failure causes, failure rate, & other relevant data etc, FMEA discovered the weak processes in the form of higher risk priority number in the manufacturing of product, which required reducing by identifying and implementing mitigation actions and this will improve the process and product quality & productivity.

40|$|International audienceToday, {{facility}} cleanup, dismantling and decommissioning activities (D&D²) {{represent a}} mature industry. For CEA facilities in France, {{the results obtained}} on the Grenoble site $^ 1 $ are proof of this, and technological advances such as the implementation of the Maestro system $^ 2 $ confirm it. Process efficiency is based on mastering the three generic phases (high level functions) of any manufacturing industry: storage management, treatment (physical and radiological reduction) and then waste <b>conditioning</b> (<b>product).</b> The procedures have been deployed in complex situations and are adapted {{to meet the challenges of}} different technical configurations: reactor, research laboratories, spent fuel treatment plants, etc. The point in common is the management of a source term (Bq). Each step in a D&D² procedure is controlled depending on the evaluation of the radiological levels involved. Nuclear instrumentation is therefore a major function in the deployment and the mastery of D&D² processes. During facility operation, most of the radiological and physical-chemical characterization equipment for materials at the end of the life cycle is concentrated on the waste packages. These devices are maintained during the D&D² phase. Further measurement and checking apparatus are distributed throughout the facility, from the components in their original positions to the storage of final packages. The functional and logical architecture of this instrumentation is in the form of an instrumentation diagram where the first apparatuses are adapted to characterizing the scenes to dismantle, then on to control cleanup and dismantling procedures, and at the end of the line, to demonstrate that the packages or the facility are free of radiological constraints. Measurements of gamma and neutron rays dominate the non destructive analysis techniques. Gamma spectrometry is the reference technique in D& D². Its deployment has been facilitated by the arrival of detectors which function at ambient temperature (CdZnTe, LaBr 3, etc.). For complex scenes, the gamma spectrum processing result is combined with techniques for the localization of concentration points (hot spots). The combined processing of measurement results is carried out by the use of digital methods for drawing up curves for the yield and the estimation of the uncertainty associated with the quantity of interest. Overall, the characterization of D&D² waste has reinforced the use of coupled methods: physical and chemical analysis, gamma spectrometry, gamma camera and neutron counting...|$|E

When washing hair with sodium lauryl sulfate, significantly more lauryl sulfate is left behind on hair previously treated with cationic detergent han on hair containing no cationic detergent.
