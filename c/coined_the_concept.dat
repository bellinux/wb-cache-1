25|$|Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela {{originally}} <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of autopoiesis within theoretical {{biology to}} describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference. This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising {{a solution to the}} problem of the humanised 'subject'.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections {{for the future}} power of PGD {{in its ability to}} create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E

2500|$|Barth endorses {{the main}} theme from Kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and {{transforms}} the details. Barth expands {{the theory of}} indirect communication {{to the field of}} Christian ethics; he applies <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of unrecognizability to the Christian life. He <b>coins</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of <b>the</b> [...] "paradox of faith" [...] since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.|$|R

30|$|As Kharas (2011) (known for <b>coining</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> “Middle Income Trap”) points out, {{it would}} take 10  years or more for the {{intended}} effects of reform to materialize, including {{the development of a}} capital market, acceleration of innovation and development of higher education, improvement of urban management, livable city construction, formation of the agglomeration effect, effective rule of law, separation of powers, and reduced corruption. Therefore, the protracted nature of the reforms to potential growth rates often leads the decision-makers to return to their tried and trusted economic tricks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we firstly <b>coin</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of ξη-multiple {{fixed point}} and then obtain {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions for a}} class of mixed monotone operators to have this point. We see that these conditions can be considerably loosened for monotone operators acting on pairs of points, which are multiples of the same point. Also when a cone is chosen to be a normal solid cone and monotone operator on interior of the cone, the necessary and sufficient conditions get reduced further. The introduction of adjoint sequence generalizes further the main result...|$|R
