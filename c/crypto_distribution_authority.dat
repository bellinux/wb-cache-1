50|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced in Egypt in 1893, the generation and distribution of electricity was practiced exclusively by private companies. In 1962, the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity were nationalized under three authorities (the Electricity Production <b>Authority,</b> the Electricity <b>Distribution</b> <b>Authority,</b> and the Electricity Projects Implementation Authority) leaving the government as the sole owner and operator of all electrical companies. These three authorities were replaced in 1965 by the public Egyptian Corporation for Electricity which remained active until 1976 when it was converted into the Egypt Electricity Authority as decreed by electricity sector Law no. 12. In 1978 the Egypt Electricity Authority supervised the establishment of seven geographically divided electricity distribution companies. An additional electrical power <b>distribution</b> <b>authority</b> was established in 1983 {{as a means of}} supervising distribution companies which had become independent of the Egypt Electricity Authority.|$|R

Presented Hierarchical Binary Tree (HBT) based model is distributed, self-organizing, scalable {{and does not}} employ online key <b>distribution</b> <b>authority</b> or group manager. Two different group authentication and group key establishment protocols are proposed for the users who form an ad hoc group with distributed trust model.

However, constraints in resources make fully public key operations not affordable on sensor. Three different authenticated key establishment protocols are proposed with an objective of being respectful to constraints. Sensor needs to make only modular or cyclic convolution multiplications, and expensive public key decryption operation is executed at the data processing station side. Schemes require small size of code and achieve the least sensor processing time in comparison with fully public key cryptography based protocols...|$|R

40|$|Composite line-post {{insulators}} {{are being}} used more frequently by the electrical <b>distribution</b> <b>authorities</b> in Australia. The durability of these materials under the extreme environmental conditions encountered in Australia is unknown. An environmental stress chamber was built to investigate the long-term degradation mechanisms of the materials. Within the chamber a number of stresses were applied simultaneously to model glass reinforced plastic insulating rods. The rods were subjected to cantilever mechanical loads and electrical stresses. They were also sprayed with, or immersed in, water as the tests progressed. The temperature of the air surrounding the insulators was also controlled. In this way the stresses which are applied to insulating rods in service were simulated. The environmental stress chamber was linked to a personal computer which monitored and recorded the progression of creep and leakage current. The behavior of silicone modified polyester rods has been examined. The results available to date are presented. The change in the rates of creep with different mechanical loads is discussed. In addition, the uptake of water over prolonged periods has been studied...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 163 - 172. This study {{examines}} {{the involvement of}} public and private sector institutions in the provision of electricity in urban areas of South Africa. Access to electricity in South Africa is highly unequal and little progress is currently being made to bring electricity to all, mainly due to institutional and financial problems. The focus on public and private sector roles is adopted because of the social importance and economic nature of electricity provision, the global and national significance of privatisation policies, and the current importance of allocating appropriate roles to {{the public and private sectors}} in widening access to services, including electricity, in South Africa. The distribution sector of the South African electricity supply industry (ESI) is highly fragmented. Municipal electricity departments, which mostly serve white residential, commercial and industrial areas, are generally highly profitable and provide an effective service, but are not highly efficient by international standards. These departments are self-sufficient in the implementation of electrification projects, and have access to adequate capital to finance such projects. Electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>authorities</b> set up to serve black areas, especially electricity departments of black local authorities, are ineffective, and often financially unsound. Due to the weakness of public authorities charged with the task of undertaking electrification projects in black areas, the implementation of these projects is dependent on the involvement of private electrical consultants and contractors. However, few such projects are currently being undertaken due to inappropriate planning and shortages of concessionary finance. After close consideration of the benefits and drawbacks {{of public and private}} involvement in range of activities that arise from electricity provision, it is concluded that the key challenges facing the ESI in South Africa will best be met if the distribution sector is restructured on a regional basis in order to utilise existing expertise, and retained within the public sector. Accelerated electrification initiatives, planned and co-ordinated by these <b>distribution</b> <b>authorities,</b> would draw upon the experience and capabilities of private electrical consultants and contractors. Public sector leadership in mobilising both public and private investment would also be necessary. Thus, whilst public institutions would be dominant, important roles would remain for the private sector in the provision of electricity in urban areas. The results of this study suggest that far from privatising service provision in South Africa, it will be essential to allocate a dominant role to the public sector in widening access to services to all...|$|R

It is commonly identified as the program. or project management technique and is concerned with the centralization of program decision activity within a single individual who bears the title of Program or Project manager. The objectives of this study are to determine the degree and kinds of authority that this new type of manager has bean given, and to identify factors that regulate the <b>distribution</b> of <b>authority</b> between functional and program managers. These factors are evaluated in terms of their contribution toward optimizing this <b>authority</b> <b>distribution.</b> Two areas of research have bean performed to attain the desired objectives: (1) a study of useful contributions from academic and Government literature and, (2) a survey of the 110 aerospace contractors with the largest dollar. volume business in Government Aerospace contracts. These research tasks have resulted in the identification of seven key principles that can be applied in determining effective <b>authority</b> <b>distribution</b> over a wide range of organizational configurations. They have also contributed to the design of a conceptual medal which when used in conjunction with the seven key principles, provides a general framework for development of workable and effective program/functional mar 1 agerlal authority assignments...|$|R

40|$|Subsidiarity is a {{principle}} in Catholic social thought that informs the <b>distribution</b> of <b>authority</b> among {{levels of the}} political and social order. First expressly articulated by Pope Pius XI in his 1931 encyclical letter Quadragesimo Anno, the roots of the concept go back further to Pope Leo XIII and to Thomistic social theory. But subsidiarity is frequently subject to the criticism that it is vague and indeterminate and thereby an ineffective guide to politics and public policy. Much of the discussion of subsidiarity proceeds as though the principle were merely one of devolution of authority to the local level. Moreover, the principle is often taken to be a procedural norm, counseling “small is better ” regardless of the underlying substantive question to which one is applying the principle of subsidiarity. The thesis of this dissertation is that it is only through an adequate examination of concrete policy issues that subsidiarity’s import can be fully measured and appreciated and only by asking what the common good requires in particular instances through the exercise of political prudence that the proper <b>distribution</b> of <b>authority</b> can be determined. The account of subsidiarity advanced in the dissertation is one of “functional pluralism,...|$|R
