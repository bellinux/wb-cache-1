5|$|Australian {{production}} of the first <b>Commodore</b> launched in 1978 was initially spread between Holden's Pagewood (NSW) and Dandenong (Vic) plants. In August 1978, Holden announced a $6.7 million program to enable assembly of the <b>Commodore</b> range at the Elizabeth (SA) plant, {{which resulted in the}} closure of the Pagewood plant a year later. The Australian {{production of}} the <b>Commodore</b> was consolidated at Elizabeth in 1988, coinciding with the launch of the then new VN <b>Commodore.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of launch in Australia, Ford's BF Falcon {{directly}} competed with the VE <b>Commodore.</b> In November 2006 Toyota released their key Aurion model to the Australian market. The front-wheel drive Mitsubishi 380 also indirectly competed with the Holden <b>Commodore</b> but has since been discontinued.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, <b>Commodore</b> sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the <b>Commodore</b> pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and <b>Commodore</b> towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the <b>Commodore</b> as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E

The Chevrolet SS Sedan was imported to the United States (but again, not to Canada) again for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic Ride Control suspension and a Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission.

5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship <b>Commodore</b> model as Holden Calais, with the <b>Commodore</b> Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and <b>Commodore</b> utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the <b>Commodore</b> and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E

5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL <b>Commodore</b> sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the <b>Commodore</b> further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the <b>Commodore</b> gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E

5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior {{to the second}} generation <b>Commodore</b> of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the second generation <b>Commodore.</b> With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving <b>Commodore</b> and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the <b>Commodore</b> sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Commodore</b> and its {{derivatives}} {{have been}} the basis of modified variants by companies separate to Holden. Officially, Holden's performance partner is HSV, although other prominent high performance brands include HDT Special Vehicles, Corsa Specialized Vehicles (CSV) and Walkinshaw Performance (WP), since the first, third and fourth generation <b>Commodore,</b> respectively.|$|E

5|$|The VE <b>Commodore</b> {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian market, where it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly double that of its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota Corolla in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 has helped to re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total <b>Commodore</b> sales. In 2007 the VE <b>Commodore</b> became the fifth <b>Commodore</b> model to receive the Wheels Car of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|The VS <b>Commodore</b> was {{the last}} of which to be sold as a Toyota Lexcen, as Holden and Toyota ended their model-sharing scheme. The last Lexcens were built during 1997. This model was also sold as the VS <b>Commodore</b> Royale in New Zealand. Similar in {{specification}} to the Calais also sold in New Zealand, the Royale featured a standard VS <b>Commodore</b> body with the front end from the VS Caprice and an Opel 2.6-litre 54-Degree V6 engine. The Royale was also sold between 1995 and 1997 in small numbers to Malaysia and Singapore as the Opel Calais.|$|E

5|$|At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers {{secured the}} license to publish home {{conversions}} of the Q*bert arcade game. Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600, {{and by the}} end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, the Atari 8-bit computer family, <b>Commodore</b> VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and <b>Commodore</b> 64. The release of the <b>Commodore</b> 64 version was noted to lag behind the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop electronic game. It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item. Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.|$|E
