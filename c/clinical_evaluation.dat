25|$|Elevated {{expression}} {{levels of}} urokinase {{and several other}} components of the plasminogen activation system {{are found to be}} correlated with tumor malignancy. It is believed that the tissue degradation following plasminogen activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to metastasis.

[...] Polysomy 17 may complicate the interpretation of HER2 testing results in cancer patients. [...] Chromosome 17 polysomy may not be present when the centromere is amplified, so it was later discovered that polysomy 17 is rare.

Artificial liver support like liver dialysis or bioartificial liver support concepts are currently under preclinical and <b>clinical</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Virtually all liver transplants {{are done in}} an orthotopic fashion, that is, the native liver is removed and the new liver {{is placed in the}} same anatomic location. The transplant operation can be conceptualized as consisting of the hepatectomy (liver removal) phase, the anhepatic (no liver) phase, and the postimplantation phase. The operation is done through a large incision in the upper abdomen. [...] The hepatectomy involves division of all ligamentous attachments to the liver, as well as the common bile duct, hepatic artery, hepatic vein and portal vein.

2500|$|Bradykinesia and akinesia: [...] {{the former}} is {{slowness}} of movement, while the latter {{is the absence of}} it. It is the most characteristic clinical feature of PD, and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. The performance of sequential and simultaneous movements is also hindered. Bradykinesia is the most disabling symptom {{in the early stages of}} the disease. Initial manifestations of bradykinesia are problems when performing daily life tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing, sewing, or getting dressed. <b>Clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> is based in similar tasks consisting such as alternating movements between both hands or feet. Bradykinesia is not equal for all movements or times. It is modified by the activity or emotional state of the subject to the point of some patients who are barely able to walk being capable of riding a bicycle. Generally, patients have less difficulties when some sort of external cue is provided.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis of Rhythmic Movement Disorder {{is done on}} an exclusionary {{basis in}} which other closely related {{movement}} disorders are systematically ruled out. Because of this, a thorough <b>clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> is necessary. Often, impairments are not severe enough to warrant this process and so RMD is not often diagnosed unless there are extremely interfering or disabling symptoms. Many patients do not seek treatment for RMD directly and most seek professional help to alleviate sleep-affecting symptoms. To compound the issue, many sufferers are often misdiagnosed as having Restless Legs Syndrome or sleep apnea {{or some combination of}} the two. Rhythmic Movement Disorder differs from Restless Legs Syndrome in that RMD involves involuntary contractions of muscles with no urge or uncomfortable sensation to provoke such movement. Additionally, 80-90% of Restless Legs Syndrome sufferers show periodic limb movements as observed on a polysomnogram, which are not common in RMD patients. Rhythmic Movement Disorder can also have symptoms that overlap with epilepsy. However, use of a polysomnogram can help distinguish one disorder from the other as RMD involves movements in both REM and NREM sleep, which is unusual for seizures ...|$|E
2500|$|... p38α MAPK {{constitutes}} the main p38 MAPK activity in heart. [...] During cardiomyocyte maturation in new born mouse heart, p38α MAPK activity can regulate myocyte cytokinesis and promote cell cycle exit. while inhibition of p38 MAPK activity leads to induction of mitosis in both adult and fetal cardiomyocyte. Therefore, p38 MAPK {{is associated with}} cell-cycle arrest in mammalian cardiomyocytes and its inhibition may represent a strategy to promote cardiac regeneration in response to injury. [...] In addition, p38α MAPK induction promotes myocyte apoptosis. via downstream targets STAT1, CHOP, FAK, SMAD, cytochrome c, NF-κB, PTEN, and p53. p38 MAPK can also target IRS-1 mediated AKT signaling and promotes myocyte death under chronic insulin stimulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity confers cardioprotection against ischemia reperfusion injury in heart However, some reports demonstrated that p38 MAPK also involves in anti-apoptotic effect via phosphorylation of αβ-Crystallin or induction of Pim-3 during early response to oxidative stress or anoxic preconditioning respectively [...] More interestingly, p38α MAPK and p38β MAPK appear to have an opposite role in apoptosis. Whereas p38α MAPK has a pro-apoptotic role via p53 activation, p38β MAPK has a pro-survival role via inhibition of ROS formation. [...] In general, chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity is viewed as pathological and pro-apoptotic, and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is in <b>clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> as a potential therapy to mitigate acute injury in ischemic heart failure. [...] p38 MAPK activity is also implicated in cardiac hypertrophy which is a significant feature of pathological remodeling in the diseased hearts and a major risk factor for heart failure and advert outcome. [...] Most in vitro evidence supports that p38 MAPK activation promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. [...] However, in vivo evidence suggest that chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity triggers restrictive cardiomyopathy with limited hypertrophy, while genetic inactivation p38α MAPK in mouse heart results in an elevated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload [...] or swimming exercise. [...] Therefore, the functional role of p38 MAPK in cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial and yet to be further elucidated.|$|E
