40|$|The {{impact of}} {{diseases}} {{caused by a}} wide range of pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) is the most important problem in aquaculture of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Genetic selection aimed at obtaining population of more resistant common carp is potential and sustainable approach to disease control in semi-intensive carp pond farming. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are candidate marker genes for studies on association with disease resistance. The MHC contains some of the most polymorphic genes known to date and are considered crucial to adaptive immunity. MHC molecules bind both self and foreign peptides and present them to T lymphocytes (T cells). MHC class I molecules present endogenously derived peptides to CD 8 + T cells, while MHC class II molecules present exogenously derived peptides to CD 4 + T cells. Each MHC molecule has the ability to bind and present different groups of peptides in more or less successful ways. This can influence the immune response of an organism since the peptides derived from a certain pathogen may either not be presented by specific MHC molecules, which can result in higher susceptibility or, may be bound with a high affinity by specific MHC molecules which could lead to increased resistance to the pathogenic organism. In teleosts, unlike to humans, tetrapods and cartilaginous fish, class I and class II genes are not linked and segregate independently, which allows for association studies of only class I or only class II MH genes with disease resistance. MHC class II molecules generally have a broader spectrum of action in the immune system than the MHC class I genes. There are also observations that suggest a more intense selection pressure and a more rapid evolution of MH class II than class I alleles in fish. Although the expression of both MH class II chains is equivalent, the beta chain generally has a higher degree of polymorphism than the alpha chain. This thesis addressed possible implementations of MH class II B genes for selection aimed at improving of a common carp resistance in semi-intensive pond farming. In common carp there are two paralogous groups of MH class II B genes, Cyca- DAB 1 -like and Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes. In a preliminary study, we examined the polymorphism for the Cyca-DAB 1 -like and Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes in different European common carp lines (chapter 2). These carp lines were of various geographical origins and part of <b>carp</b> <b>live</b> gene bank, which is maintained at the Institute of Ichthyobiology and Aquaculture in Gołysz. Previous observations over a period of at least 15 years revealed significant differences between lines in survival rate and parasite load under natural conditions. Also, differences in resistance to atypical Aeromonas salmonicida in laboratory based challenge tests was observed, suggesting genetic differences in resistance between the carp lines. Analysis of polymorphism of MH class II B genes in selected carp lines revealed a ubiquitous presence and high polymorphism of Cyca-DAB 1 -like but not Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes. The observed allelic polymorphism for Cyca-DAB 1 -like genes rather than Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes stimulated further studies into the association of Cyca-DAB 1 -like allelic polymorphism and disease resistance of common carp. In order to study association between Cyca-DAB 1 -like gene polymorphism and resistance of common carp we optimized a technique designated polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragments- single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-RFSSCP) to be able to screen and type large numbers of individual carp (chapter 3). The advantages of this technique are simplicity, high sensitivity and low costs. PCR-RFSSCP analysis of n = 79 carp individuals from 8 lines challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila revealed the presence of different genotypes consisting of unique combinations of Cyca-DAB 1 and Cyca-DAB 2 sequences. We found four alleles for the Cyca-DAB 1 (* 02 -* 05) gene but only one allele for Cyca-DAB 2 (* 02). We noted that the Cyca-DAB 2 gene was either homozygous or absent. The degree of heterozygosity of the Cyca-DAB 1 and Cyca-DAB 2 genes clearly correlated with the number of SSCP bands. Thus, we proved that PCR-RF-SSCP is a reliable technique {{that can be used for}} screening large number of individuals for investigating the Cyca-DAB 1 and Cyca-DAB 2 genes polymorphism in common carp. Previously, we performed a long-term divergent selection of common carp for antibody production, which successfully resulted in carp lines with a different immune response. We studied the segregation of Cyca-DAB genes with the DNP-specific antibody response and we showed that the presence of Cyca-DAB 1 -like, but not Cyca- DAB 3 -like genes, preferentially leads to a high DNP-specific antibody response in carp (chapter 4). Background genes other than Cyca-DAB genes also influenced the level of antibody response. We also studied the transcription of both Cyca-DAB 1 -like and Cyca- DAB 3 -like genes in different organs of carp. The constitutive transcription for both Cyca-DAB 1 -like and Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes was high, although Cyca-DAB 1 -like genes consistently showed slightly higher mRNA transcription than Cyca-DAB 3 -like genes in some immunological relevant organs. Sequence information, constitutive transcription levels and co-segregation data indicated that both paralogous Cyca-DAB 1 -like and Cyca-DAB 3 -like groups represent functional MH class II B genes. We then proceeded to study association of Cyca-DAB 1 -like genotypes with resistance to four different pathogens; the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, the ectoparasite Argulus japonicus, and the blood parasite Trypanoplasma borreli (chapter 5) and the viral pathogen Cyprinid herpesvirus- 3 (CyHV- 3) (chapter 6). We used a large number of individuals of different carp lines and revealed, using PCR-RF-SSCP, the presence of n = 9 unique Cyca-DAB 1 -like genotypes, of which three genotypes (B, D, and E) were most common (chapter 5). In general, Cyca-DAB 2 was often homozygous or absent while allelic polymorphism was detected in Cyca-DAB 1 gene. We could detect significant associations between genotype E and abundance of A. japonicus and between genotype D and higher level of parasitaemia after T. borreli infection. We also observed a significant association between Cyca-DAB 1 heterozygosity and lower level of parasitaemia after T. borreli infection. In chapter 6, we showed a strong association between Cyca-DAB 1 -like genotypes and resistance or susceptibility to CyHV- 3. One genotype (E) performed significantly better, resulting in carp more resistant to CyHV- 3, while three other genotypes (B, H and J) could be linked to higher susceptibility to the virus. Subsequent analysis of the alleles that compose the Cyca-DAB 1 -like genotypes linked one particular allele (Cyca-DAB 1 * 05) to significantly increased, and two alleles (Cyca-DAB 1 * 02 and Cyca-DAB 1 * 06) to significantly decreased resistance to CyHV- 3. The resistant genotype E did not comprise the Cyca-DAB 2 gene and consisted of a homozygous Cyca-DAB 1 * 05 allele. Phylogenetic analysis of all Cyca-DAB 1 alleles showed that the Cyca-DAB 1 * 05 allele represents the oldest allele in our study (chapter 7). We discussed the possibility for using Cyca-DAB 1 allelic polymorphism as a potential genetic marker in future breeding programs of common carp (chapter 7). We expect that selection of carp for particular MH class II B genotypes or alleles could allow for an increased survival upon challenge with selected pathogens and possibly, increased survival rate under pond conditions...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine environmental parameters thought to affect cannibalism in certain fish species. It was found that environmental, behavioural, genetic and physiological factors all affect cannibalism in the species exhibiting the phenomenon. The diversity of factors nfluencing cannibalism served to illustrate the complexity of this behaviour pattern. Feeding to satiation was found to suppress cannibalism in catfish, trout and koi carp. High population densities were found to increase the rate of cannibalism, thereby acting as a population regulation mechanism for catfish, trout and the common and koi <b>carps.</b> <b>Live</b> food, as compared with dry pelletized feed was found to significantly suppress cannibalistic aggression. Catfish grown in total darkness, provided with refuges and living in turbid conditions were found to exhibit lowered cannibalistic and territorial aggression. Various lines of evidence suggested that cannibalism has a genetic basis, as was shown by the differences in cannibalistic behaviour of the two strains of Cyprinus carpio, viz. common and koi carp, with cannibalism being higher in the latter. This finding substantiates the hypothesis that cannibalism is genetically controlled and therefore open to evolutionary change. It is concluded that cannibalism is adaptive in times of food limitation, but that it is merely a by-product of normal feeding behaviour when food is abundant. Since cannibalism is advantageous and thus adaptive, the question arises ai to whether selection is occurring at the individual or the population level (or both). It was concluded that it is acting at the individual level, and that any benefits accruing at the population level iv were simply the effect of the initial cause, viz. individual selection. One of the aims {{of this study was to}} determine whether cannibalistic tendencies in fish are influenced by differing life history style trajectories. Based on the results of this study it is hypothesized that cannibalism is an r-selected trait. wi th the understanding gained from the knowl edge of the fundamental principles governing cannibalism, certain recommendations for its control in fish culture could be made. It is, however, imperative that further intensive studies be carried out to understand more fully this complex subject. General "rules" for regulating cannibalism could be helpful for any given cannibalistic species. However, in considering the differing life-history styles of each species, it becomes evident that species-specific guidelines need to be worked out. Until then, any suggestions for cannibalistic control offered to the aquaculturist can only serve as unrefined tools. ...|$|R

40|$|An eco-hydraulic {{model was}} used to {{determine}} the levels of fish habitat suitability in the fluvial and lacustrine regions of a new Eco-City. This model has been developed by combining a depth integrated hydrodynamic and water quality model with a habitat suitability index model. Carps were selected as the target species because they represent the major fish population in the study area. Water depth, flow velocity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used as the suitability indicators. Hydrologic data recorded during 2001 – 2010 were analysed to determine the base flow, average flow and high flow rates, which were used to represent the discharges in the river for the three stages of the carp life cycle: overwintering, spawning and growth, respectively. Numerical model simulations were undertaken to determine the levels of habitat suitability for <b>carps</b> to <b>live</b> at these three life stages. The model results indicate that under the current flow regime the habitat suitability level in the lacustrine region is too low for carps at the growth and overwintering stages. DO depletion, overriding the role of velocity and depth, is attributed to the poorly suited habitat conditions in the lacustrine region. To improve the suitability conditions in the lacustrine region, a DO enhancement scheme was used. Model results show that the scheme has significantly enhanced the water quality, with the ideally suited area increased from 24. 4 % to 67. 9 % for the overwintering stage and from 44. 5 % to 77. 5 % for the growth stage. Due to the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region, further numerical model simulations were undertaken to investigate the effect of flow augmentation on the carp spawning habitat suitability. Non-traditional water obtained from recycled domestic and industrial wastewater in the Eco-City was used as an additional water resource. The analysis indicates that the Eco-City has sufficient non-traditional water to meet the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region...|$|R

Poor old Twoshoes is so old and toothless and quaky, that she can't sing a bit; but don't be giving yourself airs over her, because she can't sing and you can. Make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth. Set that old kettle to sing by our hob. Warm her old stomach with nut-brown ale and a toast laid in the fire. Be kind to the poor old school-girl of ninety, who has had leave to come out for a day of Christmas holiday. Shall there be many more Christmases for thee? Think of the ninety she has seen already; the four-score and ten cold, cheerless, nipping New Years! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromatin}} threads, {{which we}} described briefly {{several years ago}} (1), have since then been studied carefully both morphologically and chemically. We now consider these microscopic threads of chromatin to be isolated chromosomes (2). From certain animal cells such masses of isolated chromosomes can be prepared that, with respect to quantity of material available, no special methods are required for chemical investigation. It need hardly be said that interest in the chemical properties of this material is greatly enhanced {{by the knowledge that}} the material consists of chromosomes, for this provides the chemical studies with a background acquired by several generations of cytological investigation of chromosomes. In this paper the preparation of isolated chromosomes is described and evidence is presented that the bodies isolated are indeed chromosomes. Preparation of Isolated Chromosomes. [...] Chromosomes were first isolated from fish erythrocytes and their isolation from this source is simpler than from any other. Erythrocytes of the salmon and carp have been used. Of these the salmon is to be preferred, being a much larger fish, but for most investigators the carp is far more readily available. In some cities large, <b>live</b> <b>carp</b> can be had in the fish stores. Blood is withdrawn from the caudal vein with a syringe, mixed with oxalate, and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5000 R. P. ~. A white sediment, consisting of leucocytes, is obtained. The red cells are mixed with three volumes of 0. 14 ~ NaC 1 and centrifuged. This time the sediment consists of red cells. The red cells are well washed with saline. Finally, suspended in a large volume of saline, they are placed in a Waxing mixer for 4 minutes. All the cells and nearly all the nuclei are broken by this treatment, so that on centrifuging a clear red supernatant and a nearly colorless precipitate are obtained. The precipitate, suspended in saline, is placed in the mixer for 1 minute and centrifuged again. Washing is continued in this manner until the supernatant is colorless and at this time the precipitate is also nearly colorless. It consists of chromosomes isolated from the erythrocyte nucleus (Figs. 5 and 6). The whole procedure is carried out in a cold room kept at abou...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Eco-City, {{which is}} {{designed}} with consideration for environmental impact and is inhabited by people dedicated to minimisation of required inputs of energy, air pollution and water pollution, {{has emerged as a}} way to address sustainability issues by adapting it to their local needs and context. The sustainability of urban water resources, water recycling and more efficient use of water resources will be the key features of the Eco-City. The current study takes Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City as an example to investigate the sustainable use of water resources which focus on non-traditional water usage and ecological water requirements assessment. Firstly, the potential non-traditional water supply was evaluated based on the data acquired from the gauging station and the Eco-City planning data. It was found that rainwater has a great potential for domestic use in the Eco-City from June to September. Differing from other water consumption, ecological demand of the river lake system in the Eco-City was analysed by minimum ecological water requirements determination. An improved wetted perimeter method was used {{in order to determine the}} minimum ecological water requirements in the river system. It was found that the current monthly flow rates, with the exception of January to March, are fairly satisfactory. Secondly, an idealised river-lake system was assessed by hydraulics laboratory experimentation and 2 D numerical modelling. The experimental and numerical investigations described in this study were undertaken to improve understanding of the hydrdynamic and flushing process within such a river lake system. A water diversion scheme was implemented in order to study lake recharge by river water during dry periods and under augmented flows. Fluorescent tracer experiments and related computer simulations were conducted to assess the performance of different parts of the system before and after implementing the diversion scheme. The results showed that such measures improved flushing, as seen from the perspective of reducing the mean detention time. However, due to poor cross-sectional velocity distribution, recharge alone had little impact on the overall mixing level in the lake waters. The effect of inserting flow deflectors near the lake inlet combined with flow augmentation was then assessed and was found to positively affect the distribution of solutes, by mitigating the occurrence of dead zones. Finally, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat suitability in the fluvial and lacustrine regions of a new Eco-City. This model has been developed by combining a depth integrated hydrodynamic and water quality model with a Habitat Suitability Index model. Carps were selected as the target species as they represent the major fish population in the study area. Hydrologic data recorded during 2001 - 2010 were analysed to determine the base flow, average flow and high flow rates, which were used to represent the discharges in the river for the three stages of the carp life cycle: overwintering, spawning and growth, respectively. Numerical model simulations were undertaken to determine the levels of habitat suitability for <b>carps</b> to <b>live</b> at these three life stages. The model results indicated that under the current flow regime the habitat suitability level in the lacustrine region is too low for carps at the growth and overwintering stages. DO depletion, overriding the role of velocity and depth, was attributed to the poorly suited habitat conditions in the lacustrine region. To improve the suitability conditions in the lacustrine region, a DO enhancement scheme was used. Model results showed that the scheme has significantly enhanced the water quality in the lacustrine region. Due to the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region, further numerical model simulations were undertaken to investigate the effect of flow augmentation on the carp spawning habitat suitability...|$|R

Great ecological benefit will be gained if effective barriers {{can be constructed}} to control the movement of invasive common carp. Carp feeding habits lead to an over-enrichment of nutrients in lakes that dramatically reduces water quality and ecosystem health. Bajer et al. [2010] demonstrated that in Minnesota lakes, juvenile carp are recruited from nursery lakes to larger water bodies through small connecting channels. Reducing juvenile carp recruitment {{through the use of}} a barrier at the entrances to the interconnecting channels could prove useful in an integrated carp management plan for the entire watershed. Current barrier technologies are not well suited for these sites due to the shallow water and rapidly changing water level. This research focuses on the use of bubble curtain barriers, which has been relatively ignored in previous barrier studies, as a barrier technology that shows promise for this application. Bubble curtains generate distinct acoustic and hydrodynamic fields, and through proper manipulation could be used to deter juvenile carp migration. The initial stage of the barrier design was to quantify and measure the physical fields generated by a bubble curtain. An understanding of the physical fields helps to design full barrier systems by exploiting certain features of the bubble curtains. Experimental data revealed that a coarse-bubble curtain created a weaker flow field, but a stronger acoustic field than a fine-bubble diffuser. The subsequent stage of research included barrier tests with <b>live</b> <b>carp</b> using a PIT tag tracking system, which allowed quantification of carp passage over a barrier sans video recording. Three incrementally stronger bubble barriers were designed. A single diffuser design exhibited a mildly retarding effect of carp passage time (passages were delayed 10 - 15 sec) but not on the actual number passage attempts. Two separate multi-diffuser barriers (varying in configuration and air-supply) exhibited approximately a 75 % decrease in carp passages, in upstream and downstream directions. The reduction of passes for each barrier was calculated by taking the ratio of the number of passages during a barrier-on trial to the number of passages during a control (barrier-off) trial. Carp mobility remained constant between tests, indicating that the two larger barriers did not limit total carp activity, but limited carp passage over the barrier. This research represents the first stage of characterization of bubble curtain features with respect to carp sensory systems and rigorous testing of bubble barriers under controlled laboratory settings. The experimental results suggest that bubble barriers create a flexible barrier that appears to deter juvenile carp movement in shallow channels, and may prove to be an effective tool in an integrated carp management plan...|$|R
