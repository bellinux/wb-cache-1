It is the twelve-point sphere and besides the <b>centroids</b> of the four faces of the reference tetrahedron, it passes through four substitute Euler points, {{one third of the}} way from the Monge point toward each of the four vertices. Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.|$|E
500|$|Another {{distance}} measure {{commonly used}} in agglomerative clustering is {{the distance between the}} <b>centroids</b> of pairs of clusters, also known as the weighted group method. It can be calculated easily in constant time per distance calculation. However, it is not reducible. For instance, if the input forms the set of three points of an equilateral triangle, merging two of these points into a larger cluster causes the inter-cluster distance to decrease, a violation of reducibility. Therefore, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm will not necessarily find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm. Nevertheless, [...] writes that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm provides [...] "a good heuristic" [...] for the centroid method.|$|E

The weighted <b>centroid</b> localization offers a fast and simple algorithm for the location equipment in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm derives from the <b>centroid</b> measurement and calculation device of the adjacent anchor in the average coordinate. After the analysis of the radio propagation loss model, the most appropriate log-distance distribution model is selected to simulate the signal propagation. Based on the <b>centroid</b> algorithm and the weighted <b>centroid</b> algorithm, this paper proposes an ellipse <b>centroid</b> localization algorithm. This algorithm makes use of ellipse’s characteristic to estimate the unknown node’s coordinate. The main idea of ellipse <b>centroid</b> localization algorithm is the precision control factor that can control the algorithm’s location precision. In ellipse <b>centroid</b> localization algorithm, node is extended as anchor in order to strengthen anchor density’s dynamic characteristic.

2500|$|Libraries {{of these}} {{fragments}} are constructed from {{an analysis of}} the Protein Data Bank (PDB). First, a representative subset of the PDB is chosen which should cover a diverse array of structures, preferably at a good resolution. Then, for each structure, every set of n consecutive residues is taken as a sample fragment. The samples are then clustered into k groups, based upon how similar they are to each other in spatial configuration, using algorithms such as k-means clustering. The parameters n and k are chosen according to the application (see discussion on complexity below). The <b>centroids</b> of the clusters are then taken to represent the fragment. Further optimization can be performed to ensure that the centroid possesses ideal bond geometry, as it was derived by averaging other geometries.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{buoyancy}} compensator of a scuba diver is inflated at {{the surface}} to provide positive buoyancy, {{the positions of the}} centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity of the diver are generally different. The vertical and horizontal separation of these <b>centroids</b> will determine the static trim of the diver {{at the surface}}. The diver can usually overcome the trimming moment of buoyancy, but this requires constant directed effort, albeit usually not a great deal of effort. This allows a conscious [...] diver to adjust trim to suit the circumstances such as the choice between swimming face down or face up, or remaining vertical for best field of view or visibility. The position of the diver's centre of gravity is determined by the distribution of weight, and buoyancy is determined by the equipment in use, particularly the buoyancy compensator, which can significantly influence centre of buoyancy shifts as it is inflated and deflated. Stable trim implies that the centre of buoyancy is directly above the centre of gravity. Any horizontal offset will generate a moment which will rotate the diver until the equilibrium condition is restored.|$|E

This is easy to realize with good robustness; however, locating accuracy varies with weight. There is no conclusion as to the relationship between weight and <b>centroiding</b> accuracy. To find this relationship and thus acquire the highest achievable accuracy of <b>centroiding,</b> one must first derive the general model of <b>centroiding</b> as follows. (1) Set weighting as a function that includes the grayscale intensity of each pixel and two undetermined parameters α and β. The centers were calculated from the new weights. (2) Design an accuracy evaluation method for <b>centroiding</b> based on a virtual straight-line target to obtain the accuracy of <b>centroiding</b> with various parameters. With these parameter values and accuracy records, the accuracy-parameter curve can be fitted. In the end, simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the accuracy improvement of this variable-weighted grayscale <b>centroiding</b> compared with traditional <b>centroiding.</b> The experimental result shows that the parameter α contributes significantly to accuracy improvement. When α = 1. 5, locating accuracy is 1 / 170 pixels.
