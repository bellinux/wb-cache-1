5|$|Algebraic {{solutions}} to Apollonius' problem were pioneered in the 17th century by René Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, although their solutions were rather complex.

We seek to interpret <b>Cauchy's</b> proof, and discuss the related epistemological questions involved in comparing distinct interpretive paradigms. <b>Cauchy's</b> proof is often interpreted in the modern framework of a Weierstrassian paradigm.

5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via <b>Cauchy</b> sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|The {{step from}} rationals to reals {{is a major}} extension. There {{are at least two}} popular ways to achieve this step, both {{published}} in 1872: Dedekind cuts and <b>Cauchy</b> sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cauchy</b> {{was the son}} of Louis François <b>Cauchy</b> (1760–1848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. <b>Cauchy</b> had two brothers, Alexandre Laurent <b>Cauchy</b> (1792–1857), {{who became}} a {{president}} of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and Eugene François <b>Cauchy</b> (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.|$|E

Despite its emblematic status {{in the history of}} mathematical analysis and, indeed, of modern mathematics as a whole, <b>Cauchy’s</b> introduction has been more a source for suggestive quotations than an object of study in its own right. <b>Cauchy’s</b> short mathematical metatext offers a rich snapshot of a scholarly paradigm in transition. A close reading of <b>Cauchy’s</b> writing reveals the complex modalities of the author’s epistemic positioning, particularly with respect to the geometric study of quantities in space, as he struggles to refound the discipline on which he has staked his young career...|$|R

25|$|Cauchy's father (Louis François <b>Cauchy)</b> {{was a high}} {{official}} in the Parisian Police of the New Régime. He lost his position because of the French Revolution (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born. The <b>Cauchy</b> family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1793-4) by escaping to Arcueil, where <b>Cauchy</b> received his first education, from his father. After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-François <b>Cauchy</b> found himself a new bureaucratic job in 1800, and quickly moved up the ranks. When Napoleon Bonaparte came to power (1799), Louis-François <b>Cauchy</b> was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known {{for his work on}} mathematical physics). The famous mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the <b>Cauchy</b> family.|$|E

25|$|During his civil {{engineering}} days, <b>Cauchy</b> {{once had been}} briefly in charge of repairing {{a few of the}} Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister <b>Cauchy</b> started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. <b>Cauchy</b> did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to Baron, a title by which <b>Cauchy</b> set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and <b>Cauchy</b> was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.|$|E
