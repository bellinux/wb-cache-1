The Downsizing of internal combustion engines (ICE) is al-ready recognized as a very suitable method for the concurrent enhancement of the indicated fuel conversion efficiency (IFCE) and lowering of the CO 2 and NOx emissions [1], [2]. In this report the Ultra-Downsizing is introduced as a still higher development stage of ICE. The Ultra-Downsizing will be implemented here by means of real Atkinson cycles, using asymmetrical <b>crank</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> combined with a very inten-sive multistage high-pressure turbocharging with intensive intercooling. This will allow an increase of ICE performance while keeping the thermal and mechanical strain strength of engine components within the current usual limits.

50|$|A similar implement, {{the foot}} press or foot screw, {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} horizontal iron plates slowly tightened around the bare foot by means of a <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> to crush the bones. Although it was quite standard to line the lower plate with ribs to prevent the foot from popping out of the grip of the instrument as it became sweatier, a crueler variant of this device - typically encountered in Nuremberg, Germany - lined the upper plate with hundreds of sharp spikes. A version from Venice, sometimes called the foot screw or toe breaker, connected the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> to a drill that slowly mutilated the foot by boring a hole {{through the center of the}} instep as the press was tightened. The instrument was of sufficient power and cruelty to pulverize the tiniest of toe bones.|$|E
