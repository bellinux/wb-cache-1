This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth.

5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} {{is that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> it {{correctly}} so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{proposed}} to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, general relativity states that gravitational fields have energy, and special relativity concludes that energy {{is equivalent to}} mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The nuclear forces also have this self-interacting property.|$|E

25|$|Institutionalized {{cultural}} capital comprises an institution's formal {{recognition of a}} person's {{cultural capital}}, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is {{in the labor market}} (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a heuristic (practical solution) with which the seller <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> his or her cultural capital to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, {{space and}} time are different categories and refer to absolute {{space and time}}. That conception {{of the world is}} a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. The four dimensions of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe string theory, eleven dimensions <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> supergravity and M-theory, and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space.|$|E
