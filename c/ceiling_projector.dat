50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV lift systems, {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} lift systems. These projector lift systems may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the <b>projector</b> <b>ceiling</b> light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector lift system is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. <b>Projector</b> <b>ceiling</b> lift systems are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|R

The museum asked for designs that would provide the visitor with an inspiring view of the large central atrium of the Guggenheim building. ATN suggested an installation design that made use of a sparkling curtain of Swarovski crystals falling from the <b>ceiling.</b> A special <b>projector</b> light on the crystals would then generate a vertical rainbow of colours across the atrium.|$|R
40|$|We {{have created}} an {{interactive}} storytelling system for public spaces that is collaborative, easy and entertaining to use, and allows for a natural inte-raction. The system consists of a table, a <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>projector</b> that projects onto the table, and a 3 D camera for tracking hands and for object recognition. The main feature {{of the system is}} the projection on top of the palm of the hand of the users; thus, the hand becomes also a viewing surface. This allows for very natural gestural interaction, such as holding and passing objects between users. For example, in the course of narrative, users can hand over a story cha-racter or object to each other. We also employ projection based augmented real-ity to animate real objects on the table. Apart from entertainment, the system shall be employed for concrete educational interactive storytelling applications in public spaces...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} virtual zoo {{depends upon}} the augmented reality (AR) and holographic projection technologies. When first entering a domed area of the station, a video of the African savannah, underwater ocean scene, or other pleasant viewscape would be projected on the <b>ceiling</b> using <b>projectors</b> installed {{around the perimeter of}} the space. The intent would be to provide a full 3 D holographic visual experience without the use of special glasses. There is also the potential for the video to be live-streamed from any location on earth. It could become interactive with the programming of desired content. For example, as people enter the space, fish could swim away from them. This kind of real-time interaction brings a new reality to space. The animals, grass, and other elements would be part of the AR experience. The experience can be made educational as well as entertaining. It could be also something that many people living in large cities do not get to experience in real life [14].|$|R

40|$|We {{are engaged}} in a {{long-term}} project to improve personal productivity for computer-related activities and tele-collaboration in an office environment of the future. Personal computer-related activities, we believe will be enhanced by capability to project imagery on any surface in the office, that together with precise head and eye-tracking, will enable head-tracked stereo imagery {{to be added to the}} user's views of his/her office environment [...] - creating a 3 D immersive generalization of the now ubiquitous 2 D desktop metaphor as the principal human-computer interface. We plan to realize this kind of system by mounting many video projectors and video cameras around the room, especially around the <b>ceiling.</b> The <b>projectors</b> may provide the only source of light in the room and will allow detailed imagery to be projected (almost) everywhere in the office. In order to generate the appropriate imagery, however, a detailed 3 D map of the changing office environment needs to be acquired.

50|$|In 1997 {{the college}} Principal Mike Syms put {{together}} {{the concept of an}} Information and Communication Technology learning centre. By July 2006 the college had reached its fund raising target of £3.2 million and a further £370,000 for equipment and technology. In May 2004 the official ground breaking ceremony took place performed by HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Just as his mother, the Queen, had laid the foundation stone for the college in 1949, Prince Edward carried out the unveiling of the foundation stone for the new centre almost 60 years later. The buildings Architects were Patel Taylor of London. The main construction contract was given to a local company Clegg Construction of Lace Market in Nottingham. Work commenced in May 2005 and the finished building was handed over in June 2006. The new building has ten teaching spaces. These teaching spaces include the IT Essentials Suite, Computer Aided Design Suite, CISCO and Microsoft Academies, Job Club and Transition Suite, Skills for Life/Learning Resource Suite, Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) Suite, Learning and Skills Information Learning Technology Suite and a Research and Development Centre. There are also various meeting rooms and a new main reception. The new centre is furnished with equipment and furniture. There are specially designed desk with integrally fitted computers and interactive whiteboards and <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>projectors</b> in some of the rooms. All the workstations have chairs.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project attempts {{to identify the}} teaching and learning benefits of the IWB for both student and teacher in a mixed Primary School in Co. Mayo. It is based on the introduction of nine Interactive Whiteboards installed in the school. It looks at how the pupils and teachers have embraced it over the year. In this case study, data was gathered from qualitative and quantitative methods in the form of drawings, interviews with 54 primary school children from ages 5 - 12, interviews with the Principal and a Microsoft Office Master Instructor (computer teacher), a questionnaire to nine members of staff and a follow-up focus group interview. Lessons were also conducted with forty four pupils from 3 rd and 4 th classes with pre and post testing carried out. One group of pupils were taught a lesson using the IWB and the other group were taught the same lesson using laptops. The research found that lack of resources for the Irish Primary School Curriculum and lack of training were the main drawbacks of having an IWB. If interactive lessons are not developed, it will revert to a “didactic” approach to learning. Pupils love having the IWB in their classroom due to its large visual element, its sound quality and its motivating factor for learning. Some pupils feel that if the teacher takes over they don‟t get sufficient chance to use it. The technical hitches annoy the children as much as the teachers. Having an IWB in a classroom allows teachers to integrate ICT. The report concludes there are not enough interactive resources that support the curriculum. Teachers need to collaborate more on resources that worked well saving valuable time. Teachers need to be aware that they need to keep up-to-date with training and therefore plan lessons which are “interactive” in nature otherwise these expensive boards are not used to their potential but only as a <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>projector</b> for visual display...|$|R
