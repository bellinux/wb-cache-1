They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|R

The findings show that these deals are unlikely to occur when the European Parliament is represented by agents with biased views of the overall legislature.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a first step towards the {{analysis}} of the joint decision-making mode of governance in the EU. It argues that such a mode of governance enhances policy effectiveness in the field of environmental policy. This is mainly due to the as yet neglected phenomenon of the interaction between representative institutions at different levels in the European Union that characterises joint decision-making. The European Parliament, as a <b>co-legislator</b> with veto power in the co-decision procedure, has been a crucial organisational actor. Its interactions with other actors such as national parliaments and the Council of Ministers and the European Commission are particular relevant in the building-up of more appropriate and legitimate incentives for the correct implementation of common policies, internalising many externalities. It has also allowed for a more active role of EU national parliaments in the EU legislative process, increasing their leverage vis-à-vis their respective governments as far as European legislation is concerned.

40|$|There are broader {{democratic}} implications {{in whether}} legislative deals are concluded between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in the co-decision procedure at first reading, {{as the potential}} of different interests within the legislative bodies to affect the outcomes varies considerably between this and the later reading stages. This paper therefore examines {{the extent to which}} six different explanations can account for early agreement and uses a dataset with all procedures that had their first reading in the first five years after the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. The key conclusion is that factors that the institutions themselves attached importance to before the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force, such as workload and the character of the file, do not have explanatory power, whereas others, such as how close a working relationship exists between the <b>co-legislators,</b> the size of the file negotiated, and whether it is a new act do. Moreover, the paper adds to existing evidence of the relevance of party politics within the institutions by demonstrating that party interests also play a role across them. The chance of early conclusion increases if the negotiators from the Council and the European Parliament come from the same party family...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} visible and {{discussed}} changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty concerns {{the introduction of the}} two new leadership figures in the EU: the permanent President of the European Council (POTEC) and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the new High Representative). The two new actors have each been entrusted with a part of a role previously held by the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). However, the rotating Presidency, contrary to the views often expressed in the media and also among the expert community, still has a job to do and shoulders responsibility for the advancement of the work in the Council during its six-monthly term in office. As a stark difference to the previous ‘single EU Presidency’ principle, the leadership of the Council and European Council is consequently split between the POTEC, the new High Representative and the rotating Presidency. Other changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, especially the extension of co-decision procedure to a number of new policy-fields 1, which increases the role of the European Parliament bringing it {{on a par with the}} Council as <b>co-legislators,</b> consequently even increased the role, and the importance, of the rotating Presidency of the Council. These changes, the introduction of the two new posts and a greater role for the European Parliament in the decision-making process, have profound effects on the organisation and competences required by national administrations. This article analyses the effects of the split in the Presidency-system in the EU on the national administration of the Member State entrusted with holding a six-monthly rotating Presidency. It differentiates between the challenges the new leadership structures and governance modes have brought to organisational patterns in the administration, both in the capital and to their Permanent Representation in Brussels, and with regard to the competences that are required by individual officials as they enter previously unknown terrain with different actors and procedures.

The task of this forum is "to pave the way for the next Intergovernmental Conference as broadly and openly as possible" The Convention is currently at work in Brussels and, inter alia discussing proposals for institutional reform. Thus paper sets out to analyze the perspectives for reform for one of the institutions, the European Parliament (EP), which has come a long way from a deliberative assembly to a full fledged <b>co-legislator</b> (f not in all legislative fields). In this context the aim of the paper is threefold: to sketch the current demands for parliamentary reform; to examine the proposals currently ventilated to remedy the mentioned malaise; and to put these observations into a wider context, by briefly touching upon the issue whether the Convention could be seen as a forum where the notion of deliberative democracy prevails...|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. Many {{observers}} {{claim that}} {{the implementation of the}} Co-decision mechanism with the ESA (1987) and its manifestation in the Maastricht/Amsterdam Treaties (1992 / 97) could be interpreted as a significant step towards more democratic legitimacy in European policymaking. This conclusion could come close to reality under two conditions: The first, if the EP as the only directly elected decision-making body is comprehensively involved as an equal-footing <b>Co-legislator</b> beside the Council. The second, and even more important, is if the Co-decision procedure is sufficiently transparent for the European Citizens. Therefore, this paper aims to explore, whether these two requirements are fulfilled. The following is that a too optimistic assessment of the Codecision procedure, as a tool for more legitimacy cannot be justified. In order to demonstrate my thesis, I will firstly discuss the general problem for European Citizens with legislation at the national and European level, specifically regarding the critical question, of how the EU can bring the people closer to the Union. Secondly, it seems useful to deliver a more comprehensive description {{of the history of the}} Co-decision procedure, because this gives an insight into the development of legislation in the Community...|$|E
40|$|The European Union has {{continuously}} {{emphasized the}} importance of social politics, and the harmonization of gender equality policies amongst its member states. Since most of the union’s social- and gender equality policies have been advanced to primary law, its significance has become even further underlined. The European Social Dialogue operates as one of the union’s social policy tools, partly because of its duty to oversee the implementation of the policies, but also because it operates as a <b>co-legislator</b> on social policy. Earlier research has mainly been focusing on the occurring problems of the implementation process of social- and gender equality policy, since the implementation has often turned out to be inadequate. Therefore, it is my aim to examine the Swedish trade union confederations’ views on the Social Dialogue’s complex of problems, due to their shared responsibility of the implementation of gender equality policies in Sweden, but also to compare the confederations views with earlier research. The results from this study indicates that the trade union confederations’ views coincide with the earlier research, which further indicate that the confederations conclusions may be eminent to the explanation of the gender equality policies’ deficiency...|$|E

40|$|After the {{extension}} of the European Parliament’s (EP) decision-making powers introduced by the Treaties of Amsterdam and Lisbon, it was assumed that the EP would increase the democratic credentials of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) and, given the EP’s traditional promotion of civil liberties and human rights, that it would also tip the balance towards a more rights-based approach. Six years on, these expectations have not been fulfilled. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate why the EP, now a <b>co-legislator,</b> has been unable (or unwilling) to maintain its past policy preferences. In order to understand this gap between expectations and actions, the study looks at three case studies (the ‘Data retention’ directive, the ‘Returns’ directive and the SWIFT Agreement) and compares the impact that the introduction of more powers for the EP has had on these different episodes. In order to maximise the number of possible explanations, the study uses rational-choice and constructivist institutionalist approaches to identify the reasons behind the change in the policy preferences of the EP. In this sense, it aims to uncover the levels and direction of change as well as the main conditions and drivers that led to the abandonment of its previous policy positions...|$|E
40|$|In June 2009, about 350 {{millions}} European {{citizens have}} been asked to cast their vote for the new European Parliament. The European Parliament is no longer a merely consultative assembly, but the <b>co-legislator</b> of the European Union in a wide array of policy areas: the European citizens were thus offered the opportunity to shape the course of action of the European Union for the next five years. Once more, however, the participation of the European people(s) failed to reach a satisfactory level and the “democratic deficit” argument regained momentum. This result appears to be in sharp contrast with the expectations enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, declaring that the Union “shall be founded on representative democracy”, with the direct representation of the EU citizens in the European Parliament and a linkage role explicitly assigned to the EU transnational parties. This paper, relying on an ample documentary evidence concerning European institutions and parties and on a questionnaire targeting the Italian elected representatives in the Sixth EP, seeks to depict the current state of “representative democracy” in the EU. It focuses, specifically, on the “European” elements of the EU elections: the definition of common electoral rules among the Member States, the presentation of clear and distinct manifestos by the Euro-parties and the consolidation of autonomous party organizations in Brussels. Finally, the effects of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on the political and institutional architecture of the EU are also briefly evaluated...|$|E
40|$|For a long time, the European Parliament (EP) {{was viewed}} as a {{lobbying}} sideshow mainly to be targeted if interest groups were unsuccessful at getting their demands included in the European Commission’s proposal. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have a reputation for being particularly open to diffuse interests who, due to their limited resources, use ‘friendly’ MEPs to put pressure on the European Commission and the Council. The notion of the EP representing diffuse interests conflicts with the broader political science literature on interest groups, which dwells on business bias. There are, however, good reasons to doubt the EP’s reputation as a defender of diffuse interests. Much of our current knowledge about the EP’s interest group politics stems from a time when the EP’s legislative powers were more limited. Within the last twenty years, the EP has evolved from a ‘multilingual talking shop’ to a genuine <b>co-legislator</b> with the Council. The increased powers of the EP raise the question of whether EP interest group politics has normalised, whereby the assumptions of the interest group literature would seem to reflect the reality of the EP. A common assumption in the interest group literature is that diffuse interests carry limited weight in decision-making because their resources and interests remain subordinate to that of business. However, business influence differs across policy fields depending on how the costs and benefits related to policies are distributed. The aim of my thesis is to investigate how the distribution of costs and benefits of legislative proposals influence interest groups’ likelihood of winning particular conflicts in the EP. This is done by examining four legislative dossiers in the areas of employment, consumer, and environmental policies. The thesis draws on the process-tracing of EU documents, and 144 interviews with MEPs, EP officials, and interest groups...|$|E

40|$|Transparency in {{diplomatic}} {{negotiations and}} political discussions is an oxymoron. Rather, secrecy and informality traditionally reign negotiations at the bilateral, regional and multilateral level. Yet transparency {{ranks among the}} most basic desiderata in the grammar of global governance and has been regarded as positively related to legitimacy. To date, transparency is not a universal principle: it matters for certain countries more than for others, depending on each country’s constitutional tradition and legal culture. In {{the case of the}} EU, transparent trade diplomacy is quintessential for constitutional reasons but also for broader political reasons: in the first case, even if trade matters fall within the exclusive competence of the EU, the EU executive is bound by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to inform the European Parliament, the EU <b>co-legislator,</b> in regular intervals. The underlying rationale is that the Parliament must early on know what the EU negotiator (typically in trade matters, the European Commission) offers and receives in exchange at the negotiating table, as the final deal will be subject to the positive vote of the European Parliament. In the second case, transparency at an early stage is important in order to address public reluctance, suspicion or even opposition regarding a particular trade deal. The present chapter chronicles the quest for and turning moments relating to transparency during the EU trade negotiations with Canada for a Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA); with the US for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP); and with a group of WTO Members for a the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) at the plurilateral/WTO level.

40|$|During {{the months}} leading {{to the end of}} the {{transitional}} period (January 2005), most academics and actors involved in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (ASFJ) expected the introduction of co-decision as the normal decision-making procedure in this area to change the balance between security and liberty. The involvement of the European Parliament as a <b>co-legislator</b> was thought to be a positive aspect, since this institution had persistently adopted a pro-civil liberties stance. Since then, this question has not been systematically tackled in the literature and consequently the impact of co-decision on the AFSJ remains unclear. However, in 2007, Maurer and Parkes looked at the securitised policy-image governing European asylum policy in order to understand why the European Parliament had been unable to redress the balance and establish civil liberties as a priority. Following their line of reasoning, this paper develops the functional and substantive dimensions introduced by these scholars, in order to explain why the European Parliament, and especially the LIBE committee, has been equally unable to change priorities in the fields of irregular immigration and data protection. I argue that the persistent weakness of the European Parliament in the functional dimension, i. e. the need to legitimise its presence in negotiations dealt with under co-decision, has made changes in the substantive dimension difficult to attain. In those areas were the substantive dimension is weak, as was the case in the Returns directive, the need to legitimise the presence of the EP creates more polarisation among the members of the LIBE committee. In those cases where there is a strong substantive alternative in the LIBE committee, as was the case in the Data retention directive, change is hindered by the Plenary, which establishes the strengthening of the functional dimension as a priority for the institution. In both cases the introduction of co-decision led to the persistence of a securitised policy-image and the impossibility of engaging in conflict expansion...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament (EP) {{has evolved}} into a {{powerful}} legislative actor over the past 40 years. In order to exercise its hard won legislative competencies in an efficient and effective manner the EP has developed an extensive and influential committee system. The Treaty of Lisbon (ToL) recognised its equal status as <b>co-legislator</b> with the Council of the EU and introduced the Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP) as the default EU legislative procedure. Despite the fact that after the introduction of the OLP all EP committees formally operate under the same legal procedure, disparities remain in the levels of influence that each committee commands. This state of affairs demonstrates that if we are to understand what drives committee influence we need to explore the informal sources of influence that committees draw on in addition to the formal rules. This project addresses the lack of understanding of how the committees establish legislative influence by identifying and testing the different resources which committees may be utilising to establish their influence. The thesis puts forward four hypotheses concerning the factors that can account for how committees establish influence. These are developed and tested within three case studies. The case studies comprise the highly influential committees on, firstly, the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, secondly, the Budget Committee and, thirdly, the International Trade Committee. The research project adopts a qualitative approach to complement and create a different perspective from the quantitative studies which dominate the field. It draws on extensive primary material from thirty semi-structured interviews held with MEPs, advisers, EP staff and party officials active in the 7 th legislative term (2009 - 2014). A number of the current conventions concerning the way in which expertise, partisan dynamics, and policy outputs affect how committees establish legislative influence are challenged and new insights regarding their relative importance are offered. Overall, these original findings, contained within this dissertation, have highly significant implications, not only with regard to the committee system of the EP but, also, for the wider field of legislative politics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{participation}} of the Finnish Parliament, Eduskunta, in the national policy formulation of the European Union Justice and Home Affairs. The aim is to analyse to what extent Eduskunta’s control on government led EU policies covers the critical policy formulation phases of EU level policy making. Eduskunta’s strong institutional framework for parliamentary scrutiny in EU matters is tested in a complex policy domain suffering parliamentary deficit at the EU level. As the study deals with the relationship between the parliament and the government {{from the point of view}} of democratic policy making, it adopts the principal-agent framework. The framework helps to conceptualise the parliament - executive relationship for a systematic institutional analysis. This theoretical framework also focuses on observing the information flow between the two parties. The empirical study will then analyse Eduskunta’s participation in the light of the information it receives as the principal from its governmental agents. Degrees of information asymmetry and agency losses are used as indicators of Eduskunta’s participation. The empirical data includes both government’s and Eduskunta’s documents and handling information on the 114 Justice and Home Affairs proposals known also as the Tampere scoreboard. This mostly quantitative data is supplemented by interviews in order to build an overall picture of the scope and timing of the information Eduskunta receives. Finally both Eduskunta’s potential and real participation to Justice and Home Affairs can be estimated. The study revealed that Eduskunta’s decentralised scrutiny model allowed a selected participation to the policy formulation phase. Because of the amount and technicality of the government’s documents and their late arrival to Eduskunta, parliament’s real chances to participate were many times limited. On the other hand, also due to Eduskunta’s own limited resources the scrutiny was focused but to some key issues. All in all, as Eduskunta revealed to be rather supportive <b>co-legislator</b> to government, few serious agency losses were identified. In the light of this study, Eduskunta appears to trust on government’s ability to promote Finnish interests in the EU level negotiations. Endast sammandrag.

However, the parliamentary legislative organisation is under-researched despite its profound consequences for EU policies and policy-making. Addressing this gap, this thesis studies the internal setup and legislative impact of the EP committees. Drawing on congressional literature, I confront distributive, informational and partisan theoretical approaches to answer the research questions of this project, namely whether and why the EP committees and their legislative output are dominated by preference-outlying legislators with special interests, experts serving the informational needs of the plenary, or loyal members of the working majority party group (coalition). Statistical analyses of committee assignments, allocation of legislative tasks, and adoption of committee reports in plenary are conducted using data on the 6 th European Parliament (2004 - 2009). They are complemented with evidence from semi-structured interviews. The results show that legislators’ special interests and expertise account for the formally regulated assignment to committees depending on the predominant character of their legislative output (distributive or regulatory). In contrast, party group affiliation and loyalty shape the allocation of important legislative tasks in committees, owing to the informal allocation process. Furthermore, committee reports are more successful on the floor if drafted by rapporteurs from the working majority party group - perhaps a natural consequence of the EP open amendment rule. Thus, the parliamentary legislative output is ultimately controlled by the working majority party group and not committees. The congressional rationales fail to account for committees’ legislative influence when an informal early agreement is reached with the Council of Ministers. This occurs increasingly often, rendering decision-making in committees largely obsolete. The observed regularities are used to advance the literature on legislative organisation by identifying conditions under which each of the main congressional rationales can explain committee setup and influence, namely: 1) the policy areas a committee covers; 2) the parliamentary rules regulating committee-party and committee-plenary relationships; and 3) the balance of power and mode of negotiation between the legislative chambers. More substantively, the EP committees are not conducive for pursuing particularistic policies. Instead, they promote left-right party politics. This has important implications for EU legislative politics, interest representation, legitimacy, and more generally the EU democratic deficit...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} built around the {{decisions}} {{that led to the}} legislation on security of natural gas supply which first consisted of a directive (OJ L 127, 29. 4. 2004) that was then changed to a regulation (OJ L 295, 12. 11. 2010) concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply. I study the decision-making processes behind the legislation on the security of gas supply and the role that the main institutions of the EU, namely the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, play in the process. The theory used in this thesis is based on Mark A. Pollack’s (2003) perception of the principal-agent analysis in rational choice institutionalism. The analysis is guided by this theoretical framework. Based on the main theory, I formulate two general research questions and three sets of hypotheses. The formulated hypotheses determine which categories were used when interpreting the gathered evidence. The method of my thesis is an intrinsic case study. The case is the decision-making process that led to the legislation on security of natural gas supply. The primary material for this research consists of the official documents written in the process of formulating the directive and regulation. These documents were supplemented with journalistic reports. The main result of this thesis is a founding according to which the roles of the institutions did change {{in the course of the}} decision-making process. The Council started as the dominant actor in the decision-making process of the directive, possessing the most influence on the conduct of the process and consequently, the resulting decisions. The Commission and the Parliament were left with the roles of a weak agenda-setter and a junior legislator. As the decision-making process proceeded to the regulation, the roles of the institutions changed. The Commission’s agenda-setting behaviour became more assertive and it was able to achieve a larger number of goals than earlier. The Parliament’s role changed from junior legislator to the Council’s <b>co-legislator</b> as it was able to engage itself into a fairly equal bargaining with the Council. The Council, on its part, had to give up its dominant position and accept a more balanced decision-making process with the other institutions, forcing it to assess its preferences in a more critical way. In terms of a zero sum game, the Council lost influence in the course of the legislation process whereas the Commission and the Parliament gained influence. The reasons behind the change in the roles of the institutions include the changing legal framework of the EU, namely the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty which gave the Commission and the Parliament more influence in the decision-making processes by extending the application of the co-decision procedure to decision-making on energy. Another reason for the change was the gas disruption between Russia and Ukraine in 2009 which brought the matter of urgency into the equation as the Member States preferred a quick adoption of a new regulation compared to the option of continuing with the already existing directive.
