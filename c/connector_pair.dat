5000|$|Jack {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a connector often with the female electrical contact or socket, and is the [...] "more fixed" [...] connector of a <b>connector</b> <b>pair.</b> Plug commonly {{refers to a}} movable connector, often (but not always) with the male electrical contact or pin, and is the movable (less fixed) connector of a <b>connector</b> <b>pair.</b>|$|E

50|$|Plug {{refers to}} the half of a <b>connector</b> <b>pair</b> {{designed}} to attach to a wire or cable; {{as opposed to the}} Receptacle half which is typically mounted to a bulkhead, panel or box. Even though plugs are usually thought of having male (pin) contacts, they can in fact house any type of contact—pins, sockets or even both. Therefore, it is the design and location of the connector which makes it a plug, not the gender of its contacts.|$|E
50|$|An {{endpoint}} is used {{to exchange}} MIDI data between the element (software and/or hardware) in charge of decoding the RTP-MIDI transport protocol and the element using the MIDI messages. In other terms, only MIDI data are visible at endpoint level. For devices with MIDI 1.0 DIN connectors, there is one endpoint per <b>connector</b> <b>pair</b> (e.g.: 2 endpoints for KissBox MIDI2TR, 4 endpoints for iConnectivity4+, etc...). Devices using other communication links (like SPI or USB) offer more endpoints (for example, a device using the 32 bits encoding of USB MIDI Class can represent up to 16 endpoints using the Cable Identifier field). An endpoint is represented on RTP-MIDI side by a pair UDP port when AppleMIDI session protocol is used.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} optical {{communication}} lines {{are now in}} use at NASA-Kennedy for the transmission of voice, computer data, and video signals. Now, all of these channels use a single carrier wavelength centered near 1300 or 1550 nm. Engineering tests {{in the past have}} given indications of the growth of systematic and random noise in the RF spectrum of a fiber network as the number of <b>connector</b> <b>pairs</b> is increased. This noise seems to occur when a laser transmitter is used instead of a LED. It has been suggested that the noise is caused by back reflections created at connector fiber interfaces. Experiments were performed to explore the effect of reflection on the transmitting laser under conditions of reflective feedback. This effort included computer integration of some of the instrumentation in the fiber optic lab using the Lab View software recently acquired by the lab group. The main goal was to interface the Anritsu Optical and RF spectrum analyzers to the MacIntosh II computer so that laser spectra and network RF spectra could be simultaneously and rapidly acquired in a form convenient for analysis. Both single and multimode fiber is installed at Kennedy. Since most are multimode, this effort concentrated on multimode systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of mated connector pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master cylinder's plunger is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a mated <b>connector</b> <b>pair</b> hanging in free space...|$|E
40|$|Erbium-doped fibres {{suffer from}} {{quenching}} at high Er-concentrations. We {{have found that}} cryo-cooling to liquid-nitrogen temperature (LNT) substantially improves both the threshold and slope efficiency of a heavily doped, partly quenched, erbium-doped fibre laser (EDFL). The fibre is fabricated in-house by a heated-frit method, a technique suitable for gas-phase deposition of rare-earth doped fibre. It has an Er-concentration of ~ 8300 ppm (wt.) in a 10 µm diameter, 0. 13 NA aluminosilicate core. It was characterised in a ring laser setup with an outcoupled signal of 3 dB. In the outcoupling we include the loss of an attenuator, two tap couplers, an extra isolator, and a <b>connector</b> <b>pair</b> inserted into the cavity for experimental convenience. The 1 m doped fibre was counter-pumped in the core at 1480 nm with negligible pump leakage. Figure 1 shows the resulting laser power at LNT and RT (room temperature), calculated as {{the difference between the}} circulating power after and before amplification in the EDF. The LNT case shows clear improvements in both threshold and slope efficiency, the latter reaching 38. 6 %. The emission wavelength shifts from 1592 nm at RT to 1572 nm at LNT...|$|E

We {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between internal profunctors and <b>connectors</b> on <b>pairs</b> (R, S) of equivalence relations which originally {{appeared in the new}} profunctorial approach of the Schreier-Mac Lane extension theorem [11]. This clarification allows us to extend this Schreier-Mac Lane theorem to any exact Mal’cev category with centralizers. On the other hand, still in the Mal’cev context and in respect to the categorical Galois theory associated with a reflection I, it allows us to produce the faithful action of a certain abelian group on the set of classes (up to isomorphism) of I-normal extensions having a given Galois groupoid...|$|R
40|$|Current {{practice}} is to uniquely key the connectors, which, when mated, {{could not be}} verified by ground tests such as those used in explosive or non-explosive initiators and pyro valves. However, this practice does not assure 100 -percent correct mating. This problem could be overcome by the following approach. Errors in mating of interchangeable connectors can result in degraded or failed space mission. Mating of all flight connectors considered not verifiable via ground tests can be verified electrically by the following approach. It requires two additional wires going through the connector of interest, a few resistors, and a voltage source. The test-point voltage V(sub tp) when the connector is not mated {{will be the same}} as the input voltage, which gets attenuated by the resistor R(sub 1) when the female (F) and male (M) connectors are mated correctly and properly. The voltage at the test point will be a function of R(sub 1) and R(sub 2). Monitoring of the test point could be done on ground support equipment (GSE) only, or it can be a telemetry point. For implementation on multiple connector pairs, a different value for R(sub 1) or R(sub 2) or both can be selected for each pair of connectors that would result in a unique test point voltage for each <b>connector</b> <b>pair.</b> Each test point voltage is unique, and correct test point voltage is read only when the correct pair is mated correctly together. Thus, this design approach can be used to verify positively the correct mating of the connector pairs. This design approach can be applied to any number of connectors on the flight vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Address event {{representation}} (AER) is {{a widely}} employed asynchronous technique for interchanging “neural spikes” between different hardware elements in neuromorphic systems. Each neuron or cell in a chip or a system is assigned an address (or ID), which is typically communicated through a high-speed digital bus, thus time-multiplexing {{a high number of}} neural connections. Conventional AER links use parallel physical wires together with a pair of handshaking signals (request and acknowledge).

The setup has been tested using commercial Spartan 6 FPGAs attaining a maximum event transmission speed of 75 Meps (Mega events per second) for 32 -bit events at a line rate of 3. 0 Gbps.
