5|$|In October–November 938, Bajkam and the Caliph campaigned {{against the}} {{influential}} Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{who had taken}} advantage of the turmoil in Iraq to cease forwarding his province's revenue to Baghdad. Although Bajkam's army captured Mosul, Hasan fled before him to the remotest <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> domain, where Bajkam's forces pursued him in vain. In the meantime, the local population resented the presence of the caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them, while Ibn Ra'iq used Bajkam's absence to take control of Baghdad {{at the head of a}} Carmathian force. These developments forced Bajkam to negotiate with his rivals: the Hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for the payment of the tax arrears, and Ibn Ra'iq was bought off with the governorship of the provinces of Tariq al-Furat, Diyar Mudar, Qinnasrin and al-'Awasim, which were also claimed by the Ikhshidids of Egypt. This arrangement allowed Bajkam and the Caliph to return to Baghdad in February 939.|$|E
25|$|While Bayinnaung had decisively {{defeated}} Siam {{his most}} powerful rival in the neighborhood, his greatest challenge {{would turn out}} to be keeping remote, mountainous states in the farthest <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> empire in check. Guerrilla warfare by small rebel armies combined with difficult terrains and starvation caused more problems for the king's armies than the armies of Siam ever did.|$|E
500|$|Pickett made a {{colorful}} general. He rode a sleek black charger named [...] "Old Black," [...] {{and wore a}} small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was {{the talk of the}} Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E

500|$|Busch {{felt his}} {{painting}} skills could {{not compete with}} those of the Dutch masters. He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them {{one on top of the}} other in damp <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio, where they stuck together. If the pile of paintings became too high, he burnt some in his garden. Since only a few remaining pictures are dated, categorizing them is difficult. His doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials. His ground was usually chosen carelessly. Sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly-prepared spruce-wood boards. One exception is a portrait of Johanna Kessler, on a canvas support measuring [...] by , one of his largest paintings. Most of his works, even landscapes, are small. As Busch used poor grounds and colours, most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect.|$|E

2500|$|During the Mexican War of Independence, one {{important}} insurgent, Eugenio Montaño, was from Otumba. He, along with José Francisco Osorno, fought {{mostly in the}} Apan area until 1813, when the royalist forces battled his troops near Calpulalpan. Montaño lost and his body was found by the royalists at the Tepetates Hacienda. [...] Looking for vengeance, the royalists cut off Montaño's head and cut {{the rest of the}} body into four pieces. The head was sent to his family and the body parts were hung in at the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house in Otumba. The parish priest tried to bury the body in at the church but the royalist dug it back up and rehung the pieces. A short time later, the body was permanently interred in the baptistery of the church.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, he gave an {{interview}} which was captured on tape, wherein he discussed his {{growing up in}} Montana, and learning to paint {{at the hands of}} the elders of his mother's tribe. He actively continued painting through the early 1960s. He is still considered one of the most important artists of Glacier National Park. His body of work helps to understand [...] "the significant contributions by marginalized artists who successfully negotiated the terrain of the mainstream art world." [...] Lone Wolf died in St. Mary's hospital in Tucson, Arizona, on February 9, 1970. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred near the grave of his maternal uncle Last Rider in Montana. He was buried on June 19, 1970, in an Indian ceremony which included four willow wands topped by eagle feathers placed at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grave. Paul Dyke, his adopted son, lowered the urn into the earth, and Lone Wolf's widow, Naomi, cast the first spade of earth into the grave. Afterwards, Naomi gave the eagle feathers to friends as remembrances. At some point during the next year, Naomi, despondent over Lone Wolf's death, committed suicide, using Lone Wolf's old revolver. Two years after his death, his story was highlighted, along with pictures of his paintings and sculptures, in the first issue of the 1972 edition of Montana The Magazine of Western History. The article was written by Paul Dyke.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, he {{presented}} a new show, Beajet 'm eus (" [...] I travelled [...] "). On April 7, 2015, Denez published a new studio album, [...] "An enchanting garden - Ul liorzh vurzhudus". This album, comprising 12 original songs {{written by the}} singer, including one in English, {{is the result of}} several years of writing (a hundred gwerzioù of 80 verses), trips and experiments on stage. The Breton and Celtic themes, unstructured, are interwoven with Slavonic and Armenian ("An tri seblant"), Greek ("Krediñ 'raen"), Andalusian ("Ar binioù skornet"), Bossa nova ("An tri amourouz"), Gypsy or Yiddish ("Beajet'm eus"), African ("An trucher hag an Ankoù") for an entirely acoustic music. In songs in Breton, the artist invites to discover the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inner garden and the plurality of his influences. [...] Denez's vocal, [...] "enigmatic and inspiring" [...] (accompanied by the hang on [...] "Before dawn"), is like a link between the real and the invisible, supported by the writing of timeless stories, sometimes tragic, satirical or burlesque, such as [...] "Peñse Nedeleg", a Fisel dance describing the shipwreck of a freighter that makes the happiness of the inhabitants for Christmas or [...] "An tri amourouz" [...] whose black humor recalls that of Tim Burton. [...] "An Old Story", in English, couples with [...] "Gwechall gozh", in breton, two complaints sharing the same story: an innocent woman burnt like witch for having too many companions.|$|E
