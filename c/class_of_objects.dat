Quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, {{that appeared to be}} similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies.

5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects,</b> and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects,</b> plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started {{to be used for}} the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E

25|$|A {{concrete}} category, when defined {{without reference}} to the notion of a category, consists of a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects,</b> each equipped with an underlying set; and for any two objects A and B a set of functions, called morphisms, from the underlying set of A to the underlying set of B. Furthermore, for every object A, the identity function on the underlying set of A must be a morphism from A to A, and the composition of a morphism from A to B followed by a morphism from B to C must be a morphism from A to C.|$|E
25|$|As it {{was said}} in the {{previous}} section, for specific case of translations and scaling, localization condition can be satisfied by use of generic Gabor templates. However, for general case (non-group) transformation, localization condition can be satisfied only for specific <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects.</b> More specifically, {{in order to satisfy}} the condition, templates must be similar to the objects one would like to recognize. For instance, if one would like to build a system to recognize 3D rotated faces, one need to use other 3D rotated faces as templates. This may explain the existence of such specialized modules in the brain as one responsible for face recognition. Even with custom templates, a noise-like encoding of images and templates is necessary for localization. It can be naturally achieved if the non-group transformation is processed on any layer other than the first in hierarchical recognition architecture.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific instance or individual and mapping a label to an entire <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects.</b> This latter process is sometimes referred to as generalization or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input. These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of under and overgeneralization in infant word learning. Research has also shown that the frequency in co-occurrence of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.|$|E

25|$|Quasars are {{believed}} to be powered by accretion of material into supermassive black holes in the nuclei of distant galaxies, making these luminous versions of the general <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> known as active galaxies. Since light cannot escape the black holes, the escaping energy is actually generated outside the event horizon by gravitational stresses and immense friction on the incoming material. Central masses of 105 to 109 solar masses have been measured in quasars by using reverberation mapping. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, with no sign of a quasar nucleus, have been shown to contain a similar central black hole in their nuclei, so it is thought that all large galaxies have one, but only a small fraction are active (with enough accretion to power radiation), and it is the activity of these black holes that are seen as quasars. The matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole that will cause the matter to collect into an accretion disc. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} a quasar could form as the Andromeda Galaxy collides with our own Milky Way galaxy in approximately 3–5 billion years.|$|E
500|$|On June 11, 2008, the IAU {{executive}} committee announced {{the establishment of}} a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned [...] "new category of trans-Neptunian objects" [...] to which Pluto is a prototype. This new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects,</b> termed plutoids, would include Pluto, Eris and any other future trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU also determined that, for naming purposes, only those TNOs with an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 would be allowed into the category. To date, only two other TNOs, 2003EL61 and 2005FY9, meet the absolute magnitude requirement, while other potential dwarf planets, such as Sedna, Orcus and Quaoar, do not. On July 11, 2008, the Working Group on Planetary Nomenclature included 2005FY9 in the plutoid class, naming it Makemake. On September 17, 2008, 2003EL61 joined the category with the name Haumea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One {{approach}} to recognizing objects seen from arbitrary viewpoint is by extracting invariant properties <b>of</b> the <b>objects</b> from single images. Such properties {{are found in}} images <b>of</b> 3 D <b>objects</b> only when the objects are constrained to belong to certain classes (e. g., bilaterally symmetric objects). Existing studies that follow this approach propose how to compute invariant representations for a handful <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects.</b> A fundamental question regarding the invariance approach is whether it {{can be applied to}} a wide range <b>of</b> <b>classes.</b> To answer this question it is essential to study the set <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> for which invariance exists. This paper introduces a new method for determining the existence of invariant functions for <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> together with the set of images from which these invariants can be computed. We develop algebraic tests that determine whether the objects in a given class can be identified from single images. These tests apply to <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> undergoing affine projection. In addition, these tests allow us to determine the set of views <b>of</b> the <b>objects</b> which are degenerate. We apply these tests to several <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> and determine which of them is identifiable and which of their views are degenerate.

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroid-like. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most [...] "asteroids" [...] with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinction}} between proper names and common names is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. London Bridge, while common names {{are used in}} {{a more general sense}} in reference to a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> e.g. bridge. Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning in the way that ordinary words mean, probably for the practical reason that when they consist of Collective nouns, they refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the singular e.g. [...] "committee". Concrete nouns like “cabbage” refer to physical bodies that can be observed by {{at least one of the}} senses while abstract nouns, like “love” and “hate” refer to abstract objects. In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding noun-forming suffixes ("-ness", [...] "-ity", [...] "-tion") to adjectives or verbs e.g. [...] "happiness", [...] "serenity", “concentration”.
