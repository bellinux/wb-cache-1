5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing <b>capability</b> <b>is</b> achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E

For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{organizational}} <b>capability</b> has <b>been</b> developed basically {{in the field}} of strategic management. Organizational <b>capabilities</b> <b>are</b> identified as one major source for the generation and development of sustainable competitive advantage).

25|$|A {{major focus}} of Galactic Civilizations II is the {{artificial}} intelligence of its opponents, {{due in part to}} the deliberate omission of multiplayer in favor of the single player experience.

25|$|Land Attack Missiles: As of 2008 {{the class}} {{deliberately}} lacks a land-attack cruise missile capability for political reasons: such weapons are {{seen by some}} as “too aggressive” and out of keeping with the Valour-class’s “defensive posture”. However, like its peers the SA Navy recognises the growing importance of fighting in the littoral battlespace and supporting land forces during war and peace operations.
