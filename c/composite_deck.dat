Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company. [...] On September 2, 1959 the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH. This {{was the beginning of}} The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products. With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc. The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960. With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products. By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing color concentrates for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry. In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH. Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding. This marked the company’s first step into the building products industry. Americhem then {{became a member of the}} Vinyl Siding Institute and helped invent tests along with standards for weathering and durability that are still used today. Americhem was one of the first companies to use IBM System/3 computers and ACS Color Matching computers that were installed in 1972. Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois. This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem. During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits. In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner. [...] In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department. The new laboratory led to the production of Americhem’s first color concentrates for synthetic fibers in response to the new developments of nylon and polyester dispersion technology. In 1987, Americhem received “Best Technical Paper” for the presentation “Weathering Metamerism: A Photochemical Process” and again in 1988 for “Refractive Index: A Key to Understanding Color Difference.” Around the same time, Americhem purchased Colourfast Plastics Ltd. in England to expand their international presence. Then, in order to be strategically located in the heart of the textile industry, Americhem opened a plant in Concord, North Carolina in 1989. Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998” In 2001, Americhem introduced a polyester solution dye product line for automotive interiors which still continues to be an excellent market that the company excels in. A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia. Americhem continued to expand internationally with the establishment of the Luxembourg sales office in 2003, the Mexico City sales office in 2004, and the Suzhou, China plant that opened in 2006 and was expanded in 2014. [...] In the early 2000s, Americhem introduced the first variegated wood grain products for <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> board applications in 2005, an outdoor color line for polyester fibers, and a low heat build-up technology for dark construction colors in 2006.In 2007, a new company logo and brand were introduced to the market.

40|$|In recent years, Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) {{has become}} a widely used {{material}} in Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite structures. Several studies have been performed on the bonding methods of FRP sheets and plates, but limited research has been undertaken on the critical shear connection systems for innovative GFRP concrete composite bridge decks structures. Coarse sand coating shear connection systems for GFRP structures show strong bondage in the shear direction but poor grip in the normal direction. An innovative concrete wedge system, supplementary to coarse sand coating overcomes the normal split between GFRP panel and concrete, in composite bridge deck structures. This study presents a finite element (FE) investigation on GFRP concrete <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> using a concrete wedge shear connection system based on existing experimental evaluation. In this research, {{the thickness of the}} GFRP module was varied and the deflection behaviour of GFRP concrete <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> was furthermore studied.

40|$|AbstractPresenting the <b>composite</b> <b>deck,</b> which {{consists}} of concrete slab with profiled steel sheets fixed to {{the top layer of}} Double Layer Grid (DLG), proved its great efficiency in increasing the load carrying capacity for this type of structures. Earlier studies concluded that the application of the prescribed composite action had solved many problems facing the spread of DLG structures such as their prone to collapse in a progressive manner besides their suitability to be used only as roof covering structures. In addition, the application of the composite action introduced an economical solution due to considerable savings in steel material used in building the top layer of the DLG structures. However, openings in the deck are needed for architectural purposes such as passing service ducts, day-lighting panels or passing shear walls or continuous structural elements. Adding such openings in the deck affects the efficiency of the <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> in carrying the assigned loads especially if the openings are being added after the construction is completed. The current research introduced experimental tests along with numerical investigation using ABAQUS software for <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> space trusses with common cases of support patterns and different deck opening locations.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> slab depends mainly on the longitudinal shear transfer mechanism at the interface between steel and concrete. The bond strength developed by the cement paste is weak and causes premature failure of <b>composite</b> <b>deck</b> slab.

Development of embossment patterns requires an advanced technology which makes the deck profile expensive. Fastening studs by welding weakens the joint strength and also escalates the cost. The present investigation is attempted to arrive at a better, simple interface mechanism. Three types of mechanical connector schemes are identified and investigated experimentally. All of the three shear connector schemes exhibited full shear interaction with negligible slip. The strength and stiffness of the composite slabs with shear connectors are superior about one and half time compared to these of the conventional reinforced concrete slabs and about twice compared to these of composite slabs without mechanical shear connectors.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Composite</b> metal <b>decking</b> {{has become}} one of the {{prevalent}} forms of Fast Track Construction for multi-story steel buildings. The in-plane stiffness of <b>composite</b> metal <b>decks</b> however is of considerable importance as they typically act as a diaphragm in lateral-load- resisting systems and thus attract a large in-plane shear. The diaphragm action or the in-plane shear capacity of <b>composite</b> metal <b>decks</b> remained a concern for structural engineers and designers. The present work aims to investigate the in-plane shear behavior of fiber reinforced <b>composite</b> metal <b>decks</b> and compare it to that reinforced with welded wire mesh. A comprehensive experimental program involving testing large scale slabs was conducted. Steel decking of trapezoidal profile with a sheet thickness of 0. 9 mm was used to construct the composite slabs. Conventional WWF mesh reinforcement and synthetic macro fibers at different reinforcing rates were considered in the test program. The slabs were tested under monotonically increasing in-plane shear force until failure. Load-deflection responses were plotted and cracking pattern and sequence were recorded. The test results show that fibers provide comparable deck behavior as that with steel mesh. Both imparted similar ultimate in-plane shear capacity and enhanced the ductility and the post peak behavior of the <b>composite</b> metal <b>decks</b> relative to the control slab. The results demonstrate the viability of synthetic macro fibers to replace the steel mesh in this type of composite flooring systems...|$|R
