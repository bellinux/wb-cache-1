5000|$|In the United States, the {{external}} Continental tire mounting was a factory option on {{various types of}} cars during the 1950s and early 1960s. On some models [...] - [...] such as on the Nash Metropolitan, Jeepster Commando, and Mercury Turnpike Cruiser [...] - [...] the Continental tire was a standard feature. Most often, the car's rear bumper was extended and the tire had a fabric or metal <b>cover.</b> The <b>bracket</b> for the spare wheel was designed to swing away {{for access to the}} trunk.|$|R
5000|$|Mid-1996: Changed valve <b>cover,</b> added <b>bracket</b> to hold {{cam chain}} bumper; changed crank to heavier unit; {{improved}} clutch basket with 1 more clutch plate; changed countershaft sprocket retainer from slotted plate to large nut; changed {{second and third}} gear ratios. Kickstarter no longer fits with new clutch basket. At least some early 1996 models had the matte black engine cases and covers rather than the later hammer-finished dark gray coloration found in the 1997 and later models. New left balancer weight/sprocket begins with engine #KLE650AE032206.|$|R
25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the slide <b>cover</b> latch <b>brackets</b> on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|R
5000|$|Commandant's Quarters, {{also known}} as Quarters [...] "A", is a {{historic}} home located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1874-1875, and is a three-story, painted brick dwelling in the Italian Villa-style. A porch was added in 1901. It features an off-center square tower, slate <b>covered</b> gable roof, <b>bracketed</b> waves, and a bay window. It was an officer's residence until June 1960.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the later}} 1880s, Twyford made further {{improvements}} to the sanitary industry and lengthened his reach beyond water closets. He produced and released a pedestal hand-basin made completely of earthenware that had [...] "improved holes for the taps"; he eventually even attached overflow chambers and an outer-layer of material that was more pleasing to see to <b>cover</b> the iron <b>brackets</b> that supported the basin. Twyford even developed a bidet that was made completely of earthenware and had both a hot and cold tap.|$|R
30|$|Orthodontic {{treatment}} has an inevitable {{influence on the}} enamel surface [29]. Regardless of the composite used, some grooves are present in teeth after bracket debonding and resin removal [29]. Enamel surface alterations after bracket removal are particularly important for the outer layer of enamel, which contains more minerals and fluoride than the deeper layers [29]. Damage to the enamel surface may lead to decreased enamel resistance and {{an increased risk of}} decalcification [32]. In this study, the final roughness {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the polymerization shrinkage and physical stresses of the specific composite used. Thus, the main factor determining the final roughness was that the teeth were finished with a multilaminated carbide bur (Table  1), although the tooth enamel was not returned the smoothness present before of bracket bonding (Table  1). The values for enamel roughness after finishing were similar or lower to those found in another study [25] that used similar methodology in sound tooth enamel. Thus, the enamel roughness found after finishing is acceptable. Furthermore, residual adhesive could be removed with minimal damage to the enamel by the careful use of a tungsten carbide bur [47]. Considering the biochemical factors involved in dental caries development, higher concentrations of insoluble polysaccharides can cause a shift in demineralization [48]. When combined with orthodontic treatment, the mechanical retention of foods containing insoluble polysaccharides may increase roughness in areas near those <b>covered</b> by the <b>bracket.</b> Thus, high roughness values were not found in this study in the areas of sound enamel not <b>covered</b> by <b>brackets</b> (Table  1).|$|R
50|$|The Burkenroad Reports provide stock {{analyses}} of small- to mid-size companies throughout the Texas to Florida {{region of the}} United States. Many of these companies would otherwise not be <b>covered</b> by bulge <b>bracket</b> financial firms; consequently, the reports provide unique information that investors rely on, which helps the followed companies gain access to capital. Students are the primary authors of the reports, and they {{get the opportunity to}} visit the followed companies and interview top management. This process allows students to gain practical and marketable stock analysis skills, as well as insight into strategic management.|$|R
50|$|The House at 1487 Loma Vista Street is a {{historic}} house located at 1487 Loma Vista Street in Pasadena, California. The American Craftsman house was built in 1913 in the city's Pasadena Heights neighborhood. A gable with paired <b>brackets</b> <b>covers</b> the front porch {{and part of the}} first story; the gable is supported by three concrete piers topped by decorative lumber uprights. The sides and rear of the house each have gables at both the first and second stories. All of the gables in the house have exaggerated peaks inspired by Asian architecture, wide eaves, and exposed rafter tails. The property includes a similarly-designed garage, which also has an exaggerated gable peak and is considered a contributing building.|$|R
40|$|Description of a 91. 5 -cm (36 -in.) {{airborne}} infrared telescope {{installed in}} a C 141 A StarLifter as a national IR observatory. The telescope system is mounted in a specially constructed cavity located {{just ahead of the}} leading edge of the wing. All controls and ancillary systems are located in consoles and racks mounted aft of the telescope. The telescope is a conventional Cassegrain design which can be used either directly with the focal point behind the primary mirror or in a folded configuration by inserting a tertiary mirror following the secondary which folds the optical path through the support bearing into the aircraft cabin area. The telescope system is designed to operate at all ambient conditions from sea level to 15, 200 m. The system is optimized for operation at ambient temperatures experienced at 13, 000 to 15, 000 m (220 K). The entire telescope assembly with the exception of noncritical <b>covers</b> and <b>brackets</b> is constructed of Invar-type material to minimize the effects of thermal distortions. Pointing accuracy and stability of the telescope with respect to the target are achieved through multiple stages of stabilization and vibration isolation equipment...|$|R
6000|$|All {{the rooms}} were thick with queer little objects that {{indicated}} a quite beaver-like industry {{in the production of}} [...] "work." [...] There were embroidered covers for nearly every article on the wash-hand-stand, and mats of wool and crochet wherever anything stood on anything; there were [...] "tidies" [...] everywhere, and odd little <b>brackets</b> <b>covered</b> with gilded and varnished fir cones and bearing framed photographs and little jars and all sorts of colourless, dusty little objects, and everywhere on the walls tacks sustained crossed fans with badly painted flowers or transfer pictures. There was a jar on the bedroom mantel covered with varnished postage stamps and containing grey-haired dried grasses. There seemed to be a moral element in all this, for in the room Sydney shared with Rom there was a decorative piece of lettering which declared that-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Kate took {{a survey}} of the room, which was very prettily furnished, with {{quantities}} of beautiful work of all kinds, and little tables and <b>brackets</b> <b>covered</b> with little devices in china and curiosities under glass, and had flowers standing in the windows; and by the time she had finished trying to make out the subject of a print on the walls, she heard some words that made her think that her aunts were talking of her new governess, and she opened her ears to hear, [...] "So {{we thought it would be}} an excellent arrangement for her, poor thing!" [...] and [...] "Papa" [...] answering, [...] "I hope Kate may try to be a kind considerate pupil."

"We must settle something--we {{must take}} a line," [...] he declared, passing {{his hand through his}} hair and giving a glance at the long narrow mirror which adorned the space between the two windows, and which had at its base a little gilded <b>bracket</b> <b>covered</b> by a thin slab of white marble, {{supporting}} in its turn a backgammon board folded together in the shape of two volumes, two shining folios inscribed in letters of greenish gilt, History of England. If Morris had been pleased to describe the master of the house as a heartless scoffer, it is because he thought him too much on his guard, and this was the easiest way to express his own dissatisfaction--a dissatisfaction which he had made a point of concealing from the Doctor. It will probably seem to the reader, however, that the Doctor's vigilance was by no means excessive, and that these two young people had an open field. Their intimacy was now considerable, and it may appear that for a shrinking and retiring person our heroine had been liberal of her favours. The young man, within a few days, had made her listen to things for which she had not supposed that she was prepared; having a lively foreboding of difficulties, he proceeded to gain as much ground as possible in the present. He remembered that fortune favours the brave, and even if he had forgotten it, Mrs. Penniman would have remembered it for him. Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a drama, and she flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted. Combining as she did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of the spectator, she had long since done her utmost to pull up the curtain. She too expected to figure in the performance-- to be the confidante, the Chorus, to speak the epilogue. It may even be said that there were times when she lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the play, in the contemplation of certain great passages which would naturally occur between the hero and herself.|$|R
50|$|The madrasa {{structure}} has an innovative design. It {{was built in}} L-Shape as one contiguous structure on {{the south and east}} edges of the reservoir complex. One arm of the L-shape structure runs in the North - South direction measuring 76 m and the other arm runs in the East - West direction measuring 138 m. The two arms are pivoted at the large Tomb of Firuz Shah (pictured). At the northern end there is a small mosque. Between the mosque and the tomb two storied pavilions exist now on the northern side and similar pavilions on the eastern side, overlooking the lake, which were used as madrasa. The two arms are interconnected through small domed gateways passing through the tomb at the center. The North - South arm with balconies overlooking the reservoir is a two storied building with three towers of varying sizes. Ornamental <b>brackets</b> <b>cover</b> the upper storied balconies while the lower stories have corbelled support. Roof overhangs or eaves (chajjas) are seen now only in the upper stories though it is said that they existed on both stories when it was built.From each floor of the Madrasa, staircases are provided {{to go down to the}} lake. Many cenotaphs, in the form of octagonal and square chhatris are also seen, which are reported to be possibly tombs of teachers of the Madrasa.It is recorded that the first Director of the Madarasa was one Jalal al-Din Rumi who knew fourteen sciences, could recite the Quran according to the seven known methods of recitation and had complete mastery over the five standard collections of the Traditions of the ProphetThe madrasa was well tended with liberal donations from the Royalty.Timur, the Mongol ruler, who invaded Delhi, defeated Mohammed Shah Tughlaq in 1398 and plundered Delhi, had camped at this venue. Expressed in his own words, his impressions of the tank and buildings around Hauz Khas were vividly described as:When I reached city’s gates, I carefully reconnoitered its towers and walls, and then returned to the side of the Hauz Khas. This is a reservoir, which was constructed by Sultan Feruz Shah, and is faced all round with stone and stucco. Each side of the reservoir is more than a bows - shot long, and there are buildings placed around it. This tank is filled by rains in the rainy season, and it supports the people of the city with water throughout the year. The tomb of Sultan Firuz Shah stands on its bankWhile his description of the place is correct but his ascribing construction of the tank to Firuz Shah was a misconception.|$|R
