50|$|The European sea {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser sturio), {{also known}} as the Atlantic sturgeon or <b>common</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> is a species of sturgeon previously found on most coasts of Europe. It is anadromous and breeds in rivers. It is currently a critically endangered species. Although the name Baltic sturgeon sometimes has been used, it has now been established that sturgeon of the Baltic region are A. oxyrinchus, a species otherwise restricted to the Atlantic coast of North America.|$|E
50|$|Smörgåskaviar is a {{fish roe}} spread eaten in Scandinavia and Finland. It {{differs from the}} more <b>common</b> <b>sturgeon</b> or salmon caviar {{in that it is}} made from cod roe and a {{variable}} mix of other ingredients. These can include mashed potatoes, tomato sauce, onion, salt and often dill or chives. It is usually sold in smoked and non-smoked variants, as well as in variants with a prominent taste of dill, for instance Öhnbergs Dill-kaviar. The most common brand in Sweden is Kalles kaviar.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the number}} of fish species has risen over the past 34 years, the species list differs from the one drawn up 100 years ago, since some {{anadromous}} fish such as the allis shad Alosa alosa (L.) and <b>common</b> <b>sturgeon</b> Acipenser sturio L. have been extinct for more than 60 years due to former river contamination (at the beginning of industrialisation), barricades {{along the length of}} the river and intensive fishing [33]. For the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. several reimplementation programmes were established in the late 1990 s to restock populations [34]. This species has still to be found during the electrofishing procedure as the method used is limited to catches along the river banks rather than the middle of the river, and {{the number of}} returning S. salar is still low [30].|$|E

In a different way, the most important Tyrrhenian population in the Tiber River underwent a rapid decline and disappearance in the 1920 s, due to increasing fishing and pollution. In Italy, sturgeon fishing was declared illegal in the 1980 s, but in a few years the species disappeared. Nowadays, a reintroduction plan could take advantage of the experience gained with the recovery plan carried out for A. naccarii...|$|E
40|$|Sturgeon {{is among}} the oldest fishes in the world. They are living in natural waters of Europe, Asia and the Northern America for 200 million years. Once {{abundant}} in lakes and rivers throughout the Northern Hemisphere, sturgeon stocks are now highly endangered, mostly due to over-harvesting and severe habitat alterations. Sturgeons {{are among the most}} valuable aquatic species in the world. They are prized for their delicate flesh and world famous caviar. They have also interesting evolutionary status and life history. Several species of sturgeon occurred in the Black Sea basin and in the waters of the neighbouring countries. At present more than 27 sturgeon species are found living throughout the world of which seven species are found distributed in the Black Sea and its drainage basin, namely beluga (Huso huso), Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), <b>common</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. sturio), sterlet (A. ruthenus), ship (A. nudiventris), stellate (A. stellatus) and Persian sturgeon (A. persicus). The stocks have declined rapidly due to multi-factorial causes such as overfishing, destruction of critical habitats through construction of dams and dikes on the rivers obstructed the migration of the fish, industrial pollutions and fishing during spawning period. In this paper, the present status of sturgeons in the world and Turkey has been discussed in terms of threats, conservation measures and restorat ion activitie...|$|E

5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be <b>common,</b> pallid <b>sturgeon</b> populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the genetic origin of individual sturgeon that are morphologically intermediate to pallid (Scaphirhynchus albus) and shovelnose (Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus) sturgeon, we combined previously published mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite data with additional microsatellite data. Two sympatric populations of pallid and shovelnose sturgeon {{from the upper}} Missouri River and a sympatric population containing pallid, shovelnose, and putative pallid-shovelnose hybrids from the Atchafalaya River were analyzed using an index of hybridization and a principle components analysis of individual relatedness scores. The addition of new microsatellite data improved our ability to genetically differentiate individual pallid and shovelnose sturgeon collected in both areas. Our methods distinguished morphologically intermediate Atchafalaya River sturgeon, which appear to be genetically intermediate between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The results support a hybrid origin for morphologically intermediate individuals, although {{it is unclear whether}} they are all first-generation hybrids or if some are the result of subsequent backcrossing with the more <b>common</b> shovelnose <b>sturgeon.</b> The pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) was first described by Forbes and Richardson (1905) as a morphological variant of the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus), based on morphometric and meristic differentiation and o...|$|R
5|$|The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as {{vertebrate}} fossils, {{including those}} of dinosaurs, are quite <b>common.</b> Sharks, rays, <b>sturgeons,</b> bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna. Mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial Didelphodon. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus {{has been found in}} marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus. Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and caenagnathids. Intermingled with the Albertosaurus remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod Albertonykus were found. Adult Albertosaurus were the apex predators in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSturgeons (chondrostean, acipenseridae) are ancient fish species, {{widely known}} for their caviar. Nowadays, {{most of them are}} {{critically}} endangered. The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is a <b>common</b> Eurasian <b>sturgeon</b> species with a small body size and the fastest reproductive cycle among sturgeons. Such species {{can be used as a}} host for surrogate production; application is of value for recovery of critically endangered and huge sturgeon species with an extremely long reproductive cycle. One prerequisite for production of the donor's gametes only is to have a sterile host. Commonly used sterilization techniques in fishes such as triploidization or hybridization do not guarantee sterility in sturgeon. Alternatively, sterilization can be achieved by using a temporary germ cell exclusion–specific gene by a knockdown agent, the antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO). The targeted gene for the MO is the dead end gene (dnd) which is a vertebrate-specific gene encoding a RNA-binding protein which is crucial for migration and survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs). For this purpose, a dnd homologue of Russian sturgeon (Agdnd), resulting in the same sequence in the start codon region with isolated fragments of sterlet dnd (Ardnd), was used. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed tissue-specific expression of Ardnd only in the gonads of both sexes. Dnd-MO for depletion of PGCs together with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) –biotin–dextran for PGCs labeling was injected into the vegetal region of one- to four-cell-stage sterlet embryos. In the control groups, only FITC was injected to validate the injection method and labeling of PGCs. After optimization of MO concentration together with volume injection, 250 -μM MO was applied for sterilization of sturgeon embryos. Primordial germ cells were detected under a fluorescent stereomicroscope in the genital ridge of the FITC-labeled control group only, whereas no PGCs were present in the body cavities of morphants at 21  days after fertilization. Moreover, the body cavities of MO-treated and nontreated fish were examined by histology and in situ hybridization, showing gonads which had no germ cells in morphants at various stages (60, 150, and 210 days after fertilization). Taken together, these results report the first known and functional method of sturgeon sterilization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Lower Danube River (LDR) still {{supports}} three naturally self-sustaining {{species of}} anadromous sturgeons. Beluga sturgeons (Huso huso) and stellate sturgeons (A. stellatus) are still <b>common</b> while Russian <b>sturgeons</b> (Acipenser gueldenstaedti) became very rare. Studying their swimming behaviour {{is essential for}} understanding (i) the impact of construction works aiming to improve conditions for navigation; (ii) sturgeon behaviour in relation to Iron Gate hydropower and navigation systems; (iii) behaviour of young sturgeons during downstream migration towards the Black Sea. A significant number of wild adult sturgeons (N= 103; 39 beluga, 1 Russian and 63 stellate) was implanted with acoustic transmitters, with depth and temperature sensors, and their movements were tracked using arrays of submerged automatic receivers installed in the LDR (R Km 60 – 863) during 2009 – 2014. For some of these fish additional swimming depth data were obtained by manual tracking. Wild born young of the year (YOY) beluga sturgeons (N= 27) were captured in the LDR (R Km 123), implanted with acoustic transmitters and released during routine monitoring (June 2010). YOY beluga sturgeons of hatchery origin (N= 33) were implanted with acoustic transmitters and stocked in the LDR at R Km 300 and R Km 102 (August 2010). Their movements were tracked and recorded by arrays of submerged acoustic receivers installed on the main Danube (R Km 101) and the three branches of the delta. This paper analyses {{for the first time}} on the LDR consistent data (over 70, 000 recordings) on swimming speed (upstream and downstream) and swimming depth behaviour of adult sturgeons (beluga and stellate), during spring and autumn migration season, and YOY beluga sturgeons of wild and hatchery origin...|$|R
40|$|I used field surveys, {{geospatial}} modeling, and cross-system {{comparisons to}} determine if dispersal of larval Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) differed in small and large river systems and resulted in a corresponding difference in habitat use for age 0 – 2 individuals. Most species – environmental relationships have been described based on interactions observed during an animal’s most dominant life history stage, or extrapolated from systems where animal behavior is better understood. As a result, knowledge of habitat use during early development of a species is often poorly understood, or assumed to be consistent throughout the animal’s range. Using field surveys in North Channel (NC) and Middle Channel (MC) of the St. Clair River, Michigan, I assessed movement patterns of larval Lake Sturgeon and found significantly higher catch per unit effort (CPUE; No. larvae / hour) in 3 locations 0. 5 – 5 km downstream from their natal reefs. Further, I found variation in larval lengths and yolk sac stages from individuals collected in single nets at each of these sites. This suggests larvae of variable ages remained in the river and that suitable nursery habitat existed there and was being utilized by young sturgeon. I then developed a novel habitat suitability model (HSM) to evaluate the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of riverine nursery habitat for larval, young-of-year (YOY), and juvenile (< 500 mm) Lake Sturgeon in NC. This HSM was developed using georeferenced information on substrate, invertebrate densities, benthic current velocities, and depth. Of the 283 larval Lake Sturgeon collected, the majority were found in high quality habitat (81 %) and clustered in three locations (91. 2 % of total catch). Nine out of 11 YOY and juveniles collected in NC were also in high quality habitat, suggesting suitable habitat also exists for young Lake Sturgeon in NC. Cross-system comparisons of the HSM developed for NC were undertaken for MC and Fighting Island Channel (FIC) of the Detroit River. Model outputs indicated a significantly higher abundance of high quality habitat present in NC (29. 1 %) than MC and FIC (16. 9 % and 15. 7 %, respectively). HSM modeled output for NC indicated an abundance of suitable habitat first occurred < 0. 5 km downstream from a known spawning location. Larval, YOY, and juvenile Lake Sturgeon were found in high densities at three distinct locations of high quality habitat and appeared to utilize similar riverine habitat throughout early development. In MC, larvae also concentrated in three distinct locations of high quality habitat. However, this habitat was less abundant and did not occur until 4. 5 km downstream from MC reef. Larval collections in MC decreased as sampling progressed downstream, suggesting increased drift distance to suitable habitat resulted in increased larval mortality or alternative dispersal behavior. In FIC, high quality habitat was less <b>common,</b> larval Lake <b>Sturgeon</b> abundance was low, and larvae were not observed in high concentrations. This suggests that newly emerged larvae did not utilize available habitat in FIC, but instead drifted into the main channel of the Detroit River. My dissertation showed that dispersal of larval Lake Sturgeon in the GLCCs is strongly associated with location and abundance of suitable nursery habitat downstream from natal spawning reefs. Further, results indicated variation in habitat conditions downstream of natal reefs resulted in variable dispersal patterns of young Lake Sturgeon and {{should be taken into}} account for the planning of future restoration efforts...|$|R
