The wildlife sanctuary is part of Project Tiger and Project Elephant conservation programmes run by the Government of India. The sanctuary is listed among the top five places in India for poaching tigers by the international wild life trade monitoring network, TRAFFIC. In February 2016, the National Tiger Conservation Authority announced that drones will be used to monitor tiger population in five tiger reserves including Sathyamangalam.|$|E
5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief <b>conservator</b> of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E

50|$|Separated shards are {{carefully}} reassembled. <b>Conservators</b> use identifying clues such as shape, texture, and decorative pattern or painted scenes {{to piece together}} fragments. Missing shards can be recreated out of plaster and replaced. In-painting is used to disguise areas of repair. In modern conservation treatment, the media used by <b>conservators</b> is reversible and can easily be distinguished from ancient material. Different <b>conservators,</b> or conservation departments, may have different policies regarding in-painting. Some <b>conservators</b> leave replacement fragments completely undecorated in order to easily distinguish them as modern additions. Some <b>conservators</b> paint silhouettes of missing figures, using existing fragments, scene narrative, and other extant vases as examples. This approach helps show the narrative of the painted scene, while still distinguishing the modern restoration from the original fragments. Some <b>conservators</b> use more extensive in-painting to recreate missing decoration.|$|R

A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Center for Molecular Biology in Hyderabad.

5|$|Marigene Butler, head <b>conservator</b> at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research}} project between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the quality and}} the cost-efficiency of contract archaeology in Sweden a revised regulation for contract archaeology was established the 1 st of January 2008. By including find strategy as a concept with special demands in the regulation the Swedish Heritage Board is now hoping that the <b>conservators</b> will be integrated earlier in the archaeological process and that the unpremeditated find accumulations will stop. This is making the competition between the archaeological companies even harder. The questions are how the regulation have affected {{the role of the}} <b>conservators</b> in the field of contract archaeology today, what is affecting the integration and the situation, and what can the different stakeholders do to make the collaboration between archaeologists and <b>conservators</b> more professional? The <b>conservators</b> are now hoping that this is the change that will {{increase the}} collaboration with the archaeologists, which is important for the finds prosperity and the drive of information. To get an updated and generalised view {{of the impact of the}} regulation so far, phone conversations and questionnaires were carried out with archaeologists, <b>conservators,</b> employees at county administrative boards and the Swedish Heritage Board. The answers revealed a generally positive attitude amongst the archaeologists about the conservators’ integration in the archaeological field. It also revealed that most of the archaeologists already are satisfied with the contact they have with the <b>conservators</b> today, while the answers from the <b>conservators</b> proved the opposite. It is still very rare that <b>conservators</b> are part of the practical fieldwork, where the most crucial stage for the finds takes place. The contact is still not constant and the understanding of what the <b>conservators</b> can do is not obvious, and therefore the lack of demand for more contact and practical help. It seems like we are getting closer to the goal, but the communication to a better understanding is still missing and collaboration is scarce. The <b>conservators</b> have to claim their role in the archaeological field and explain their importance in the integration more clearly. If nothing is done, probably nothing will happen...|$|R

5|$|The IMA's {{conservation}} {{department was}} established in 1970 by the museum's first full-time <b>conservator,</b> Paul Spheeris, and quickly became known as a regional center for conservation. In 1978 the department began providing consulting services to regional institutions, taking on contracts from across the Midwest. An early high-profile contract involved the preservation of 45 governors' portraits {{over the course of}} 15 months. The 1979 exhibit, Portraits and Painters of the Governors of Indiana, was held at the IMA from January to March before the portraits were placed on permanent display at the Indiana Statehouse. Other major regional projects have included the conservation and restoration of the Thomas Hart Benton murals, first created for the Indiana Hall at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair and now located at Indiana University, the Wishard Memorial Hospital murals, the Otto Stark and Clifton Wheeler murals in Indianapolis Public School 54, and most recently the restoration of the May Wright Sewall Memorial Torches at Herron High School, the former site of the John Herron Art Institute.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent <b>conservator</b> and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{conservation}} department serves {{the needs of}} the museum through the expertise of specialists in paintings, textiles, works on paper, frames, and objects conservation. The department has grown in both size and staff throughout the years, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2007. As of 2007, the IMA owned one of the few computer-based X-ray units in the United States, continuing a trend in X-ray technology that the department began in the 1970s. In 1980, the department helped organize and establish the Midwest Regional Conservation Guild, which includes conservators and conservation scientists from Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. In the mid-1980s, the department received attention when head <b>conservator</b> Martin Radecki assisted local authorities in uncovering over two dozen forged T.C. Steele and William Forsythe paintings worth more than $200,000. The high-profile forgery case led Radecki to organize an exhibit in 1989, Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and Forgery in Indiana. The exhibit highlighted conservation techniques and examined how forgeries can be discovered. Another public presentation of conservation took place in 2007 with Sebastiano Mainardi: The Science of Art, a Star Studio exhibit that allowed visitors to watch conservators as they worked on the 16th-century altarpiece. The IMA's Star Studio is an interactive gallery that enables visitors to learn, through the process of art-making and observation, about the museum's collections.|$|E
