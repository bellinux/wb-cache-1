500|$|A <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> of {{the maximum}} {{potential}} intensity, , is [...] However, this quantity varies significantly across space and time, particularly within the seasonal cycle, spanning a range of [...] This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( [...] ) {{as well as in}} the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere, which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating. The nature of this modulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). [...] On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean, as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water. However, this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on [...] is weak in comparison.|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of sound inside porous absorbing material {{can be described}} completely by use of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>values,</b> the complex wave number k(ind a) and the complex impedance Z(ind a). These <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> can be calculated using different acoustical models, e. g. {{the model of the}} homogeneous medium or the model of DELANY/BAZELY. But in case that for some special absorber no model exists, or the model is not valid due to clogging or deformation of the porous material, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> cannot be calculated correctly. This paper describes the direct measurement of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>values,</b> dependent from clogging or deformation. With the help of these <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> it is possible to estimate the parameters of the absorber or to predict the transmission loss of a silencer that is lined with this particular porous absorber. This measuring method is usefull especially for the new hollow metal sphere absorbers, for which no exact and universally valid acoustical models exists. These new porous absorbers can replace common porous absorbers with equal acoustical properties in places, where conventional absorbers cannot be used due to their disadvantageous technical properties.

[...] When the latent vertices are included, the resulting split system has the Helly property: every pairwise intersecting subfamily has a common intersection. [...] In some sense median graphs are characterized as coming from Helly split systems: the pairs (Wuv, Wvu) defined for each edge uv of a median graph form a Helly split system, so if one applies the Buneman graph construction to this system no latent vertices will be needed and the result will be the same as the starting graph.|$|E
2500|$|Phylogeny is the {{inference}} of evolutionary trees from observed characteristics of species; such a tree must place the species at distinct vertices, {{and may have}} additional latent vertices, but the latent vertices are required to have three or more incident edges and must also be labeled with characteristics.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of blown films made of {{thermoplastic materials}} {{is considered an}} important processing technique for polymer raw material. Today, one goal of the further development of the blown film extrusion is the reduction of raw material application while maintaining or {{improving the quality of}} the film, also in regard of the mechanical properties. Therefore, the mechanical film properties, as a key aspect on the way to create thinner films, move into the focus of interest. Up to now, a generic and recognised calculation model, which predicts the film properties in the blown film extrusion process, is not available. Hence, large imponderability in predicting film properties for new product development or the change of material or the production line result to the film manufacturer. Therefore, the proposal of a calculation model in order to predict the mechanical <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> of the blown film extrusion {{is the subject of this}} work. The model developed in the course of this work, in order to predict the blown film properties, is based on the foundation of statistical modelling. The corresponding mechanical <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> form the start values of the model. As input <b>value,</b> dimensionless process <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> are being chosen, in order to ensure the transferability of the statistical property model on different materials and production lines. Therefore, next to the known <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> of the blown film process, blow-up ratio and take-up ratio, additional process <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> are being introduced. All used process <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> have in common that they describe the process state in the bubble expansion zone because the blown film properties are being fixed there. The results show that it is on principle possible to describe the mechanical blown film properties with statistical models by the use of process <b>characteristic</b> <b>values.</b> The results of shrinkage and strain at 100 % stretch are to be judged as good, while the results of the calculation of Young’s modulus and tensile strength can be used to assess the properties roughly. The transferability of the model to different materials and blown film lines has been realised only to a limited extend. For a possible improvement, further research is necessary. Some approaches by the use of additional material- or plant-specific <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> have been shown already...|$|R
