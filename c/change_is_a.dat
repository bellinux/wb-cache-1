5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pervasive pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

25|$|Change to attacking formations. When {{chasing a}} game for a {{desirable}} result, teams tend to sacrifice a defensive player or a midfield player for a forward in order to chase a result.

25|$|Change to {{defensive}} formations. When a team {{is in the}} lead, or {{wishes to}} protect the scoreline of a game, the coach may choose to revert to a more defensive structure by removing a forward for a more defensive player. The extra player in defence or midfield adds solidity by giving the team more legs to chase opponents and recover possession. An {{example of such a}} <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> change from 4–4–2 to 5–3–2, 3–5–2 to 4–5–1, or even 4–4–2 to 5–4–1.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how a spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to make}} some considerations about a simple convex lens.

This <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control.

25|$|Technological <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 {{study in the}} journal Science showed that {{the peak of the}} rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, technological change clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of technological change.|$|E

25|$|Understanding and {{describing}} <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> common {{theme in the}} natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise {{the ways in which}} many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.|$|E
25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E
25|$|When Vikernes was convicted, it was {{possible}} to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the Norwegian Parliament had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason. His lawyer, John Christian Elden, has complained that the policy <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> form of retroactive legislation. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Tromsø Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years. In March 2009, however, his parole was announced. He had then served 15 years of his 21-year sentence. On 22 May 2009, he confirmed that he had been released from prison on probation.|$|E
