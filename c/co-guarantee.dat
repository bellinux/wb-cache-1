50|$|One Microfinance program, run by Empowering the Poor in Development(EPID) - Kenya {{partnered with}} the United States-based, 501(c)(3) non-profit, The Walking with Africans Foundation (WAF) focuses on {{organizing}} and providing initial funding to Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) groups. EPID and WAF jointly oversee 5 ROSCA groups totaling 120 {{members in the}} greater Kibwezi area. The program provides initial loans without collateral, allowing members of peer groups the opportunity to <b>co-guarantee</b> repayment of loans and assume management of the revolving fund. The small interest collected from loans is reinvested into lending to more participants. To qualify and remain in the program, participants must meet strict monitoring criteria and pay back the original loans through small weekly repayments and contributions to joint savings. Qualified participants who own small businesses or who seek to establish small business enterprises are extended loans on a short-term repayment cycle (3 to 6 months). WAF was founded by James Munthali, a retired economist with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), {{and other members of}} Burke Presbyterian Church in the suburbs of Washington D.C., United States of America.|$|E
