40|$|Objectives: Aseptic {{loosening}} of the tibial component {{remains a}} major cause of failure in total knee arthroplasty and may be related, directly or indirectly, to micromotion. Therefore, good fixation of the tibial component is a prerequisite to achieve long-term success of the implant. Cementing technique is one of the factors that play a role in this respect. We investigated the effect of different cementing techniques on the cement penetration in the proximal tibia. Methods: We compared 5 different cementing techniques in an anatomical open pore sawbone model (n= 25), using a contemporary TKA design and standard polymethylmetacrylate cement. In the first technique, 10 g of cement was applied in a thin layer on the lower surface of the tibial component. The component was then placed and impacted onto the tibia using the specific component impactor supplied by the manufacturer. In the second technique, 20 g of cement was applied in a thick layer on the lower surface of the tibial component. In the third technique, 20 g of cement was applied in equal parts, on both the tibial component and the tibial bone using a spatula. In the fourth technique, 20 g of cement was applied in equal parts on both the tibial component and the tibial bone, but it was fingerpacked into the bone. In the fifth technique, 20 g of cement was applied to the tibial bone {{with the use of a}} <b>cement</b> <b>gun.</b> After making cuts in the medial and lateral oblique sagittal plane of the tibia, we used Corel PHOTO-PAINT 9 to quantify the cement penetration. Results: Technique 1 (thin layer of cement on the tibial implant only) and 2 (thick layer of cement on the tibial implant only) were not significantly different from each other in terms of penetration depth, but were both significantly different from the other techniques. The same was seen for technique 3 (two equal parts of cement on both the tibial component and the tibial bone using a spatula) and 4 (two equal parts of cement on both the tibial component and the tibial bone, using the fingerpacking technique). The penetration depth was highest for technique 5 (using a <b>cement</b> <b>gun),</b> which was significantly different from all the other techniques. Conclusions: We demonstrated that applying cement to both the undersurface of the tibial baseplate and as well as onto the tibial bone, either by a spatula or fingerpacking technique, leads to an optimal cement penetration of 3 - 5 mm. When cement is applied only onto the tibial component, penetration is insufficient. When a <b>cement</b> <b>gun</b> is used, cement penetration is too excessive. status: publishe...|$|E

Clinical outcome was assessed using the Harris Hip score. Radiological analysis was performed on calibrated plain radiographs taken in two planes. Complete radiological data on 110 patients (120 hips) and clinical follow-up on all the surviving 111 patients (122 hips) was available. The fate of all the hips was known. At final follow-up, the mean Harris Hip score was 86 (47 to 100), and 87 of 116 patients (75 %) had good or excellent scores. Survival with revision of the stem for aseptic loosening as the endpoint was 100 %; and survival with revision of the stem for any reason was 95. 9 % (95 % confidence interval 87. 8 to 96. 8) at ten years.

60|$|But {{if that is}} so, {{you will}} ask, {{why is it that}} they have not made more {{impression}} upon the enemy's position? The answer lies in the strategical position of Italy, and it can be discussed without any technicalities. A child could understand it. The Alps form such a bar across the north that there are only two points where serious operations are possible. One is the Trentino Salient where Austria can always threaten and invade Italy. She lies in the mountains with the plains beneath her. She can always invade the plain, but the Italians cannot seriously invade the mountains, since the passes would only lead to other mountains beyond. Therefore their only possible policy is to hold the Austrians back. This they have most successfully done, and though the Austrians {{with the aid of a}} shattering heavy artillery have recently made some advance, it is perfectly certain that they can never really carry out any serious invasion. The Italians then have done all that could be done in this quarter. There remains the other front, the opening by the sea. Here the Italians had a chance to advance over a front of plain bounded by a river with hills beyond. They cleared the plain, they crossed the river, they fought a battle very like our own battle of the Aisne upon the slopes of the hills, taking 20,000 Austrian prisoners, and now they are faced by barbed wire, machine <b>guns,</b> <b>cemented</b> trenches, and every other device which has held them as it has held every one else. But remember what they have done for the common cause and be grateful for it. They have in a year occupied some forty Austrian divisions, and relieved our Russian allies to that very appreciable extent. They have killed or wounded a quarter of a million, taken 40,000, and drawn to themselves a large portion of the artillery. That is their record up to date. As to the future it is very easy to prophesy. They will continue to absorb large enemy armies. Neither side can advance far as matters stand. But if the Russians advance and Austria has to draw her men to the East, there will be a tiger spring for Trieste. If manhood can break the line, then I believe the Durandos will do it.|$|R

40|$|Aseptic {{loosening}} is {{the major}} problem in hip joint replacement. Improved cementing techniques {{have been shown to}} improve the long-term survival of implants significantly. To assess the use of modern cementing techniques in British surgeons, a detailed questionnaire was sent to all Fellows of The British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) regarding cement preparation, bone preparation, cementing technique and prostheses used in total hip arthroplasty. Excluding retired fellows, surgeons who use no cement, and those who had filled in forms inadequately, 668 responded, who between them performed 43, 680 hip arthroplasties per year. In this survey, 21 different types of hip prostheses were implanted by the surgeons; 48 % of hips implanted were Charnley type. Of the surgeons, 46 % used Palacos with gentamicin as their cement for both the femur and acetabulum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1999, a {{statement}} of best practice in primary total hip replacement {{was approved by the}} Council of the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and by the British Hip Society (BHS) to provide a basis for regional and national auditable standards. We have compared practice in the North West Region of England to this document to ascertain adherence to this guide to best practice. METHODS: A total of 86 surgeons from 26 hospitals were included in a questionnaire study. RESULTS: A mean of 93. 3 % of operations were performed in the surgeon's usual theatre. All of these theatres had vertical laminar air flow systems. Of respondents, 42. 2 % routinely used exhaust suits, 68. 1 % routinely used impermeable disposable gowns, and 26. 1 % used impermeable re-usable gowns. The Charnley femoral and acetabular prostheses were the most commonly used prostheses. All surgeons used some form of anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis: 66. 2 % use a combination of both mechanical and chemical means. All surgeons used antibiotic prophylaxis. The most popular choice of antibiotic was a cephalosporin [...] 70. 7 % used a 3 -dose regimen over 24 h, 2. 6 % of surgeons continued antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 h after surgery, and 93. 7 % of surgeons routinely use antibiotic-loaded cement. All surgeons routinely cleaned, irrigated and dried the acetabulum and femur before cement insertion. Only one surgeon did not use any form of femoral canal occlusion. 69. 4 % used an intramedullary bone block. Retrograde filling of the femoral shaft by means of a <b>cement</b> <b>gun</b> was practised by 65. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated considerable variation of practice in total hip arthroplasty across the North West Region and significant divergence from the statement of best practice approved by the BOA and BHS.

There was a 70 % response rate of which 71 did not perform hip surgery, a further 33 refused to take part, leaving 181 valid responses. Preoperative assessment clinics were used by 89 % of surgeons, but anaesthetists and rehabilitation services were rarely involved at this stage. Of respondents, 99 % used routine thromboprophylaxis, with 79 % {{using a combination of}} mechanical and chemical methods. Of surgeons, 84 % routinely used stockings, whereas 95. 5 % used chemical prophylaxis, 63 % employed low molecular weight heparins. Theatre facilities were shared with other surgical specialties by 6 % of surgeons and 18 % regularly used body exhaust suits for THR. Antibiotic loaded cement was used by 69 % of surgeons, the majority (65 %) used a single brand of normal viscosity cement with 9 % using reduced viscosity formulations. Modern cementing techniques were commonly used at least in part, 87 % used a <b>cement</b> <b>gun</b> and 94 % a cement restrictor for femoral cementing.

(there is an additional 1. 5 -in. inner liner {{for much of the}} height), and a spherical domed roof (nominal thickness is 10 in.) rising another 6 ft, 3 in. {{at the center of the}} tank. The thickness of both the sidewall and the domed roof increases to 30 in. near their juncture. The tank floor is nominally 3 -in. thick, except at the juncture with the wall where the thickness increases to 9 in. The tanks are constructed of gunite (a mixture of Portland cement, sand, and water in the form of a mortar) sprayed from the nozzle of a <b>cement</b> <b>gun</b> against a form or a solid surface. The floor and the dome are reinforced with one layer of welded wire mesh and reinforcing rods placed in the radial direction. The sidewall is reinforced with three layers of welded wire mesh, vertical { 1 / 2 }-in. rods, and 21 horizontal rebar hoops (attached to the vertical rods) post-tensioned to 35, 000 psi stress. The haunch at the sidewall/roof junction is reinforced with 17 horizontal rebar hoops post-tensioned with 35, 000 to 40, 000 psi stress. The yield strength of the post-tensioning steel rods is specified to be 60, 000 psi, and all other steel is 40, 000 psi steel. The specified 28 -day design strength of the gunite is 5, 000 psi...|$|E
30|$|Deep {{infection}} following total joint arthroplasty {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most severe complications [1 â€“ 5]. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is an accepted and efficient method of local antibiotics delivery and is widely used for prophylaxis and treatment of deep infection after arthroplasty and other orthopedic surgeries [6 â€“ 8]. The elution characteristics of ALBC and antibiotics have been investigated in many previous papers [9 â€“ 15]. When ALBC is used for fixing the prosthesis in the primary arthroplasty, the most important point is to obtain rigid fixation as it is well recognized that bone cement is plagued with a number of drawbacks that contribute to the aseptic loosening of cemented arthroplasties. To achieve the initial rigid and long endurable fixation with reducing the porosity of the cement, various cementing techniques such as antibiotic mixing technique, <b>cement</b> <b>gun,</b> negative pressure mixing (vacuum mixing) [16, 17], and centrifugation [17, 19] are currently performed. Moreover, in order to maintain the cementâ€™s mechanical strength, a low-dose ALBC product (1 g antibiotic per 40 g bone cement) is available for the initial fixation of the prosthesis as prophylaxis; the mechanical property of this low-dose ALBC is stronger than the hand-mixed one and as strong as nonantibiotic control cement [6, 20]. Meanwhile, in treating infected arthroplasties, elution efficacy of the antibiotics is most important when ALBC is used for fabricating the joint spacer. In this circumstance, the mechanical strength of ALBC is not so important. It had also been reported that increasing the ALBC porosity increases the antibiotic elution, so dextran and glycine were used as space fillers to obtain a more porous ALBC [12, 21]. In those studies, antibiotic elution properties were examined in detail, and a significantly higher elution efficacy was found when ABLC contained space filler. However, detail of cement porosity and other methods of obtaining higher porosity of ALBC were not described in these previous studies. When considering the cement pores as pathways that enable the antibiotics to spread outside the cement spacer, surface porosity of the cement spacer will be the most appropriate indicator for the elution efficacy because the pores which are located deep inside the spacer without any junction to the outside are considered to have no relation with antibiotic elution. The question remains: how deep must the pores be within the cement spacer in order not to release relevant amounts of antibiotic? This remains hard to quantify.|$|E
