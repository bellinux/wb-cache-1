40|$|The main target <b>of</b> a <b>steering</b> {{system is}} that the driver can change vehicle {{trajectory}} {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power steering types include; Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro - Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental type of Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel off angle to the left wheel off angle.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials in airplanes {{has been increasing}} over the last decades, mainly due to the high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio of composites. Traditionally, the possible fibre angles are often restricted to 0 °, ± 45 ° and 90 °, referred to as conventional laminates. However, {{with the rise of}} fibre placement machines, not only can any ply angle be placed, the fibres can even be steered onto curved paths. By steering the fibres, the mechanical properties of the material are made spatially varying while maintaining material continuity; hence these laminates are called variable stiffness laminates. This thesis proposes an optimisation approach that exploits the possibilities of variable stiffness laminates, while posing limitations to the steering radius to guarantee the optimised design is manufacturable. Furthermore, the design guidelines are interpreted for variable stiffness laminates and posed as constraints, increasing the (industrial) feasibility of the optimised design. In addition to steering the fibres, layers can also be dropped to obtain laminates with varying mechanical properties. This is also incorporated in the optimisation algorithm, leading to variable thickness laminates. Finally, the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> fibres and dropping layers is implemented as well, leading to variable stiffness, variable thickness laminates.

40|$|Most of the {{fault-tolerant}} control strategies {{found in}} the literature assume conclusive diagnosis, i. e. the current fault mode of the plant is well-known. Although, speculative diagnosis can be a more realistic approach while noise corrupted measurements and plant disturbances hamper the construction of a precise diagnosis statement. Speculative diagnosis consists in providing a set with the most probable fault modes in the control system. The idea of a set with probable fault modes is not new, but reconfiguration is not an easy task in this context. Prompt reconfiguration under lack of a conclusive statement is not properly approached in the current literature. The risks involved in such decision are evaluated and used in the modeling of the Dilemma Diagnoser. It is a decision maker coupling speculative diagnosis statements and control reconfiguration to achieve a safe decision in a particular sense, i. e. keep the control system stable and close to the desired reference. The problem is modeled as a bi-matrix game, the two players are the Diagnoser (choses among several available fault modes in a speculative set) and the Switcher (choses between reconfigure instantaneously or wait until the next diagnosis sample to make a decision). It can be solved by game theory using Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium. A specific control strategy is also developed to recover a multi-wheeled rover from steering motor failures. This strategy is integrated with the Dilemma Diagnoser and applied to the case of the ExoMars Rover. Note that all methods presented here are applicable to all kinds of multi-wheeled rovers and are capable to cover all amplitudes and <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> failures as long as sufficient driving power is available. The fault-tolerant controller is tested in the Planetary Exploration Laboratory (PEL) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR-Oberpfaffenhofen); the controller is embedded in the ExoMars B 2 Breadboard Model.

At DLR a radiometric demonstrator for fully-electronic MW imaging was set up at Ka band, {{which is based on}} a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> beam <b>steering</b> by frequency shift using a broadband slotted-waveguide antenna for one scanning direction, and the application of aperture synthesis for the other direction.

For example, in Earth observation missions, {{it is possible}} to estimate the salinity of oceans, the soil moisture of landscapes, or to extract atmospheric parameters like the liquid water content of clouds. Due to the penetration capabilities of microwaves through many dielectric materials, and the purely passive character of this kind of remote sensing, this technique nowadays is considered as well in many security and reconnaissance applications (e. g. observation of sensitive areas, detection of concealed objects, trough-wall imaging, etc.). Presently different imaging principles for MW radiometry are possible. Most of them still are based on pure mechanical scanning or they combine this with electronic scanning by using parts of a focal plane array. Due to many advantages, the technological trend is going towards fully-electronic beam steering or two-dimensional focal plane arrays.
