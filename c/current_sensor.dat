40|$|Abstract − Power {{semiconductor}} switches {{that include}} integrated pilot <b>current</b> <b>sensors</b> create opportunities to eliminate external <b>current</b> <b>sensors</b> in three-phase inverter applications. Each {{of the three}} conventional low-side power switches in a three-phase inverter can be replaced by one of these special devices {{that is designed to}} provide a sensing level current that accurately mirrors its total forward current. Recognizing that the output current in each phase flows through the low-side switch for only a portion of the fundamental cycle, a technique has been developed to reconstruct the full phase current waveforms for R-L loads using only the incomplete phase current measurements. The performance characteristics of the proposed current reconstruction technique are experimentally verified, including demonstration of a closed-loop three-phase current regulator using the reconstructed current feedback from the integrated pilot <b>current</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due {{to limited}} budgets and reduced {{inspection}} staff, {{state departments of}} transportation (DOTs) {{are in need of}} innovative approaches for providing more efficient quality assurance on concrete paving projects. The goal of this research was to investigate and test new methods that can determine pavement thickness in real time. Three methods were evaluated: laser scanning, ultrasonic <b>sensors,</b> and eddy <b>current</b> <b>sensors.</b> Laser scanning, which scans the surface of the base prior to paving and then scans the surface after paving, can determine the thickness at any point. Also, scanning lasers provide thorough data coverage {{that can be used to}} calculate thickness variance accurately and identify any areas where the thickness is below tolerance. Ultrasonic and eddy <b>current</b> <b>sensors</b> also have the potential to measure thickness nondestructively at discrete points and may result in an easier method of obtaining thickness. There appear to be two viable approaches for measuring concrete pavement thickness during the paving operation: laser scanning and eddy <b>current</b> <b>sensors.</b> Laser scanning has proved to be a reliable technique in terms of its ability to provide virtual core thickness with low variability. Research is still required to develop a prototype system that integrates point cloud data from two scanners. Eddy <b>current</b> <b>sensors</b> have also proved to be a suitable alternative, and are probably closer to field implementation than the laser scanning approach. As a next step for this research project, it is suggested that a pavement thickness measuring device using eddy <b>current</b> <b>sensors</b> be created, which would involve both a handheld and paver-mounted version of the device...|$|R
50|$|Doppler {{instruments}} are more common. An instrument {{of this type}} is the Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), which measures the water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column. The ADCPs use the traveling time of the sound to determine {{the position of the}} moving particles. Single-point devices use again the Doppler shift, but ignoring the traveling times. Such a single-point Doppler <b>Current</b> <b>Sensor</b> (DCS) has a typical velocity range of 0 to 300 cm/s. The devices are usually equipped with additional optional sensors.|$|E
50|$|Hall effect devices (when {{appropriately}} packaged) are {{immune to}} dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.When electrons flow through a conductor, {{a magnetic field}} is produced. Thus, {{it is possible to}} create a non-contacting <b>current</b> <b>sensor.</b> The device has three terminals.A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a shunt, required for the most common current sensing method) need be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{low-cost}} current sensors {{based on}} the principle of a Rogowski coil have been developed. These sensors share the principles of a Rogowski coil, measuring the rate of change of current using a transformer with no magnetic core. The difference from the traditional Rogowski coil is that the sensor can be manufactured using a planar coil rather than a toroidal coil. In order to reject the influence of conductors outside the sensor's measurement region, these planar Rogowski current sensors use a concentric coil geometry instead of a toroidal geometry to limit the response to external fields. The main advantage of the planar Rogowski <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> is that the coil winding precision that is a requirement for accuracy can be achieved using low-cost printed circuit board manufacturing.|$|E

50|$|Two or more {{contactors}} {{may be used}} {{to provide}} reduced voltage starting of a motor. By using an autotransformer or a series inductance, a lower voltage is present at the motor terminals, reducing starting torque and inrush current. Once the motor has come up to some fraction of its full-load speed, the starter switches to full voltage at the motor terminals. Since the autotransformer or series reactor only carries the heavy motor starting current for a few seconds, the devices can be much smaller compared to continuously rated equipment. The transition between reduced and full voltage may be based on elapsed time, or triggered when a <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> shows the motor current has begun to reduce. An autotransformer starter was patented in 1908.|$|E
50|$|Saturable {{inductor}} <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is based}} on the detection of an inductance change. The saturable inductor is made of small and thin magnetic core wound with a coil around it. The saturable inductor operates into its saturation region. It is designed {{in such a way that}} the external and internal flux density will affect its saturation level. Change in the saturation level of a saturable inductor will alter core’s permeability and, consequently, its inductance L. The value of saturable inductance (L) is high at low currents (based on the permeability of the core) and low at high currents (the core permeability becomes unity when saturated).Fluxgate detectors rely on the property of many magnetic materials to exhibit a non-linear relationship between the magnetic field strength H and the flux density B.|$|E
5000|$|June 14, 2007: Kodak {{announced}} {{a two to}} fourfold increase in sensitivity to light (from one to two stops) compared to <b>current</b> <b>sensor</b> designs. This design was {{a departure from the}} classic [...] "Bayer filter" [...] by adding panchromatic or “clear” pixels to the RGB elements on the sensor array. Since these pixels are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light, they collect a significantly higher proportion of the light striking the sensor. In combination with advanced Kodak software algorithms optimized for these new patterns, photographers benefited from an increase in photographic speed (improving performance in low light), faster shutter speeds (reducing motion blur for moving subjects), and smaller pixels (higher resolutions in a given optical format) while retaining performance. The technology was credited to Kodak scientists John Compton and John Hamilton.|$|E
