40|$|AbstractWater <b>curtain</b> could dilute leaking {{poisonous}} gas or obstruct {{the diffusion of}} the {{poisonous gas}} to the sensitivity regions safely, efficiently and quickly. So {{it was very important}} to understand diffusion mechanism of the heavy gas diluted by water <b>curtain</b> and explore pattern of the effect of water curtain's setting parameter on the diffusion capacity of heavy gas diluted with water <b>curtain.</b> In this paper, experiments of fan water <b>curtain</b> and cone water <b>curtain</b> diluting CO 2 in open space were done. According to experiment results, dilution mechanism of fan water <b>curtain</b> and cone water <b>curtain</b> were obtained. The protective screen formed by fan water <b>curtain</b> could obstruct heavy gas diffusion effectively, and fan water <b>curtain</b> could also disperse heavy gas upwards through the mechanical effect. Cone water <b>curtain</b> would atomize the water and mix the heavy gas and air intensively with the help of air entrainment to dilute the heavy gas clouds. On this basis, it was concluded that when water <b>curtain</b> was opened before heavy gas passed through water <b>curtain</b> and the cone water <b>curtain</b> was installed in front of the fan water <b>curtain,</b> dilution effect was better. When water <b>curtain</b> was opened after heavy gas passed through water <b>curtain</b> and the fan water <b>curtain</b> was installed in front of the cone water <b>curtain,</b> dilution effect was better...|$|R

5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no <b>curtains</b> on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E

5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding <b>curtains</b> often surround the welding area. These <b>curtains,</b> made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
