5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{contract}} for the ships was signed on 4 October 2007. The A$8 billion, three-ship deal included the option to order a fourth ship at a later date. This option was due to expire in October 2008. The Australian government sought to extend the offer into early 2009, so as to review {{the recommendations of the}} [...] white paper due for completion at the end of 2008, and to enquire about acquiring a fourth Aegis system from the USN, before ordering or cancelling the fourth destroyer. The Navy League of Australia has consistently supported the acquisition of a fourth AWD. According to the Navy League, building a fourth destroyer would be relatively <b>cheap</b> (<b>money</b> for design and other 'start-up' costs would have already been spent) and improve RAN capabilities (by offering increased flexibility and redundancy, particularly {{in the event of a}} Falklands War-like armed conflict). Along with the Navy League, the Australian defence industry has supported a fourth destroyer, to keep workers employed for longer while reducing the gap to the next major defence construction projects (the Collins-class replacement and the Anzac-class replacement).|$|E

50|$|The {{inflation}} rate {{will not be}} known in advance. People often base their expectation of future inflation on an average of {{inflation rate}}s in the past, but this gives rise to errors. The real interest rate ex-post {{may turn out to}} be quite different from the real interest rate (ex-ante real interest rate) that was expected in advance. Borrowers hope to repay in <b>cheaper</b> <b>money</b> in the future, while lenders hope to collect on more expensive money.

The <b>cheapest</b> <b>money</b> {{available}} {{to finance the}} development and expansion of your business {{is to be found}} within your business itself. It costs nothing to locate, but requires effort, self-discipline and good management to realize and maintain the necessary capital. The management of current assets is an essential element of the financial management of a company. Current-asset-management plays an important role to assure survival of a company when growing fast. This report describes a case study of a specialist rehabilitation company, Envirogreen Pty. Ltd [...] The aim {{of this study is to}} show that the management of bank, debtors, creditors and growth is important to ensure a solid financial platform. from which hture opportunities can be captured. The sales of Envirogreen have grown at an average rate of 160 % since 1993194. Innovative ways to speed up the collection of money from debtors, and management of suppliers, to yield a positive bank balance, were investigated. The financial statements for the period of 1993194 - 1997198 was analyzed and is explained. The major conclusions reached are described in the final chapter, along with suggestions to improve financial management within Envirogreen. The concluding chapter is followed by a glossary of terms.

50|$|Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, Baron Dalton PC (16 August 1887 - 13 February 1962) was a British Labour Party {{economist}} and politician {{who served as}} Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1945 to 1947. He shaped Labour Party foreign-policy in the 1930s, opposed pacifism, promoted rearmament against the German threat, and strongly opposed the appeasement policy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938. He served in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet. As Chancellor, he pushed his <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> policy too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947. Dalton's political position was already in jeopardy in 1947, when, he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted his resignation, but he later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions.|$|E

50|$|The {{key to this}} {{eventually}} {{emerged as}} the Settle and Carlisle Railway, which was authorised by a Midland Railway Act on 16 July 1866. The 72-mile line was to run through mountainous and thinly populated terrain, from Settle, north of Keighley, to Carlisle. The construction was to be fearsomely difficult, crossing a summit level 1,025 feet above sea level; the Midland was to raise £1,650,000 in additional capital to pay for it. The scheme had been brought forward {{at a time of}} <b>cheap</b> <b>money,</b> but there was a slump in the financial sector, {{and at the end of}} 1867 the Midland Railway directors responded to massive shareholder disquiet, and ordered suspension of work on the new line. In the 1869 Parliamentary session the Midland promoted a Bill to abandon the construction, but the abandonment was opposed by other interests, and the Bill was lost.

50|$|The {{line had}} been planned for purely local transits, with only a {{possible}} link with the Arbroath and Forfar line in mind. In the years following {{the opening of the}} line, the notion of a railway network in Scotland gathered support; such a network was already forming in England, and controversy was seen everywhere in the press over a route from central Scotland to England; which route would be practicable? That discussion lent further weight to ideas of trunk railways in Scotland, and the availability of <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> led to a frenzy of railway promotions. In the 1845 Parliamentary session, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, capital £1.5 million, to build from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle, there joining the English system; but in addition the Scottish Central Railway (Castlecary to Perth), the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (Perth to Forfar), the Aberdeen Railway (Forfar to Aberdeen) and the Dundee and Perth Railway were all authorised on the same day, 31 August 1845.|$|E

These are due to the CEGB which wrongly seeks to build electricity-only stations (nuclear and coal-fired) with <b>cheap</b> public <b>money,</b> thus crowding out more cost-effective private investment in conservation (CHP and insulation) and renewables (e. g. tidal power).
