25|$|In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set}} up that covered hollow ware making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services.</b> while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of direct taxation on the wealthy while also investing more money in social services. The educational grant was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus and}} {{aim of this}} study was to {{illustrate}} and explore how biological children in foster families experience preparation and follow-up by Bufetat and the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service.</b> Further, I wanted to look at the parents’ role in the process and especially how the children experienced information and preparation by their parents. While exploring the experiences in five foster families it was important to gain a wider understanding of how it was to live in a foster family, how the foster child affected the family dynamic and further which other implications fostering could have. Based on semi-structured interviews with biological children, foster parents, one informant from Bufetat and one informant from the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service,</b> I got the empirical data to analyse and explore my research questions. I also chose to use family maps as a method with the children to gain a broader understanding of the family relationships. My main findings is divided into three analysis chapters which seeks to understand the biological children’s point of views of the information, preparation and follow-up, both by the agencies and their parents. Further, I explored the relationships in the family and the families’ experience of the first period after the foster child moved in. Implications in terms of challenging behaviour and how the foster child’s biological family might affect the foster family have been important issues. To get a more nuanced view on the family situation, the parents were included in the study as well, and I found that they had information their children did not reveal. Children’s voices and the lack of involvement from the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service</b> in terms of the children were important findings and although all the foster families found the process of the placement differently, there were some recurrent issues in most of the families. Not being heard and having little or no contact with the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service,</b> lack of time for preparation and family relationship was expressed as important in most families...|$|R
