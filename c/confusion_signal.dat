Yet, for students who are learning the medium of instruction as an additional language, understanding is often elusive. The study reported in this chapter looked at how African middle school students and parents, and educators in Australian schools, talked about problems of understanding, and responsibility for redressing these, at intensive language school and in transition to a mainstream Australian high school. In general, participants assumed students should <b>signal</b> <b>confusion</b> and teachers should resolve it.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a relatively new}} research topic called independent component analysis (ICA), which is becoming very popular in the signal processing literature and amongst those working in machine learning and data mining. The primary focus of ICA is to resolve the classical problem of blind source separation (BSS), in which an unknown mixture of nonGaussian signals is decomposed into its independent component signals. The classical example of BSS is the so-called cocktail-party problem, where the mixture consists of simultaneous speech signals recorded {{by a number of}} microphones. Important applications include biomedical signal processing (usually brain wave activity in the form of EEG and MEG tracings), audio signal separation (mixed speech and music <b>signals),</b> telecommunications (a <b>confusion</b> of <b>signals</b> transmitted by multiple users of mobile phones), financial time series (portfolios of stocks), and data mining (text document analysis).

25|$|After {{having his}} ships {{refitted}} Knowles sailed on a cruise, hoping to intercept a Spanish treasure fleet off Cuba. On 30 September {{he fell in}} with HMS Lenox, under Captain Charles Holmes, who {{reported that he had}} encountered a Spanish fleet some days earlier. The fleet was sighted the next morning but <b>confusion</b> over <b>signals</b> and a struggle to keep the weather gauge meant that the British fleet failed to attack in an organised manner. Though the Battle of Havana ended with the capture of one Spanish ship and another being badly damaged, it was not the major British victory hoped for. Knowles was accused of badly mismanaging the action and faced a court martial in December 1749. The result was a reprimand for the poor tactics he employed, while several of the other captains involved were also reprimanded. There was considerable bad feeling between Knowles and his subordinates, and several challenges to duel were issued. In once instance Knowles exchanged shots with Holmes, and in another two of his captains, Innes and Clarke, duelled, which resulted in Innes being mortally wounded. King George II eventually intervened to forbid any more duels over the matter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In the {{application}} of telemedicine, ECG signal is transmitted to the Doctor end without any patient details. As a result, confusion is arisen between signal and patient’s identity. To avoid this <b>confusion,</b> ECG <b>signals</b> need to be combined with patient confidential information when sent. A typical ECG monitoring device generates massive volumes of digital data. Huge amount of bandwidth {{is required for the}} transmission of the ECG signal for telemedicine purposes. This huge amount of bandwidth for the transmission of the ECG signal can be avoided if the signal is compressed after embedding the patient’s personal information within the ECG signal. Since the ECG signal and the patient details integrated into one, bandwidth for the transmission can be reduced in telemedicine applications. In this paper ECG signals are watermarked with patient information using LSB watermark technique and compressed the huge amount of ECG data using ASCII character encoding in order to confirm patient or ECG linkage integrity and reduced the bandwidth in telemedicine applications. The whole module has been applied to various ECG data of all the 12 leads taken from PTB diagnostic database (PTB-DB) of physioNet and gives a highly compressed result that can be stored using far less digital space without distorting important ECG characteristics and at the same time, embedded information can be completely retrieved...|$|R
40|$|During their synthesis, a large {{fraction}} of proteins are {{directed to the}} secretory pathway. There are several models that aim to distinguish between different destinations along this pathway; however, they rarely distinguish between known stages of this translocation process. This paper presents a translocation probability function which models the protein SRP-recruitment process—the first stage of the secretory pathway. It unifies groups of proteins with distinct final destinations, allowing more specific sorting {{to be done in}} due course, mirroring the hierarchical nature of secretory translocation. We apply conditional random fields to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a full sequence model. Introducing the translocation function improves substantially compared to a model based on properties that are relevant to the subsequent stages and final destinations only. For the discrimination of secretory, signal peptide (SP) -equipped proteins and non-secretory proteins a correlation coefficient of 0. 98 is achieved—a level of performance that is only met by specialized SP predictors. Transmembrane proteins cause considerable <b>confusion</b> in <b>signal</b> peptide predictors, but fit naturally into our transparent design and reduce the performance of the translocation function only slightly. The proposed function and model assist efforts to uncover localization and function for the growing numbers of protein sequence data. Applying our model we estimate with high confidence that about 27 % of the human and 29 % of the mouse proteins are associated with the secretory pathway...|$|R
