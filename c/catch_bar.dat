5000|$|Swingers: Each {{team has}} to swing from a trapeze {{suspended}} 40 feet above water toward a <b>catch</b> <b>bar,</b> {{drop into the}} water, then each partner has to swim toward and around a midway buoy, and back toward another buoy at the finish line. The team that {{makes it to the}} finish line in the fastest time wins, with the fastest female team winning immunity from the Jungle and the last-place female team automatically sent to the Jungle.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{important}} {{facilities for}} the district are located just outside the immediate Middlewood area. There are no large supermarkets and {{only a limited number}} of small shops within the district and most residents will commute to nearby Hillsborough to do their larger shopping needs. There is a small shopping area at the top of Leppings Lane known as the Middlewood shops. This contains a large concentration of take-away food shops although there is a medium-sized Asda supermarket located within the old Hillsborough Park cinema building on <b>Catch</b> <b>Bar</b> Lane. The cinema building dates from 1921 and ceased being a cinema in 1967, since then it has been a bingo hall and then a supermarket operated by Supasave, then Netto before Asda took over in August 2011.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{traditional}} flying trapeze act, flyers mount a narrow board (usually by climbing a tall ladder) {{and take off}} from the board on the fly bar. The flyer must wait for {{a call from the}} catcher to make sure he or she leaves at the correct time. Otherwise, the catcher will not be close enough to the flyer to make a successful catch. The flier then performs one of many aerial tricks and is caught by the catcher, who is swinging from a separate <b>catch</b> <b>bar.</b> Once in the catcher's hands, the flyer continues to swing and is thrust back toward the fly bar in a maneuver called a [...] "return". A return could consist of some kind of twist back to the bar, an [...] "angel" [...] (when the catcher holds the flyer by the feet and one arm), or any other trick that a flyer can think of {{to get back to the}} bar. Once back to the fly bar, the flyer can return to the board, and another flyer takes a turn.|$|E
5000|$|Uneven bars: Swing {{backward}} - release {{with half}} turn in flight between <b>bars</b> to <b>catch</b> low <b>bar</b> (D) ...|$|R
50|$|Solo trapeze: A {{young artist}} swung a trapeze {{incredibly}} high, whenever the trapeze was swung high the artist would spin up multiple times, and would <b>catch</b> the <b>bar</b> of the trapeze with her legs.|$|R
50|$|One-Handed Tailwhip: The rider does {{a normal}} tailwhip in the air, and, as {{the frame is}} 1/2 way through the rotation, the rider lets go one {{of his hands and}} <b>catches</b> the <b>bar</b> while hopping back on the pedals before he lands.|$|R
50|$|A common {{accident}} {{arises from}} kickback, when a chain tooth {{at the tip}} of the guide <b>bar</b> <b>catches</b> on wood without cutting through it. This throws the bar (with its moving chain) in an upward arc toward the operator which can cause serious injury or even death.|$|R
50|$|The power clean, {{a weight}} {{training}} exercise {{not used in}} competition, refers to any variant of the clean in which the lifter does not <b>catch</b> the <b>bar</b> in a full squat position (commonly accepted as thighs {{parallel to the floor}} or below). The hang clean, another weight training exercise, begins with the barbell off the ground, hanging from the arms. Both power and hang cleans are considered to be ideal for sports conditioning; as they are both total body exercises that have been known to increase neuromuscular co-ordination and core stability.|$|R
50|$|The Pak, or Pak salto, is {{a release}} move {{performed}} on the uneven bars in women's artistic gymnastics. The move starts with the gymnast hanging on the high bar and facing the low bar, then swinging forwards towards the low bar and performing a straight backward salto to <b>catch</b> the low <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|Heavy <b>catches</b> of <b>barred</b> seer fish, Scomberomorus commerson was {{observed}} at Chintapalli fishing village, 67 km north of Visakhapatnam {{on the night of}} 24 - 01 - 2013. The fish were caught by motorized crafts operated at depth of 50 - 60 m by hook and lines using sardines as bait. The total landing estimated on that day was 1200 kg. The length of the fish ranged from 85 - 153 cm FL and weight from 7. 4 - 28 kg. Landings were brought to Visakhapatnam fishing harbour and being a high valued fish, fetched a price of ` 410 /kg...|$|R
50|$|A newer form {{of power}} rack {{that has become}} popular is the half rack, which {{utilizes}} two or four vertical posts (with cantilevered <b>bar</b> <b>catches)</b> that the user stands in front of, in contrast to standing {{in the center of}} four posts in a conventional rack. The first half racks were developed at the University of Nebraska.|$|R
5000|$|The Gienger is a {{gymnastics}} skill {{performed on}} the uneven bars for women and the high bar for men. It is named after German gymnast Eberhard Gienger. The release move looks like a half-turn layout [...] "flyaway" [...] above the <b>bar</b> to <b>catch</b> the same <b>bar.</b> Its COP reference is 3.405 {{and it is a}} D element.|$|R
50|$|Bhardwaj is {{a move on}} {{the uneven}} bars in artistic {{gymnastics}} in which the gymnast performs a layout salto with full twist from the high <b>bar</b> to <b>catch</b> the low <b>bar.</b> This movement can also {{be described as a}} full-twisting Pak salto. The move is named after Indian American gymnast Mohini Bhardwaj, who was the first to perform it at an international competition.|$|R
50|$|The glide kip with stoop {{through is}} {{performed}} by executing a glide kip, but bringing the feet and straight legs between {{the bar and}} the arms to finish {{sitting on top of}} the bar. The gymnast typically will then use the propulsion of the kip to push off the low <b>bar</b> and <b>catch</b> the high <b>bar.</b> This skill may also be performed by straddling the legs over the bar rather than piking between the hands.|$|R
5000|$|The power cage serves several purposes. Chief {{among them}} is safety: for instance, in the bench press, placing the <b>bar</b> <b>catches</b> right above the lifter's chest will prevent the barbell from {{crushing}} the athlete {{in the case of}} muscular fatigue or other loss of control of the bar. In the case of squats, catches placed just below the lowest position of the squat allow the lifter to [...] "dump" [...] the weight safely.|$|R
5000|$|Joey {{traditionally}} performed his own act solo using a guitar, harmonica, whistling, and foot-stomping (which {{he often}} prefers to mic). His solo act was furious and edgy enough to <b>catch</b> a loud <b>bars</b> attention. But more often he is found {{playing in a}} full band known as Joey Only Outlaw Band. [...] The Outlaws have played about 400 shows in Western Canada while Joey Only has played an additional 500 shows solo and many more in other bands.|$|R
5000|$|A power rack (also {{known as}} a power cage, squat cage or squat rack) {{is a piece of}} weight {{training}} equipment that functions as a mechanical spotter for free weight barbell exercises without the movement restrictions imposed by equipment such as the Smith machine. Its general design is four upright posts with two adjustable horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>catches</b> (also called [...] "supports" [...] or [...] "pins") on each side. Many power racks also have accessory attachments, such as a chin-up bar, pulldown cable attachment, or pegs for storing weight plates.|$|R
50|$|From Portsmouth, {{the fleet}} headed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. En route, Tradewind and Our Svanen were called {{back by the}} British Department of Transport for further safety checks, and Amorina had to divert to Falmouth, Cornwall to put ashore an {{engineer}} who had developed renal colic. On 25 May, the lead ships anchored at Porto Santo {{to wait for the}} rest of the fleet to <b>catch</b> up. All <b>bar</b> Our Svanen had regrouped by 26 May, and the fleet carried on. The reenactment fleet arrived off Tenerife on 29 May, and was able to enter the port under full sail.|$|R
50|$|Simhadri {{chooses to}} the first option. As soon as Aravind <b>catches</b> the train <b>bar</b> handle, Simhadri shoots him in the back. Surprised at Simhadri's action; Indu jumps off the train to catch her falling father and she gets hit her head against a pole, causing her amnesia and become mentally challenged. After the {{flashback}} ends, people are seen and heard chanting Singamalai Singamalai outside the hospital. Bhai Saab and his men arrive at the hospital to finish off Simhadri. But Simhadri has gained consciousness {{with the help of}} his friends, police and family (now reunited), he takes down Bhai Saab and his army.|$|R
40|$|The {{main problem}} {{regarding}} the catching of a free-falling object by hand {{is to move}} the hand {{to the right place}} at right time. Furthermore, the projected force of impact between the hand and the object must be taken into account. To solve this problem with robots, a tracking strategy was chosen in which the tangential velocity of the robotic hand was matched to that of the flying object prior to closure of the grasp (Hong and Slotine, 1995). This strategy is advantageous, in that it 1) reduces the degrees-of-freedom, 2) increases the margin-of-error for the timing of hand closure and 3) reduces the relative momentum at impact. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the strategies employed by human subjects when performing a similar free-falling catching task. Six subjects were asked to <b>catch</b> a <b>bar</b> dropped by the experimenter (2 heights) or by himself (1 height), with each hand. Bar and hand kinematics were captured by means of an optical 3 D-system. We found that hand and bar velocities were not exactly matched in amplitude, but nevertheless were in the same direction at the moment of grasping. This suggests humans also adopt a tracking strategy, as opposed to a purely interception strategy, to catch a falling object with the hand...|$|R
6000|$|The cradle is a {{very simple}} machine, being a semicircular trough, {{hollowed}} out of a log, from five to six feet long by sixteen inches in diameter. At one end {{of this is a}} perforated copper or iron plate, with a rim of wood round it, on which the [...] "dirt" [...] is thrown, and water poured thereon by one man, while the cradle is rocked by another. The gold and gravel are thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two transverse bars, half-an-inch high, are placed; the first of these arrests the gold, which, from its great weight, sinks to the bottom, while the gravel and lighter substances are swept away by the current. The lower <b>bar</b> <b>catches</b> any particles of gold that, by awkward management, may have passed the upper one. Three men usually worked together at a rocker, one digging, one carrying the [...] "dirt" [...] in a bucket, and one rocking the cradle.|$|R
50|$|As new {{equipment}} was developed, it, too, came to distinguish powerlifting federations from one another. Weight belts and knee wraps (originally simple Ace bandages) predated powerlifting, but in 1983 John Inzer invented {{the first piece}} of equipment distinct to powerlifters—the bench shirt. Bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits (operating on the same principle) became ubiquitous in powerlifting, but only some federations adopted the latest and most supportive canvas, denim, and multiply polyester designs, while others (e.g., IPF) maintained more restrictive rules on which supportive equipment could be used. The Monolift, a rack in which the <b>bar</b> <b>catches</b> swing out, eliminating the walkout portion of the squat, was invented by Ray Madden and first used in competition in 1992. This innovation, too, was adopted by some federations and forbidden in others. Other inventions included specialized squat bars and deadlift bars, moving away from the IPF standard of using the same bar for all three lifts.|$|R
