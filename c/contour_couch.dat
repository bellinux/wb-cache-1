50|$|Additional {{hardware}} {{changes to}} Mercury 4 were a redesigned fairing for the spacecraft-Redstone adapter clamp-ring and additional foam padding {{added to the}} head area of the <b>contour</b> <b>couch.</b> The fairing changes and additional foam were used to reduce vibrations the pilot experienced during the boost phase of flight. The spacecraft instrument panel was rearranged to provide a better eye scan pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Robinson family, {{supposedly}} {{selected from}} two million volunteers for this mission, consisted of Professor John Robinson, played by Guy Williams, his wife, Maureen, played by June Lockhart, their children, Judy (Marta Kristen), Penny (Angela Cartwright), and Will (Billy Mumy). They {{are accompanied by}} their pilot, U.S. Space Corps Major Donald West (Mark Goddard), who is trained to fly the ship {{when the time comes}} for the eventual landing. Initially the Robinsons and Major West will be in freezing tubes for the voyage, with the tubes opening when the spacecraft approached its destination. Unless {{there is a problem with}} the ships navigation or guidance system during the voyage, Major West was only to take the controls during the final approach and landing on the destination planet, while the Robinsons were to strap themselves into <b>contour</b> <b>couches</b> on the lower deck for the landing.|$|R
40|$|Three {{chimpanzees}} trainees, "Duane", "Jim" and "Chu" {{strapped into}} their own space restraints. The chimps were among 75 being trained for space missions at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexicon on Jan. 13, 1961. Writing on the photo or group of photos: '"Space Trainees"- "Duane", "Jim", & "Chu"' Physical description: Black and white print (photograph) 24 x 19 mm. When {{the time came to}} test the space capsule?s life support systems and task performance ability in space, NASA needed a special animal couch to both house the chimpanzees and the device that would be used to test performance. The task of building the animal couch went to the McDonnell Aircraft Company. For the chimpanzee flights, the <b>contoured</b> <b>couch</b> was used for more then just animal restraint and safety. It was designed to test the same environmental control loop in the Mercury capsule that the human astronauts? pressure suits would use. The couch had the same hookup system to the control loop as the pressure suits and had a cover that could be sealed to simulate the pressure suit with the faceplate closed. The couch fit both the chimpanzee and the psychomotor panels inside, did not interfere with the Mercury spacecraft interior, and only require enough power from the spacecraft systems for its operation. These couches were designed around the animal that would be used and were fitted with restraints built into it as well as a water supply system and a urine collection system. Lead wires monitoring the animals vitals and psychological responses and leads that administered electrical shock to the soles of there feet when the correct lever was not pulled or banna pellets as a reward for the correct action. These wires feed information to psychomoter panels. This same couch design was used by both the ballistic and orbital flights with only a change in the psychomotor panel...|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiotherapy is the {{keystone}} in brain tumor treatment, including posterior fossa tumors, and can achieve better patient health-related quality of life. Radiation exposure can {{be associated with}} the risk of skin radiation injuries. Accurate tumor and critical structure delineations and precise dose planning may improve the outcomes and decrease radiation complications. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the influence of the headrest and treatment couch during dose planning, on the dose distributions and skin injury post irradiation. Material and Methods: Treatment planning calculations were performed for 14 brain tumor patients using the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to study the dose distribution and dose-volume histograms (DVH). We compared the following three cases of general patient contours: patient body contour alone, body contour including the headrest, and body <b>contour</b> with headrest, <b>couch</b> and immobilization mask. The same configuration beams were used in all these cases; general patient contours alone were altered. Results: For dose estimations, the skin was delineated as a 2 mm layer beneath the patient’s body contour. The comparisons showed that the average dose on the skin, among all the patients included in this study, in the case of body contour alone is 3. 3 Gy, whereas in the case of body contour with headrest, it is 6. 3 Gy and in the case of body <b>contour</b> with headrest, <b>couch</b> and immobilization mask it is 9. 4 Gy. Conclusion: For brain tumors, located in the posterior fossa and near the patient’s skin, the skin needed to be included as a critical structure. The skin dose should be considered when evaluating treatment plans, taking into account the bolus effect of the headrest and couch...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Purpose: Stereotactic {{radiation}} therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery deliver radiation precisely to tumors, using special equipment to position and demobilize patients. The VisionRT system, with its component AlignRT, is a non-invasive stereotactic positioning and tracking system that uses cameras to capture infra-red images of patients, and process these images, to obtain precise shifts in patient location. This thesis evaluates {{the accuracy of}} the AlignRT system accuracy while setting up and tracking patients. Methods: This thesis investigates the setup accuracy of the AlignRT system based on the CT contour of an anthropomorphic phantom exported to the AlignRT from treatment planning systems, and compared results to those provided by the X-ray image-based positioning system ExacTrac. Measurements utilize a modified Winston-Lutz technique to derive the deviation of the planned isocenter relative to the radiation isocenter. A phantom embedded with a 16 mm metallic sphere and a Winston-Luts pointer were used as the positioning objects. A Varian electronic portal imaging device were utilized to obtain images. A Vidar scanner and RIT 113 v 5. 2 software were used to process images obtained in Winston-Lutz tests. Based on the equations derived for Winston-Lutz tests, shifts of the planned isocenter relative to the radiation isocenter were calculated, which were then used to judge the positioning the objects. Both positioning and tracking modes of AlignRT were tested. AlignRT, ExacTrac, and Winston-Lutz test measurements were all performed on the same Varian Novalis Tx system. Results: The results indicated that the AlignRT gave a positioning error of more than 1 mm based on CT contours and at small couch angles, which was larger than the clinical tolerance of 1 mm for stereotactic {{radiation therapy}}. The positioning error would be less if the AlignRT system could be recalibrated with the same isocenter as the X-ray system or utilize its own initial image instead of CT <b>contour.</b> At larger <b>couch</b> angles, the positioning errors were larger than 1 mm even after recalibration. A further investigation and collaboration with the manufacture would be required to obtain desired accuracy...|$|R
