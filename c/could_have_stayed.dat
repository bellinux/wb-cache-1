500|$|Despite {{achieving}} distinction {{at a young}} age, Clinkscales soon {{fell out}} of the public view. He spent one year in Springfield Gardens High School in Queens and did not play basketball for the team due to poor grades. When considering his failure to develop his potential at an early stage, he reflected: [...] "All [...] would have come true if I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in New York and played high school basketball." [...] In the following year, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in Ocala, Florida. The decision to switch schools was made because he wanted to improve his academic performance, and one of his friends knew the new school's basketball coach, Allan Adams. At Ocala, Clinkscales lived with Stephen and Nancy Davidson, who both worked at the academy. Stephen was a pastor and the administrator of the school, and Nancy was an office staff member.|$|E
500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged. It was a great experience and so much fun and I wish I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> on the show for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by Kai Ebel, a German TV reporter, Lewis Hamilton stressed {{that it was}} important to him to [...] "strike back" [...] after his retirement in Singapore. Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: [...] "Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [...] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who have helped me get to where I am today and this team, because without them I would not be here." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just need to try to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment." [...] Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.|$|E
5000|$|The Sonata was performed... {{with such}} {{unattainable}} perfection, that I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> {{to listen to}} anything more, so I left the hall completely enraptured.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mean Clara's conduct; {{and dear}} grandmamma--oh! if she <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> with us! If you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen how haggard and grieved {{he came home}} from Cheveleigh! I do not think he has been quite the same ever since.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] he answered. [...] "I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in Paris {{and waited}} for news. Tell me exactly what has happened. Even now I do not understand. Is this man Hill dead?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} by Tim Hanson that {{appeared}} in the Spokesman Review article on August 26, 1984 Schuckardt is quoted as saying: [...] "If there is some way I can just let the people know we didn't run away. We were sent away. We were thrown out of our home. If there was anyway we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there, we would have. They must know that it was made impossible." [...] The article goes on to state that On June 7, 1984 Chicoine filed a lawsuit in Superior court asking that Schuckardt and 10 of his associates be prohibited from returning to the church property at Mount St. Michael's or Schuckardt's mansion at E2314 South Altamont Blvd. As a result of this lawsuit, a document was served at his mansion. The article states: [...] "Schuckardt said last week he thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued." [...] Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: [...] "There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on [...] "either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property." [...] Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.|$|E

6000|$|... "That," [...] responded his {{dragoman}} somewhat dramatically, {{extending his}} hand towards the old man, [...] "that is the rural population, and he a cockney hardened in the Great Skirmish, or he <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> the course." ...|$|R
50|$|In early 1989, the Soviet Phobos 2 {{spacecraft}} was {{injected into}} a quasi-satellite {{orbit around the}} Martian moon Phobos, with a mean orbital radius of about 100 km from Phobos. According to computations, it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> then <b>stayed</b> trapped {{in the vicinity of}} Phobos for many months. The spacecraft was lost due to a malfunction of the on-board control system.|$|R
5000|$|Clarke {{announced}} his retirement from AFL on 24 September 2009, citing his desire to return home and to play Gaelic football, which he said had prompted him to decline the offer of another three-year contract in Australia and that [...] "I <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>stayed.</b> But I {{think this is what}} I want to do more. I am more passionate about playing for Down than playing for Collingwood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I {{could not}} feel tired. I think--I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> alone here until--until--" [...] then her {{inability}} to express her thoughts confused her and she became silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm not hurt, aunty, {{and nothing}} broke," [...] he answered. [...] "Oh, it was immense! I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> up an hour if I had wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "All {{that seems}} over forever. I couldn't {{go back there}} and be what I was. I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there, but I couldn't go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Franklin, {{on being}} {{asked whether the}} United States had done right in going into the war, said [...] "Yes"; asked whether the country <b>could</b> with honour <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> out, he said [...] "No." [...] There is {{guidance}} here for thinking men of all ranks.|$|R
6000|$|He walked about furiously, {{stammering}} interrogations on {{the mode}} of her discovery, and, as she explained, storming at her for having brought this down on him by the folly of putting 'that thing into the Times.' Why <b>could</b> she not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> away, instead of meddling where she was not wanted? ...|$|R
60|$|When {{he got out}} of the elevator, he saw {{the other}} going along a passage in front, which he thought curious, because he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> more than a few moments in the bar. Moreover his limp was not {{noticeable}} now he imagined himself alone. Foster went on quietly, keeping his distance, and knitted his brows in thoughtful surprise when the other opened a door. The man, who did not seem to know Telford, had gone into his room.|$|R
60|$|Only a smooth, icy {{surface was}} there. I found nothing to clutch or stay my fall, {{and a moment}} later so great was my speed that nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> {{and died}} with him," [...] he broke out with {{unaffected}} bitterness. [...] "There were {{times at the}} beginning when I was sorry I let him send me away." ...|$|E
60|$|He saw her sudden embarrassment, and fancied {{that she}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there, {{if she had}} wished to do so, but {{he felt that he}} must speak frankly, and he shook his head severely.|$|E
5000|$|... "I saw her {{board the}} train heading east and I knew as we waved {{to each other}} {{that that was the}} last time I’d ever see her...I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> insisted she <b>stay</b> with me. But I didn't. That is one of two things I’ve always regretted." ...|$|R
60|$|Stead did not {{understand}} this, he thought only of looking under each steel cap or tall, slouching hat for Jephthah. Several times a youthful, slender figure raised his hopes, and disappointed him, {{and he began to}} wonder whether Jeph <b>could</b> <b>have</b> after all <b>stayed</b> behind in the town, or if he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been hurt and was ill there.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have known better than that, and seen I {{was a little more}} {{finished}} than I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been by <b>staying</b> where I was born. There was not much to do at home, and I was eating my head off, so I went away for three months." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with this}} abrupt leave-taking, the little fellow doffed his hat to me, and {{wheeling}} his horse he set spurs in its flanks, {{and was gone}} before a word of mine <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|Come away: for Life and Thought [...] Here {{no longer}} dwell; [...] But {{in a city}} glorious-- [...] A great and distant city--have bought [...] A mansion incorruptible. [...] Would they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> with us! ...|$|E

50|$|OG was loaned out to Kardemir Karabükspor on 26 August 2015. It {{was later}} {{revealed}} by the player himself, that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen to <b>stay</b> at Bursaspor, but he didn't {{want to take that}} risk. OG played 24 games and scored four goals, before leaving the club {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
6000|$|... he had {{gathered}} roughly, as it were, that Simeon {{had not been}} comfortable. He had pitied him. But now, sitting in his office-chair, he began to wonder what the man had made such a fuss about. He suspected him of having had {{a touch of the}} white feather in him. It was not as if he had not had food. He talked about 'hungers and thirsts', but he must have had something to eat, or he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> the course. Very likely, if the truth were known, there was somebody below who passed him up regular supplies of cake and cocoa.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, Alice and Adam see {{one another}} again {{on either side}} of an {{escalator}} - she's going down and he's riding up. They both watch each other as they pass without saying anything. Adam stops at the top and turns to stare back at Alice before walking away. The film ends with Alice's voiceover recalling the events in posterity and wondering what might have happened had fate not led her to Adam one morning. She wonders if the passion between them <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> lasted, and if a [...] "flatlander" [...] like her <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> at such a high altitude [...] At least that's what she tells herself anyway.|$|R
60|$|Our coming {{was in a}} way well timed. I {{doubt if}} we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> the {{execution}} of Saint-Eustache's warrant even had we arrived earlier. But for effect--to produce a striking coup de theatre--we could not have come more opportunely.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite was so happy, she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> {{here for}} ever, hearing his voice, asking a hundred questions. But at mention of Chauvelin's name she started in quick alarm, afraid for the dear life {{she would have}} died to save.|$|E
60|$|If {{we had not}} had a few moors and heaths {{where he}} could breathe, I don't know whether he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in England; and as for London, the din, the dinginess, the squalor of houses and people, sat like a weight on his heart.|$|E
50|$|Many {{men from}} British Columbia served in World War I {{which began in}} 1914. Steamboat men were no exception, even Armstrong {{although}} he <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> home because of his age. Instead, Armstrong supervised British river transport in the Middle East, on the Nile and Tigris rivers. The Tigris in particular was in a difficult and hard-fought theater of war. Armstrong {{was not the only}} one of the small community of steamboat men of Golden to serve. Armstrong's apprentice, John Blakely (1889-1963), the son of his former competitor, enlisted and went to Europe, where he became one of only six survivors when his ship was torpedoed in the English Channel.|$|R
25|$|Historian Winfried Ludecke {{suggests}} that, upon leaving Port Arthur, Reilly voyaged to Imperial Japan in {{the company}} of an unknown mistress. If he did visit Japan, presumably to be paid for his espionage, he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> very long, for by June 1904 he appeared in Paris, France. During the brief time Reilly spent in Paris, he renewed his close acquaintance with William Melville, sometimes incorrectly described as the first director general of MI5, whom Reilly had last seen just prior to his 1899 departure from London. Reilly's meeting with Melville is most significant, for within a matter of weeks Melville was to use Reilly's expertise in what would later become known as the D'Arcy Affair.|$|R
25|$|The {{location}} of Muammar Gaddafi was unclear on 22 August; {{it was thought}} that he <b>could</b> still <b>have</b> been <b>staying</b> in Tripoli, surrounded by remaining forces in his Bab al-Azizia compound, but this was yet to be determined. Another report had him in the Tajura cardiac hospital. Al Jazeera reported that Muammar Gaddafi allegedly had successfully resisted an attempt to arrest him at the hospital.|$|R
