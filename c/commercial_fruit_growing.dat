Subsistence farming was essentially {{the only kind}} of farming in this mostly poor neighbourhood but, as elsewhere in Maple Ridge, a few residents developed small-scale <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> and poultry farming.

50|$|The St Ives {{area was}} first {{explored}} by Governor Arthur Phillip and {{a party of}} men in 1788 where {{they set up a}} campsite at Bungaroo which is close to what is now Hunter Avenue. The area produced a small scale timber felling industry. There are still some examples of the thirty metre and higher trees in nearby Pymble in the Dalrymple Hay forest and near Canisius College. Native turpentine trees were also once abundant and provided useful timber for cabinet making. It was once known for its apple orchards but due to residential demand, {{there is no longer any}} <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> in the area. During World War II there were significant numbers of troops barracked in the area, which provided the impetus to build Archbold Road as a supplementary and emergency route to the city. Since 1950 the suburb has expanded from the central shopping areas and the arterial main roads to include hilltop and valley areas bordering on the surrounding Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park to the north, now the area known as St Ives Chase, and Garigal National Park to the east and the south east.|$|E
40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting the financial outcome of <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> is the success of pollination and fertilization, which in turn are dependent on weather conditions, activity of pollinators and compatibility and flowering overlap of the pollinizers. Before introducing pollinizer accessions, it is obviously important to know the compatibility and flowering characteristics of the genotypes as well as tree characteristics like vigour, tree habit and pest and disease susceptibility. In order to find out these attributes, 25 accessions belonging to eight Pyrus species have been evaluated. Further, eight promising genotypes were tested in more detail for pollen production and germination, pollen compatibility with Pyrus communis cultivar 'Conference' and flowering phenology. As a result, four recommendable ornamental Pyrus accessions, both early and late flowering were found. To ensure maximal overlap of the flowering period of the main cultivar every year, a mix of 2 or 3 different pollinizers will be advised for commercial orchard...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of study are determination vitamin C content in three <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juices (apple, guava and mango) using titration method. Beside that, comparing vitamin C content determined {{and to that}} stated on the label for each fruit juice sample. To relate the amount of vitamin C present {{at the time of}} consumption based on the expired date. Sample to determine vitamin C is apple juice, mango juice and guava juice in <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice on different expiry date. From different expiry date can get different shelf life before expired days. Method to determine vitamin C in <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice is titration method with iodine solution. Titration method is accurate and precision method compare another methods. From the result the higher amount of vitamin C was guava juice about 183 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 20. 25 g/ 100 mL for <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice. Following mango juice was about 28 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 16. 40 for <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice. The lower amount of vitamin C was apple juice about 6 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 5. 33 g/ 100 mL for <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice. However mango juice and guava juice were suitable to drinking compared apple juices because apple juice has lower vitamin C contained and the higher loss of vitamin C content. According from analysis, the longer shelf life before expiry, the higher amount of vitamin C in fruit juice. However, apple juice was lower amount of vitamin C because the range of vitamin C content was shorter compared mango juice and guava juice in <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> juice...|$|R

In The Netherlands, `Xenia¿ has been tested since 2001. So far, trees have given early and high yields and required little thinning. Up to now, a very low to moderate susceptibility to scab (Venturia pirinia) and a very low susceptibility to fruit tree canker (Nectria galligena) have been observed. The trees showed a medium vigour {{and there was a}} low tendency to biennial bearing. With the relatively young trees, the average fruit size of `Xenia¿ fruits at full crop was 250 - 300 g. The harvest window was wide. Fruits of `Xenia¿ had a green ground colour at harvest and were moderately bronzed. `Xenia¿ had a spherical pear shape. The fruits had a strong fruit skin. The firmness was higher than that of `Conference¿. The juiciness varied from juicy to very juicy, depending on the maturity stage. `Xenia¿ had a good eating quality: fresh, slightly aromatic with a typical aroma. The storability of the fruits was very good and the shelf life of `Xenia¿ proved to be much better than of `Conference¿.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting the financial outcome of <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> is the success of pollination and fertilization, which in turn are dependent on weather conditions, activity of pollinators and the compatibility and overlap in flowering of the cultivars. Before introducing new cultivars, it is obviously important to know the compatibility and flowering characteristics of the genotypes. In order to find out these attributes of seven new and four established plum cultivars, pollen germination tests, hand pollinations and flowering phenology observations were carried out. ‘Prosser 84 ’ had 70 % pollen germination. ‘Opal’ had just 3 %, probably due to aged pollen. ‘Anna Späth’ flowered over a short period (13 days) and ‘ 1468 ’ and ‘DCA BO 46 ’ over long (19 days) periods; the overlap of all cultivars was relatively good. With ‘ 1468 ’, ‘Victory’, ‘Anna Späth’ and ‘Prosser 84 ’ flowering intensity varied between years, ‘Jubileum’, ‘V 70032 ’, ‘Tita’ and ‘DCA BO 46 ’ flowered regularly, the others were intermediate. ‘ 1468 ’ and ‘WJ 65 ’ flowered early, ‘Prosser 84 ’ and ‘DCA BO 46 ’ late and the rest fell in between. ‘Victoria’ proved to be self-fertile, ‘Jubileum’, ‘V 70032 ’ and ‘ 1468 ’ semi self-fertile. Fruit set percentages after June drop of all crosses were rather low; varying between 0 and 28 %. With ‘Tita’, fruit drop occurred approximately two weeks later than with the other cultivar...|$|E

Introduction: The act of Congress, which gave land to each {{state for the}} endowment, support and maintenance of a school where the leading object should be to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, virtually established an agricultural college in each state. Horticulture {{is one of the}} branches which goes largely to make up agriculture, and it should be the object of such colleges to provide instruction such that those students who wish to become proficient as horticulturists should be given an opportunity to do so. I know of no such place at the present time where a person can go and learn <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing,</b> so that he will be competent to take charge of a place, either for himself or some one else without the costly experience all successful fruit growers have had to pass through. Such information, when gotten only by experience, paid for by himself, is costly, for it often takes years of cultivation and patience as well as money before one can find out that a certain variety is of no value as a money maker. In most of the Agricultural colleges, the present equipment seems to be inadequate for such teaching. But if a thorough course of practical scientific work could be provided, after its completion one would be ready to go into the practical vocation of growing fruit. If the farmer of this state were taught how to grow their own fruit, many thousands of dollars annually, which now go to California or other fruit growing states would be saved, besides getting a better article making home more attractive and improving things in general...|$|E

40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar a reutiliza??o de quatro substratos e a produ??o de cinco cultivares de tomateiros sob cultivo protegido no Munic?pio de Iranduba-AM. A pesquisa foi conduzida em casa de vegeta??o tipo capela de 338 m 2, os substratos reutilizados foram: solo + fibra de c?co 2 : 1 (S 1), solo + esterco de gado 2 : 1 (S 2), solo + carv?o mo?do 2 : 1 (S 3) e solo (S 4), as cultivares utilizadas foram: Setcopa, Olympo, Fasc?nio, Duradoro e D?bora Plus. As plantas foram transplantadas aos 21 dias ap?s o semeio e posteriormente tutoradas e conduzidas atrav?s de fitilhos em haste ?nica at? altura de 2, 0 metros. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados em parcelas subdivididas avaliando quatro substratos, cinco cultivares de tomate em quatro repeti??es. As vari?veis estudadas foram ?s caracter?sticas qu?micas e f?sicas dos substratos e a produ??o dos tomateiros. Na an?lise qu?mica comparando-se os resultados dos substratos no in?cio do segundo plantio ao final do cultivo houve altera??es dos valores dos macros e micronutrientes relacionado ao pH, CE, P, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, S, Na, Fe, Zn, e Cu. J? na densidade (DS), porosidade total (PT), macroporosidade (MAC) e microporosidade (MIC) do material coletado no in?cio e final do experimento, verificou-se que o S 4 e S 2 apresentaram valores superiores de DS e MAC e o S 3 e S 1 valores superiores de PT e MIC, j? no in?cio do cultivo a DS foi maior e no final a PT menor. Na an?lise foliar com rela??o aos substratos para o teor de P, foi verificado maior m?dia no substrato S 3, j? com rela??o aos substratos e cultivares os teores de Nitrog?nio (N) foi significativo apenas para a cultivar D?bora Plus. A altura das plantas aos 36 DAT n?o se diferem para os cultivares e substratos, aos 120 DAT houve destaque para os cultivares D?bora Plus no S 1 e S 2, Setcopa no S 3. Nos substratos aos 36 DAT os mesmos n?o apresentaram diferen?as significativas, j? a partir de 50 DAT at? o final do experimento os substratos diferiram. O peso de fruto total n?o houve diferen?a significativa, o peso de frutos comerciais apresentou diferen?a significativa para a cultivar Fasc?nio (6, 91 kg planta- 1), o peso m?dio de fruto comercial para a cultivar Olympo (0, 51 kg planta- 1) seguido do Duradoro (0, 45 kg planta- 1). No n?mero de frutos total (NFT) houve diferen?a para a cultivar Fasc?nio com maior n?mero de frutos produzidos, cachos por planta (NCP) e frutos comerciais (NFC), nos substratos (NFT) n?o apresentou diferen?a estat?stica, j? a caracter?stica (NCP) foi significativa para o esterco de gado (S 1) com maior n?mero de cachos por planta e maior n?mero de frutos comerciais. Na avalia??o do di?metro do fruto onde os cultivares Duradoro e Olympo foram os que apresentaram os maiores frutos, j? o Fasc?nio foi que apresentou os menores di?metros, no entanto o Fasc?nio foi o que apresentou maior n?mero de frutos por planta e o Olympo o menor n?mero de frutos. Conclui-se que as cultivares Fasc?nio e Duradoro apresentaram melhores produ??es de frutos no substrato a base de solo + esterco de gado, sendo a cultivar Fasc?nio com produ??o de (172, 7 t/ha- 1), seguida da cultivar Duradoro com (166, 5 t/ha- 1). Portanto, recomenda-se a reutiliza??o do substrato a base de esterco de gado + solo em cultivo de tomateiro sob ambiente protegido no munic?pio de Iranduba. The {{objective of}} this research was to evaluate the reuse of four substrates and the production of five cultivars of tomato under protected the city of Iranduba-AM cultivation. The research was conducted in a greenhouse of 338 m 2 chapel type, the substrates were reused: soil + Coir 2 : 1 (S 1), soil + cattle manure 2 : 1 (S 2), soil + charcoal ground 2 : 1 (S 3) and soil (S 4), the cultivars used were: Setcopa, Olympian, Fascination, and Deborah Duradoro Plus. The plants were transplanted 21 days after seeding and were conducted in plastic strands at height of 2. 0 meters. The experimental design was a randomized block split plot evaluating four substrates five tomato cultivars in four repetitions. The variables studied were the chemical and physical characteristics of the substrate and the production of tomatoes. In the chemical analysis comparing the results of the substrates {{at the beginning of the}} second planting at the end of cultivation there were changes in the values of macro and micronutrients related to pH, EC, P, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, S, In, Zn, and Cu. Already density (DS), total porosity (TP), macroporosity (MAC) and microporosity (MIC) of the material collected at the beginning and end of the experiment, it was found that the S 4 and S 2 showed higher values of DS and MAC and S 3 and higher values of PT S 1 and MIC since the beginning of culture and the DS was higher in the lower end of the PT. Foliar analysis with respect to the substrates for P content, the highest average was found in the substrate S 3, since with respect to the substrates and cultivars the levels of Nitrogen (N) was significant only for the cultivar D?bora Plus. Plant height at 36 DAT did not differ among the cultivars and substrates, at 120 DAT was especially cultivars D?bora Plus in S 1 and S 2, S 3 Setcopa. The substrates at 36 DAT they showed no significant differences, as from 50 DAT until the end of the experiment the substrates differed. The total fruit weight no significant difference, the weight of marketable fruits showed a significant difference in cultivar Fascination (6. 91 kg plant- 1), the average weight of <b>commercial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> for Olympian (0. 51 kg plant- 1) followed by Duradoro (0. 45 kg plant- 1). In the number of fruits (NFT) were no differences in cultivar Fascination with the highest number of fruits produced, clusters per plant (NCP) and commercial fruit (NFC), the substrates (NFT) showed no statistical difference, since the characteristic (NCP) was significant for the cattle manure (S 1) with larger number of clusters per plant and greater numbers of unmarketable fruits. In the diameter of the fruit where Duradoro, Olympian and cultivars were those with the largest fruit, as was the fascination that showed the smallest diameters, however the Fascination showed the highest number of fruits per plant and the fewest Olympian fruit. We conclude that the fascination and Duradoro cultivars showed higher fruit yields in the base substrate soil + cattle manure, and cultivate Fascination with production (172. 7 t/ha- 1), then the cultivar with Duradoro (166. 5 t/ha- 1). Therefore, the reuse of the substrate is recommended based on cattle manure + soil in tomato under protected cultivation in the municipality of Iranduba...|$|E
