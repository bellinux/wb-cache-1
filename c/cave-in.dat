5|$|By late December 1899, mining had {{compromised}} Joppenbergh's integrity {{enough to}} cause a series of landslides, followed by a large <b>cave-in</b> on December19. Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8AM, and culminating in the 11:30AM collapse of the Black Smoke Mine shaft network. Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, eating lunch.|$|E
5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to <b>cave-in</b> upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a <b>cave-in</b> during the final scenes of the game.|$|E
50|$|Some mine shafts are {{blocked by}} <b>cave-ins,</b> which require {{dynamite}} to clear, but Roderick must not stand too close when the dynamite explodes. The helmet laser can also destroy <b>cave-ins,</b> {{but it does}} so much more slowly than dynamite. In later levels, the player must contend with magma, which, like <b>cave-ins,</b> can be dynamited to clear a path, but like the mine creatures, is lethal when touched. Later levels also feature solid walls of magma, with openings that alternate between open and closed. Skillful navigation is required to fly through the opening without touching the magma.|$|R

5|$|Later, Kate {{appears as}} part of Batman and Robin: Blackest Knight. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She is sealed within a coffin and taken {{underground}} to the last remaining Lazarus Pit {{in order for the}} ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes Knight and Squire. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into the pit in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her. True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by Darkseid) emerges from the Pit and attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding the Pit, causing a massive <b>cave-in.</b> Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her. Kate is healed after being placed inside the Pit, and she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has a thing for red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, Barbara Gordon and Starfire), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi's {{background}} is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides {{the gap between}} Part I and II of the manga. Following his father's suicide, Sakumo Hatake aka the White Fang, Kakashi adopted the philosophy {{that the success of}} a mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced <b>cave-in</b> crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.|$|E

50|$|Since mining entails {{removing}} {{dirt and}} rock from its natural location, thereby creating large empty pits, rooms, and tunnels, <b>cave-ins</b> {{as well as}} ground and rock falls are a major concern within mines. Modern techniques for timbering and bracing walls and ceilings within sub-surface mines have {{reduced the number of}} fatalities due to <b>cave-ins,</b> but ground falls continue to represent up to 50% of mining fatalities. Even in cases where mine collapses are not instantly fatal, they can trap mine workers deep underground. Cases such as these often lead to high-profile rescue efforts, such as when 33 Chilean miners were trapped deep underground for 69 days in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1959, Vetern's Memorial Stadium, the Pottsville High School's Stadium, faced {{numerous}} <b>cave-ins</b> as {{a result}} of being located {{on the site of the}} old York Farm Colliery whose mining operations covered the area. [...] A sink-hole developed underneath the Press Box that was 18 feet in depth and eight feet in diameter. It was thought to compromise the integrity of the symbolic press box as well as the structure of the home side bleachers. [...] Similar <b>cave-ins</b> occurred in 1937 when the east end of the stadium was deemed unstable and suffered collapses and required numerous tons of fill to render the field safe for athletic competition.|$|R
25|$|On March 22, 2013, one miner {{died and}} another was injured after they became {{trapped in a}} <b>cave-in</b> at {{a part of the}} Castle Valley Mining Complex, about 10 miles west of the small mining town of Huntington in Emery County.|$|E

25|$|It was at {{this time}} that the only lives were lost on the project. A <b>cave-in,</b> caused by a high ground water level, {{resulted}} in the loss of four lives. The rescue operation was able to save eight other workers who were trapped with those that perished.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, due to fear of <b>cave-ins</b> of the miles of tunnels under Lead’s Homestake Mine, {{many of the}} town’s {{buildings}} located {{in the bottom of}} a canyon were moved further uphill to safer locations.|$|R
50|$|Entrapment {{rescue teams}} are {{typically}} associated with fire departments. They may be combined with fire search-and-rescue, or operate independently for non-fire rescues, such as from motor vehicle accidents, construction accidents, and natural disasters (<b>cave-ins,</b> house collapse, and the like).|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} shafts may {{be covered}} to minimize blown-in sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or <b>cave-ins,</b> cleaned {{of sand and}} mud and otherwise repaired. For safety, air flow must be assured before entry.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, {{portions}} of the tunnel have collapsed, once claiming several houses. The line of the underground tunnel can clearly be traced by dips {{in some of the}} north-south streets crossing its path. The largest <b>cave-in</b> to date resulted in creation of a park on Broad Street between 24th and 25th where a church once stood.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Gandalf {{opened the}} doors, the Watcher in the Water {{attacked}} the Fellowship {{as they entered}} the Mines, ripping down the holly trees that flanked the doors and barricading the gate; the Watcher also shut the doors leaving the Fellowship trapped in Moria. In the film, the Watcher caused a <b>cave-in</b> instead, apparently destroying the gate.|$|E
25|$|The Nicoll Highway {{collapse}} was {{a construction}} accident that occurred at approximately 3.30pm on 20 April 2004 in Singapore when a tunnel being constructed {{for use by}} Mass Rapid Transit trains collapsed. The tunnel {{was part of the}} construction of the underground Circle Line, near the Nicoll Highway. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a 30-metre (100ft) deep <b>cave-in</b> that spread across six lanes of Nicoll Highway. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident has delayed the construction end date for the MRT station.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the stream}} connects with the nearby Arch Spring Cave, but {{underwater}} blockages and <b>cave-ins</b> prevent a complete trip through. The total {{length of the}} cave system, from {{the entrance to the}} exit at Arch Spring, is about 4200 ft.|$|R

25|$|The {{affected}} {{area has}} a low population density and has an abundance of homes that are constructed with local clay material by unskilled workers. The unreinforced stone masonry or adobe homes are sometimes overloaded single story structures with flat wooden roofs with steel beams. Most {{of these types of}} homes suffered partial collapse, and led to a number of roof collapses. Fifty homes were destroyed, three-hundred were damaged, including a roof <b>cave-in</b> that left two women dead. Overall, seven villages sustained damage and twelve were destroyed. Four people died, forty were injured, and 800 were left homeless, but no major infrastructure (dams, bridges, or power stations) were impacted.|$|E
25|$|Coal mining {{remained}} the prominent industry in Pittston for many decades, but disasters did strike {{on more than}} one occasion. The first major tragedy occurred in the Newton Coal Company's Twin Shaft Mine (near the city's railroad junction). In {{the early morning hours of}} June 28, 1896, ninety miners were at work in the Red Ash Vein of the Newton Coal Company's Twin Shaft Mine in Pittston. At 3:00 a.m., the roof quickly caved-in. The concussion from the explosion was so great that it was heard for miles around. The foundation of nearly every building in Pittston was shaken. The <b>cave-in</b> killed 58 miners (including the city's then-acting mayor, Michael J. Langan).|$|E
25|$|Jen and Kira {{discover}} a ruined Gelfling city with ancient writing describing a prophecy: the shard Jen carries must be reinserted into the Dark Crystal to restore its integrity. They are {{interrupted by the}} Chamberlain, who claims that the Skeksis want to make peace and wants the Gelflings {{to return to the}} castle with him, but they mistrust him and refuse. Riding on Landstriders, the Gelflings arrive at the Skeksis' castle and intercept the Garthim that attacked Kira's village. While trying to free the captured Podlings, Kira, Jen, and Fizzgig descend {{to the bottom of the}} castle's dry moat and use a lower-level entrance to gain access. They are followed by the Chamberlain, who repeats his peace offer; when the Gelflings refuse again, he buries Jen in a <b>cave-in</b> and takes Kira to the castle. The General reinstates him to his former position, and the Skeksis' Scientist tries to drain Kira's life essence for the General to drink so that he can regain his youth. Aughra, imprisoned in the Scientist's laboratory, tells Kira to call for help from the animals held captive; they break free in response, releasing Kira and causing the Scientist to fall to his death. His Mystic counterpart simultaneously vanishes. Aughra later escapes, saving Fizzgig in the process.|$|E

50|$|Recovery {{efforts were}} both {{delicate}} and dangerous, as the mine {{was filled with}} mud and debris and workers worried about potential <b>cave-ins.</b> It took months to recover the men's bodies. The last body was removed on November 9th. The mine resumed operations soon after that.|$|R
25|$|Female Galápagos green turtles {{most often}} only lay eggs every 2–3 years {{and spend the}} time between resting and foraging. Fertilization occurs under water with only females {{emerging}} for nesting. Mating has not been witnessed outside of the nesting season and usually occurs off shore near the nesting sites. Nesting space can be somewhat limited due to {{the consistency of the}} beaches in the Galápagos, being of volcanic origin. Many rocky areas and cliffs are present, with limited space on sandy beaches. Also, the sandy areas tend to be quite dry, and this causes many cave-ins of the nests. Females in the Galápagos have modified their nesting habits due to this factor and usually keep one hind flipper in the nest while depositing the eggs to prevent the unwanted <b>cave-in.</b> Clutch size varies from 50 to 200 eggs per nest and can take up to three hours to accomplish. However, Galápagos green turtles are known to have smaller clutch sizes than other populations. After the eggs are laid, the female covers them with sand and presses down with her plastron for compaction. They have also been noted to make a false nest next to their primary nest to try to fool predators. When leaving, the female turtle attempts to cover any trace of her presence by flinging sand around in the nest area.|$|E
