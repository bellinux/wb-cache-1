They also have the potential to bioaccumulate providing the major limiting factor for safe disposal or beneficiation of the coal combustion ash products. The various forms and oxidation states of the trace elements may determine the ultimate environmental fate and health impacts. For example, in case of chromium, the trivalent Cr(III) is an essential nutrient while Cr(VI) is strongly carcinogenic. Moreover, Cr(VI) originates mostly from anthropogenic industrial sources and is classified as a Group A inhalation carcinogen by the US environmental protection agency (EPA), and is also classified as one of the 'priority pollutants' in the national pollutant inventory (NPI) in Australia. Knowledge of the chromium species in coals and ash by-products becomes important for conducting comprehensive risk assessment of their emissions from coal-based power plants. This study focuses on chromium speciation analysis of coals and ash by-products. US EPA methods 3060 A and 7199 were used for Cr(VI) determination in samples.

The biosorption process followed pseudo first order kinetic model, implying that the initial rate of biosorption is totally independent of the initial concentration. The biosorption of Cr(VI) is well described by Langmuir isotherm, which express the existence of monolayer adsorption under the experimental conditions.

40|$|Low-temperature {{pyrolysis}} is evaluated as {{a possible}} technique for the disposal of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood waste. Theoretical and experimental studies are performed {{in order to gain}} more insight in the mechanism of arsenic release. In this paper, the most important observations and results of modelling are brought together in order to present the current state of knowledge. Lab-scale pyrolysis experiments show that pyrolysis at 300 °C for 20 min gives rise to inconclusive release for the three metals. However, arsenic releases are substantial for all experiments using a temperature of 320 °C. A speciation study shows the presence of trivalent arsenic in the pyrolysis residue, indicating that arsenic, present in pentavalent state in the CCA solution and in the CCA treated wood, is partly reduced to the trivalent state during pyrolysis. Arsenic release can be modelled by a simple first order single-reaction kinetic scheme for the temperature range from 350 to 450 °C. Based on the order of magnitude of the kinetic constants, the reaction is identified as a reduction reaction. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of hydrated chromium arsenate (the major arsenic compound in CCA treated wood) reveals that thermal decomposition probably results in the formation of solid Cr 2 O 3 and gaseous H 2 O, O 2 and As 4 O 6, indicating again that As(V) is reduced to As(III) and arsenic is released in <b>trivalent</b> <b>form.</b> TG studies of the pure arsenic oxides (As 2 O 5 and As 2 O 3) show that at temperatures lower than 500 °C the reduction reaction As 2 O 5 →As 2 O 3 +O 2 does not take place. At higher temperatures decomposition is observed. As 2 O 3, however, is already released at temperatures as low as 200 °C. This release is driven by temperature dependent vapour pressures. It can be concluded that the wood, char and pyrolysis vapours form a reducing environment, thereby influencing the thermal behaviour of the arsenic oxides. An other explanation for the difference in thermal behaviour could be that part of the arsenic in the CCA treated wood is already present in the <b>trivalent</b> <b>form.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Desferrioxamine is a trihydroxamic acid isolated from a strain of streptomyces (Bickel, von Gaumann, Keller-Schierlein, Prelog, Vischer, Wettstein, and Zahner, 1960), which belongs to the naturally occurring sideramines. It has highly specific chelating activity for <b>trivalent</b> iron, <b>forming</b> the ferric chelate, a red-brown compound, known as ferrioxamine...|$|R
