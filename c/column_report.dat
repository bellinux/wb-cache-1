5000|$|The first World War {{ended in}} November 1918. A Westminster {{election}} {{was called for}} December 1918.To attract the Unionist working class vote, trades union candidates were put forward under the UULA banner in three Belfast constituencies for the 1918 Westminster election. One of these was Thompson Donald standing in the Victoria Ward in East Belfast. He was a suitable candidate in that he was remembered {{as one of the}} organisers of the 1914 meeting against Home Rule, he had been a well known trade unionist, {{he was a member of}} the Orange Order and he was a Mason.The NW of Wednesday 27 November 1918 featured in its Editorial the selection of Sir Edward Carson as the Parliamentary candidate for Duncairn in the forthcoming election. There were 1½ columns recounting his career and his seven years of leadership of the Ulster cause.The NW of Saturday 30 November 1918 reported on electioneering in the Victoria Ward and Mr Thompson Donald’s Candidature and the Meeting of Support held in the Sailor’s Institute, Dock St. ‘Mr Donald, who was enthusiastically received…..said he had the support of Sir Edward Carson. He had been a teetotaller all his life and was in favour of prohibition…..There was a need for better schools…..He was out to get 10,000 comfortable workers’ houses built in Belfast’. The NW of Monday 2 December 1918 gave notice of ‘A Public Meeting of the Electors in support of Mr Thompson Donald to be held in the Old Town Hall on Friday at 8 o’clock. The Rt Hon Sir Edward Carson will be in attendance. The Candidate will address the Meeting.’ On 7 December the NW carried a 3½ <b>column</b> <b>report</b> largely relating to the speech Sir Edward Carson made in support of Mr Thompson Donald as a true Unionist candidate in the forthcoming election. ‘A number of questions were then put to the candidate by members of the audience, and were answered satisfactorily, the vote of confidence being passed unanimously’.The NW of Saturday 14 December 1918 had a large advertisement addressed to the ‘Loyal Unionists of Belfast. Keep the Old Flag Flying. The (seven) Constitutionally Selected Candidates are…Carson - Duncairn…..Donald - Victoria…..Whitla - Belfast University. Vote for us and no other. No Surrender! Edward Carson’.Monday 16 December 1918 was polling day. In Victoria Ward Donald had polled 9309 votes and won comfortably againstthe Labour candidate who had 3469 votes. [...] Thompson Donald thus became Thompson Donald MP and would remain so until the next election in 1922. All three UULA candidates had won and were duly admitted as Members of Parliament to the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.At Westminster the three were submerged in the Ulster Unionist Party. They were entertained by the Duke of Abercorn and the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava and the experience allegedly went to their heads. They were unable to live in London on their annual salaries of £400 and had to be assisted by the UUC. [...] As backbenchers their only role was to ask questions in the House. (It was agreed that Thompson Donald was the most active, but the presence of all three at Westminster dropped off after 1921 when they were elected to the first Northern Ireland Parliament).However the BN on Monday 6 October 1919 reported [...] on a Labour Unionist meeting held in Belfast. In the absence of Carson Mr Ronald McNeill gave the major speech and paid a high tribute to the three UULA MPs in assisting the Ulster party in questions affecting labour. Mr Thompson Donald MP said that Sinn Feiners were ousting people out of their jobs and Government should see that the demobilised soldiers got work.After the 1916 rising in Dublin and the continuing northern resistance to Home Rule the British government realised that there was not going to be a simple solution to the ongoing political problems in Ireland. In October 1919 a Cabinet committee was set up to review the Irish ‘problem’ and in February 1920 the Government of Ireland Bill was introduced at Westminster. It proposed two Home Rule parliaments in Ireland, one for most of the country, based in Dublin, and the other for the north, based in Belfast, with both to have strictly limited powers and continuing representation at Westminster. The Ulster Unionists were now faced with having their own Parliament, which they had never sought. However, they realised that it would strengthen their position. There was then debate about the size of the North - would it include the nine counties of Ulster, a more compact six counties or the four mainly Protestant counties of Down, Londonderry, Tyrone and Antrim? The Unionists quailed at the thought of trying to govern the 80% Catholic nationalist counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. A four county area was not economically viable so the six counties - Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone - became Northern Ireland. On 22 July 1920 in the House of Commons Joe Devlin, the MP for West Belfast, asked questions of the Chief Secretary for Ireland regarding recent disturbances in Harland & Wolff when all the Catholic workers had been expelled. Thompson Donald stated ‘this is not a question of Catholic and Protestant at all, but of Unionists and Sinn Feiners…….these Protestants and Unionists were justified, in view of the fact that the Sinn Feiners were armed with revolvers, and immediately they produced revolvers the Unionists knocked them down’. The Chief Secretary ended the debate, having answered none of Joe Devlin’s questions, by saying [...] "everything has been done before the 12th July, on the 12th, since the 12th, and now to preserve order in one of the most difficult areas in His Majesty’s Dominions".|$|E

The fourth <b>column</b> <b>reports</b> results from a specification excluding observations in the highest income and age categories. These three specifications deliver results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained by analyzing the entire sample—i.e. signs remain identical and magnitudes of the coefficients are similar when excluding the richest, the oldest or both. Thus, we conclude that results are not driven by inclusion or exclusion of age and income categories.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the theory, design, fabrication {{and testing of}} the microvalves and columns necessary in a pressure- and temperature-programmed micro gas chromatograph ({micro}GC). Two microcolumn designs are investigated: a bonded Si-glass column having a rectangular cross section and a vapor-deposited silicon oxynitride (Sion) column having a roughly circular cross section. Both microcolumns contain integrated heaters and sensors for rapid, controlled heating. The 3. 2 cm x 3. 2 cm, 3 m-long silicon-glass column, coated with a non-polar polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stationary phase, separates 30 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in less than 6 min. This is the most efficient micromachined <b>column</b> <b>reported</b> to date, producing greater than 4000 plates/m. The 2. 7 mm x 1. 4 mm Sion column eliminates the glass sealing plate and silicon substrate using deposited dielectrics and is the lowest power and fastest GC <b>column</b> <b>reported</b> to date; it requires only 11 mW to raise the column temperature by 100 C and has a response time of 11 s and natural temperature ramp rate of 580 C/min.
