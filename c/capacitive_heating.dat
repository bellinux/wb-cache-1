40|$|External <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> is {{the usual}} method of {{electromagnetic}} wave heating, in which the tumor is caught and heated between two opposite applicators. Using a phantom, the authors developed and evaluated {{the performance of a}} new <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> applicator designed for simultaneous radiohyperthermotherapy (SRH) in which the electron beam irradiation is provided from above an external <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> applicator for the treatment of superficial and shallow-seated tumors. The trial applicator was constructed to fulfill the following conditions: 1. use of an electrode plate which does not affect the electron beam depth dose, 2. a uniform thickness to maintain flatness of the electron beam, and 3. a cooling function to prevent damage to normal skin tissue and enhance the therapeutic gain factor. This applicator was comprised of a 0. 1 -mm-thick copper electrode and a 5 -mm-thick cooling chamber. The depth of the 80 % dose of the new applicator was 21 mm with a 9 -MeV electron beam and 36 mm with a 15 -MeV electron beam, which was comparable to the effect of a conventional irradiation bolus. The temperature distribution produced by the trial applicator was symmetrical on both sides {{from the center of the}} applicator. The 50 % specific absorption rate region was 6. 4 cm wide at a depth of 1 cm from the phantom surface and 2. 8 cm wide at a depth of 3 cm. There have been no previous reports on the development of an external <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> applicator designed for the SRH of superficial and shallow-seated tumors; this is the first such report.

40|$|Background: Magnetites (iron oxide {{nanoparticles}} in Fe 3 O 4) {{coated with}} positively charged liposomes are called as magnetic cationic liposomes (MCLs). MCLs {{used in an}} 8 -MHz radiofrequency (RF) <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> device can increase the temperature of a specific site to up to 45 ℃. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the safety of regional 8 -MHz RF capacitive hyperthermia combined with MCL in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Materials and methods: Three CRPC patients resistant to standard cancer therapy were enrolled in this study. The patients were injected with 0. 5 mL MCL containing Fe (30 mg/mL) into the prostate, followed by application of the heat using an 8 -MHz RF <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> device. The primary end point was to evaluate the presence, or absence, as well as the degree of adverse events. The secondary end point was to obtain preliminary efficacy data. 　Results: The temperature of the tumor was increased by more than 2 ℃ following MCL injection when compared with the 8 -MHz RF treatment alone. No severe adverse events were noted in the prostate, rectum, or the bladder. After treatment, both levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in the tissue were increased in three patients by varying degrees. Conclusion: The present study confirms the safety of regional 8 -MHz RF capacitive hyperthermia combined with MCL...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous radiohyperthermotherapy (SRH) is a {{combined}} hyperthermia-radiation therapy in which irradiation is given during heating. Mutual interference between the high energy radiotherapy system (Toshiba LMR- 15 A) and the 13. 56 MHz <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> system (Omron HEH- 500 C) was tested with phantom materials {{prior to a}} clinical trial with SRH. The energy and flatness of irradiation were not affected by the heating system {{within the range of}} clinical use. The high energy radiotherapy system did not affect the increase or distribution of temperature during simultaneous treatment. The results of this phantom study indicated that these apparatuses would not produce clinically significant mutual interference during SRH. A clinical trial was performed on a 57 -year-old woman with postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer. This is the first reported clinical case treated with true SRH in which external irradiation was administered during mid <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating.</b> Twelve SRH treatments were performed on the recurrent lesion at a frequency of twice a week for six weeks using the apparatuses described above. There was a significant reduction in pain after treatment. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased after treatment. On CT images taken after treatment, the tumor site became a low density area which indicated necrosis. There were no side effects. These results suggest that further clinical study of SRH should be performed to clarify its advantages. </p...|$|E

40|$|A unique, high {{temperature}} (1000 - 2000 K) continuously operating <b>capacitive</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger system is described. The system transfers heat from a combustion or solar furnace to a working gas {{by means of}} a circulating {{high temperature}} molten refractory. A uniform aggregate of beads of a glass-like refractory is injected into the furnace volume. The aggregate is melted and piped to a heat exchanger where it is sprayed through a counter-flowing, high pressure working gas. The refractory droplets transfer their heat to the gas, undergoing a phase change into the solid bead state. The resulting high temperature gas is used to drive a suitable high efficiency heat engine. The solidified refractory beads are delivered back to the furnace and melted to continue the cycle. This approach avoids the important temperature limitations of conventional tube-type heat exchangers, giving rise to the potential of converting heat energy into useful work at considerably higher efficiencies than currently attainable and of storing energy at high thermodynamic potential...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{discovery}} of bulk metallic glasses with exceptional properties has generated much interest. One of their most intriguing features is their capacity for viscous flow above the glass transition temperature. This characteristic allows metallic glasses to be formed like plastics at modest temperatures. However, crystallization of supercooled metallic liquids in the best bulk metallic glass-formers is much more rapid than in most polymers and silicate glass-forming liquids. The short times to crystallization impairs experimentation on and processing of supercooled glass-forming metallic liquids. A technique to rapidly and uniformly heat metallic glasses at rates of 10 5 to 10 6 kelvin per second is presented. A capacitive discharge is used to ohmically heat metallic glasses to temperatures in the super cooled liquid region in millisecond time-scales. By heating samples rapidly, the most time-consuming step in experiments on supercooled metallic liquids is reduced orders of magnitude in length. This allows for experimentation on and processing of metallic liquids in temperature ranges that were previously inaccessible because of crystallization. A variety of forming techniques, including injection molding and forging, were coupled with <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>heating</b> to produce near net-shaped metallic glass parts. In addition, a new forming technique, which combines a magnetic field with the heating current to produce a forming force, was developed. Viscosities were measured in previously inaccessible temperature ranges using parallel plate rheometry combined with <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>heating.</b> Lastly, a rapid pulse calorimeter was developed with this technique to investigate the thermophysical behavior of metallic glasses at these rapid heating rates. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} deals with {{preparation}} and characterization of electrically lossy ferrofluid {{which can be}} used as a mediator for radio frequency (RF) - capacitive hyperthermia method. To this end, ferrofluid that can absorb the energy of alternating electrical field at the frequencies commonly employed in RF-capacitive hyperthermia (13. 56 and 27. 12 MHz) has been prepared by co-precipitation method. This ferrofluid comprises of electrically conductive component with core-shell structure, i. e. magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) coated by dextran, organized in chain-like structure. The effect of RF - capacitive hyperthermia in the presence of mediator was studied on the series of tests performed on HaCaT and HepG 2 cell lines using MMT test. The RF-electrical field (13. 56 MHz) with controllable power output was applied using the EHY- 110 SA (Oncotherm group) to increase the temperature of samples from 37 °C up to target temperature of 44 °C.

40|$|Various type of 25 {{refractory}} tumors (16 : shallow-seated tumors, 9 : deep-seated tumors) {{were treated}} with radiotherapy and RF <b>capacitive</b> <b>heating</b> using HEH- 500. Heating state, acute toxity and clinical result were analysed as follows. Mean maximum intratumor temperature over 42 °C and 41 - 42 °C could be obtained in 9 (36 %) and 8 (32 %) respectively. Bulky shallow-seated tumors in the flat portion were capable of getting good heating state. But the temperatures of deep-seated tumors in the pelvis and lung {{could not be reached}} 42 °C. In the rugged portions such as neck, supraclavicular region and chest wall after radical mastectomy, heatings tend to be unstable due to complaining of hot spot. The frequency of painful hot spot which was the cause of power limiting factor decreased from 81 % to 41 % by using large water bolus. Acute toxicity occured in 15 cases (12 : burns, 3 : subcutaneous indurations). There were no serious complications. Tumor response was evaluated by tumor shrinkage and complete responses were observed in 28 % (7 / 25), partial responses in 40 % (10 / 25) and no responses in 32 % (8 / 25). Therefore the heating device (HEH - 500) is thus suitable for heating of shallow-seated bulky tumors. It is considered that further improvement of applicators and boluses and increasing power of machine are necessary in order to heat deepseated tumors and other various site of tumors properly. rights:日本ハイパーサーミア学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきJournal archiveから複製したものであるrelation: isVersionOf: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Temperature {{is a key}} {{measure in}} human red blood cell {{concentrate}} (RBC) quality control. A precise description of transient temperature distributions in RBC units removed from steady storage exposed to ambient temperature is at present unknown. Magnetic resonance thermometry was employed to visualize and analyse RBC warm up processes, to describe time courses of RBC mean, surface and core temperatures by an analytical model, and to determine and investigate corresponding model parameters. METHODS: Warm-up processes of 47 RBC units stored at 1 - 6 °C and exposed to 21. 25 °C ambient temperature were investigated by proton resonance frequency thermometry. Temperature distributions were visualized and analysed with dedicated software allowing derivation of RBC mean, surface and core temperature-time courses during warm up. Time-dependence of mean temperature was assumed to fulfil a lumped <b>capacitive</b> model of <b>heat</b> transfer. Time courses of relative surface and core temperature changes to ambient temperature were similarly assumed to follow shifted exponential decays characterized by a time constant and a relative time shift, respectively. RESULTS: The lumped <b>capacitive</b> model of <b>heat</b> transfer and shifted exponential decays described time-dependence of mean, surface and core temperatures close to perfect (mean R(2) were 0. 999 ± 0. 001, 0. 996 ± 0. 004 and 0. 998 ± 0. 002, respectively). Mean time constants were τmean =  55. 3 ± 3. 7 min, τsurface =  41. 4 ± 2. 9 min and τcore =  76. 8 ± 7. 1 min, mean relative time shifts were Δsurface =  0. 07 ± 0. 02 and Δcore =  0. 04 ± 0. 01. None of the constants correlated significantly with temperature differences between ambient and storage temperature. CONCLUSION: Lumped <b>capacitive</b> model of <b>heat</b> transfer and shifted exponential decays represent simple analytical formulas to describe transient mean, surface and core temperatures of RBC during warm up, which might be a helpful tool in RBC temperature monitoring and quality control. Independence of constants on differences between ambient and storage temperature suggests validity of models for arbitrary storage and ambient temperatures...|$|R
40|$|During the 1998 - 1999 Antarctic field season, we {{installed}} three autonomous GPS {{stations in}} Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica to measure glacio-isostatic rebound {{and rates of}} spreading across the West Antarctic Rift System. The systems collect data throughout the entire year and therefore must function during the warm, relatively mild summer, and cold, harsh winters. They are powered by gel cell batteries that are charged by wind and solar power. The system includes dual data logging capability. We log data at 5 minute intervals within the receiver and at 30 second intervals to a serial data logger. We do not require 365 days of continuous data for well determined crustal velocities, but rather long periods (greater than 24 hours) of continuous data distributed throughout the year. Therefore, for simplicity, {{we designed the system}} to accept occasional data interruptions. The batteries, in addition to supplying power, act as a thermal <b>capacitive</b> <b>heat</b> storage device to help regulate the temperatures within the system. This storage system absorbs the majority of the 10 - 15 watts of power from the receiver and 5 watts from the data logger which helps to maintain temperature for long periods of time. Power is switched off when the temperature within the system enclosure reaches 50 'C and is reconnected at 20 C. If battery voltage drops too low the batteries will freeze. Therefore, we cut the power off when the batteries drop to a low voltage of 12. 45 V. Power is restored at 13. 2 V. The temperature and power hysteresis allows for a minimum of several days of data to be collected before system shutdowns. A check of all three stations in late January 1999 indicated that the thermal and power control systems are performing as expected. We plan to implement satellite telemetry to the systems during the 2000 - 2001 season following a year of development...|$|R

The platform accurately simulates the process evolution and the thermodynamic and rheological response of the metallic glass, providing excellent agreement with experiments. Features such as the rapid temperature response, a dynamic glass-transition accommodated by a broad enthalpy recovery, a remarkable temperature and deformational uniformity, and an enthalpy trend that validates the adiabatic constraint, are accurately simulated.

40|$|The Mars Hopper is an {{exploratory}} vehicle designed to fly on Mars using carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere as a rocket propellant. The propellent gasses are thermally heated while traversing a radioisotope ther- mal rocket (RTR) engine’s core. This core {{is comprised of}} a radioisotope surrounded by a <b>heat</b> <b>capacitive</b> material interspersed with tubes for the propellant to travel through. These tubes, or flow channels, can be manu- factured in various cross-sectional shapes such as a special four-point star or the traditional circle. Analytical heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) anal- yses were performed using flow channels with either a circle or a star cross- sectional shape. The nominal total inlet pressure was specified at 2, 805, 000 Pa; and the outlet pressure was set to 2, 785, 000 Pa. The CO 2 inlet tem- perature was 300 K; and the channel wall was 1200 K. The steady-state CFD simulations computed the smooth-walled star shape’s outlet temper- ature to be 959 K on the finest mesh. The smooth-walled circle’s outlet temperature was 902 K. A circle with a surface roughness specification at 0. 01 mm gave 946 K and at 0. 1 mm yielded 989 K. The The effects of a slightly varied inlet pressure were also examined.

40|$|Radioisotope heat {{sources and}} power systems, {{traditionally}} fuelled by 238 Pu, {{have been developed}} and used for spacecraft thermal management and to provide electrical power during many deep space and planetary science missions. The use of fission reactors in space, however, has been limited to high power applications in Earth orbit. Previous ground based research programs conducted by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission demonstrated the principal of nuclear thermal rocket propulsion but to date, flight heritage of nuclear propulsion has been limited to nuclear-electric propulsion. The development of space nuclear systems and tributary components {{that are capable of}} meeting the rigors of space flight is of paramount importance. Performance, lifetime and operational safety under all foreseeable conditions are essential considerations that must be made. The selection of appropriate materials and environmental compatibility is vital to the success of any given design. The ability for radioisotope heat sources to survive the extreme temperatures and mechanical loads associated with launch related accidents, is both legally mandated and necessary for the protection of life and the Earth’s environment. Nuclear fuels for fission systems must provide equal protection during accidents while the integral design ensures that a reactor remains in a safe configuration. A historical overview of nuclear systems for space is presented. Traditional and modern system designs and fabrication techniques are discussed. Applicable solid state and mechanical power conversion methods are described and their performances are evaluated. Consideration is made for the effect of radioisotope selection and heat source encapsulation architecture upon radiation safety. The identification of 241 Am as an alternative isotope fuel is made. Other candidate isotopes such as 210 Po, 242 Cm and 244 Cm are assessed. The development of encapsulation methods that are resistant to the extraction and dispersion of the radioactive materials enclosed is increasingly attractive for security reasons. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) processes are presented as novel, simple and rapid techniques for the encapsulation of radioisotopic materials within tungsten ceramic-metallic or cermet matrices. Computational modelling via Monte-Carlo simulation has shown that the encapsulation of radioisotopes within heterogeneous tungsten cermet matrices may reduce the neutron, X-ray and Gamma-ray radiation dose delivered to the localised environment. The prevention of fabrication related volatilisation of radioisotopic compounds is fundamental {{to the success of the}} encapsulation process. SPS is empirically demonstrated via the use of CeO 2 as an inert simulant for radioisotopic compounds such as PuO 2, AmO 2 and UO 2. The chemical compatibility of americium oxides within a tungsten matrix is also demonstrated through pressureless sintering within a Differential Scanning Calorimetric furnace. The techniques developed for radioisotope encapsulation are also demonstrated in context of cermet fuel fabrication for high temperature space power and propulsion reactor systems. The use of tungsten cermet fuels may eliminate material incompatibilities and failures experienced by historical nuclear thermal propulsion programs. Finally, three novel concept applications of nuclear energy as an enabling technology for planetary exploration are presented. Melt penetration of icy surfaces and long range mobility on planetary surfaces is proposed via the use of pulsed high power <b>heat</b> <b>capacitive</b> radioisotope sources. In-situ resource utilization is considered for propellant production. The use of CO 2 is proposed as a propellant for a radioisotope thermal rocket in the context of a ‘Mars Hopper’. A CO 2 propellant is also considered in the context of a high temperature (3000 °C) nuclear thermal propulsion system for a single stage surface ascent vehicle under a Mars sample return mission.
