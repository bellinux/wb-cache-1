40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{based primarily on}} transaction costs, for comparing the various tendering mechanisms used for transportation Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, the model contrasts <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures</b> with the open procedure, {{as defined by the}} current European Union legislation on public tendering. The model includes both ex ante transaction costs (borne during the tendering stage) and ex post transaction costs (such as enforcement costs, re-negotiation costs, and costs arising from litigation between partners), explaining the trade-off between them. Generally speaking, it is assumed that the open procedure implies lower transaction costs ex ante, while the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> reduces the probability of the appearance of new contingencies not foreseen in the contract, hence diminishing the expected value of transaction costs ex post. Therefore, the balance between ex ante and ex post transaction costs is the main criterion for deciding whether the open or <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> would be optimal. Notwithstanding, empirical evidence currently exists only on ex ante transaction costs in transportation infrastructure projects. This evidence has shown a relevant difference between the two procedures as far as ex ante costs are concerned, favouring the open procedure. The model developed in this paper also demonstrates that a larger degree of complexity in a contract does not unequivocally favour the use of a <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure.</b> Only in those cases dealing with very innovative projects, where important dimensions {{of the quality of the}} asset or service are not verifiable, may we observe an advantage in favour of the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure.</b> The bottom line is that we find it difficult to justify the employment of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures</b> in most transportation PPP contracts, especially in the field of roads. Nevertheless, the field remains open for future empirical work and research on the levels of transaction costs borne ex post in PPP contracts, as well as on the probabilities of such costs appearing under any of the procurement procedures...|$|R
40|$|The core of diploma thesis lies in {{analysis}} of public procurement procedure of which defining features {{in all the}} world public procurement systems are elimination of competition and constraints to the transparency, which opens up the scope especially for disguised breaches of law, discrimination of suppliers and corruption - <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice. Existence of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice is not overseen in the Czech legal environment. Frequency of its use currently amounts to significant 20 per cent of all awarded contracts. This procurement procedure has been traditionally justified in all procurement systems by specific circumstances, which from its nature either eliminate competition, or there is another public interest, which outweigh free competition. Thus balancing of such interests tends to be the major problem when assessing permission to use this non-transparent <b>procedure.</b> <b>Negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice has already occurred in the Czech law in the first legal act, which governed public procurement. The respective groundbreaker was the Act No. 199 / 1994 Coll., which was inspired by the UNCITRAL Model law on public procurement. After the accession to the European Union, the Czech Republic was forced to reflect common procurement framework and to implement provisions [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to improve our {{comprehension}} of the role played by project complexity and institutional quality as possible drivers of the choice between open auctions and negotiations in a sample of Italian municipalities. Controlling for project characteristics, for observed and unobserved heterogeneity at municipality level, our main results suggest that projects that are more complex are more likely to be procured with <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures.</b> On average, a rise in the project complexity index from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of its distribution increases the probability of procuring the project with a <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> by about 6 %- 8 %. However, our results also suggest that the impact of complexity might be more relevant in the case of projects procured by municipalities located in provinces characterized by low levels of corruption. Moreover, we also find that complex projects are associated to longer delays in their execution, larger rebates and to higher probabilities to be awarded to local firms...|$|R

Specifically, it provides with thorough interpretation of the Czech legal regulation of conditions allowing for using <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> with prior notice or <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without prior notice to award a public tender. In order to achieve such purpose, the thesis uses information from the 137 / 2006 Coll., Public Procurement Act, as amended, available doctrinal literature and case law of the Office for the Protection of Competition, Czech courts and the European Court of Justice. The interpretation is performed to compare the Czech regulation with the one contained in relevant European directives (2004 / 17 /EC, 2004 / 18 /EC and 2009 / 81 /EC).

40|$|The <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without {{publication}} of a contract notice is a special procedure for awarding public procurement contracts which departs from the obligation imposed on contracting authorities of respecting the freedoms of the internal market and rules of competition. The procedure may be applied in exceptional situations of extreme urgency resulting from an event {{which could not be}} foreseen. The current judicature of the Court of Justice of the EU provides interpretations of the legal basis for application of the procedure in specific cases. However, it does not address the issue of whether it is possible to regard improper performance of contractual obligations as unpredictable. It does not provide broader considerations concerning the form of regulations on the procedure of awarding public interest contracts either. These issues were subject to analysis in one of the resolutions of the National Appeal Chamber (KIO) – the Polish authority issuing decisions in matters related to public procurement contracts. In resolution KIO/KD 58 / 10 of 6 August 2010, KIO assessed the correctness of the application of the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> for changing the contractor of the Municipal Stadium in Wrocław {{in the run-up to the}} 2012 European Football Championships. KIO found that the significant delay in construction of the facility was unpredictably exceptional, and significantly threatened the timeliness of commissioning the facility, which resulted in termination of the agreement by the contracting authority. The resolution also included an assessment allowing for the position that such a situation was exceptional due to the scale of the threat to the public interest, including the commercial interest of the contracting authority, stemming from a lack of immediate performance of the contract if it resulted in disproportionate consequences for a specific community.

A distinction is made in the negotiating process between the proposal of technical factors by interested parties, their quantification for each party, best accomplished by an impartial review panel, and the relative weightings finally given to each technical factor, decided by negotiation. Negotiations could efficiently focus on these weightings within a spreadsheet matrix of numerical values by interested party and factor. From a hypothetical example, it seems that prior negotiation on which factors to include may be unnecessary with multiple participants: any factor not achieving general consensus will have a low weighting, and a relatively minor influence on the final allocations. ...|$|R
