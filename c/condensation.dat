25|$|The {{positioning}} of the osteoprogenitor cell <b>condensations</b> determines the cell lineage before the signalling molecules can.

40|$|Context. The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} clustered star formation and {{the origin of}} the stellar initial mass function (IMF) are currently much debated. In one school of thought the IMF of embedded clusters is entirely determined by turbulent fragmentation at the prestellar stage of star formation, while in a major alternative view it results from dynamical interactions and competitive accretion at the protostellar stage. Aims. In an effort to discriminate between these two pictures for {{the origin of the}} IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of starless <b>condensations</b> and protostars previously detected by us in the dust continuum at 1. 2 mm in the L 1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. The starless <b>condensations</b> have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in the protocluster. Methods. We carried out detailed molecular line observations, including some N 2 H+(1 - 0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster <b>condensations</b> using the IRAM 30 m telescope. Results. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence within the <b>condensations,</b> implying virial masses which generally agree within a factor of 2 with the masses derived from the 1. 2 mm dust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L 1688 starless <b>condensations</b> are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We detected the classical spectroscopic signature of infall motions in CS(2 - 1), CS(3 - 2), H 2 CO(212 - 111), and/or HCO+(3 - 2) toward six <b>condensations,</b> and obtained tentative infall signatures toward 10 other <b>condensations.</b> In addition, we measured a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0. 4 km s- 1 (or twice the sound speed) between <b>condensations.</b> The small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in general, the <b>condensations</b> do not have time to interact with one another before evolving into pre-main sequence objects. Conclusions. Our observations support the view that the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage. Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the protostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating <b>condensations</b> initially produced by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum...|$|R

40|$|We present {{combined}} Submillimeter-Array (SMA) + single-dish {{images of}} the (sub) millimeter dust continuum emission toward two prestellar cores SM 1 and B 2 -N 5 in the nearest star cluster forming region, ρ Ophiuchus. Our combined images indicate that SM 1 and B 2 -N 5 consist of three and four <b>condensations,</b> respectively, with masses of 10 ^- 2 - 10 ^- 1 M_ and sizes {{of a few hundred}} AU. The individual <b>condensations</b> have mean densities of 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3 and the masses are comparable to or larger than the critical Bonner-Ebert mass, indicating that the self-gravity {{plays an important role in}} the dynamical evolution of the <b>condensations.</b> The coalescence timescale of these <b>condensations</b> is estimated to be about 10 ^ 4 yr, which is comparable to the local gravitational collapse timescale, suggesting that merging of the <b>condensations,</b> instead of accretion, plays an essential role in the star formation process. These results challenge the standard theory of star formation, where a single, rather featureless prestellar core collapses to form at most a couple of <b>condensations,</b> each of which potentially evolves into a protostar that is surrounded by a rotating disk where planets are created.
