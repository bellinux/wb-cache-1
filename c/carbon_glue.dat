30|$|The EDS {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} to further identify the compositions of the NiS/Pt/Ti CE. Figure  2 d displays the presence of C, O, Ni, S, and Pt elements in the NiS/Pt/Ti film, in which the atomic percentages of Ni/S ratio is nearly 1 : 1. This illustrates that NiS was successfully deposited on Ti foil. Among Ti, O, Pt, and C elements, {{the large amount of}} Ti and Pt is responsible for the Ti foil substrate and electrodeposition of chloroplatinic acid, respectively; a little O may come from the passive oxide of TiO 2 on the Ti foil substrate, and C is due to the holey conductive <b>carbon</b> <b>glue.</b> The results demonstrate that the NiS/Pt/Ti composite CE was successfully prepared by means of the facile electrodepositing route.|$|E

The electrical conductivity of second material has been adjusted by density, size, and shape of carbon filler particles incorporated into the resin matrix. The study shows that micro-voids inside die attach layers of a semiconductor package can lead to partial discharges (PD). Such discharges are reduced by a design-in of <b>carbon</b> filled <b>glues</b> into the device.

50|$|The A {{model of}} the H.XVIII was a long, smooth blended wing body. Its six {{turbojet}} engines were buried deep in the wing and the exhausts centered on the trailing end. Resembling the Horten Ho 229 flying wing fighter there were many odd features that distinguished this aircraft; the jettisonable landing gear and the wing made of wood and <b>carbon</b> based <b>glue,</b> are but two. The aircraft was first proposed for the Amerika Bomber project and was personally reviewed by Hermann Göring: after review, the Horten brothers (with deep dissatisfaction) were forced to share design and construction of the aircraft with Junkers and Messerschmitt engineers, who wanted to add a single rudder fin as well as suggesting underwing pods to house the engines and landing gear.|$|R

30|$|Evaporation {{of fluid}} at micro and {{nanometer}} scale {{may be used}} to self-assemble nanometre-sized particles in suspension. Evaporating process can be used to gently control flow in micro and nanofluidics, thus providing a potential mean to design a fine pattern onto a surface or to functionalize a nanoprobe tip. In this paper, we present an original experimental approach to explore this open and rather virgin domain. We use an oscillating tip at an air liquid interface with a controlled dipping depth of the tip within the range of the micrometer. Also, very small dipping depths of a few ten nanometers were achieved with multi walls <b>carbon</b> nanotubes <b>glued</b> at the tip apex. The liquid is an aqueous solution of functionalized nanoparticles diluted in water. Evaporation of water is the driving force determining the arrangement of nanoparticles on the tip. The results show various nanoparticles deposition patterns, from which the deposits can be classified in two categories. The type of deposit is shown to be strongly dependent on whether or not the triple line is pinned and of the peptide coating of the gold nanoparticle. In order to assess the classification, companion dynamical studies of nanomeniscus and related dissipation processes involved with thinning effects are presented.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} making India ink was known in China {{as early as the}} middle of the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, during Neolithic China. India ink was first invented in China, although the source of materials to make the carbon pigment in India ink was later often traded from India, thus the term India ink was coined. The traditional Chinese method of making the ink was to grind a mixture of hide <b>glue,</b> <b>carbon</b> black, lampblack, and bone black pigment with a pestle and mortar, then pouring it into a ceramic dish where it could dry. To use the dry mixture, a wet brush would be applied until it reliquified. The manufacture of India ink was well-established by the Cao Wei Dynasty (220 - 265 AD). Indian documents written in Kharosthi with ink have been unearthed in Chinese Turkestan. The practice of writing with ink and a sharp pointed needle was common in early South India. Several Buddhist and Jain sutras in India were compiled in ink.|$|R
40|$|Activated carbons remove {{waterborne}} bacteria from potable water systems through attractive Lifshitz-van der Waals forces despite electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged cells and carbon surfaces. In this paper we quantify the interaction forces between bacteria with negatively and positively charged, mesoporous wood-based carbons, {{as well as}} with a microporous coconut carbon. To this end, we <b>glued</b> <b>carbon</b> particles to the cantilever of an atomic force microscope and measured the interaction forces upon approach and retraction of thus made tips. Waterborne Raoultella terrigena and Escherichia coli adhered weakly (1 - 2 nN) to different activated carbon particles, and the main difference between the activated carbons was the percentage of curves with attractive sites revealed upon traversing of a carbon particle through the bacterial EPS layer. The percentage of curves showing adhesion forces upon retraction varied between 21 % and 69 %, and was highest for R. terrigena with positively charged carbon (66 %) and a coconut carbon (69 %). Macroscopic bacterial removal by the mesoporous carbon particles increased with increasing percentages of attractive sites revealed upon traversing a carbon particle through the outer bacterial surface layer.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{different}} coatings on the physiological potential of stylosanthes cv. Campo Grande seeds. The treatments were: uncoated seeds; limestone + PVA glue; limestone + sand + PVA glue; limestone + activated carbon + PVA glue; calcium silicate + PVA glue; calcium silicate + sand + PVA glue; calcium silicate + activated <b>carbon</b> + PVA <b>glue.</b> Posteriorly, the seeds were analyzed for water content (WC), maximum diameter (MAD) and minimum diameter (MID), thousand seed weight (TSW), germination test, germination speed index (GSI), mean germination time (MGT), emergence, emergence speed index (ESI), mean emergence time (MET), shoot and root length, fresh and dry matter of shoot and root. The coating increased the TSW, MAD and MID and decreased its WC. The treatments comprising limestone + PVA glue and limestone + sand + PVA glue increased the germination time, but none of the treatments negatively affected the physiological seed quality. Treatment with calcium silicate + PVA glue was outstanding for germination speed index and fresh and dry matter of shoot and root in the stylosanthes cv. Campo Grande seeds coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a reproducible technique for synthesis of a conducting Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) probe using a MWNT and to demonstrate the usefulness of this new probe for Conductive Probe-AFM (CP-AFM). Current technology employs a <b>carbon</b> based acrylic <b>glue</b> for adhering a MWNT to a silicon cantilever for use in Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) [1]. The technique is limited in its ability to produce good electrical and mechanical contact between the MWNT and the silicon cantilever. ^ A novel technique is described that allows for synthesis of MWNT probes that possess good electrical and mechanical contact between a MWNT and a gold coated silicon cantilever. The technique employs a spatially selective electro-deposition of gold from an aqueous plating solution on and around the MWNT/silicon cantilever junction. The metal provides a robust contact and probes with measured resistances consistently on the order of 10 s of kΩ. The technique developed for MWNT CP-AFM probe synthesis was used to produce probes and then characterize novel electronic structures. The electronic properties of Self Assembled Monolayers (SAMs) of organic molecules on a specially prepared flat gold substrate and of a nanostructure consisting of a gold nanocrystal adsorbed onto an organic SAM were measured. ...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical analysis of strengthened damaged reinforced concrete corbel by <b>gluing</b> <b>carbon</b> fibre fabrics. The main {{objective of this}} study is to investigate the damage effect on the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures, especially on short reinforced concrete corbel and to propose an analytical model. Therefore, an experimental program was developed to evaluate the mechanical damaging effect on short corbels behaviour by using strain gauges. According to this program, five reinforced concrete corbels were tested under a three-point bending up to failure. Three of them were damaged at 45, 65 and 90  % of their ultimate load. After the specimens were repaired with carbon fibre fabrics and the loading was conducted till their failure. The fourth corbel which was not damaged. It was strengthened and tested until its collapse. The last one is the reference specimen corbel which was not reinforced. The test results with corbel specimens which were strengthened and unstrengthened are given. The significance to member performance is also explained. The measured load versus strain was too measured in the same way (with precision strain gauges) for others materials such as composite fibre fabrics, steel bar and concrete at the cross section of corbel. The study shows that the composite fibre fabrics using bonding technique could be a convenient and effective strengthening method for concrete structures. Thus, steel reinforcement and carbon fabrics played a major role in the repair of corbels. A theoretical analysis is presented describing the behaviour of strengthened damaged concrete corbel using the damage theory of reinforced concrete beams.|$|R
