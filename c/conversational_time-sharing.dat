50|$|The Sigma 9 was {{announced}} in 1970 and the first delivery was made in 1971. There were 3 models built, the Sigma 9, the Sigma 9 Model 2 and the Sigma 9 Model 3. The original was {{the most powerful and}} was universally applicable to all data processing applications at the time. The Model 2 was able to process in multi-programmed batch, remote batch, <b>conversational</b> <b>time-sharing,</b> real-time, and transaction processing modes. The Model 3 was designed for the scientific real-time community.|$|E
40|$|Extensions and {{improvements}} {{were made to}} SFTRAN, a structured programming language. This language was implemented as a precompiler that translates from SFTRAN to FORTRAN. It was available to batch and conversational users of the UNIVAC 1100 computer system. The SFTRAN language and its use are described. In addition, <b>conversational</b> <b>time-sharing</b> system command subroutines were implemented that eliminated the complications of dealing with extra files and processing steps {{that the use of}} a precompiler would otherwise require. These command subroutines are reported, and their use is illustrated by examplesIssued Apr. 1978. Includes bibliographical references (p. 41).

40|$|A FORTRAN 4 {{program is}} {{described}} which reduces the {{data obtained from}} a high resolution mass spectrograph. The program (1) calculates an accurate mass for each line on the photoplate, and (2) assigns elemental compositions to each accurate mass. The program is intended {{for use in a}} time-shared computing environment and makes use of the <b>conversational</b> aspects of <b>time-sharing</b> operating systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} which allocates an available budget to research alternatives subject to budgetary constraints on both organizational and technical entities. The solution algorithm {{is based on}} the out-of-kilter minimum cost network flow algorithm and is programmed for use in a <b>time-share,</b> <b>conversational</b> mode. Although the model does not describe the decision processes observed empirically, its output is sufficiently similar to actual allocations that it can be viewed as predictive. Strengths and weaknesses of the model are detailed based on questionnaire and interview data provided by the potential users of the system. The decision information system is used to illustrate that experimentation concerned with better understanding of the adoption process can be used to facilitate model design and application. ...|$|R
