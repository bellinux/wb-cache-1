50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of attacks in HoL, Melee (with hand-to-hand weapons) and Ranged (with {{projectile}} weapons). Attackers attack, and Defenders either Dodge or Parry the attack. The Attacker rolls 2d6 + Stat + Skill to attack, rolling on the <b>Combat</b> <b>Chart</b> (which is similar to the General Chart, i.e. rolls lower than 15 miss). The total attack roll is modified by the Defender's Feets Stat + 2d6 (this acts as the base Difficulty Modifier against the attack) plus any other modifiers the HoLmeister sees fit (e.g. for cover).|$|E

50|$|Only {{about half}} the total height of the game board {{is used for the}} actual map. The {{remainder}} is covered by various charts and tables used in the game. Along the bottom is the game turn track that lists the reinforcements for each side. There is also a chart showing the various effects of the different terrain types, a <b>combat</b> results <b>chart</b> for resolving battles, a summary table of the various supply effects, and tracks for marking replacements for allied and axis forces.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{was based}} on an odds ratio between the attacking units Attack Rating and the {{defending}} unit's Defense Rating. The odds ranged from 1-to-4 or less, up to 5-to-1 or more. Different <b>combat</b> results <b>charts</b> were used {{based on the number of}} Defense Factors, and the results determined by rolling a six-sided dice. The result was in terms of step losses by each side, with at most one step being lost. Many of the results called for a step loss by both sides, reflecting the heavy attrition incurred throughout this conflict. Defending units in clear terrain that suffered a step loss also had to retreat a hex, or lose a second step.|$|R
2500|$|Lead single [...] "Know Your Rights" [...] was {{released}} on 23 April 1982, and reached number 43 on the U.K. singles <b>chart.</b> <b>Combat</b> Rock {{was released}} on 14 May 1982 and reached number 2 on the U.K. album charts, kept off the top spot by Paul McCartney's Tug of War. In the United States, Combat Rock reached number 7 on the album charts, selling in excess of one million copies.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, suppose two armies clash, one led by Napoleon (leader rating 3) and one Bagration (leader rating 2). In the French army {{there are}} 20 {{strength}} points and Bagration leads {{an army of}} 8. Odds then are 2:1 plus {{and there is a}} net 1 increase for Napoleon's tactical advantage. Suppose it takes place in a forest hex though, so there is a -1 adjustment as well. Two dice are rolled and the result is an 8. There is no net adjustment so the result for 8 is searched for in the 2:1 row. The result for the larger force is “1” and for the smaller force “D1”. This means that the smaller force is immediately demoralized. The <b>Combat</b> Loss <b>chart</b> is then consulted. Bagration's army of 8 in the D1 Row means 2 SP are lost, whereas Napoleon's 20 lose 2 as well. A [...] "D" [...] result requires that side to lose at least one strength point of cavalry, and the loser must retreat, and must also lose an additional strength point if he is inferior in cavalry to the winner.|$|R
