25|$|Maskelyne {{subsequently}} encouraged Arnold {{by employing}} him on several occasions, mostly {{in connection with}} watch and clock jewelling. In 1769, Arnold modified Maskelyne's centre seconds watch by John Ellicott, changing the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> from steel to one made of sapphire. He lent this watch to the Astronomer William Wales for use in assessing the practicability of Maskelyne's Lunar distance method for finding the ship's longitude during the voyage of the Transit of Venus expedition to the West Indies in 1769. Around this time, Arnold also seems to have started to think about making an accurate timekeeper to find the longitude.|$|E

Arnold made a sufficient impression so that McGuire gave him a loan, enabling him to set up in business as a watchmaker at Devereux Court, Strand, London. In 1764, Arnold obtained permission to present to King George III an exceptionally small half quarter repeating watch <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> watch mounted in a ring. A similar repeating watch by Arnold has survived; it is of interest that the basic movement is Swiss in origin but finished in London.

5000|$|Roamer {{was founded}} in Solothurn, Switzerland, in 1888 by Fritz Meyer. At first, Meyer and {{employees}} concentrated on manufacturing <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapements,</b> in 1904 Meyer began assembling watches. In 1905 [...] Meyer joined forces with fellow watchmaker Johann Studeli to form the partnership Meyer and Studeli (MST). In the same year Meyer won a Bronze medal at the Liege World Fair. The partnership continued to develop new calibres and enter them into more World Fairs, winning Silver Medals at the Milan Fair in 1906 and Brussels Fair in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|Jewel bearings, {{introduced}} in England in 1702 by the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, also came into use for quality watches during this period. Watches {{of this period}} are characterised by their thinness. New innovations, such as the <b>cylinder</b> and lever <b>escapements,</b> allowed watches to become much thinner than they had previously been. This caused a change in style. The thick pocketwatches based on the verge movement went out of fashion and were only worn by the poor, and were derisively referred to as [...] "onions" [...] and [...] "turnips".|$|R
5000|$|The lever escapement, {{invented by}} Thomas Mudge in 1750, {{has been used}} in the vast {{majority}} of watches since the 19th century. Its advantages are (1) it is a [...] "detached" [...] escapement; unlike the <b>cylinder</b> or duplex <b>escapements</b> the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again. The original form was the rack lever escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement. British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap [...] "dollar watches" [...] in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.|$|R

50|$|The Lépine calibre uses {{bars and}} bridges instead of pillars and upper plates. As mentioned, the {{movement}} has no fusee which equalizes the driving power transmitted to the train, replaced instead by a going barrel to drive the train directly. This improvement was facilitated by using the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> and enhanced springs.|$|E
5000|$|Essentially, the [...] "Lépine calibre" [...] or [...] "calibre à pont", {{served to}} reduce a watch’s thickness. To do this, it {{exchanged}} the traditional frame with two bottom plates {{for a single}} plate onto which the train is fixed with independent bridges. It also removed the fusee and its chain and then began using the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement.</b> He also invented the floating mainspring going barrel.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{original}} verge escapement, which required a fusee, was gradually replaced in better French watches with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> and in British watches with the duplex escapement. Then in the 19th century both were superseded by the lever escapement {{which has been}} used almost exclusively ever since. A cheaper version of the lever, the pin lever escapement, patented in 1867 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in inexpensive watches until the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The duplex watch {{escapement}} {{was invented}} by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.The early forms had two escape wheels. The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> and could equal that of the (early) lever escapement and when carefully made was {{almost as good as}} a detent escapement.|$|E
5000|$|In pocketwatches, besides its inaccuracy, the {{vertical}} {{orientation of the}} crown wheel {{and the need for}} a bulky fusee made the verge movement unfashionably thick. French watchmakers adopted the thinner <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> invented in 1695. In England, high end watches went to the duplex escapement, developed in 1782, but inexpensive verge fusee watches continued to be produced until the mid 19th century, when the lever escapement took over. [...] These later verge watches were colloquially called 'turnips' because of their bulky build.|$|E
50|$|The {{first thing}} to be {{improved}} was the escapement. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George Graham in the 1720s. In Britain a few quality watches went to the duplex escapement, invented by Jean Baptiste Dutertre in 1724. The advantage of these escapements was that they only gave the balance wheel a short push {{in the middle of}} its swing, leaving it 'detached' from the escapement to swing back and forth undisturbed during most of its cycle.|$|E
50|$|His father, a Cornishman, John Ellicott (-1733), {{was also}} a clockmaker and had been {{admitted}} to the Clockmakers' Company in 1696. John Ellicott (jnr) conducted business first from Austin Friars Street EC2 and later from Swithin’s Alley, Royal Exchange, and in 1738 was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He showed {{a keen interest in}} scientific matters and maintained an observatory at his home in Hackney. He was best known for his work on temperature compensated pendulums and his use of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement.</b> His quality workmanship led to an appointment as Clockmaker to George III.|$|E
50|$|The {{increased}} {{accuracy of}} the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by {{other parts of the}} movement, igniting a two-century wave of watchmaking innovation. The first thing to be improved was the escapement. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George Graham in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert Hooke allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.|$|E

Arnold made a sufficient impression so that McGuire gave him a loan, enabling him to set up in business as a watchmaker at Devereux Court, Strand, London.

5000|$|Before World War I Krupp, in Germany, started {{producing}} the Baker clockwork fuze. It contained a spring clock {{with an extra}} rapid <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> giving 30 beats per second. [...] During World War 1 Germany developed other mechanical time, i.e. clockwork, fuzes. These were less erratic and more precise than igniferous fuzes, critical characteristics as gun ranges increased. Between the wars five or six different mechanical mechanisms were developed in various nations. [...] However, three came to predominate, the Thiel pattern in British designs, Junghans pattern in United States and the Swiss Dixi mechanisms, the first two both originated in World War 1 Germany. [...] Mechanical time fuzes remain in service with many armies.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} or <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> {{invented by}} Thomas Tompion in 1695 and perfected by George Graham in 1726, {{was one of}} the escapements which replaced the verge escapement in pocketwatches after 1700. A major attraction was that it was much thinner than the verge, allowing watches to be made fashionably slim. Clockmakers found it suffered from excessive wear, so it was not much used during the 18th century, except in a few high-end watches with the cylinders made from ruby. The French solved this problem by making the cylinder and escape wheel of hardened steel, and the escapement was used in large numbers in inexpensive French and Swiss pocketwatches and small clocks from the mid-19th to the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In 1815, Frédéric-Louis Blancpain, the {{great-grandson}} of Jehan-Jacques, who {{was head}} of the family business at the time, modernized production methods and transformed the traditional craft workshop into an industrial undertaking capable of serial production. By replacing the crown-wheel mechanism with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> Frédéric-Louis introduced a major innovation into the watchmaking world. In {{the second half of the}} 19th century, as industrialization took hold, the prices of watchmaking products were falling and many workshops were fated to close down. To face up to American competition, in 1865 Blancpain built a two-storey factory by the River Suze and made use of water power to supply the electricity needed for its production processes. By modernizing its methods and concentrating on top-of-range products, Blancpain become one of the few watchmaking firms to survive in Villeret. In 1926, the Manufacture entered into a partnership with John Harwood and started marketing the first automatic wristwatch.|$|E
5000|$|After steadfastly {{pursuing}} various methods during {{thirty years}} of experimentation, Harrison moved to London in late 1758 where to his surprise he found {{that some of the}} watches made by Graham's successor Thomas Mudge kept time just as accurately as his huge sea clocks. It is possible that Mudge was able to do this after the early 1740s thanks to the availability of the new [...] "Huntsman" [...] or [...] "Crucible" [...] steel produced by Benjamin Huntsman sometime in the early 1740s which enabled harder pinions but more importantly, a tougher and more highly polished <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> to be produced. [...] Harrison then realized that a mere watch after all could be made accurate enough for the task and was a far more practical proposition for use as a marine timekeeper. He proceeded to redesign the concept of the watch as a timekeeping device, basing his design on sound scientific principles.|$|E
5000|$|In retrospect therefore, {{it was a}} {{significant}} occasion when in 1767, Nevil Maskelyne presented John Arnold {{with a copy of}} the [...] "Principles of Mr. Harrison's Timekeeper" [...] {{as soon as it was}} published, evidently with a view to encourage him to make a precision timekeeper of the same kind. Maskelyne subsequently encouraged Arnold by employing him on several occasions, mostly in connection with watch and clock jewelling. In 1769, Arnold modified Maskelyne's centre seconds watch by John Ellicott, changing the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement</b> from steel to one made of sapphire. He lent this watch to the Astronomer William Wales for use in assessing the practicability of Maskelyne's Lunar distance method for finding the ship's longitude during the voyage of the Transit of Venus expedition to the West Indies in 1769. Around this time, Arnold also seems to have started to think about making an accurate timekeeper to find the longitude.|$|E
50|$|Up to the 1720s, {{almost all}} watch {{movements}} {{were based on}} the verge escapement, which had been developed for large public clocks in the 14th century. This type of escapement involved a high degree of friction and did not include any kind of jewelling to protect the contacting surfaces from wear. As a result, a verge watch could rarely achieve any high standard of accuracy. (Surviving examples mostly run very fast, often gaining an hour a day or more.) The first widely used improvement was the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement,</b> developed by the Abbé de Hautefeuille early in the 18th century and applied by the English maker George Graham. Then, {{towards the end of the}} 18th century, the lever escapement (invented by Thomas Mudge in 1759) was put into limited production by a handful of makers including Josiah Emery (a Swiss based in London) and Abraham-Louis Breguet. With this, a domestic watch could keep time to within a minute a day. Lever watches became common after about 1820, and this type is still used in most mechanical watches today.|$|E
5000|$|In pocketwatches, {{the verge}} escapement, which {{required}} a fusee, was gradually replaced by escapements which were less sensitive {{to changes in}} mainspring force; the cylinder and later the lever escapement. In 1760, Jean-Antoine Lépine dispensed with the fusee, inventing a going barrel to power the watch gear train directly. This contained a very long mainspring, of which only a few turns were used to power the watch. Accordingly, {{only a part of}} the mainspring's 'torque curve' was used, where the torque was approximately constant. In the 1780s, pursuing thinner watches, French watchmakers adopted the going barrel with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>escapement.</b> By 1850, the Swiss and American watchmaking industries employed the going barrel exclusively, aided by new methods of adjusting the balance spring so that it was isochronous. England continued to make the bulkier full plate fusee watches until about 1900 [...] They were inexpensive models sold to the lower classes and were derisively called [...] "turnips". After this, the only remaining use for the fusee was in marine chronometers, where the highest precision was needed, and bulk was less of a disadvantage, until they became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|E
