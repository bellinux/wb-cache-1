It is a fast, highly scalable system for creating, distributing, and installing disk images.

40|$|In some {{network and}} {{application}} scenarios, {{it is useful}} to cache content in network nodes on the fly, at line rate. Resilience of in-network caches can be improved by guaranteeing that all content therein stored is valid. Digital signatures could be indeed used to verify <b>content</b> <b>integrity</b> and provenance. However, their operation may be much slower than the line rate, thus limiting caching of cryptographically verified objects to a small subset of the forwarded ones. How this affects caching performance? To answer such a question, we devise a simple analytical approach which permits to assess performance of an LRU caching strategy storing a randomly sampled subset of requests. A key feature of our model is the ability to handle traffic beyond the traditional Independent Reference Model, thus permitting us to understand how performance vary in different temporal locality conditions.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the accuracy of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of testis rupture after scrotal trauma and its sensitivity and specificity for testis rupture, tunica albuginea breach, testicular hematoma, testis avulsion, epididymis injuries, and hematocele. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2006, 33 patients underwent surgical exploration for blunt scrotal trauma. All these patients had an emergency scrotal ultrasonography with the use of a 7. 5 or 10 MHz linear transducer. Ultrasonographic findings were compared with surgical findings to calculate sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for each type of lesion. RESULTS: Of 33 patients, 16 presented a testis rupture. Testis rupture was in all cases suspected ultrasonographically by the loss of contour of the testis and heterogeneous parenchyma. Tunica albuginea breach was visualized in only 8 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for testis rupture were 100 % and 65 %, respectively. Moreover, ultrasonography allowed diagnosis of hematocele (sensitivity: 87 % and specificity: 89 %), testicular hematoma (sensitivity: 71 %, specificity: 77 %), and testis avulsion (sensitivity: 100 %, specificity: 97 %). Ultrasonography results for epididymis injuries were poor. On 7 patients, 3 epididymis lesions were misdiagnosed by ultrasound examination. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can distinguish various scrotal injuries. Testicular rupture is probably the most severe injury that needs early surgical treatment to improve testis salvage rate. In our work, ultrasonography is highly sensitive in the diagnosis of testis rupture and can provide information on the scrotal <b>contents</b> <b>integrity</b> that can help the physician to determine the optimal treatment...|$|R

MA. 22 accrued T 3 N 0, any N 2 or N 3, and T 4 breast cancer patients. Treatment was 6 cycles of 3 -weekly (Schedule A; N =  47) or 8 cycles of 2 -weekly (Schedule B; N =  46) epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy in sequential phase I/II studies, with growth factor support. In phase I of each schedule, MTDs were based on DLT. In phase II, clinical responses (CR/PR) and pathologic complete responses (pCR) were assessed. Tumor biopsy cores were obtained pre-, mid-, and post-treatment: 3 for pathologic assessment; 3 for microarray studies. DLT for Schedule A was febrile neutropenia at 105  mg/m 2 epirubicin and 75  mg/m 2 docetaxel; for schedule B, it was fatigue at 75  mg/m 2 for both agents. Phase II doses were 90  mg/m 2 epirubicin/ 75  mg/m 2 docetaxel for Schedule A and 60  mg/m 2 (both agents) for Schedule B. Schedule A CR/PR and pCR rates were 90 and 10  %, with large reductions in tumor RNA <b>content</b> and <b>integrity</b> following treatment; Schedule B results were 93 and 0  %, with smaller reductions in RNA quality.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen the use of photo {{response}} non-uniformity noise (PRNU), a unique fingerprint of imaging sensors, in various digital forensic applications such as source device identification, <b>content</b> <b>integrity</b> verification and authentication. However, {{the use of a}} colour filter array for capturing only one of the three colour components per pixel introduces colour interpolation noise, while the existing methods for extracting PRNU provide no effective means for addressing this issue. Because the artificial colours obtained through the colour interpolation process is not directly acquired from the scene by physical hardware, we expect that the PRNU extracted from the physical components, which are free from interpolation noise, should be more reliable than that from the artificial channels, which carry interpolation noise. Based on this assumption we propose a Couple-Decoupled PRNU (CD-PRNU) extraction method, which first decomposes each colour channel into 4 sub-images and then extracts the PRNU noise from each sub-image. The PRNU noise patterns of the sub-images are then assembled to get the CD-PRNU.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of broadcast/multicast systems, like DVB-H, large scale content {{broadcasting}} is becoming a key technology. This type of data distribution scheme largely relies {{on the use of}} Application Level Forward Error Correction codes (AL-FEC), not only to recover from erasures but also to improve the content broadcasting scheme itself (e. g. FLUTE/ALC). This work focuses on the LDPC-staircase large block FEC codes that are well suited to these services, and for which an open source codec is available. We believe that sooner or later these broadcasting systems will require security services. Therefore, the current work focuses on the <b>content</b> <b>integrity</b> service, {{which is one of the}} key security building blocks. More and more often (and in particular in the context of DVB-H), the client terminal will be a handheld autonomous device with limited battery capacity. In order to save the client terminal resources, we have focused on a hybrid system that merges the FEC decoding and <b>content</b> <b>integrity</b> verification services. This hybrid system takes advantage of a corruption propagation phenomenon during the FEC decoding process in order to perform integrity verification. Thanks to this approach, we have been able to design a high performance hybrid codec that keeps the same erasure recovery capabilities of the LDPC-staircase codes while providing a <b>Content</b> <b>Integrity</b> Verification service almost for free. More precisely this system can detect an object corruption triggered by deliberate attacks or by transmission errors (not detected by lower layer protocols) with a very high probability (close to 100 %) with a processing overhead that is only a minimal fraction (around 6. 2 %) of the overhead of a hash calculation over the whole object, which is the usual way to address the problem.
