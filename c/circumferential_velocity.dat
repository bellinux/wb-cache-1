50|$|A small {{percentage}} slip {{can result in}} a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance. This is partly because the tractive force applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall power = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a {{small percentage}} increase in <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.|$|E

The effects of principal flow variables, i. e., mean axial velocity and fluid temperature, annular passage configurations, i. e., the gap width and radii of cylinders on the pressure and <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> of a three dimensional turbulent flow in the annular passage were investigated. The results were validated with the available solutions in the literature and fairly good agreements are seen. By increasing the gap of the annular passage and the axial flow velocity, smaller values for the unsteady pressure and the <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> amplitudes are produced.

The magnitude of shear stress at the wall is enhanced, suggesting that, if applied to vascular system, the vascular wall could be prone to ulceration during pathological situations like polycythemia.

40|$|An {{analysis}} for helically-grooved turbulent annular seals is developed to predict leakage and dynamic coefficients, {{as related to}} rotordynamics. The grooved surface pattern is formulated as an inhomogeneous directivity in surface shear stress. The zeroth-order equations define the steady-state leakage and the <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> development due to wall shear for a centered rotor position. The first-order equations define perturbations in the pressure and axial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> fields due to small motion of the rotor about the centered position. Numerical results are presented for proposed grooved seals in the High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPTOP) of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and for a water-pump application.

Further, a properly designed helically-grooved stator is predicted to have pronounced stability advantages over other currently used seals...|$|E

The Invar alloy has been deformed by asymmetrical rolling with a 84 % thickness reduction. The texture of the deformed and annealed alloy was measured by X-ray diffraction at different levels through the thickness: upper side- middle- down side, with unidirectional rolling. The deformed texture is a copper type texture but the components were rotated about 5 - 7 ° around the Transverse Direction (TD) axis {{as compared to the}} ideal position of these components in the pole figure representation. During recrystallization, the rolling components (brass { 011 },copper { 112 }, aluminum { 123 }) decrease quickly whereas the cube component { 001 } is preferentially developed after a short annealing time. However, the rolling components do not disappear completely after complete recrystallization (120 minutes annealing).

The peak core <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity</b> is constant during vortex formation. Peak core axial velocity tends towards tip-speed near the blade tip. In the near wake, the variation in core axial velocity exhibits a periodic behavior.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} cost {{pressure}} {{in the field of}} aviation, the further increase in effciency is in the focus of development. Nowadays, airfoils are highly developed and optimized. Thus, new sophisticated approaches, additional configurations and physical effects at lift generation devices have to be explored in order to further reduce drag and significantly increase lift. Focal point of these considerations is the Magnus effect, in which rotating cylinders generate a lift force. This has already been investigated in the past, in particular, different kinds of surface roughnesses, special rotor geometries, ratios of <b>circumferential</b> speed <b>velocity</b> to free stream velocity, or the effect of end plates have been considered. The Scottish engineer A. Thom achieved a significant increase of the performance by adding so called Thom discs coaxially and equidistantly mounted on the cylinder.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{based on a}} transformed, conservative form of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and an analytical model based on lumped fluid parameters are presented and compared with studies of modeled rotor bearing seal systems. The rotor destabilizing factors {{are related to the}} rotative character of the flow field. It is shown that these destabilizing factors can be reduced through a decrease in the fluid average <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity.</b> However, the rotative character of the flow field is a complex three dimensional system with bifurcated secondary flow patterns that significantly alter the fluid <b>circumferential</b> <b>velocity.</b> By transforming the Navier-Stokes equations to those for a rotating observer and using the numerical code PHOENICS- 84 with a nonorthogonal body fitted grid, several numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the character of this complex flow field. In general, fluid injection and/or preswirl of the flow field opposing the shaft rotation significantly intensified these secondary recirculation zones and thus reduced the average circumferential velocity; injection or preswirl in the direction of rotation significantly weakened these zones...|$|E

When two electrodes were positioned parallel to and near to the greater curvature, slow waves were first detected at the oral site and subsequently at the anal site: the oro-anal conduction velocity was found to be 2. 5 mm s− 1. When one electrode was positioned near the greater curvature and the other at a circumferential location, slow waves were first detected near the greater curvature and subsequently at the circumferential site: the <b>circumferential</b> conduction <b>velocity</b> was 13. 9 mm s− 1. When recordings {{were made from}} preparations in which the circular muscle layer had been removed, the oro-anal and the <b>circumferential</b> conduction <b>velocities</b> were both about 3. 5 mm s− 1. When slow waves were recorded from preparations in which much of the myenteric network of antral interstitial cells (ICCMY) had been dissected away, slow waves were first detected near the region of intact ICCMY and subsequently at a circumferential location: the <b>circumferential</b> conduction <b>velocity</b> of slow waves in regions devoid of ICCMY was 14. 7 mm s− 1. When the electrical properties of isolated single bundles of circular muscle were determined, their length constants were about 3 mm and their time constant about 230 ms, giving an asymptotic electrotonic propagation velocity of 25 mm s− 1. Oro-anal electrical coupling between adjacent bundles of circular muscle was found to vary widely: some bundles were well connected to neighbouring bundles whereas others were not. Together the observations suggest that the slow oro-anal progression of slow waves results from a slow conduction velocity of pacemaker potentials in the myenteric network of interstitial cells. The rapid circumferential conduction of slow waves results from the electrical properties of the circular muscle layer which allow intramuscular ICC (ICCIM) to support the radial spread of slow waves: regions of high resistance between bundles prevent the anally directed spread of slow waves within the circular layer...|$|R

The ideal shear deformation texture of fcc metals can be approximated by the // ND and { 001 } orientations, among which the former improves the deep drawability. The ideal shear deformation texture for bcc metals can be approximated by the Goss { 110 } and { 112 } orientations, among which the former improves the magnetic permeability along the directions and is the prime orientation in grain oriented silicon steels. The intense shear strains can result in the grain refinement and hence improve echanical properties. Steel sheets, especially ferritic stainless steel sheets, and luminum alloy sheets may exhibit an undesirable surface roughening known as ridging or roping, when elongated along RD and TD, respectively. The ridging or roping is caused by differently oriented colonies, which are resulted from the oriented columnar structure in ingots or billets, especially for ferritic stainless steels, that is not easily destroyed by the conventional rolling. The breakdown of columnar structure and the grain refinement can be achieved by asymmetric rolling, resulting in a decrease in the ridging problem...|$|R
