25|$|In 1892 Alberta {{adopted the}} Ontario schools model, {{emphasizing}} state-run institutions that glorified {{not only the}} English language but English history and customs as well. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Française de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; {{the majority of those}} hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and <b>culture</b> <b>issues</b> of francophones.|$|E

500|$|Baker {{is known}} to chime in on popular <b>culture</b> <b>issues</b> from time-to-time: in 2015, Boston Magazine wrote a piece on the Governor's music preferences, stating that Baker [...] "is shamelessly Top 40 in his tastes, stuck mostly in the classic rock that {{dominated}} radio of his teens and twenties, aka the 1970s and ’80s" [...] but holding [...] "a deep knowledge and appreciation for the Ramones, Green Day, and the Dropkick Murphys." [...] That same year, the Governor, a lifelong Star Wars fan, [...] admitted to not being {{a fan of the}} prequels nor the sequels that follow the original trilogy.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, WMATA {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} for a neglect of safety in both its rail and bus systems. Problems include failures {{within the system}} designed to prevent train collisions and escalators failing or breaking apart while in service. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended that WMATA invest $1 billion in needed safety improvements. A December 2008 report by the WMATA Inspector General documented that Metro's System Safety and Risk Management Office was bypassed when changes were made to Metrorail's operating procedures, even though that office's review and approval was required {{as a matter of}} policy. On June 22, 2009, two Metrorail trains collided between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro stations, killing nine. [...] In February 2011, the National Transportation Safety Board conducted a public hearing during which witnesses testified about problems with the safety culture at WMATA. [...] The NTSB's final report on the accident commented that [...] "he failure of WMATA engineers and technicians or managers to properly address track circuit anomalies is symptomatic of the larger safety <b>culture</b> <b>issues</b> within the organization." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Steiner's career spans half a century. He has {{published}} original essays and books {{that address the}} anomalies of contemporary Western <b>culture,</b> <b>issues</b> of language and its [...] "debasement" [...] in the post-Holocaust age.

[...] He further added that Acts 29 leaders did not contact Mars Hill before acting, and that Driscoll had [...] "changed his ways", and described Acts 29's actions as [...] "divisive." [...] Van Skaik also addressed the formal charges brought against Driscoll under the Mars Hill bylaws, writing [...] "the formal charges that were filed were serious, were taken seriously, and were not dismissed by the board lightly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{finished}} product was a 20-by-20inch oil {{painting of a}} man {{sitting in a chair}} in an all-white room with his back facing the audience. The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our <b>culture.</b> <b>Issues</b> such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just a guy who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm. The minimal white area surrounding the figure is more important than the figure itself, being that it can represent health or paranoia." [...] The image is repeated on the disc itself.|$|E
