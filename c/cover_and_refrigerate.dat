5000|$|In making tocino in the Philippines, {{the pork}} belly meat is first sliced into thin strips. Anise wine, annatto, water, sugar, and salt are then {{combined}} {{in a container}} to make a mixture. Each of the meat strips is then sprinkled with the mixture and then stacked in a separate container, which is then <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> kept <b>refrigerated</b> for about three days to cure.|$|R
5000|$|Basics: The {{mixture is}} simmered gently over low heat, and stirred often to prevent {{scorching}} {{until all the}} liquid is cooked off and the mixture is thick. It is then allowed to cool, then stirred again to incorporate all the rendered fat, and transferred to a large clean container or individual containers, <b>covered</b> tightly <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> for several hours or overnight until firm. Pig marrow is also often added in order to form a gelatin that allows it to congeal.|$|R
40|$|Background: Tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) {{in blood}} {{might be a}} helpful biomarker in various diseases. However, various authors report that TIMP- 1 is dependent on preanalytical procedures. Our study was performed to determine how storage conditions and time to centrifugation influence TIMP- 1. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six blood specimens were collected from each of 20 volunteers. Two specimens from each person were centrifuged/measured within 1 h after venipuncture and frozen at - 80 degrees C. They were thawed once or twice within 72 h. Eight specimens were stored at 20 degrees C in daylight, 8 at 20 degrees C <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> 8 at 4 C in daylight. Four {{of each of these}} 8 specimens were mixed once a day until centrifugation. A mixed and an unmixed specimen of each group was centrifuged/measured after 3, 6, 24 and 72 h. Results: TIMP- 1 increased after freeze/ thaw (p < 0. 001). Mixing blood specimens more than once caused increased TIMP- 1 (p < 0. 001). TIMP- 1 increased within 3 h of storage (p < 0. 001). The increase was lower in specimens <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: TIMP- 1 is unstable and has to be evaluated carefully. Blood should be centrifuged directly after venipuncture. For routine application, specimen handling must be standardized and carefully followed. Research should be done on specimens handled identically. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel. ...|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} {{consumed}} fresh, chestnuts can also be canned, pureed, or preserved in sugar or syrup (marrons glacés). Shelled and cooked nuts should be <b>covered,</b> <b>refrigerated,</b> <b>and</b> used within three to four days. Cooked chestnuts, either whole, chopped, or pureed, may be frozen {{in an airtight container}} and held up to 9 months. Because of their high water content, transpiration rates and consequent loss weight, the nuts react as fresh fruits (not as nuts). They should be kept cool at all times, including in shops when on display for sale. To preserve their freshness for a few months with no artificial refrigeration, the chestnuts can be soaked in cold water for about 20 hours immediately after harvest, after which they are dried in the shade, then layered in dry sand. Chestnuts behave similarly to seeds in that they produce very little ethylene, and their respiration rate is low, varying between 5 and 20 mg/(kg·h) depending on the temperature.|$|R

About 15 kg catfish weighing 600 - 800 gr each was obtained from a fish market in Pekanbaru. Two groups of dendeng prepared from catfish meat and the products were packed in aluminium foil and stored respectively at room temperature <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> temperature for 49 days.
