[...] He evolved from a local sewage contractor to a political boss by carefully selecting his political allies. His prominence stems from the death of Anton Cermak and his political career is intertwined with that of Edward Joseph Kelly.

50|$|The {{predominant}} psychoanalytic theories can be {{organised into}} several theoretical schools. Although these theoretical schools differ, {{most of them}} emphasize the influence of unconscious elements on the conscious. There has also been considerable work done on <b>consolidating</b> <b>elements</b> of conflicting theories (cf. the work of Theodore Dorpat, B. Killingmo, and S. Akhtar). As in all fields of medicine, there are some persistent conflicts regarding specific causes of certain syndromes, and disputes regarding the ideal treatment techniques. In the 21st century, psychoanalytic ideas are embedded in Western culture, especially in fields such as childcare, education, literary criticism, cultural studies, mental health, and particularly psychotherapy. Though there is a mainstream of evolved analytic ideas, there are groups who follow the precepts {{of one or more}} of the later theoreticians. Psychoanalytic ideas also play roles in some types of literary analysis such as Archetypal literary criticism.|$|E

In addition, it provides a straightforward option to capture classroom action for instructors who wish to deliver elements of the classroom experience to distance students. The student experience, which was assessed by an analysis of solicited (survey) and unsolicited student comments as well as quantitative retention and performance data confirms the utility of the technology for both face-to-face and distance delivery. In fact, some striking improvements in motivation (higher retention rates) and performance (final examination performance) were deduced from the data...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{participation}} of Colombian coal {{in the international}} market has depended and will depend primarily on price to compete with other potential international suppliers, if the strategy is not changed to compete. Therefore {{one of the most}} important factors to consider has to do with the cost of logistics operation, in the case of Norte de Santander. Objective: The main objective of this project is to make the diagnosis of coal logistics operation in Northern Santander. Methods: Basically the methodology used was the application of polls leading experts and entrepreneurs exporters of coal in Norte de Santander. Results: One of the most important aspects that mitigate the possibility of capturing value in foreign trade are high costs in logistics operation. The identified problem occurs in the absence of studies to characterize the international physical distribution of coal in Norte de Santander, the most representative for extraction Municipalities sector.

Insofar as we know them formerly, there will be a personal link during the screening of the film that will make us to appropriate it.

40|$|Based on {{the basic}} {{theoretical}} principles and the existing practices of community involvement into planning, the article explores the ways of improving urban landscapes of residential territories, especially {{in the process of}} housing renovation. Researchers of different countries increasingly focus their attention on adaptability of landscape in the process of housing renovation and identify the main actors in this process. Local communities are strongly motivated players in the process of improving residential areas, providing the planners and architects with the ideas for programming, designing and implementing diverse housing projects on different scales. At the same time, the local communities themselves get strengthened by consolidating their interests towards achieving common goals in the territory of their interest. Housing renovation process is a perfect sphere where local communities could express their goals of improving living standards in the existing area of residence. The main interest areas of local residents for better living space and the surrounding area are presented, where landscape is seen as an important <b>consolidating</b> <b>element.</b> As a physical resource, landscape is important for local communities for its recreational function in a close environment also in connection to wider urban landscape.
