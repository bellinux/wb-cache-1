50|$|On {{the second}} floor of the main block are three bedrooms, all with their {{original}} finishes. A steep, narrow stair leads up to the attic, where the original roof framing is visible. It consists of three heavy beech king post trusses with purlins and common rafters, about 16 in below the current roof. The two chimneys corbel together and form a <b>common</b> <b>flue.</b> At the south end are the remains of a small 6 by 8 ft brick room.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of two flues, the inner flue and the outer flue. The outer flue draws air {{into the bottom of}} the sealed firebox to allow for combustion. The inner flue draws hot exhaust gasses from the top of the sealed firebox and vents them directly to the outside of the structure through either an adjacent wall or the roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} type of heated {{platform}} appeared in modern-day Northeast of China {{and used a}} single <b>flue</b> <b>systems</b> found in the hypocaust of Ancient Rome and the ondol of Korean origin.

Its single flue is 'L' shaped, built from adobe and cobblestones and covered with stone slabs.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{dedicated}} low emission {{gas heaters}} {{do not require}} a <b>flue</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, {{with the introduction of}} oxygen depletion sensors and thermostatic controls, they do not place critical reliance on ventilation as had been the case. These heaters can be positioned more conveniently and centralised to affect optimum warm air distribution. By definition unflued low NOx gas heaters are 100% efficient as all heat energy released from the flame is converted to useful heat.|$|R

50|$|The adobe blocks {{are laid}} {{so that the}} joints are staggered. There is no mortar in the {{vertical}} joints to allow for expansion and contraction during firing. Rammed Earth and Mud Pile can also be fired, but must be fired from both sides because of {{the thickness of the}} walls. Building with stiff wet mud, like a potter, allows for thinner walls, and the possibility of incorporating <b>flue</b> <b>systems</b> into the walls. Arches can be formed by stacking non mortared blocks as form work, and removing them after firing.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding gas explosions, the {{greatest}} danger to the public from gas is Carbon Monoxide (CO), which is a toxic byproduct of the combustion process, in increased volume if combustion is incomplete. Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on safe CO dispersal through ventilation and <b>flue</b> <b>systems,</b> and prevention of incomplete combustion by regular service and maintenance of heat producing appliances, especially open-flued appliances. Modern gas appliances, especially those with fan assisted flues, are safer in this respect {{and the number of}} fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding gas explosions, the {{greatest}} danger {{to the public in}} using gas is from carbon monoxide (CO), which is a highly toxic by-product of the combustion process. Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on avoiding excessive production of CO through adequate ventilation and correct combustion, and the safe dispersal of the small amounts produced by correct combustion through effective <b>flue</b> <b>systems.</b> Modern room-sealed gas appliances are much safer in this respect and the number of fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined. Each year in the UK around 30 people are killed as a result of CO poisoning.|$|R
50|$|The stack was {{designed}} to discharge exhaust gases from the various roasting and smelting furnaces at the smelter. The stack is situated just below {{the top of a}} hill. The smelter had a large network of exhaust flues from the furnaces that all fed a main flue. The main flue carried the combined smelter exhaust gases a half-mile up the hill to the stack. The <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> and stack combined to provide a natural draft to carry the smelter exhaust gases, and it was claimed to be capable of handling three to four million cubic feet per minute of gas.|$|R
50|$|To {{economically}} manufacture a condensing boiler's {{heat exchanger}} (and for the appliance to be manageable at installation), the smallest practical size for its output is preferred. This approach {{has resulted in}} heat exchangers with high combustion side resistance, often requiring {{the use of a}} combustion fan to move the products through narrow passageways. This has also had the benefit of providing the energy for the <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> as the expelled combustion gases are usually below 100°C (212°F) and as such, have a density close to air, with little buoyancy. The combustion fan helps to pump exhaust gas to the outside.|$|R

50|$|The {{selectivity}} of CO2 in ionic liquids {{has been}} widely studied by researchers. Generally, polar molecules and molecules with an electric quadrupole moment are highly soluble in liquid ionic substances. It {{has been found that}} at high process temperatures the solubility of CO2 decreases, while the solubility of other species, such as CH4 and H2, may increase with increasing temperature, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the solvent. However, the solubility of N2 in ionic liquids is relatively low and does not increase with increasing temperature so the use of ionic liquids in post-combustion carbon capture may be appropriate due to the consistently high CO2/N2 selectivity. The presence of <b>common</b> <b>flue</b> gas impurities such as H2S severely inhibits CO2 solubility in ionic liquids and should be carefully considered by engineers when choosing an appropriate solvent for a particular flue gas.|$|R
30|$|This {{effect is}} only {{relevant}} for CCPPs {{and does not}} occur at steam power plants, because the condensate preheating in steam power plants is realized with steam extractions from the steam turbine instead of heat exchangers in the <b>flue</b> gas <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|Wet {{limestone}} scrubbing is {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>flue</b> gas desulphurization (FGD) process. In this process, oxidation of calcium bisulphite {{plays a major role}} both by determining the dewatering properties of the obtained sludge and the production of gypsum of high quality. In order to contribute to the simulation of the wet limestone FGD process, in the present paper a comprehensive model for isothermal gas-liquid stirred tank reactors has been used. Based {{on the assumption that the}} reactions are zeroth order with respect to gaseous reactants, the model requires appropriate physico-chemical parameters which are taken from the literature. The model was used to quantitatively interpret some literature experimental data concerning uncatalysed calcium bisulphite oxidation performed in a continuous stirred tank reactor. In particular, the model is capable of confidently predicting the transition from chemically to mass transfer controlled regime occurring when changing the operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{limestone}} scrubbing is {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>flue</b> gas desulfurization process for control of sulfur dioxide emissions from combustion of fossil fuels. Forced oxidation in the scrubber loop improves the dewatering properties of the sludge, leading {{to the formation of}} gypsum (Ca 50. 2 H(2) O). A literature analysis revealed that uncertainties on the mechanisms of the oxidation reaction and on the values of the kinetic parameters still remain. In the present work the oxidation rate was experimentally studied by contacting pure oxygen or mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen with a calcium bisulfite solution. The experiments were carried out in a well-mixed bubbling reactor varying temperature, oxygen partial pressure and sulfite concentration, in the absence of solid calcium sulfite and of catalytic species. It was shown that the rate of the process is controlled by reaction kinetics, and that the reaction rate is zero order in dissolved oxygen and 3 / 2 -order in bisulfite ion.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of wood biomass to generate district heat {{and power in}} communities that have access to this energy source is increasing. In this paper the effect of wood fuel properties, combustion condition, and <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> on variation in the amount and formation of particles in the flue gas of typical district heating wood boilers are discussed based on the literature survey. Direct measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions from wood boilers with district heating applications are reviewed and presented. Finally, recommendations are given regarding the selection of wood fuel, combustion <b>system</b> condition, and <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> in district heating systems {{in order to meet}} stringent air quality standards. It is concluded that {{utilization of}} high quality wood fuel, such as wood pellets produced from natural, uncontaminated stem wood, would generate the least PM emissions compared to other wood fuel types. Particulate matter emissions from grate burners equipped with electrostatic precipitators when using wood pellets can be well below stringent regulatory emission limit such as particulate emission limit of Metro Vancouver, Canada.

50|$|Not all {{available}} devices {{in the market}} have a flue gas treatment plant. But there are devices available with a dry <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> according to the rigorous European standards. Such a <b>flue</b> gas <b>system</b> mainly consists of a dry sorption system for SO2, HCI, HF, dust reduction, heavy metals, dioxins, etc. To protect the whole system, an automatic emergency water injection facility at the combustion chamber serves for the cooling of flue gas in case, too much waste or waste with too high calorific value is charged. Mobile incinerator units with such a system are environmental friendly. Many units are now offered with a Venturi Scrubber as the preferred treatment module.|$|R
5000|$|Chimneys {{varied in}} size. The <b>common</b> <b>flue</b> was {{designed}} to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though the often narrowed to one brick square, that is 9 in by 9 in or less. Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, and occasionally it would actually be on fire. Careless climbing boys could get stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks {{from the side of the}} chimney.

5000|$|Its {{interior}} cavity, {{leading to}} a (often) convoluted <b>flue</b> <b>system,</b> channels the hot exhaust from a firewood/coal fireplace, usually the cooking fire from an adjacent room {{that serves as a}} kitchen, sometimes from a stove set below floor level. This allows a longer contact time between the exhaust (which still contains much heat from the combustion source) and (indirectly) the inside of the room, hence more heat transfer/recycling back into the room, effectively making it a ducted heating system similar to the hypocaust system used by ancient Romans. A separate stove may be used for controlling the amount of smoke circulating through the kang, maintaining comfort in warmer weather. Typically, a kang occupies one-third to one half the area the room, and is used for sleeping at night and for other activities during the day.

50|$|The Frederick Francis Woodland Palace is a {{historic}} house located in Francis Park 2.5 mi northeast of Kewanee, Illinois. Frederick Francis, a multi-talented architect, engineer, and artist, began work on the house in 1889; while {{he and his wife}} moved into the house a year later, he continued to work on it until his death in 1926. The house has an eclectic design noted both for its vernacular interpretation of Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival architecture and its innovative engineering. The building's exterior design includes a hand-chipped brick exterior, a concrete tower above the main entrance, two porches on the south side, a solarium on the west side, and a gambrel roof. The interior's noteworthy features include a bedroom designed like a Pullman sleeping car, a system of levers which opened both front doors at once, a hearth with a <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> that also helped heat the house, a water filtration and heating system supplied by a cistern, and several secret compartments.|$|R

The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between type of <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with grate firing is considered. For this plant 10 different <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>systems</b> are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system,</b> starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack. The elements chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), cadmium and lead are considered. As a result of this work, two flue gas cleaning concepts seem to be very interesting for the construction of new plants: A plant with a wet <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> equipped with fabric filter followed by a two-stage scrubber system generates small amounts of residues by low investment costs.
