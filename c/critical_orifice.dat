40|$|The {{purposes}} of this investigation were to develop a method to evaluate flow properties of powders from avalanching tests and to detect similarities and relationships between these data and conventional powder flow properties. The API AeroFlow® automated flowability analyzer was tested using 6 pharmaceutical excipients. Data were presented as mean time to avalanche (MTA), scatter, and a classification based {{on the type of}} motion of the powder bed. Powders were also characterized in terms of particle size, particle shape, loss of weight on drying, Carr’s compressibility index, and <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter to prevent ratholing. A dual approach, which combines visual observation of the type of motion of the powder bed in the rotating drum with numerical descriptors such as MTA and scatter, was found to be more accurate in the assessment of powder flow than the current practice of using only MTA and scatter values. Statistical analysis established that there are relationships and similarities between the ranking of powder flow properties obtained from the avalanching test and Carr’s compressibility index and the <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter. An interaction between particle size and shape, both influencing powder flow, when evaluated with these methods was found.

Understanding the mechanical stability of airborne nanoparticle agglomerates under varied mechanical forces and environmental conditions {{is important for}} estimating their emission potential and the released particle size distributions which in consequence alters their transport and human uptake probability. In this study, two aerosolization and deagglomeration systems were used to investigate the potential for deagglomeration of nanopowder aerosols with different surface hydrophilicity under a range of shear forces and relative humidity conditions. <b>Critical</b> <b>orifices</b> were employed to subject airborne agglomerates to the shear forces induced by a pressure drop. Increasing applied pressure drop {{were found to be}} associated with decreased mean particle size and increased particle number concentrations. Rising humidity decreased the deagglomeration tendency as expressed by larger modal particle sizes and lower number concentrations compared to dry conditions. Hydrophilic aerosols exhibited higher sensitivities to changes in humidity than hydrophobic particles. However, the test systems themselves also differed in generated particle number concentrations and size distributions, which in turn altered the responses of created aerosols to humidity changes. The {{results of the present study}} clearly demonstrate that a) humidity control is essential for dustiness and deagglomeration testing, b) that (industrial) deagglomeration, e. g. for preparation of aerosol suspensions, can be manipulated by subjecting airborne particles to external energies, and c) that the humidity of workplace air may be relevant when assessing occupational {{exposure to}} nanomaterial aerosols...|$|R

The reaction chamber consists of a tripole operated with rf voltages generating an electric field only in the radial direction. An elevated electrical field is necessary to reduce clustering of primary hydronium (H 3 O+) and product ions with water molecules present in the sample gas. The axial movement of the ions is achieved by the sample gas flow only. Therefore, the new design allows a 30 -fold longer reaction time and a 40 -fold increase in pressure compared to standard PTR-TOF-MS. First calibration tests show sensitivities of up to 18000 counts per second/parts per billion and volume (cps/ppbv) at a mass resolution of > 8000 m/Δm (fwhm).

The sudden blowdown of a pressurized water pipe under temperature gradient generates a travelling pressure wave that changes from decompression to compression, and vice versa, {{every time it}} reaches the two-phase region near the orifice break. The pressure wave amplitude and frequency are obtained at different locations of the pipe's length. The value of the wave period during the first 20 [*]ms of the experiment seems to be correct but the pressure amplitude is overpredicted.

Previous calculations considered only the aerodynamic lens. The calculations also investigated the effect of operating the lens system at two different sampling pressures, 7. 8 × 104 Pa (585 torr) and 1. 0 × 105 Pa (760 torr).

The flowproperties and the tendency to arch formation over openings of three different biomass particulate solids, two cuts of sawdust and a dried ground olive husk, were studied. Shear testing experiments indicated that flow properties of particulate biomass could be measured by shear cells when the particle size is below 2 mmand that, however, particle elasticity or irregular shape could determine uncommon flow behavior. The pipe to arch transition was characterized for the biomass samples and a gypsumpowder in a new tester, in which the critical opening size for arching was characterized {{as a function of}} the consolidation stress.

Tests using secondary treated municipal effluent from the Mililani Wastewater Treatment Plant on Oahu, Hawaii, consisted of numerous plugging experiments supplemented by theoretical and laboratory studies. Tests showed that plugging, up to 25 % or less, can be controlled by using size emitters and passing the effluent through a stationary 40 - and 80 -mesh screen; critical-size emitters are 0. 03 in. for microjets and 0. 019 in. for monotubes; higher operating pressure further reduces plugging percentages; flexible 0. 15 in. slit orifices (at 15 psi) perform as well as the <b>critical</b> size rigid <b>orifice</b> but another round flexible orifice (rubber tube) was less successful; a multiple-inlet network design with critical-size emitters can minimize pressure and emitter flow variations along the drip laterals and was ideal for systems with large flow rates; and plugging was attributed to particles and fibers in the effluent.

In order to provide references for engineering practice, we examined the cavitation mechanism around the orifice plate and its influencing factors by utilizing mathematical analysis methods to analyze the flow conditions around the orifice plate in view of gas bubble dynamics. Through the research presented in this paper, the following can be observed: The critical radius and the critical pressure of the gas nucleus in orifice plate flow increase with its initial state parameter τ 0; the development speed of bubbles stabilizes at a certain value after experiencing a peak value and a small valley value; and the orifice plate cavitation is closely related to the distribution of the gas nucleus in flow. For computing the orifice plate cavitation number, we ought {{to take into account the}} effects of pressure fluctuation. The development time of the gas nucleus from the initial radius to the critical radius is about 10 − 7 – 10 − 5 s; therefore, the gas nucleus has sufficient time to develop into bubbles in the negative half-cycle of flow fluctuation. The <b>orifice</b> <b>critical</b> cavitation number is closely related to the orifice plate size, and especially closely related with the ratio of the orifice plate radius to the tunnel radius. The approximate formula for the critical cavitation number of the square orifice plate that only considers the main influencing factor was obtained by model experiments...|$|R

An aerosolization method, that resembles an industrial fluidized bed process, was used to aerosolize dry nanopowders. We produced aerosols with stable particle number concentrations and size distributions, which was important for the characterization of the aerosols׳ properties. Next, {{in order to test}} their potential for deagglomeration, a <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> was used to apply a range of shear forces to them. The mean particle size of tested aerosols became smaller, whereas the total number of particles generated grew.

Transmission electron microscopy imaging showed that most of the nanoparticles were still agglomerated after passing through the orifice. However, primary particle geometry was very different. These results are encouraging for the use of our system for routine tests of the deagglomeration potential of nanomaterials. Furthermore, the particle concentrations and small quantities of raw materials used suggested that our system might also be able to serve as an alternative method to test dustiness in existing processes...|$|E

Various laboratory and field measurements report that molecular iodine (I 2) and organoiodine compounds (e. g. CH 3 I, CH 2 I 2) are the most important precursors for reactive iodine in the MBL[1],[2]. However, the identification and quantification of reactive iodine containing compounds are still analytical challenges. Here, we present a new application of the time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (ToF-AMS) for the quantification of gaseous I 2 and ICl in real-time.

After passing the particle-sizing chamber, the non-refractory particles are flash-vaporized on a heated tungsten surface (500 - 600 °C) and then ionized by electron impact.

Cigarettes are smoked through a holder comprising a measured pressure drop across a <b>critical</b> <b>orifice.</b> The holder also contains a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and photodetector that measures light obscuration in order to estimate nicotine-free dry particulate matter (NFDPM, “tar”) delivery. All data are recorded on a puff-by-puff basis and displayed in real time. These NFDPM estimates are known as optical “tar” (OT), and are derived from the calibration of the OT measurement versus gravimetric NFDPM yields of cigarettes under a range of smoking regimes. In a test study, puff volumes from 20 - 80 mL were recorded to ± 6. 0 % of a pre-set volume, with an absolute error of 4. 7 mL for an 80 mL volume drawn on a lit cigarette, and an average error of less than 2. 0 mL across the range 20 - 80 mL.

A field intercomparison of the QC-TILDAS with a modified Thermo 42 CTL chemiluminescence-based analyzer was also performed at Environment Canada's Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) in the rural town of Egbert, ON between May–July 2008. Background tests and calibrations using two different permeation tube sources and an NH 3 gas cylinder were regularly carried out throughout the study. Results indicate a very good correlation at 1 min time resolution (R 2 = 0. 93) between the two instruments at the beginning of the study, when regular background subtraction was applied to the QC-TILDAS. An overall good correlation of R 2 = 0. 85 was obtained over the entire two month data set, where the majority of the spread can be attributed to differences in inlet design and background subtraction methods...|$|E

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 167 Particle size reduction {{is an important}} component of feed manufacturing that impacts pellet quality and animal feed efficiency. However, reducing particle size too fine often results in reduced flowability of the ground corn and finished feed, which creates potential handling and storage concerns at the feed mill and farm. The objective of this experiment was to determine how fractionation affected flowability of ground corn. Whole corn was received from a single source and ground to achieve 3 target particle sizes, 400, 500, and 600 µm, with actual results of 469, 560, and 614 µm. Each target particle size was fractionated into 3 fractions: coarse (> 630 µm), medium (282 µm), and fine (< 282 µm) particles using a vibratory separator (model LS 18 SP 3, SWECO, Florence, KY). Within each particle size, the percentage of ground corn as each fraction included: 400 µm: 57. 5, 32. 3, and 4. 6 % for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively; 500 µm: 64. 4, 30. 1, and 1. 80 % for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively; and 600 µm: 71. 2, 23. 2, and 0. 90 % for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively. When the target particle sizes were fractionated, their particle sizes were: 400 µm: 744, 269, and 94 µm for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively; 500 µm: 815, 253, and 96 µm for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively; and 600 µm: 898, 220, and 99 µm for coarse, medium, and fine, respectively. Fractionated samples were analyzed for multiple flowability characteristics, including: angle of repose, <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter, composite flow index (CFI), density, and compressibility. Treatments were arranged in a nested model with 3 replicates per treatment. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. When particle size was analyzed as a main effect, density affected flowability (P = 0. 014) with the 400 µm having the lowest density. However, when fraction was nested within particle size, it impacted (P < 0. 001) all measures of flowability, with the fine fraction (< 282 µm) of the 400 µm corn having the poorest flowability. In conclusion, reducing particle size resulted in the ground corn having poorer flowability characteristics, caused predominantly by particles that passed through 282 µm. Based on this data, producers may potentially grind corn to a lower particle size while maintaining flowability if fine particles (< 282 µm) are removed...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to deduce}} an {{appropriate}} shape and density for an electronic free-cell {{that could be}} placed into a silo so that position and other desired physical parameters could be recorded. To determine how density and shape affects the trajectory and displacement of free cells, the trajectory and displacement of cylindrical, cuboid and triangular prism free-cells of equivalent volume was investigated in a discharging quasi 3 D silo slice. The free-cells were placed at twelve different starting positions spread evenly over {{one half of the}} 3 D slice. Tests were conducted using a monosized batch of spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 5 mm. Tests were also conducted in a binary mixture consisting of particles of different sizes (5 mm/ 4 mm) and the same density (1. 28 g/cm 3) and a binary mixture consisting of particles of different size (6 mm/ 5 mm) and different densities (1. 16 g/cm 3 / 1. 28 g/cm 3). The rotation of the free cells was also briefly discussed. Computer simulations were conducted using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The simulation employed the spring-slider-dashpot contact model to represent the normal and tangential force components and the modified Euler integration scheme was applied to calculate the particle velocities and positions at each time step. One trial of each of the metal and plastic, cylindrical, cuboid and triangular prism free cells was compared with the average of three experimental trials. The trajectory and displacement of a representative particle positioned at the same starting position as the free cell was also obtained from DEM simulation and compared with the path and displacement of each of the free cells to determine which free cell followed the particle most closely and hence to determine a suitable free cell that would move {{with the rest of the}} grains. Spherical particles are idealised particles. Therefore tests were also conducted with a small number of polyhedral particles, to deduce their flow rate and the <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> width at which blockages were likely to form. Simulations were also conducted to test the feasibility of the DEM in modelling the behaviour of these polyhedral particles. Results indicate that for a free cell to move along the same trajectory and have the same displacement and velocity as an equivalent particle in the batch it should have a similar density to the majority of the other particles. A cylindrical free cell of similar density to the particles was found to follow the path of the representative particle more closely than the cuboid or triangular prism. Polyhedral particles were found to have a greater flow rate than spherical particles of equivalent volume. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEPSRCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The {{science of}} powders in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry is a specialised field and the particle size of a powder may influence its bulk performance, its tabletting properties and handling. During the synthesis process of an API, the crystal form {{is dependent on the}} solvent being used in the final stage of recrystallisation. Usually, the particle size is too large for use as is, in which case milling would be {{the next step in the}} production line-up. Milling of APIs can result in polymorphic phase transformations, contamination, and costly product losses through dust. The understanding of the physico-chemical properties of a given API is critical during the pre-development phases of dosage forms. This study investigated the feasibility of particle size reduction of nevirapine through rapid crystallisation (metastable, intermediary form IV), followed by desolvation and a subsequent phase transformation. The powder obtained by this novel method was characterised and compared with commercially available, nevirapine powder. The following properties of the two nevirapine powders were investigated: 1) Particles size and size distribution, 2) Particle shape and surface, 3) Powder flowability, using angle of repose, <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter, Carr’s compressibility index and the Hausner ratio, and 4) Solubility and dissolution rate. Tablets were also manufactured during this study by means of wet granulation from the two nevirapine powders. The tablets were subjected to the following tablet tests: 1) Friability, 2) Crushing strength/hardness, 3) Disintegration, 4) Dissolution, and 5) Weight variation. Based on the results obtained from the powder and tablet studies, the following conclusions were reached. Nevirapine raw material may be suitable for tablet manufacturing, either through direct compression, or through a method involving processing prior to tablet compression, i. e. granulation. Novel nevirapine powder posed flowability problems and would only be suitable for use if its flow properties could be improved by a granulation process. However, novel nevirapine powder may be the preferred API, due to its properties that could aid the dissolution of the final product. The results have shown that those tablets that had been produced from the novel nevirapine powder had several advantages over those, produced from the nevirapine raw material, such as better mechanical strength and dissolution properties. This study showed that small changes in the powder characteristics could significantly affect its subsequent processing. The change in the powder properties of nevirapine had proven this statement. There were significant differences in the flowabilities and solubilities of the two nevirapine powders, as well as between their respective tablet properties. Novel nevirapine powder had poor flowability, while offering better solubility values. Its poor flowability rendered the production of tablets by direct compression practically impossible. The tablets produced from the novel nevirapine powder showed advantageous properties. Further studies are, however, recommended in order to improve the flowability of the fine, novel, nevirapine powder and to further establish its promising potential to produce effective tablets without prior milling, as is currently being practiced.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the particulate formation mechanisms of a single-cylinder direct-injection two-stroke gasoline engine. The engine was tested at four operating points; an idle condition with a highly stratified mixture, a 2000 RPM low load condition operated with an A/F of both 30 : 1 and 15 : 1, and a 2800 RPM moderate load 15 : 1 A/F condition. The engine utilized an air-assist injector that was also used as a N 2 -assist injector to provide a slightly richer local mixture. Propane fuel was also used with the injector to isolate the effects of spray impingement and fuel films. The oil-to-fuel ratio was externally controlled to determine the lube oil effect on particulate matter (PM). A venturi-type mini-dilution tunnel was designed and integrated to sample particulates. It utilized a <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> supply that allowed the dilution ratio (DR) to be changed and a case heater to maintain a sampling temperature at the instruments. A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) {{was used to measure}} particulate mass and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to measure the number-based size distribution. The total particulate mass measured from the TEOM was compared to traditional gravimetric methods utilizing a Teflon filter and found to agree very well. NOx and CO 2 concentration measurements were made in the dilution tunnel {{to be used as a}} tracer to determine DR. Lubrication oil consumption (LOC) was found to have a large effect on the PM for this two-stroke engine utilizing a lost oil system. Not only was the lube oil the dominant effect on PM with the normal fuel-to-oil ratio, it was found to have a complex interaction that changed with engine parameters and not just increase the particulate mass by some offset at all conditions. It was therefore determined that the engine would be operated at a low oil-to-fuel ratio comparable to the LOC rates of four-stroke engines (oil sump systems). An interesting trend in particulate mass with injection timing was observed at both stoichiometric operating conditions. A local minimum in particulate mass was found for a fairly retarded injection timing. The size distributions near this local minimum showed that the particulates appeared to change mode. Generally propane injection resulted in a significantly lower particle mass. It was determined, however, that this is not entirely due to spray impingement. The fuel composition was believed to be a significant effect when using propane and accounts for some of the particulate mass difference. Temperature was found to have a significant effect on particle mass. The observed greater particulate mass for air-assist injection over N 2 -assist was likely due to higher incylinder temperatures. Analysis of the size distribution curves suggests that temperature strongly affects the small mode of particles. This corresponds with advanced timings, closer to a homogeneous condition. The local burning zone A/F had a large effect on particulate mass for very rich mixtures (retarded timings). It also has a significant effect on the large particle mode seen in the size distributions, believed to be elemental carbon particles...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Malaria is a life–threatening disease {{caused by}} Plasmodium spp and causes {{over one million}} deaths annually. The complex life cycle of the malaria {{parasite}} offers several points of attack for the antimalarial drugs. The rapid spread of resistance against antimalarial drugs, especially chloroquine and pyrimethamine–sulphadoxine, emphasises {{the need for new}} alternatives or modification of existing drugs. Artemisinin–based combination therapies (ACT’s) with different targets prevent or delay the development of drug resistance and therefore have been adopted as first–line therapy by all endemic countries. Proguanil–dapsone, an antifolate combination is more active than pyrimethamine–sulphadoxine and is being considered as an alternative to pyrimethamine–sulphadoxine. Artesunate–proguanil–dapsone is a new ACT that has wellmatched pharmacokinetics and is relatively rapidly eliminated; therefore there is a reduced risk of exposure to any single compound and potentially a decreasing risk of resistance. A few studies have been done on a triple fixed–dose combination therapy for malaria treatment and such a combination for artesunate, proguanil and dapsone are not currently investigated, manufactured or distributed. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a triple fixed–dose combination for artesunate, proguanil and dapsone. The formulation was developed in three phases; basic formulation development, employing factorial design to obtain two possible optimised formulations and evaluating the optimised formulations. During the formulation development the most suitable manufacturing procedure and excipients were selected. A full 24 factorial design (four factors at two levels) was used to obtain the optimised formulations. As end–points to identify the optimised formulations, weight variation, friability, crushing strength and disintegration of the tablets, were used. Statistical analysis (one way ANOVA) was used to identify optimal formulations. To identify any interaction between the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API’s) and the API’s and excipients, differential scanning calorimetry was done. Flow properties of the powder mixtures (of the optimised formulations) were characterised by means of angle of repose; <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter (COD); bulk density and tapped density; and flow rate. Tablets of the two optimised powder formulations were compressed. The tablets were evaluated and characterised in terms of weight variation, friability, crushing strength, disintegration and dissolution behaviour. Initial formulation development indicated that wet granulation was the most suitable manufacturing method. The results from the factorial design indicated that different amounts (% w/w) of the lubricant and binder as well as two different fillers influenced the weight variation, crushing strength and disintegration statistically significant. Two formulations containing two different fillers (microcrystalline cellulose or Avicel® PH 101, and lactose or Granulac® 200) were found to be within specifications and ideal for manufacturing. Tablets prepared from the FA formulation (formulation containing Avicel® PH 101) complied with the standards and guidelines for weight variation, friability, crushing strength and disintegration as set by the British Pharmacopoeia (BP). Tablets had an average crushing strength of 121. 56 ± 0. 022 N. Tablets disintegrated within 52. 00 seconds and a maximum weight loss of 0. 68 % occurred during the friability test. Weight variation of the tablets prepared from the FG formulation (formulation containing Granulac® 200) complied with the standards. Average crushing strength was 91. 99 ± 6. 008 N and the tablets disintegrated within 140. 00 seconds. Percentage friability (1. 024 %) did not comply with the guideline of a percentage friability of less than 1 %, however, no cracked or broken tablets were seen. Dissolution showed that 98, 93 and 94 % of artesunate, proguanil and dapsone were respectively released (of the label value) within 15 minutes for the FA formulations. Release of artesunate, proguanil and dapsone for the FG formulation was 62, 85 and 92 % for the same time period. The release of the three API’s (the FG formulation) increased to 78, 89 and 92 %, respectively, after 45 minutes. Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Direct {{compression}} {{has gained}} significant interest since its advent {{in the late}} 1950 's due to its potential ease compared to wet granulation. The primary prerequisites for powders used in direct compression are (i) good flow properties (ii) good compressibility and (iii) an acceptable dilution potential to accommodate a relative high percentage of active ingredient. Several filler/binders have been manufactured especially for direct compression and co–processing {{is one of the}} recent methods used to produce good compressible excipients with acceptable flow properties. In this study, lactose–based filler/binders were used which included simple and modified lactose materials (Granulac, Lactopress, Flowlac and Tablettose) as well as co–processed excipients (Starlac, Cellactose and Microcelac). A comprehensive literature study on direct compression revealed the importance of the physical properties of filler/binders such as interparticle forces, particle shape, particle size and distribution, powder density, particle surface structure and particle packing geometry which influence the flow of powders. All the materials were subjected to the various tests available to evaluate powder flow, namely (i) angle of repose (AoR), (ii) <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter (COD), (iii) flow rate and percentage compressibility (%C) in terms of the powders' bulk and tap densities. The results of these tests confirmed the expected flow properties of the various filler/binders, with only one material exhibiting extremely poor flow properties. The following rank order in terms of all flow tests conducted was established; Starlac >> Microcelac ~ Flowlac >> Cellactose > Tablettose > Lactopress >>> Granulac. The co–processed filler/binders presented with superior flow compared to the other lactose–based materials. During the next phase of the study, the compaction properties of the various fillers were evaluated, employing direct compression. Compacts of pure filler were tabletted on an eccentric tablet press at different compression pressures (manipulated by the upper punch setting of the tablet press). The modified lactose filler/binders (Lactopress, Flowlac and Tablettose) exhibited unexpectedly poor compression profiles, where the co–processed filler/binders (Starlac, Cellactose and Microcelac) produced compacts with acceptable appearance and compact properties. Two lubricants (Mg–St or Pruv), which were tested separately in formulations were added since no compacts could be produced from the pure filler/binders. None of the modified lactose filler/binders, in combination with a lubricant, were able to produce an acceptable compact, since lamination occurred during compression. The co–processed filler/binders produced satisfactory compacts {{with the addition of a}} lubricant, but lactose–cellulose fillers (Cellactose and Microcelac) also required the inclusion of a disintegrant (Ac–Di–Sol) to induce satisfactory compact disintegration. Poor compressible active ingredients (paracetamol), which exhibit very poor flow properties, are usually difficult to use during direct compression. Many excipients (tested in this study) are formulated to accommodate these drugs and produce acceptable functional tablets. After identifying the best filler/binders (co–processed fillers), according to their flow and compressible properties, paracetamol was added to the formulations. During a pilot study, the percentage paracetamol these fillers could accommodate in a 400 mg tablet was determined. Both Microcelac and Cellactose could accommodate 24. 5 % w/w paracetamol, whilst Starlac could only accommodated 19. 5 % w/w. Paracetamol is well known for its tendency to cause tablet capping and lamination. An acceptable upper punch setting range (20 – 22) was chosen for tabletting, followed by quality control tests done. All three formulations produced suitable tablets for testing and exhibited good tablet properties. All tablets disintegrated within two minutes, with hardness profiles between 120 N and 148 N and friability percentages less than 1 %. Dissolution studies, however, are probably the ultimate test to distinguish between the capability of filler/binders to release the optimum percentage drug after disintegration. Dissolution studies were done on all three formulations using the AUC (area under the curve) and IDR (initial drug release) as parameters to evaluate drug release. All tablets exhibited high initial dissolution rates (between 0. 018 - 0. 023 mg/min/ml) and 100 % drug release was observed. Starlac presented with a lower amount of drug released compared to the other two, but can be explained by the lower percentage (19. 5 %) paracetamol present in the formulation. It was once again confirmed that the physical and compressible properties of potential directly compressible filler/binders play a major role in direct compression. It was concluded that co–processed filler/binders (Starlac, Microcelac and Cellactose) definitely exhibited better tabletting properties during direct compression. They were able to accommodate a certain percentage of paracetamol, although it was expected that they would accommodate a higher amount (at least 50 % of total tablet weight). Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The primary {{prerequisites}} for powder mixtures/granules intended for tableting is to posses {{the quality of}} (i) homogenous composition; (ii) acceptable flowability, (iii) sufficient compressibility; and (iv) anti-adhesiveness. The most important prerequisite for these powder mixture/granulates is undoubtedly the ability to flow, due to its effect on product quality, especially dose and dosage form uniformity. A comprehensive literature study on the flowability of powders revealed that flow is affected by physical properties such as molecular- and interparticle forces, particle size and size distribution, particle shape, particle density, surface structure of the particle, and particle packing geometry. Various flow tests are available to determine powder flow, each measuring a variety of the properties mentioned above, resulting in different flow results and a subsequent variation in the classification of powders. Particle characterization {{of a wide range}} of pharmaceutical fillers through SEM and particle size analysis, indicated considerable differences between physical properties of the various fillers, which suggested significant differences in their flow behaviour. Flow tests were conducted determining the <b>critical</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter (COD); percentage compressibility (%C); angle of repose (AoR) and flow rate (FR) of the fillers in the absence and presence of a glidant (0. 25 % Aerosil® 200). The results confirmed the expected differences in flow obtained from the various tests, with no one of the fillers achieving the same flow behaviour in all the tests. The difference in flow amongst the fillers for a specific test could, to a large extent, been correlated with specific physical properties of the particles within the powder bed. COD results illustrated the influence of particle size and shape and surface structure on the flowability of these materials, with fillers with a smaller average particle size, less spherical shaped particles and uneven / rough surface structures performing poorer than their counterparts. The percentage compressibility (%C) of the materials was affected by the shape and size of the particles and the density of the materials, whilst the packing geometry also affected flow behaviour. Particles with high density and a low internal porosity tended to posses free flowing properties. Powders with a larger difference in the ratio between their respective bulk and tapped densities/volumes presented better flow results. The AoR of the fillers was affected by the cohesiveness and friction between the particles as well as the shape, surface structure and size of the particles. This method was less discriminative in terms of indicating differences in the flow of powders with comparable physical properties. A further drawback of this method was the variation in results between repetitions, which is affected by the way the samples were handled prior to measurement. The flow rate (FR) of the fillers was predominantly affected by the density of the materials and the size, shape, and surface structure of the particles. Powders with a higher density seemed to exhibit a better flow rate, although some of the other factors affected the flow rate more when the densities were very close or identical. The following general rank order for the various fillers (as an average of their performance in all the tests) were established (with no glidant present) : Cellactose® 80 > FlowLac® 100 > Prosolv® HD 90 * Ludipress® > Emcompress® >Avicel® PH 200 > Starlac® » Emcocel® 50 M * chitosan » lactose monohydrate. Addition of a glidant failed to change the rank order significantly. During the final stage of the study an attempt was made to modify and/or refine the composite flow index (CFI) proposed by Taylor ef a/. (2000 : 6) through (i) inclusion of flow rate results in its computation and/or (ii) varying the contribution (percentage) of each test to the CFI (Taylor & co-workers used equal contributions, namely 33 V* %, in their calculation of the CFI). The results indicated that including the results from the flow rate test was not beneficial in terms of providing a more representative CFI (in fact it reduced the accuracy of the index). Next various weight ratios for COD, %C and AoR was used to determine the CFI of each filler, and an optimum ratio was found at 50 %: 40 %: 10 % (COD:%C:AoR) resulting in the highest CFI for each powder and the widest range for the CFI (largest difference between minimum and maximum values). This ratio was found in the presence and absence of a glidant. At this ratio the CFI discriminated well between the different powders in terms of their flowability. Lastly, the flowability scale for powders as used by the USP (20007 : 644) for %C and AoR results was adapted and fitted on the CFI results obtained for the various powders. This scale provided an exceptional fit for the powders both in the absence and presence of a glidant) and offered an excellent means for the grouping and classifcation of powders based on their CFI.
