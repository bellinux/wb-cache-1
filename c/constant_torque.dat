The proposed system provides mechanical characteristics with <b>constant</b> maximum <b>torque</b> or increased maximum torque and reduced slip speed at frequencies below the nominal frequency.

Performance analysis of the system under different operation conditions was provided. For this purpose, a standard state-space model of three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor, with respect to a synchronously rotating d-q reference frame was derived. The correctness and validity of the derived model of induction motor was verified. The inverter was considered as a static linear element and modeled through its input-output equation based on the modulation index. Three types of controllers were modeled, simulated and experimentally tested. The results show that both suggested control methods improve the system performance.

In particular, indirect FOC is a simple and highly reliable scheme which enjoys widespread popularity. To the best of our knowledge, eventhough indirect FOC works well in applications, no rigorous global stability proof for this controller is available in the literature. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} show that indirect FOC for current-fed induction motors is globally asymptotically stable for velocity regulation applications with <b>constant</b> load <b>torque,</b> hence providing a solid theoretical foundation to this practically succesful control technique. The stability analysis is carried out invoking [...] ...|$|R

Thus, if the top's spin slows down (for example, due to friction), its angular momentum decreases and so the rate of precession increases. This continues until the device is unable to rotate fast enough to support its own weight, when it stops precessing and falls off its support, mostly because friction against precession cause another precession that goes to cause the fall.|$|E
