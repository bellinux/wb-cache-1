5|$|The {{earliest}} vexilloids (flag-like objects) used in Poland {{were known}} as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum, that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal <b>crosspiece</b> attached to a wooden pole or spear. They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century. With Poland's conversion to Christianity in 966, the stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones. The royal banner of arms {{dates back to the}} reign of King Boleslaus the Generous (r.1076–1079), but it was during the reign of King Vladislaus the Elbow-High (r.1320–1333) that a red cloth emblazoned with the White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles.|$|E
25|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a rigid axle, rubber {{sprung from}} the <b>crosspiece</b> between two tall V-form legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage at the same points as the interplane struts. The axle and <b>crosspiece</b> were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} <b>crosspiece</b> {{of the central}} cross are back to back statues (géminée) {{depicting}} Mary Cléophas, a piéta and Mary Magdalene on one side with Saint John, a statue of the risen Christ and Saint Peter on the other. On the upper <b>crosspiece</b> are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers {{who were at the}} crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so he carries a lance whilst Stephaton carries a sponge as he was the soldier who gave Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes ("Christ lié"). Jesus hangs from the central cross and is sculpted back to back with an Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope.|$|E

5000|$|Papa hōlua are {{composed}} {{of a pair of}} runners and a superstructure (platform). The runners are made from hard native woods, traditionally that of kauila (Alphitonia ponderosa or Colubrina oppositifolia), uhiuhi (Caesalpinia kavaiensis), or māmane (Sophora chrysophylla). [...] The runners have up-curved fore edges, straight aft edges, and rounded lower edges. <b>Crosspieces</b> keep the runners apart. The superstructure, two rails smaller in diameter than the runners and spaced apart by pieces of bamboo, sits on top of the <b>crosspieces.</b> The runners, <b>crosspieces,</b> and rails are bound together with sennit cordage. The rails are wrapped in white kapa cloth and the rail frame is covered in lauhala matting. Oil from kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts coats either the course or the runners to provide lubrication.|$|R
50|$|The instrument, usually six {{to eight}} feet long, {{consists}} of an upright wooden pole topped with a conical brass ornament and having crescent shaped <b>crosspieces,</b> also of brass. Numerous bells {{are attached to the}} <b>crosspieces</b> and elsewhere on the instrument. Often two horsetail plumes of different colors are suspended from one of the crescents; occasionally they are red-tipped, symbolic of the battlefield. There is no standard configuration for the instrument, and of the many preserved in museums, hardly two are alike.|$|R
25|$|The {{image of}} the crucified Jesus Christ hangs from the central cross ("Le Christ à l'agonie") which is 10 metres high. On the <b>crosspiece</b> are statues {{depicting}} the Virgin Mary and John the Apostle. Two cherubs are on {{the arms of the}} cross. Two smaller crosses stand at each side of the central cross and from these hang the bodies of the two robbers executed alongside Jesus. At the base of the central cross is a pietà ("Vierge de pitié"). The sculpture of the bad robber with attendant demon are by Jacquot whilst the good robber was carved by Guillouic.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the <b>crosspiece</b> and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
25|$|Because the Mona Lisas poplar support expands and {{contracts}} {{with changes in}} humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used {{in addition to the}} decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after {{it was found that the}} beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal <b>crosspiece</b> was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.|$|E

25|$|Few archaeological {{specimens}} of helmets attributable to Byzantine manufacture {{have been discovered}} to date, though {{it is probable that}} some of the helmets found in pagan graves in the Ukrainian steppe are of ultimately Byzantine origin. A rare find of a helmet in Yasenovo in Bulgaria, dating to the 10th century, may represent an example of a distinctively Byzantine style. This rounded helmet is horizontally divided: with a brow-band constructed for the attachment of a face-covering camail, above this is a deep lower skull section surmounted by an upper skull-piece raised from a single plate. The upper part of the helmet has a riveted iron <b>crosspiece</b> reinforcement. A high-quality Byzantine helmet, decorated in gilt brass inlay, was found in Vatra Moldovitei in Rumania. This helmet, dating to the late 12th century, is similar to the Yasenovo helmet in having a deep lower skull section with a separate upper skull. However, this helmet is considerably taller and of a conical 'pear shape', indeed it bears some similarity in outline to the later bascinet helmets of Western Europe. The helmet has a decorative finial, and a riveted brow-reinforce (possibly originally the base-plate of a nasal). A second helmet found in the same place is very like the Russian helmet illustrated here, having an almost identical combined brow-piece and nasal, this helmet has a single-piece conical skull, which is fluted vertically, and has overall gilding. It has been characterised as a Russo-Byzantine helmet, indicative of the close cultural connection between Kievan Russia and Byzantium. A remarkably tall Byzantine helmet, of the elegant 'Phrygian cap' shape and dating to the late 12th century, was found at Pernik in Bulgaria. It has a single-piece skull with a separate brow-band and had a nasal (now missing) which was riveted to the skull.|$|E
500|$|The {{banner of}} Poland traces its origins {{to the early}} Slavic vexilloids known as stanice (pronounced singular: stanica), {{probably}} used at least {{as early as the}} 10th century CE. Although no specimens or images are preserved, a stanica was probably a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal <b>crosspiece</b> attached to a wooden pole or spear, resembling the Roman vexillum. It was both a religious and military symbol; the stanice were kept either inside or outside pagan temples in peacetime and were taken to war as military insignia.|$|E
500|$|Early cricketers {{played in}} their {{everyday}} clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes {{with the addition of}} a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single <b>crosspiece.</b> The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to [...] "give the ball air" [...] by pitching it. As a result, [...] "the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre-modern phase".|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a new insect {{infestation}} {{was discovered in}} the back of the panel as a result of <b>crosspieces</b> installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.|$|R
50|$|Electric cables {{running from}} the power station at Immingham Dock to feeders along the tramway were carried on {{distinctive}} masts along the seaward side of the GDLR's conventional line, lending it an unusual appearance.

The upper bulb has a [...] "beak" [...] attached which, along with the head, is covered in a felt-like material. The bird is typically decorated with paper eyes, a plastic top hat, and one or more tail feathers. The whole setup pivots on an adjustable <b>crosspiece</b> attached to the neck.|$|E
2500|$|Note 2. Yan Larhantec's {{restoration}} involved work on up {{to thirty}} of the existing sculptures and the three crosses were entirely his work. Only the two cavaliers {{on one of the}} central crosses' <b>crosspiece</b> were original. Larhantec strove to replicate the style of the Prigent brothers. The dedication inscription has been moved during the various restorations and repairs and is now located {{at the back of the}} base of the central cross. It reads ...|$|E

50|$|The wood is {{hard and}} heavy, with well-marked {{differences}} between sapwood and heartwood timber. The heartwood turns a dark color with oxidation. The wood is very weatherproof. It {{is used in}} the construction of boats, docks, truck beds, beams, <b>crosspieces,</b> stairs, floors, as well as woodturning. Sawing produces a pale yellow sawdust containing lapachol. The wood has tannins and dyes.|$|R
2500|$|Three crosses {{reach up}} from the upper {{platform}} of the Calvary, that involving Jesus Christ's crucifixion and the crosses of {{the good and the}} bad robber. Jesus' cross has two crosspieces, on the first of which are back to back statues depicting the Virgin Mary with St Paul and his sword and John the Evangelist with St Peter and his key. [...] On the second <b>crosspiece</b> are statues of two horsed cavaliers, St Longinus on the right of Jesus and St Stephaton, who reached up to Jesus with a sponge, on the left. These crosses and the statuary involved were created as part of Larhantec's restoration.|$|E
2500|$|The sign is a [...] classic {{roadside}} pole design, mounted offset on two flat poles {{which are}} joined by a cross piece at the top. The poles extend above {{the top of the}} sign. The sign is a horizontally stretched diamond shape, with the top and bottom angles pointed while the side angles are rounded. It is double-backed, internally lit, with a border of flashing and chasing yellow incandescent bulbs outside around the perimeter. In a nod to Nevada's nickname as [...] "the Silver State," [...] {{across the top of the}} sign are white neon circles, designed to represent silver dollars. The circles each contain a red painted letter, outlined in neon, which together form the word [...] "Welcome." [...] Crowning the sign, located between the two poles and just under the <b>crosspiece</b> is an eight-pointed, red-painted metal star outlined with yellow neon.|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War, {{prominent}} architects were {{requested by}} the then Imperial War Graves Commission to submit designs for monuments to be erected in numerous cemeteries. The Cross of Sacrifice, designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield in 1917, was chosen by the commission. The selection of Blomfield's design was made in part [...] "to emphasize the military character of the cemetery." [...] The monument is found in Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries with fifty or more interments. The cross is usually sculpted in granite, sandstone, or limestone. A bronze sword, described by Rudyard Kipling as [...] "a stark sword brooding on the bosom of the cross," [...] is mounted {{on the front of}} the monument, directed downward; together with a <b>crosspiece,</b> it forms another cross. A tall monument, the Cross of Sacrifice measures from [...] in height, and usually is positioned on an octagonal base.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engineers}} {{were able to}} introduce new designs, particularly for the Column stations of Marksistskaya and Aviamotornaya which were built without ventral <b>crosspieces</b> allowing a huge economy in time by abandoning the use of tubings. The shallow column station of Novogireevo further demonstrated its parting with previous centipede roots by increasing inter-column width from six to {{seven and a half}} metres.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 June 1763, {{the image}} of Our Lady of Salambáo (formal title: [...] "Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Salambáo"), was the last saint whose cultus was {{introduced}} to Obando.

2500|$|On the calvary {{platform}} {{are three}} crosses. We see Jesus {{on the central}} cross with four angels collecting his blood and on the reverse an [...] "Ecce Homo". Jesus has a horsed cavalier {{on either side of}} him and on the lower <b>crosspiece</b> there is a depiction of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, with St Peter on one side and John the Evangelist on the other, whilst on the reverse of these three figures there is a pietà in the centre with the Virgin Mary on one side and St Yves on the other. There are two smaller crosses, one on each side of the crucifixion cross, from which the two robbers hang. The good robber turns to Jesus whilst the bad robber turns away from him. At the foot of the main cross there is a statue of Mary Magdalene looking up towards Jesus and on the pedestal platform a [...] "mise au tombeau" [...] and a depiction of Jesus' resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|The standard, four-pointed Latin {{crucifix}} {{consists of}} an upright post or stipes and a single <b>crosspiece</b> to which the sufferer's arms were nailed.

[...] The Russian Orthodox crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief Saint Dismas (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief Gestas (to the viewer's right). [...] The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or low relief icon that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber. [...] They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and halo, and no background. [...] More sculptural small crucifixes in metal relief are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as pectoral crosses and blessing crosses.|$|E
