5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> to countermand laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia General Assembly is {{the oldest}} {{continuous}} law-making body in the New World. The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008. It is unique in how it treats <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{branch of the}} government is headed by a mayor and vice-mayor. As in other South Korean <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>counties,</b> the mayor is elected directly, while the vice-mayor is appointed. As of 2010, the mayor is Choi Yang-sik, who {{was appointed to the}} position on July 1, 2010 after winning the local election held on June 2 of the same year. He is Gyeongju's fifth mayor to be directly elected, the sixth to preside over the city in its present form, and the 31st mayor since 1955. Like most heads of government in the Yeongnam region, {{he is a member of}} the conservative Grand National Party.|$|E
25|$|The State of Colorado {{is divided}} into 64 counties. Counties are {{important}} units of government in Colorado since the state has no secondary civil subdivisions such as townships.

25|$|Aurora {{is split}} among three <b>counties</b> <b>and</b> lies {{distant from the}} {{respective}} county seats. A consolidated <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> government was considered in the mid-1990s but failed to win approval by city voters. The issue was reconsidered in 2006. Colorado voters created the <b>City</b> <b>and</b> <b>County</b> of Denver in 1902 <b>and</b> the <b>City</b> <b>and</b> <b>County</b> of Broomfield in 2001. A consolidated <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> of Aurora would likely include areas not within the current city limits, but the new city-county boundaries would be set, restricting future expansion.|$|R

5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> {{to set up}} industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
