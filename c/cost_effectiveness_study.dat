40|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>study</b> is {{presented}} {{on the use}} of c 7 E 3 in high risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The results from the EPIC study have been combined with cost data from The Netherlands. The study took account of the number of survivors without ischaemic events, and the number with neither ischaemic events nor bleeding (both measured after 6 months). It is estimated that the initial costs of c 7 E 3 and the additional costs due to the increased risk of bleeding are almost entirely counterbalanced by the savings, as a result of fewer myocardial infarctions and revascularizations. The additional costs per additional patient without ischaemic events are approximately DFL 5235. The additional costs per additional patient with neither ischaemic events nor bleeding are estimated at DFL 15, 685. Both figures are less than the average for similar procedures without c 7 E 3. Sensitivity analysis supports the conclusion that c 7 E 3 treatment is efficient. However, cost effectiveness could be further improved if patients are carefully selected...|$|E

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{emission control}} measures, usually calculated in dollars per ton of emissions reduced, {{is often used}} to determine which control measures should be implemented to meet overall emission reduction requirements. This seemingly simple <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> methodology requires making careful choices, such as whether to employ (1) user costs or societal costs, (2) manufacturer- or consumer-level costs, (3) emission reductions in non-attainment areas only or in both non-attainment and attainment areas, and (4) annual or pollution-season emission reductions. Researchers must also carefully consider how to determine baseline emissions, whether to use multiple-pollutant emission reductions, and whether to apply emission discounting. Because there are various ways to address these issues and because different studies employ different assumptions regarding costs and emission reductions, the results of <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> can be significantly different and can sometimes contradict one another.

40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} whether the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS), licensed at present for contraceptive use, may reduce menstrual blood loss with few side effects. If effective, surgery could be avoided with consequent resource savings. Methods : A systematic review addressing the <b>effectiveness</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the LNG-IUS for menorrhagia was undertaken. Results : Five controlled trials and five case series were found which measured menstrual blood loss. Nine studies recorded statistically significant average menstrual blood loss reductions with LNG-IUS (range 74 %– 97 %). Another showed reduction in menstrual disturbance score. The LNG-IUS was more effective than tranexamic acid, but slightly less effective than endometrial resection at reducing menstrual blood loss. In one study, 64 % of women cancelled surgery at six months, compared with 14 % of control group women. In another, 82 % were taken off surgical waiting lists at one year. No <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> were found. Discussion : Small studies of moderate quality indicate the LNG-IUS is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Costs may be less than for tranexamic acid in primary and secondary care. Although its use may reduce surgical waiting lists, <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> assessment requires longer follow up. Conclusion : <b>Effectiveness</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> relative to other treatments and the effect on surgical waiting lists can only be established in larger trials measuring patient-centred outcomes in women with menorrhagia. <br /...|$|R

Two producer profiles are considered: (a) producers who are pressured to achieve maximum reduction in odor emissions; and (b) producers who are constrained with limited financial resources. Both of these profiles are reflective of current situations for some producers. The results show that, as the scale fuzziness decreases, the preference of the first producer profile over the strategies from high to low is DCS deduster, pelleting feed, automatic oil sprinkling, manual oil sprinkling, draining pit weekly, and wet scrubber while the preference of the second producer profile is draining pit weekly, DCS dedusters, automatic oil sprinkling, wet scrubbers, pelleting feed, and manual oil sprinkling.

DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. SETTING: No restriction on setting. MATERIALS: Papers reporting on the <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> or <b>cost</b> utility of prevention of (recurrent) coronary heart disease by reduction of hypercholesterolaemia in adults. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty nine <b>studies,</b> most <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> analyses, were included. In 24 studies drug interventions only were analysed. Costs of screening to target cholesterol lowering interventions to persons with hypercholesterolaemia were considered in nine studies. Adjustments of {{the efficacy of the}} intervention for community effectiveness were described in seven studies. In four studies life years gained were adjusted for quality of life. Despite large variation in the outcomes, there is a constant tendency towards a less favourable <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> ratio for intervening in persons without coronary heart disease compared with persons with coronary heart disease and for women compared with men.

S. subsidizes marketing of nutritionally poor foods {{and beverage}}s to children. This study models {{the effect of}} a national intervention that eliminates the tax subsidy of advertising nutritionally poor foods and beverages on TV to children aged 2 - 19 years. METHODS: We adapted and modified the Assessing Cost Effectiveness framework and methods to create the Childhood Obesity Intervention <b>Cost</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> <b>Study</b> model to simulate the impact of the intervention over the 2015 - 2025 period for the U. S. population, including short-term effects on BMI and 10 -year healthcare expenditures. We simulated uncertainty intervals (UIs) using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and discounted outcomes at 3 % annually. Data were analyzed in 2014. RESULTS: We estimated the intervention would reduce an aggregate 2. 13 million (95 % UI= 0. 83 million, 3. 52 million) BMI units in the population and would cost $ 1. 16 per BMI unit reduced (95 % UI=$ 0. 51, $ 2. 63). From 2015 to 2025, the intervention would result in $ 352 million (95 % UI=$ 138 million, $ 581 million) in healthcare cost savings and gain 4, 538 (95 % UI= 1, 752, 7, 489) quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating the tax subsidy of TV advertising costs for nutritionally poor foods and beverages advertised to children and adolescents would likely be a cost-saving strategy to reduce childhood obesity and related healthcare expenditures...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical validity and clinical utility of DNA testing in people {{suspected of having}} hereditary haemochromatosis and in family members of those diagnosed with the disorder. Design: A systematic review. Methods: 15 electronic databases were searched up to April 2007. For assessment of the clinical validity of genotyping for the C 282 Y mutation in the diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis, studies were included if they reported the use of DNA tests in Caucasians of northern European origin with iron overload suggestive of haemochromatosis compared with a control population, and reported or allowed calculation of sensitivity and specificity. For clinical utility, studies were included if participants were Caucasians with iron overload suggestive of haemochromatosis or were relatives of suspected cases, if the study compared a diagnostic strategy incorporating DNA testing with one not incorporating DNA testing, and if the study reported patient-based outcomes or some measure of <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Results: 11 <b>studies</b> {{that could be used}} to evaluate clinical validity of genotyping for the C 282 Y mutation in the diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis were identified. Clinical sensitivity of C 282 Y homozygosity for hereditary haemochromatosis ranged from 28. 4 % to 100 %; when considering studies that used strict criteria to classify hereditary haemochromatosis clinical sensitivity ranged from 91. 3 % to 92. 4 %. No clinical <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> were found. Two <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> were identified, both of which suggested that gene testing may be cost effective. Conclusion: DNA testing for hereditary haemochromatosis in at-risk populations has clinical validity and may have clinical utility. The review highlights the limitations of the literature and the methodological difficulties associated with evaluating this genetic test...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of stroke is 2. 1 - 5. 2 % in bypass surgery {{patients with a}} mortality of 0 - 38 %. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the {{incidence of}} significant carotid artery stenosis and its related risk factors in candidates for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: 1045 consecutive candidates for CABG underwent carotid artery Doppler examination in a prospective study. The relation of age, sex, smoking and diabetes as well as lipid profile and carotid stenosis was evaluated.. Results: In 1045 CABG candidates with the mean age of 60 years, the prevalence of significant carotid stenosis (> 60 %) was 6. 9 %. In the patients who aged 65 years and older, significant stenosis was 12. 5 %. Age of 50 years and above, female gender, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus are independent risk factors for significant carotid stenosis. Conclusion: Significant carotid stenosis has an earlier beginning in our <b>study.</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> are recommended for revising the previous screening protocols...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{transplantation}} {{of human}} organs and tissues saves many lives and restores essential functions in combination of high measurable quality indicators. In {{spite of the}} fact that organ transplants have saved thousands of lives and greatly improved the quality of life of thousands more, regrettably many people will not benefit from this therapeutic procedure. Methods: this review is based on economic evaluation studies published since 2000 and reviews published since 1987 for kidney, liver, lung, heart, pancreas, and small bowel transplantations that were conducted in 2010. Results: empirical evidence showed that the costs of organ transplantations have generally decreased over time due to improvements in medicine, while survival and quality of life have improved. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of transplantation has also improved over this period. Conclusions: <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>studies</b> on organ transplantations could contribute to the efforts of policy makers in maximising societal health benefits by managing society’s scarce resources. The differences between EU country are not only associated with different legal procedures but are also associated with social, organizational and several other factors. </p...|$|R
