5|$|<b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri,</b> {{also known}} as the Utila iguana, Baker's spinytail iguana, swamper or wishiwilly del suampo, is a {{critically}} endangered species of spinytail iguana endemic to the island of Utila, one of the Islas de la Bahía off the coast of Honduras.|$|R
500|$|Like most iguanids, <b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, eating flowers, leaves, stems, and fruit, {{but they will}} opportunistically eat smaller animals, eggs, and arthropods that inhabit the mangroves. [...] It has been observed eating smaller green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and geckos such as Hemidactylus frenatus.|$|R
500|$|<b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Norwegian-born American zoologist Leonhard Stejneger in 1901, {{while working for}} the Smithsonian Institution. The generic name, Ctenosaura, is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard". Its specific name, bakeri, is the Latinized form of Stejneger's friend and colleague Frank Baker, who was {{a former director of}} the National Zoo in Washington, D.C..|$|R
500|$|The Utila iguana is {{maintained}} {{in a number}} of zoos throughout Europe, as well as two in the United States (Fresno Chaffee Zoo and the Fort Worth Zoo), each institution serving as an ex-situ breeding center. In September, 2007, the London Zoo successfully managed to breed <b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> for the first time outside of Utila, an important step to ensure their survival if the species is lost from its natural habitat by hurricanes or over-hunting. [...] The population is currently stable, but future declines are expected {{as a result of the}} threats mentioned above.|$|R
500|$|Endemic to Utila, {{an island}} off the {{northern}} Honduras coast, <b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> is an inhabitant of [...] of mangrove forests. [...] Unique among iguanids and rare among reptiles, {{it is believed that}} C. bakeri was pushed into the mangrove swamps due to competition from the larger, more aggressive C. similis, which typically inhabits the drier habitats on Utila. It has interbred with this very species and produced viable offspring. From evolutionary and ecological perspectives, inhabiting brackish mangrove forests entails very specific adaptations of diet, behavior, and resource utilization. It is one of only two known species of lizard, the other being a species of anole, Anolis utilensis, that lives solely in mangrove forests.|$|R
500|$|In 1993 the San Diego Zoo {{experimentally}} {{tested the}} utility of a [...] "head-starting" [...] program for newly hatched Cuban iguanas with funding from the National Science Foundation's Conservation and Restoration Biology Program. [...] "Head-starting" [...] is a {{process by which the}} Cuban iguana's eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed for the first 20 months of their lives. The purpose is to get the animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators. This technique was originally used to protect hatchling sea turtles, Galapagos land iguanas, and <b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> on the island of Útila, but Alberts used {{it for the first time}} on a Cyclura species with the Cuban iguana. The purpose was not only to help the Cuban iguana population, but to test the overall effectiveness of headstarting as a conservation strategy for more critically endangered species of Cyclura.|$|R
40|$|The Bay Islands are a {{group of}} small islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras, {{comprised}} of three larger islands - Roatan, Utila and Guanaja - and several dozen cays. Due to the Islands’ Caribbean feel and inexpensive cost they have become a popular tourist destination for thrifty travelers and are a frequent stop for SCUBA diving enthusiasts. Major threats in the region are the destruction of natural coastal habitats by increasing coastal population and tourism developments and increased sedimentation due to extensive use of watersheds and inland deforestation. In particular, Utila has become {{known as one of the}} best diving sites in the world, placing further pressure on the island’s fragile marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Declines in island species such as the endemic iguana <b>Ctenosaura</b> <b>bakeri</b> have been documented, along with damaged coral reefs from various activities, mangrove deforestation, decreasing coral cover and noted fish declines for several fish species. This last fact may be particularly important given the large fishing community that has existed on the island for decades. 	Despite Utila’s small size, its roughly 8000 residents are a mix of generational Utilians, mainland Hondurans, and Ex-patriates who come from extremely diverse backgrounds, thus often making attempts to engage the community in environmental conservation difficult. In an effort to understand the environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Utila’s three main populations, an environmental survey was conducted in the summer of 2010. Results from the survey indicate that the majority of islanders recognize and are concerned with the decreasing health of the island’s ecosystems and resources. It was also found that though most individuals were aware of the island’s various environmental regulations, they recognize that the majority of people do not follow them, and that this is particularly true for fishing regulations. This finding and firsthand experiences led to an in depth look at the Honduran Fisheries Law and subsequent regulations related to the law. This paper presents the findings from the survey and also explores the possibility of using a community based environmental management approach to protect the island’s resources and monitor local fishing practices...|$|R
40|$|Ctenosaura melanosterna, a {{new species}} of spiny-tailed iguana, is {{described}} from the Aguan Valley and the Cayos Cochinos in Honduras. Its closest phylogenetic affinities are with C. palearis from the Motagua Valley in Guatemala with which it has previously been considered conspecific. Previous work on relationships within Ctenosaura presented evidence of a clade consisting of C. palearis (including the species described herein), C. bakeri, and C. oedirhina (de Queiroz, 1987 a, 1987 b; Kohler, 1995 c). Data presented here adds additional support for this clade. Alternative biogeographic scenarios are discussed, with {{the conclusion that the}} current range of these species of Ctenosaura in Nuclear Central America probably resulted from the fragmentation of a Caribbean versant distribution. Display behavior of the new <b>Ctenosaura</b> and C. <b>bakeri</b> involves head shaking unlike that seen in other Ctenosaura but similar to Iguana. Because of the highly restricted distributions of C. palearis, C. bakeri, and C. oedirhina and the new form, close monitoring of their conservation status is strongly recommended...|$|R
