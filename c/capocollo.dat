The meat is then salted (and was traditionally massaged) and stuffed into a natural casing, and hung for up to six months to cure. Sometimes the exterior is rubbed with hot paprika before being hung and cured. Differences with the breed of pig. <b>Capocollo</b> is essentially the pork counterpart of the air-dried, cured beef bresaola. It is widely available wherever there are significant Italian communities, thanks to commercially produced varieties. There is also a slow-roasted Piedmontese version called coppa cotta.|$|E

50|$|Two {{particular}} varieties, Coppa Piacentina and <b>Capocollo</b> di Calabria, have Protected Designation of Origin (P.D.O.) status {{under the}} Common Agricultural Policy of European Union law, which ensures that only products genuinely originating in those regions are allowed in commerce as such.|$|E
5000|$|This cut is {{typically}} called <b>capocollo</b> or coppa {{in much of}} Italy and Corsica. This name is a compound of the words capo ("head") and collo ("neck"). Regional terms include capicollo (Campania), capicollu (Corsica), finocchiata (Tuscany), lonza (Lazio) and lonzino (Marche and Abruzzo).|$|E

The principal salumi are the Salame Sant'Angelo, which has IGP status, and Prosciutto di Suino Nero dei Nebrodi; <b>capocollo,</b> guanciale, and coppa are also produced.|$|E

It {{is similar to the}} more widely known cured ham or prosciutto, because they are both pork-derived cold-cuts that are used in similar dishes. However, it is not brined as ham typically is.|$|E

In more recent times, the production of sausages is attested by statistics released in censuses of Gioacchino Murat, in the early 19th century. Among the most illustrious admirers of meats of this region is Giacomo Casanova, who is said to have tasted with particular enjoyment during a trip to Calabria, judging them among the best he had ever tried.|$|E

5000|$|On 8th Avenue and 28th Street, in the Chelsea area of Manhattan, (NYC), {{two friends}} from Italy decided {{to open an}} Italian deli, (Salumeria). A salumeria {{is a place where}} fresh meats are being {{processed}} and sold which are called Salumi.In 1925 they opened the business and called it Italian Salumeria Biellese-Groceries and Charcuterie. They made many of the Italian dry cured salted meats such as salame (Cured or cooked stuffed in an intestine casing), <b>capocollo</b> (cured neck meat made spicy and non spicy), mortadella (Cooked, baloney like meat with large fat chunks), zampino (Cooked, salami like meat, stuffed in the pork skin of the leg casing rather than an intestine casing), testa (head cheese.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on some typical {{traditional}} products obtained from Casertana pig, an autochthonous genetic type mostly reared in Campania in order to point out possible differences between genders during the ripening period. The products (<b>Capocollo,</b> Fiocco, Lardo, Pancetta arrotolata, Pancetta tesa, Prosciutto, Salsiccia, Sopressata) were obtained from 35 castrated males and 22 entire females. The pigs were reared in multiple boxes and slaughtered at 160 kg of live weight. The difference in ripening loss percentage between genders in salsiccia was not significant whereas the percentage loss of fiocco, pancetta and prosciutto was higher in castrated males at any time considered. Such difference {{could be due to}} different texture of adipose tissue as well as to a higher intramuscular fat content in females...|$|E
40|$|Fungi have an {{important}} role in the production of dry-cured meat products, especially during the seasoning period. In general, both industrially and handmade salami are quickly colonized by a composite mycobiota during seasoning, often with a strong predominance of Penicillium species. These species are involved in the improvement of the characteristics and taste, and in the prevention of the growth of pathogenic, toxigenic or spoilage fungi. During the survey of fungal species occurring on the salami surface and in the air of the seasoning and storage areas of a salami plant (Calabria, Italy), two Penicillium species were predominantly present. One species was identified as Penicillium nalgiovense, and the other was related to, but distinct from, Penicillium olsonii. Further molecular and biochemical analyses showed that this strain has high homology with the not yet described species named "Penicillium milanense" isolated in Denmark and Slovenia on cured meats. The taxonomic position of these strains in Penicillium was investigated using calmodulin, β tubulin and ITS sequences, phenotypic characters and extrolite patterns, and resulted in the discovery of a new Penicillium species, described here as P. salamii. A literature search showed that this species occurs on (cured) meat products worldwide. In our study, P. salamii predominated the salami and <b>capocollo</b> surface in levels similar to the commonly known starter culture P. nalgiovense, irrespective of the room or age of seasoning. Preliminary inoculation trials with P. salamii showed that it was able to colonize salami during seasoning, indicating that this species could be used as a fungal starter for dry-cured meat...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the microbiota of two typical Italian PDO delicatessens Coppa and Pancetta Piacentina, produced in Piacenza area (Italy). Classical and molecular approaches were employed, in order to acquire knowledge on their bacterial ecology and its evolution after slicing and MAP storing; thus, the biodiversity of characteristic bacterial community, already present or introduced during such procedures, was studied in both full ripened and sliced samples from two producers (A and B) of the PDO district, packaged under MAP and stored at 2 and 8 °C for 30 days. The microbiota of the two kinds of Italian delicatessen demonstrated peculiar differences, particularly regarding the staphylococci and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ratio. Moreover, some species within these two groups appeared to be linked to the kind of product: Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus versmoldensis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were found only in Pancetta while Lactobacillus pentosus, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus sciuri andMacrococcus caseolyticus occurred only in Coppa. Also, both delicatessens fromproducer A were richer in LAB compared to those of producer B and the opposite applied for staphylococci. Interestingly, Tetragenococcus halophilus was detectable in all the samples and its presence in the sausage environment has been reported only for <b>Capocollo.</b> Storage did not substantially modify the microbiota composition, the only changes being the relative abundance of same sequences; S. xylosus was prevalent before slicing process and S. equorum at the end of MAP storage at both 2 °C and 8 °C. Concerning microbial contamination during the slicing process, our results suggest that the adopted procedures assure high hygienic quality standard of these typical products, with exception of a contamination by Psychrobacter psychrophilus in Coppa B. The possible origin of species rarely or never reported in the sausage environment and detected in this study is discussed...|$|E
