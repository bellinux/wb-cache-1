40|$|<b>Cynipids</b> {{are known}} to use various {{reproductive}} modes (arrhenotoky, thelytoky and strict cyclical parthenogenesis), but the mechanism remains unknown. We have studied the reproductive system of a rose gallwasp, Diplolepis spinosissimae, which was found to exhibit two different reproductive systems according to the population. In eight out of the ten populations studied, all along the Atlantic coast, D. spinosissimae is thelytokous. Males are extremely rare, and all females are homozygous at three microsatellite loci. 'Obligate homozygous parthenogenesis' {{was found to be}} strictly associated with the presence of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia sp. In the two remaining populations, deprived of Wolbachia, D. spinosissimae reproduced by arrhenotoky as indicated by the larger frequency of males and heterozygosity of females. Allelic diversity, although not zero, was highly reduced in the coastal populations, as a consequence of thelytoky and gamete duplication. We hypothesize that mating of uninfected males with infected females during the first generations after an infection event could explain the small but significant amount of polymorphism observed in those populations. The high level of differentiation indicates a low gene flow, even between geographically close coastal populations...|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on the {{seasonal}} changes of aphids, particularly Myzus persicae (Sulz.), on hrussels sprouts {{and the importance of}} their natural enemies, from autumn 1968 to spring 1971 in the area around Edinburgh. M. persicae overwintered anholocyclically on weeds, particularly on dock plants, hut rarely on brassica crops. Plants in glasshouses also provided overwintering sites for M. persicae and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas). These aphids started gradually to infest the brussels sprout plants during the end of June in a constant but irregular movement. Both M. persicae and M. euphorbiae have no fixed patterns of population changes throughout the field nor from year to year. During early July the initially low densities of M. persicae and M. euphorbiae populations increased fast. By early August parasitism and predation increased; condensation of water droplets on the aphids also appeared in August and drowned some of them. Subsequently these mortality factors caused a sharp decline of the first peak of M. persicae abundance, and complete disappearance of H. euphorbiae from the field by mid-September. Favourable weather and reduced activities of natural enemies caused another peak of M. persicae to be reached in September. A slight drop in abundance occurred again, due mainly to parasitism; the third and last peak of a season appeared during late October and early November. The fall of this peak was attributed to the cold weather which reduced the rate of reproduction and hastened the abscission of bottom leaves which carried the aphid population. Eighteen species in eight genera of aphid parasites and at least eight species in five genera of hyperparasites were recorded. All the eleven species of primary parasites and five genera containing at least eight species of hyperparasites noted as parasites of M. persioae; and fifteen species of primary parasites and five genera of at least eight species of the hyperparasites listed tinder M. euphorbias were first records of any such parasites in Scotland. The M. persicae records as aphid host of seven species of primary parasites and two genera of at least three species of hyperparasites; and M. euphorbiae also as an aphid host of seven species of primary parasites and two genera of at least four species of hyperparasites were new records in Britain. Three and four species of primary parasites listed respectively under M, persicae and M. euphorbiae as aphid host were found to he new records in the general literature. Praon volucre (Hal.) was the dominant species of the primary parasites followed by Diaeretiella rapae Mcintosh and Aphidius picipes (Hees) which were about half and one third as numerous as the dominat species. Asaphes vulgaris Walker was the dominant species of the hyperparasites with <b>cynipids</b> about equally abundant. Some aspects of the bionomics of hyperparasites and primary parasites, particularly P. volucre, were given. Factors which limited the effectiveness of the parasites, particularly P. volucre, included 1. the fast developmental rate and the lower threshold of the aphid host (M, persicae) as compared to that of thep parasite (P. volucre). 2. hyperparasitism; - in 1969 and 1970 aphids on brussels sprouts were hyperparasitised respectively to the extent of 39. 4...|$|R

40|$|Received 23 September 2014; revised 22 November 2014; {{accepted}} 8 December 2014; {{final version}} received 9 January 2015; published 18 March 2015 We explore {{the impact of}} habitat fragmentation on interactions between keystone resources of forest trees—oaks, genus Quercus (Fagaceae) —and an associated radiation of specialist <b>cynipid</b> gall wasps. Habitat fragmentation is predicted to have bottom-up impacts on <b>cynipid</b> communities through impacts on host plant quality (plant vigor hypothesis). We explored the bottom-up impacts on <b>cynipid</b> communities of habitat fragment size, fragment edge effects and presence of isolated oaks. We quantified temporal and spatial variation of leaves produced in the canopy to quantify plant vigor, and surveyed <b>cynipid</b> gall species abundance and richness over three years using 15 permanent forest patches and 25 isolated oaks in a fragmented oak woodland landscape in central Mexico. <b>Cynipid</b> gall abundance and species richness were higher in isolated oaks and small woodland fragments than in larger ones. <b>Cynipid</b> abundance and species richness were also higher along fragment edges in comparison with fragment interiors. This contrasts with patterns observed in other taxa. In addition, host plant quality was higher in isolated trees, in smaller fragments and along fragment edges. We therefore hypothesize that observed patterns in <b>cynipid</b> abundance and species richness are driven by changes in host plant quality due to forest fragmentation. Our data represent a baseline for longer-term monitoring of fragmentation effects at a landscape scale. Further work is required to explore alternative potential explanations for observed patterns, including the estimation of potential top-down impacts of fragmentation mediated by natural enemies. J.
