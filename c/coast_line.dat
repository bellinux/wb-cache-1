5|$|The 43-kilometre, 31 station fully {{underground}} Thomson-East <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> will {{connect the}} northern region of Singapore to the south, running {{parallel to the}} existing North South Line passing through Woodlands, Sin Ming, Upper Thomson and Marina Bay before turning east and running through Tanjong Rhu, Siglap, Marine Parade and Bedok. The line will commence operation in five stages, with the first three stages starting from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay commencing operations between 2019 and 2021 respectively, Stage 4 from Tanjong Rhu to Bayshore in 2023 and Stage 5 from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok in 2024. The northern terminus of Woodlands North {{is also expected to}} interchange with the Singapore-Johor rail link to provide access to Johor Bahru and the future Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System. The Land Transport Authority announced on 11 August 2017 that the Thomson-East <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> will be the first cashless MRT line.|$|E
5|$|The {{main line}} then heads in a southerly direction, {{parallel}} to the Princes Highway {{to the west and}} bordering the Royal National Park on its eastern side until Waterfall, the last suburb in the Sydney metropolitan area.

50|$|The {{parent company}} of the {{independent}} Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>Lines</b> was the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway, incorporated in Louisiana on February 28, 1916, which bought the property and assets of the Frisco-owned New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railroad. The NOT&M was headquartered in New Orleans, and owned or leased {{a number of other}} railroads in Louisiana and Texas, operating them all together as the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>Lines.</b> As of December 31, 1916, the total trackage operated by the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>Lines</b> system was 1013 mi, including branches, sidings, trackage rights, and leased lines.|$|R

5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the previously announced alignment of the Thomson-East <b>Coast</b> <b>Line,</b> the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying whether to extend the TEL from Sungei Bedok station to the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and then connecting to the existing Changi Airport MRT station on the East-West Line. With such an extension, {{there will be a}} direct connection between Changi Airport and the city. Its length is still being decided. If feasible, this extension will start operating together {{with the opening of the}} new Terminal 5.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 to examine whether the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding <b>coast</b> <b>line</b> were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{fourteen}} stations east of Cincinnati had seen Amtrak service before. Tri-State Station (named {{for the states}} of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia) in Catlettsburg, Kentucky replaced an existing stop at Ashland. Amtrak built new stations at Roanoke and Bluefield. The remaining stops all used existing Norfolk & Western stations, {{with varying degrees of}} refurbishment and renovation. Two cities, Petersburg and Lynchburg, Virginia, had additional rail service at different stations. Amtrak's Florida-bound trains used the ex-Atlantic <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> Railroad Petersburg station, while the Southern Railway's remaining trains used Kemper Street station in Lynchburg.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with a consortium of railroads and steamship companies to merge the Chesapeake Steamship Company into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the Atlantic <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> Railroad, Southern Railway, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and the Chesapeake Steamship Company. As a result, the Old Bay Line took over the Chesapeake Line's business and assets and became the sole operator of passenger and freight steamship transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake Steamship Company, which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of the Chesapeake Line's steamboats, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond, were transferred to the Old Bay Line. As it turned out, these {{would be the last}} two vessels operated by the Old Bay Line when it went out of business in 1962. Robert E. Dunn was named president of the Old Bay Line in 1941, remaining {{at the helm of the}} company to the end of service in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Operationally and historically, {{the entire}} {{line from the}} Illawarra Junction at Redfern to its {{terminus}} in Bomaderry on the South Coast {{was known as the}} Illawarra Line. However, since 1989 CityRail has marketed the suburban services to Waterfall and Cronulla as the Illawarra line and interurban services south to Wollongong and Bomaderry as the South <b>Coast</b> <b>Line.</b> The line is coloured an azure blue on Sydney Trains timetables and other promotional materials.|$|E

5|$|The North Wales <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> is {{the railway}} line from Crewe to Holyhead, {{operated}} by Virgin Trains. Trains leaving Crewe pass through Chester, cross the River Dee into Wales, and continue through Flint, Shotton, Holywell junction, Prestatyn, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno Junction, Conwy and Bangor, to Holyhead, from {{where there is}} a ferry service to Ireland. Passengers can change at Shotton for the Borderlands Line, which links Wrexham with Bidston on the Wirral Peninsula in England. The Conwy Valley Line links Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog via Betws-y-Coed and was constructed mainly for use as a freight line for the transport of slate to the quay at Deganwy for export by sea. It is a scenic route with a number of request stops.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Main Line links London Paddington with Swansea, {{entering}} Wales {{through the}} Severn Tunnel.

The combined US 1/9 runs northeast through business areas as a six-lane divided highway, coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 a short distance after the merge. From this interchange, the road continues as a surface road with some jughandles, passing over New Jersey Transit’s North Jersey <b>Coast</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Illawarra Junction, four tracks {{head south}} through Erskineville and St Peters to Sydenham station. The 'main' pair of tracks {{are used by}} Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South <b>Coast</b> <b>Line</b> trains and the 'local' pair by Bankstown Line and peak hour Airport, Inner West & South Line trains. At Sydenham, the Bankstown railway line {{branches}} off, but trains from the Airport, Inner West & South Line continue along the Illawarra line until Wolli Creek, where a junction to the East Hills line exists. South of Wolli Creek station, a crossover allows trains from the 'main' pair of tracks to switch to the 'local' pair. This is used by peak hour all-stations Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains. The four track section ends at Hurstville. The line then continues as two tracks south towards Sutherland, crossing the Georges River via the Como railway bridge between Oatley and Como. At Sutherland the Cronulla line branches in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} German South-West Africa had been settled via {{treaties}} with Portugal (1886) and Britain (1890), but the <b>coast</b> <b>line</b> {{had not been}} surveyed in detail. Falke was tasked with locating a suitable port to connect to the capital at Windhuk. She departed Luanda on 23 January 1893 and arrived in Cape Cross four days later. The ship surveyed the area thoroughly, and discovered a Portuguese padrão. It had been placed there by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in the late 15th century. Falkes crew removed it {{to protect it from}} further weathering and placed a wooden cross to mark the location. The ship's crew received a period of rest from 14 to 16 March, after which time Falke steamed back to Kamerun, stopping in several ports along the way and arriving in Duala on 29 April. There, the stone monument was unloaded and later transported back to Berlin for preservation by the steamer , which departed Duala on 29 October. A granite copy, carried by the cruiser , was installed in its place in 1895.|$|E
