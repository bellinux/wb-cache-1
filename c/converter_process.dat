In December 1949 the VÖEST and the ÖAMG committed to building their first 30-ton oxygen converters. They were put into operation in November 1952 and May 1953 and temporarily created a surge in steel-related research. 34 thousand businesspeople and engineers visited the VÖEST converter by 1963. The LD process reduced processing time and capital costs per ton of steel, contributing to the competitive advantage of Austrian steel. However, errors made by the VÖEST and the ÖAMG management in licensing their technology made control over its adoption elsewhere impossible {{and by the end}} of the 1950s the Austrians lost their competitive edge.|$|E

The semi-fundamental modelling technique used involved developing a complete thermochemical equilibrium database of the system, and then using this in conjunction with linear systems models to predict the dynamic iron and sulphur concentrations in the matte. The thermochemical equilibrium database was developed using the FACT thermochemical simulation software. The generated equilibrium database was used to train and validate feedforward neural networks. This technique allowed the database to be used online to predict the matte equilibrium composition. The equilibrium matte concentrations of iron and sulphur predicted by the neural network were then used as exogenous inputs into two linear systems models used to predict the actual iron and sulphur matte concentrations.

40|$|Access to {{measurements}} is {{a necessity}} in most technical applications, in order to detect faults, monitor performance, or exercise control. In some cases, however, installing measurement equipment is very expensive or even impossible. In such a case, estimates can be produced instead. In an observer, this is done by combining process knowledge, {{in the form of}} an analytical process model, with information, in the form of indirect measurements. If the process model is in the form of a system of linear differential equations, then the problem of constructing an observer is essentially solved by the Kalman filter and the Luenberger observer. For a system of nonlinear differential equations, however, there is no generic solution, which is the reason for extensive research in this area for the past decades. This thesis treats the development and analysis of nonlinear observers for three applications in the steel industry. The first application is the detection of gas leakages in a pulverized coal injection plant. An observer whose residual is sensitive to the gas leakage flow, has been designed for a nonlinear process model. A Generalized Likelihood Ratio test was applied to the residual to distinguish between different types of leakages. The method has been implemented in the plant and tested successfully with actual leakages. Furthermore, a Laguerre spectrum representation of the residual was utilized, to reduce disturbances and computational effort. The second application is the detection of clogging in pulverized coal injection lines. An observer, with a state variable that represents clogging, has been designed for a time-varying process model. An adaptive threshold for the estimated clogging variable was calculated. In experiments with data from the plant, the method was shown to detect clogging successfully, without producing false alarms. The third application is the estimation of metal analysis in the steel <b>converter</b> <b>process.</b> A nonlinear, physical process model was utilized and an observer was proposed, whose feedback is weighted by the sensitivity of the output with respect to the state. Experiments with data from a converter plant show that this strategy provides accurate estimates of the carbon content in the converter. Furthermore, a generalization of the proposed observer structure has been analyzed in terms of asymptotic stability and region of attraction. Godkänd; 2001; 20061113 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of {{environmental}} regulations, optimization of industrial processes becomes necessary. This doctoral thesis summarizes the results of three application-driven projects in automatic control that were aimed at process optimization in the steel industry. The objective of the projects was to apply advanced control strategies to two important processes in steel making, namely pulverized coal injection (PCI) in blast furnaces and LD converters. Firstly, an LQ multivariable controller with gas leakage detection system for PCI vessels is designed and analyzed. Secondly, a foam level control system for the LD <b>converter</b> <b>process</b> using an audio signal for measurement is designed. Thirdly, it is attempted to create a single line flow control system for PCI using a video camera. In the latter two cases the conservative approach of inferring unmeasurable physical quantities from the audio and video sources is used. Moreover, all the designs are tested through implementation or experiments at the industrial plant. The control and gas leakage detection system ended up as a full-scale industrial implementation, whereas the projects comprising audio and video information is still at an experimental stage. Work with implementation and experiments pays off in experiences and further insights {{in the application of}} control theory, and reveals weaknesses and gaps in the existing theory. Thus, application-driven projects lead to practical solutions {{and at the same time}} pose new theoretical challenges. Consequently, this chain of events is favorable to both practitioners and theoreticians, and in turn stimulates the collaboration of industry and academia. Unfortunately, in many research projects this sequence is reversed which complicates technology transfer into industry. As a spin-off effect from the multivariable control project of the PCI process two topics are addressed anew. In the problem of measurement/actuator pairs assignment for decentralized control, the geometrical background of Gramian-based interaction measures is clarified. It is shown that weighted Gramian-based interaction measures can be effectively used for control structure design. In control structure improvement of multivariable control systems, it is shown that improvement potentials can be deduced from coarse models of the closed-loop system. Finally, in the projects comprising audio and video signals in control applications, it is concluded that the theory is rather undeveloped and that these sources should be treated as a multivariable system.
