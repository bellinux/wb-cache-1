5|$|Transport Scotland {{announced}} in June 2010 that three consortiums that had submitted expressions {{of interest in}} the project were to be invited to participate in a competitive dialogue; these were BAM UK, IMCD (Sir Robert McAlpine, Iridium Concesiones de Infraestructuras and Carillion) and New Borders Railway (Fluor, Miller and Uberior Infrastructure Investments). In mid-November 2010, the withdrawal of Fluor resulted in the third consortium pulling out of the bidding process. The second consortium withdrew in June 2011 following the decision by Carillion not to continue. This led to the cancellation of the tender procedure by Scottish transport minister Keith Brown. Network Rail was chosen by Transport Scotland to undertake the project and, following months of negotiations, a Transfer of Responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 November 2012 at the Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange. Network Rail agreed to build the line by mid-2015 for £294 million, an increase on the estimated £230 million that the line was expected to cost and the £100 million that it was originally costed at in 2000. This figure is also substantially more than the £189 million which Network Rail Chief Executive Iain <b>Coucher</b> agreed to build the line in late 2007 or early 2008.|$|E

40|$|Background: Couching is a {{traditional}} treatment for cataracts but often has poor visual outcomes, as identified during the Nigerian National Blindness Survey. Objectives: To investigate why couching is accessed by individuals with cataracts in northern Nigeria. Methods: The ten rural clusters in Jigawa State included in the National BlindnessSurvey were revisited to trace four groups of participants: cataract blind individuals, those couched or who had undergone cataract surgery and local <b>couchers.</b> Additional postoperative patients were recruited from the local eye department. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with cataract blind and cataract-operated participants, and 27 in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} those couched and five <b>couchers.</b> Qualitative data were translated, transcribed and analysed after immersion and reflection using a thematic framework. Results: Half of the cataract blind attributed the cause to spiritual factors or past misdeeds, only 25 % knew they had cataracts and 83 % had not undergone ophthalmic examination. Cost, distance and unreliability of services were the main barriers to accessing surgery. Facilitators of couching were the responsiveness of <b>couchers</b> in relation to location, timing and payment, and immediate visual improvement. <b>Couchers</b> understood local beliefs, were itinerant and used a network of case finders. Conclusions: Couching is accepted as it is entrenched in traditional beliefs and indigenous knowledge systems, and <b>couchers</b> are responsive. Lack of awareness and inaccessibility were barriers to cataract surgery. Strategies to improve cataract surgery must take account of local beliefs and factors influencing health-seeking behaviour. <b>Couchers</b> were willing to collaborate with professional eye care providers, but this will require time, skill and mutual trust.

25|$|<b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 1 (also called Landscape, Paysage, Landschap, or Sunset No. 1) is an oil {{painting}} created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). <b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 1 {{is a work}} executed in a mosaic-like Divisionist style with a Fauve palette.

25|$|Indeed, these clues {{would seem}} to suggest <b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 1 was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began {{painting}} portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 {{as indicated by the}} Kröller-Müller Museum.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled La danse (Bacchante) or Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape: (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title Two Nudes in a garden, 91.4 x 63.8cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, <b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 1 {{might have been the}} first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles <b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 2 or No. 3, the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: Landscape with Fountain, for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6cm; Paysage pointilliste, 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73cm; Matin au Parc Montsouris, ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7cm; or even La tour de Batz au <b>coucher</b> de soleil, 54 x 73cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905.|$|E

25|$|The {{height of}} Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, {{when he and}} Delaunay painted portraits of one another in {{prominent}} rectangles of pigment.

25|$|When in 1684 Louis XIV {{moved into}} the {{adjacent}} room to the south (the chambre du roi), this central room behind {{the facade of the}} avant-corps was designated as the salon du roi or the salon où le roi s’habille ("the room in which the king dresses"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the lever and the <b>coucher.</b> When the chambre de Louis XIV was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, and the room became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace. The king died in this room on 1September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the lever and the <b>coucher.</b> On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger's {{response}} in <b>Coucher</b> de soleil no. 1, {{in addition to}} illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors {{in such a way}} as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones.

5000|$|Baker {{was born}} at Barnstaple, Devonshire, in or about 1523, and educated at Eton College, whence he was elected in 1540 to King's College, Cambridge (B.A., 1544; M.A., 1548; B.D., 1554; D.D., 1562). He was {{nominated}} provost of King's College by Queen Elizabeth in 1558. Baker held several church livings and cathedral appointments; and he was vice-chancellor of the university in 1561-2. About February 1561-2 he was compelled to resign the rectory of St. Andrew Wardrobe {{on account of his}} refusal to subscribe a confession of faith which Grindal, bishop of London, required from all his clergy. Queen Elizabeth occupied the provost's lodge at King's College during her visit to Cambridge in 1564, and Baker was one of the disputants in the divinity act then kept before her majesty. In 1565 some of the fellows of the college complained against Baker to Nicholas Bullingham, bishop of Lincoln, their visitor: the provost was charged with neglect of duty in divers particulars, and with favouring popery and papists. The bishop gave him certain injunctions, which, however, he disregarded. 'By them the provost was enjoined to destroy a great deal of popish stuff, as mass books, <b>couchers,</b> and grails, copes, vestments, candlesticks, crosses, pixes, paxes, and the brazen rood, which the provost did not perform, but preserved them in a secret corner.' ...|$|R

[...] Later in 1559, the Queen issued her Injunctions, one of which required the churchwardens to deliver to [...] "our visitors" [...] an inventory of [...] "vestments, copes or other ornaments, plate, books and especially of grails, <b>couchers,</b> legends, processions, hymnals, manuals, portuals and such like, appertaining to their church." [...] In 1566, the metropolitan (Archbishop Parker) issued his [...] "advertisements" [...] ordering the use of the surplice and in cathedrals and collegiate churches the cope. The Canons of 1604, passed with strict conformity to legal procedures and legally binding with minor modifications till well into the 20th Century, enforced this same line. For about one hundred years, starting {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, the legal interpretation of the rubric was disputed. Anglo-Catholics pointed to it to justify their restoration of the traditional Eucharistic vestments of western Christianity in the Anglican Communion, whereas Evangelicals insisted that further order was taken in the Injunctions of 1559, the [...] "Advertisements" [...] of 1566 and the Canons of 1604 and therefore the only legal vestments were choir habit together with the cope in Cathedrals and collegiate churches. The use of the disputed vestments became undoubtedly legal in the Church of England with the passing of the 1969 Canons, but these stated that no particular doctrinal significance was attached to them.|$|R
25|$|In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré {{discovered}} a graphical tool for visualizing {{different types of}} polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere).
