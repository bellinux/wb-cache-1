50|$|One {{problem with}} using core on the DRTE machine was that core {{required}} fairly high power {{in order to}} operate. Providing such power from transistors, {{which at the time}} were low-power only, represented a major challenge. Although one solution, commonly used at the time, was to build the <b>core</b> <b>machinery</b> out of tubes, for the DRTE machine this was considered one more challenge in transistor design. The eventual solution, designed primarily by Richard Cobbald, was entirely transistor-based, and later patented.|$|E
50|$|Enhancers or cis-regulatory modules/elements (CRM/CRE) are non-coding DNA {{sequences}} containing multiple activator and repressor binding sites. Enhancers {{range from}} 200 bp to 1 kb {{in length and}} can be either proximal, 5’ upstream to the promoter or within the first intron of the regulated gene, or distal, in introns of neighboring genes or intergenic regions {{far away from the}} locus. Through DNA looping, active enhancers contact the promoter dependently of the core DNA binding motif promoter specificity. Promoter-enhancer dichotomy provides the basis for the functional interaction between transcription factors and transcriptional <b>core</b> <b>machinery</b> to trigger RNA Pol II escape from the promoter. Whereas one could {{think that there is a}} 1:1 enhancer-promoter ratio, studies of the human genome predict that an active promoter interacts with 4 to 5 enhancers. Similarly, enhancers can regulate more than one gene without linkage restriction and are said to “skip” neighboring genes to regulate more distant ones. Even though infrequent, transcriptional regulation can involve elements located in a chromosome different to one where the promoter resides. More interestingly, proximal enhancers or promoters of neighboring genes can serve as platforms to recruit more distal elements.|$|E

The <b>core</b> autophagy <b>machinery</b> comprising 18 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins in yeast plays {{an essential role in}} autophagosome formation; however, the molecular role of each Atg factor and the mechanism of autophagosome formation remain elusive. Recent years have seen remarkable progress in structural biological studies on the <b>core</b> autophagy <b>machinery,</b> opening new avenues for autophagy research.

50|$|Transcription {{factors are}} {{proteins}} that bind to specific DNA sequences {{in order to}} regulate {{the expression of a}} given gene. The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism's genome encodes transcription factors.Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. Often they are {{at the end of a}} signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Others are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation.Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the <b>core</b> <b>machinery</b> of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor.Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.|$|E

Recent identification of Mu-like prophages within bacterial genomes offers new material for evolutionary and comparative functional studies.

The components of its transposition <b>core</b> <b>machinery,</b> the encoded transposase (MuAHin) and the transposase binding sites, were evaluated for functional properties by sequence comparisons and DNase I footprinting. Transpositional activity of Hin–Mu was examined by in vitro assays directly assessing the assembly and catalytic function of the transposition <b>core</b> <b>machinery.</b> The Hin–Mu components readily assembled catalytically competent protein–DNA complexes, transpososomes.

This article outlines the general nature of the DNA replication machinery, but also points out important and key differences. The most complex organisms, eukaryotes, have to coordinate the initiation of DNA replication from many origins in each genome and impose regulation that maintains genomic integrity, {{not only for the}} sake of each cell, but for the organism as a whole. In addition, DNA replication in eukaryotes needs to be coordinated with inheritance of chromatin, developmental patterning of tissues, and cell division to ensure that the genome replicates once per cell division cycle...|$|R
40|$|SummarySalmonella stimulates {{host cell}} {{invasion}} using virulence effectors translocated by the pathogen's type-three secretion system (T 3 SS). These factors manipulate host signaling pathways, primarily driven by Rho family GTPases, which culminates in Arp 2 / 3 complex-dependent activation of host actin nucleation {{to mediate the}} uptake of Salmonella into host cells. However, recent data argue {{for the existence of}} additional mechanisms that cooperate in T 3 SS-dependent Salmonella invasion. We identify a myosin II-mediated mechanism, operating independent of but complementary to the Arp 2 / 3 -dependent pathway, as contributing to Salmonella invasion into nonphagocytic cells. We also establish that the T 3 SS effector SopB constitutes an important regulator of this Rho/Rho kinase and myosin II-dependent invasion pathway. Thus, Salmonella enters nonphagocytic cells by manipulating the two <b>core</b> <b>machineries</b> of actin-based motility in the host: Arp 2 / 3 complex-driven actin polymerization and actomyosin-mediated contractility...|$|R
40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{is the site}} of synthesis for nearly one-third of the eukaryotic proteome and is accordingly endowed with specialized machinery to ensure that proteins deployed to the distal secretory pathway are correctly folded and assembled into native oligomeric complexes. Proteins failing to meet this conformational standard are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a complex process through which folding-defective proteins are selected and ultimately degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. ERAD proceeds through four tightly coupled steps involving substrate selection, dislocation across the ER membrane, covalent conjugation with polyubiquitin, and proteasomal degradation. The ERAD machinery shows a modular organization with central ER membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligases linking components responsible for recognition in the ER lumen to the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm. The <b>core</b> ERAD <b>machinery</b> is highly conserved among eukaryotes and much of our basic understanding of ERAD organization has been derived from genetic and biochemical studies of yeast.

By {{now it has}} not only become clear that degradation of cytoplasmic constituents via transport by autophagosomes to lysosomes {{can be used for}} innate and adaptive immunity, but that the <b>core</b> <b>machinery</b> assists antigen presentation to the immune system by a variety of vesicular transport pathways. All of these rely on the presentation of small protein waste fragments, which are generated by a variety of catabolic pathways, including macroautophagy, on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In this review, we will point out how classical macroautophagy, as well as phagocytosis and exocytosis, which both benefit from the core autophagic machinery, assist in antigen presentation on MHC class I and II molecules to CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells, respectively. Finally to high-light that macroautophagy is always intimately interconnected with cell death in addition to the various supported vesicular transport function, its role in lymphocyte, especially T cell, development and function will be discussed.

Autophagy is generally considered to be non-selective; however, there are selective types of autophagy that use receptor and adaptor proteins to specifically isolate a cargo. One type of selective autophagy in yeast is the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. The Cvt pathway is responsible for the delivery of the hydrolase aminopeptidase I to the vacuole; as such, it is the only known biosynthetic pathway that utilizes the <b>core</b> <b>machinery</b> of autophagy.

40|$|Cell-matrix {{adhesion}} complexes (CMACs) are foci {{of cellular}} {{attachment to the}} extracellular matrix (ECM). This attachment, mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins, provides both physical and regulatory links between the ECM and the cellular microfilament system. Through continual regulation and rearrangement of both ECM adhesion and actin structures, CMACs constitute <b>core</b> <b>machineries</b> of cell migration. To fulfill this role, CMACs are exceptionally flexible and dynamic complexes, and their components undergo rapid and regulated turn-over to maintain delicately balanced streams of mechanical and chemical information. Besides the critical role of CMACs in cell migration, signaling through these complexes provides influence over virtually every major cellular function, including for example cell survival, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. This review depicts the roles of CMACs in cell migration and discusses how CMACs integrate with other sub-cellular systems involved in cell motility.

How does Ca 2 + stimulate release so rapidly and precisely? Work over the last decades revealed that Ca 2 + binding to synaptotagmin triggers release by stimulating synaptotagmin binding to a <b>core</b> fusion <b>machinery</b> composed of SNARE and SM proteins that mediates membrane fusion during exocytosis. Complexin adaptor proteins assist synaptotagmin by activating and clamping this <b>core</b> fusion <b>machinery.</b> Synaptic vesicles containing synaptotagmin are positioned at the active zone, the site of vesicle fusion, by a protein complex containing RIM proteins. RIM proteins activate docking and priming of synaptic vesicles and simultaneously recruit Ca 2 + channels to active zones, thereby connecting in a single complex primed synaptic vesicles to Ca 2 + channels. This architecture allows direct flow of Ca 2 + ions from Ca 2 + channels to synaptotagmin, which then triggers fusion, thus mediating tight millisecond coupling of an action potential to neurotransmitter release...|$|R

40|$|General and {{selective}} autophagy are pathways eukaryotic cells can utilize to degrade damaged or superfluous cellular components, {{but they are}} also survival mechanisms during starvation. Therefore these degradation pathways can be activated by starvation conditions, typically carbon and/or nitrogen sources. We investigated the effects of nitrogen and carbon starvation on autophagy- related pathway; in particular we focused on peroxisome degradation (pexophagy) and the nutrient sensing pathways involved. Pexophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the integration of two signals; one leading to activation, by phosphorylation, of the pexophagy receptor, Atg 36, and a second to activate the <b>core</b> autophagy <b>machinery.</b> Atg 36 phosphorylation depends on the presence of glucose, and the induction of <b>core</b> autophagy <b>machinery</b> depends on the inactivation of the Tor 1 (Target of rapamycin) complex in the absence of nitrogen.
