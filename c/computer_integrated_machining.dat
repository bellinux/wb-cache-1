40|$|This paper {{presents}} a job-shop workforce sizing method {{developed in the}} light of Holonic Manufacturing System (HMS). As one of the management paradigms gaining attention worldwide, HMS re{{presents a}} novel methodology that <b>integrates</b> <b>computers,</b> <b>machines,</b> and humans into a single function unit capable to cope with dynamics in the business environment. Over the decades, the concepts of holons and holonic systems have been adopted in many research fields, but they are scarcely attempted on labour planning. A literature gap exists, thus motivating the author {{to come up with a}} holonic model that uses exponential smoothing to forecast some quantitative variables in labour-intensive production. These varying parameters include the machine utilisation that reflects the demand and the worker absenteeism and turnover that constitute the disturbance. Collective equations are formulated to periodically compute the number of workers required. For model validation purpose, twenty-four-month data analysis is conducted on a mock-up basis...|$|R
40|$|Fully {{automatic}} annotation {{of tennis}} game using broadcast video {{is a task}} with a great potential but with enormous challenges. In this paper we describe our approach to this task, which <b>integrates</b> <b>computer</b> vision, <b>machine</b> listening, and machine learning. At the low level processing, we improve upon our previously proposed state-of-the-art tennis ball tracking algorithm and employ audio signal processing techniques to detect key events and construct features for classifying the events. At high level analysis, we model event classification as a sequence labelling problem, and investigate four machine learning techniques using simulated event sequences. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach on three real world tennis games, and discuss the interplay between audio, vision and learning. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, our system {{is the only one that}} can annotate tennis game at such a detailed level. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{performance of}} two <b>integrated</b> <b>machine</b> concepts (combined harvesting / forwarding capabilities) was assessed against a conventional harvester / for-warder CTL {{system in a}} simulated thinning regime. Mul-tiple-regression based on the simulation output was used in deriving time-consumption functions at the systems and machine level. Descriptive stand variables could be reduced to; harvest volume (m 3 /ha), stem volume (m 3), lead distance (m) and object volume (m 3 / stand) while maintaining acceptable statistical rigour (R 2 > 0. 95). The ability {{of one of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>machines</b> to process logs directly onto the bunk provided it with an advantage that more than compensated for its reduced harvesting efficiency. Both <b>integrated</b> <b>machine</b> systems show a com-petitive advantage in forest structures with low object volumes and long or frequent relocations. Factors negatively affecting forwarding productivity (e. g. long lead distances) favour the conventional two-machine system.
