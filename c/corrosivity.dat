5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the <b>corrosivity</b> of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
25|$|This {{reciprocal}} process effectively fuels corrosion until {{either the}} metal is eaten away or {{the concentration of}} CH3OH is negligible. Methanol's <b>corrosivity</b> has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halide ions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the <b>corrosivity</b> of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films on several metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.|$|E
25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and <b>corrosivity</b> increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
500|$|When {{the uranium}} ore {{is rich in}} such {{minerals}} as dolomite, magnesite, etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction. Its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate, which converts uranium into a complex 4−, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low <b>corrosivity</b> (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure: ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Corrosivity</b> - the {{promotion}} of corrosion by the flux and its residues. Most active fluxes tend to be corrosive at room temperatures and require careful removal. As activity and <b>corrosivity</b> are linked, the preparation of surfaces to be joined should allow use of milder fluxes. Some water-soluble flux residues are hygroscopic, which causes problems with electrical resistance and contributes to corrosion. Fluxes containing halides and mineral acids are highly corrosive and require thorough removal. Some fluxes, especially borax-based brazing ones, form very hard glass-like coatings {{that are difficult to}} remove.|$|E

It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin. This determines the level of damage to the skin that includes itching, inflammation, swelling, etc.|$|E
50|$|Above-ground {{plant can}} {{be exposed to}} extreme temperatures, and to {{humidity}} that varies with the seasons and with daily temperature changes. When humidity condenses on the surfaces of outdoor apparatus or equipment, the <b>corrosivity</b> of the moisture layer can be increased by industrial pollutants that render the condensate moisture corrosive. In sea coastal areas, wind-borne, salt-laden water droplets can deposit on exposed components.|$|E
50|$|Methanol is {{the lightest}} and {{simplest}} alcohol, produced {{from the natural}} gas component methane. Its application is limited primarily due to its toxicity (similar to gasoline), but also due to its high <b>corrosivity</b> and miscibility with water. Small amounts are used in some gasolines to increase the octane rating. Methanol-based fuels are used in some race cars and model airplanes.|$|E
50|$|Partially {{because of}} lead pipes, some states {{regulated}} the <b>corrosivity</b> of water {{put into the}} distribution system. Waters which would deposit a protective coating on the pipes rather than dissolving the pipe were preferred. Corrosion indexes such as pH or Langelier Saturation Index are not necessarily representative of the lead corrosion potential in a particular water/pipe system, nor did they measure the amount of lead to which customers were exposed.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of ions in an electrolyte, in this case, hard water, {{can also lead}} to galvanic corrosion, in which one metal will preferentially corrode when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte. The softening of hard water by ion exchange does not increase its <b>corrosivity</b> per se. Similarly, where lead plumbing is in use, softened water does not substantially increase plumbo-solvency.|$|E
5000|$|... Underground {{corrosion}} control engineers {{will collect}} soil samples to test soil chemistry for corrosive {{factors such as}} pH, minimum soil resistivity, chlorides, sulfates, ammonia, nitrates, sulfide, and redox potential. The soil samples are collected from the depth from which the infrastructure will be installed because soil properties can change from strata to strata. The minimum test of in-situ soil resistivity is measured using the wenner 4 pin method if often performed to judge a site's <b>corrosivity,</b> but if the test is performed during a dry period, the soil's actual <b>corrosivity</b> may not be properly reported since underground condensation can occur on buried metals leaving the soil touching the metal surfaces in a more moist status. This is why measuring a soil's minimum or saturated resistivity is so important. Soil resistivity testing alone will also not identify corrosive elements. Corrosion engineers can investigate locations experiencing active corrosion using above ground survey methods and design corrosion control systems such as cathodic protection to stop or reduce the rate of corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} for corrosion, leading to pipe failure, is significantly {{impacted by the}} <b>corrosivity</b> of soil. Unprotected pipes in highly corrosive soil tend to have shorter lifespans. The lifespan of ductile iron pipe installed in an aggressive environment without appropriate protection may be between 21 and 40 years. The introduction of corrosion mitigation methods for ductile pipe, {{including the use of}} polyethylene sleeving, can reduce corrosion by controlling the effect of corrosive soil on piping.|$|E

Hazardous wastes can be liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA hazardous wastes are wastes that appear {{on one of the}} four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of four characteristics-ignitability, <b>corrosivity,</b> reactivity, or toxicity. Hazardous wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C.|$|E
50|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} affects all organic compounds, {{causing a}} change in their properties because radiation disrupts covalent bonds that are most prevalent in organic compounds. One result of ionization is that the organic molecules disproportionate to form smaller hydrocarbon molecules as well as larger hydrocarbons molecules. This is reflected by increased evaporation loss, lowering of the flash and fire points, and increased viscosity. Other chemical reactions caused by radiation include oxidation and isomerization. The former leads to increased acidity, <b>corrosivity,</b> and coke formation; the latter causes {{a change in}} viscosity and volatility.|$|E
50|$|Most fuels contain small {{traces of}} {{vanadium}}. The vanadium is oxidized to different vanadates. Molten vanadates present as deposits on metal can flux oxide scales and passivation layers. Furthermore, {{the presence of}} vanadium accelerates the diffusion of oxygen through the fused salt layer to the metal substrate; vanadates can be present in semiconducting or ionic form, where the semiconducting form has significantly higher <b>corrosivity</b> as the oxygen is transported via oxygen vacancies. Ionic form in contrast transports oxygen by diffusion of the vanadates, which is significantly slower. The semiconducting form is rich on vanadium pentoxide.|$|E

Federal statute 40CFR§261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like battery acids are characterized by their pH value - acids (pH ≤ 2) and bases (pH ≥ 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and toxic wastes that are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed.
