5|$|It is {{a single}} quatrain with {{external}} rhymes that follow the pattern of AABB and with a trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with the rhyme was first recorded by composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (London, 1870). The Roud Folk Song Index catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, and classifies this song as 13026.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{demonstrated}} in 1859 {{that the growth}} of microorganisms causes the fermentation process, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and moulds, <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{region is}} <b>commonly</b> <b>associates</b> with mythical {{stories of the}} Sasanian times and even after Islam, it {{continues}} to be considered mysterious by the Islamic historians and geographers. This is probably because the Islamic armies either never got to fully conquer this region or only penetrated some of its regions (Tabaristan).|$|R
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, {{results in the}} production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is {{at high risk for}} other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} most <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with endometrioid adenocarcinoma {{are in the}} genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Chinese history {{there have}} been many {{examples}} of art being influenced by Taoist thought. Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei, Huang Gongwang, Mi Fu, Muqi Fachang, Shitao, Ni Zan, T'ang Mi, and Wang Tseng-tsu. Taoist arts represents the diverse regions, dialects, and time spans that are <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy, however scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
50|$|The Magnus effect <b>commonly</b> <b>associates</b> with a {{spinning}} object that drags air faster around one side, creating {{a difference in}} pressure that moves it {{in the direction of}} the lower-pressure side. It is a commonly observed effect in which {{a spinning}} ball (or cylinder) curves away from its principal flight path. It is important in many ball sports. It affects spinning missiles, and has some engineering uses, for instance in the design of rotor ships and Flettner aeroplanes.|$|R

5|$|Green {{today is}} not <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it {{sometimes}} represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with buried wood and {{is found in}} grassland, meadows, {{disturbed}} ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with poverty: some {{evidence}} suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E

30|$|Mail-ordering {{has been}} growing rapidly {{over the last decade}} [1]. For the most part, this {{development}} {{can be attributed to the}} increasing acceptance of online shopping. Obviously, e-tailers have done a good job in reducing the risks customers <b>commonly</b> <b>associate</b> with mail-order businesses. One common way of building trust and increasing the likelihood of ordering is the establishment of liberal return policies. Well-known examples of this strategy are the fashion retailers Zalando (www.zalando.com) and Zappos (www.zappos.com), which allow customers to return merchandise for up to 365  days at no charge. However, returns also entail a variety of direct and indirect costs.|$|R

5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|Other Italian {{folk song}} traditions are less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, {{religious}} laude, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, {{especially those of}} the maggio celebration. Professional female singers perform dirges similar in style to those elsewhere in Europe. Yodeling exists in northern Italy, though it is most <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia. Choirs and brass bands {{are a part of}} the mid-Lenten holiday, while the begging song tradition extends through many holidays throughout the year.|$|E
5000|$|KvLQT1 {{can also}} {{associate}} {{with any of}} the five members of the KCNE family of proteins, but interactions with KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3 are the only interactions within this protein family that affect the human heart. KCNE2, KCNE4, and KCNE5 have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the functionality of KvLQT1, while KCNE1 and KCNE3 are activators of KvLQT1. [...] KvLQT1 can associate with KCNE1 and KCNE4 with the activation effects of KCNE1 overriding the inhibitory effects of KCNE4 on the KvLQT1 channel, and KvLQT1 will <b>commonly</b> <b>associate</b> with anywhere from two to four different KCNE proteins in order to be functional. [...] However, KvLQT1 most <b>commonly</b> <b>associates</b> with KCNE1 and forms the KvLQT1/KCNE1 complex since it has only been seen to function in vivo when associated with another protein. [...] KCNQ1 will form a heteromer with KCNE1 in order to slow its activation and enhance the current density at the plasma membrane of the neuron. [...] In addition to associating with KCNE proteins, the N-terminal juxtamembranous domain of KvLQT1 can also associate with SGK1, which stimulates the slow delayed potassium rectifier current. Since SGK1 requires structural integrity to stimulate KvLQT1/KCNE1, any mutations present in the KvLQT1 protein can result in reduced stimulation of this channel by SGK1. [...] General mutations in KvLQT1 have been known to cause a decrease in this slow delayed potassium rectifier current, longer cardiac action potentials, and a tendency to have tachyarrhythmias.|$|R
