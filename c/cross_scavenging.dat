5000|$|Historically, the {{deflector}} piston form of <b>cross</b> <b>scavenging</b> was termed [...] "loop scavenging", after the supposed {{shape of the}} flow. Schnuerle flow was termed [...] "reverse loop scavenging". As {{the first of these}} was realised to be inaccurate, the later form adopted the simpler name. These original terms are now obsolete and no longer used.|$|E
50|$|Deflector pistons {{are used}} in {{two-stroke}} engines with crankcase compression, where the gas flow within the cylinder must be carefully directed {{in order to provide}} efficient scavenging. With <b>cross</b> <b>scavenging,</b> the transfer (inlet to the cylinder) and exhaust ports are on directly facing sides of the cylinder wall. To prevent the incoming mixture passing straight across from one port to the other, the piston has a raised rib on its crown. This is intended to deflect the incoming mixture upwards, around the combustion chamber.|$|E
50|$|Much effort, {{and many}} {{different}} designs of piston crown, went into developing improved scavenging. The crowns developed {{from a simple}} rib to a large asymmetric bulge, usually with a steep face on the inlet side and a gentle curve on the exhaust. Despite this, <b>cross</b> <b>scavenging</b> was never as effective as hoped. Most engines today use Schnuerle porting instead. This places a pair of transfer ports in {{the sides of the}} cylinder and encourages gas flow to rotate around a vertical axis, rather than a horizontal axis.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a brief {{bibliography}} survey and experimental activity concerning an unconventional combustion process for two-stroke gasoline engines. Auto-ignition is an interesting combustion process which takes place at light loads and turns the effect of residual gas from negative aspect to positive since their thermal energy is used to prime auto-ignition of the fresh gas. This leads to very good combustion quality with very small cycle to cycle variations, to low specific fuel consumption and to low exhaust emissions of carbon monoxyde and unburned hydrocarbons. The name A. T. AC. (Active Thermo Atmosphere Combustion) was chosen by Onishi et al. who presented the first industrial application of this unconventional combustion process to a portable generator (NICE 10) in 1979. Research work on the auto-ignition combustion {{have been carried out}} since early 1970 â€™s. More recently, a famous demonstration of the potential of an engine designed {{with a wide range of}} controlled auto-ignition combustion process (Activated Radicals Combustion) has been performed by the HONDA EXP 2 motorcycles during the 1995 Grenada Dakar Rally. Today, more and more stringent legislations for highly polluting two-stroke engines appear and this auto-ignition combustion process is a promising way to help to cope new regulations. In order to better understand and control this combustion process far a wide industrial application, it seems necessary to study this phenomenon thoroughly. The experimental work presented in this paper was performed on both loop and <b>cross</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engines. Different engines parameters and setting as well as compression ratio, transfer duct configuration and air/fuel ratio have been investigated to evaluate their effect an the autoignition. Furthermore, optical cylinder heads have been designed far combustion visualization and both A. T. A. C. and S. I. combustion photographic images are presented and described in this paper. A video film has also been realized...|$|R
