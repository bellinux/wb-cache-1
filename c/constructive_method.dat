500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{invariant}} theory was to solve the [...] "finite basis problem". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether {{it was possible to}} get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms. Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the [...] "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a <b>constructive</b> <b>method</b> for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group. His first proof caused some controversy because it did not give a method for constructing the generators, although in later work he made his method constructive. For her thesis, Noether extended Gordan's computational proof to homogeneous polynomials in three variables. Noether's constructive approach made it possible to study the relationships among the invariants. Later, after she had turned to more abstract methods, Noether called her thesis [...] (crap) and Formelngestrüpp (a jungle of equations).|$|E
