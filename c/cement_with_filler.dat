40|$|Cement clinker {{production}} {{is a highly}} resource and energy intensive process and contributes substantially to annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. One potential pathway to reduce the environmental footprint of cement-based materials is through the reduction of clinker content in concrete by partial replacement of <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> <b>fillers.</b> In this investigation, the partial replacement of <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> chemically inert nano and microsized fillers of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) and limestone was examined. The effects of nano and micro fillers on early-age properties, long-term properties, photocatalytic properties (for TiO₂-cement mixtures) and life cycle costs were measured and compared. Investigation of early-age properties shows that nanoparticles increase rate and degree of early cement hydration and chemical shrinkage due to heterogeneous nucleation effect. In contrast, coarser microparticles (> 3 µm in this research) maintain or marginally decrease the rate and degree of early cement hydration and decrease chemical shrinkage due to a dilution effect. In addition, temperature sensitivity of hydration reactions increases {{in the presence of}} nanoparticles. Investigation of long-term properties shows that pore size refinement is possible with the partial replacement of <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> nanoparticle <b>fillers.</b> But the long-term tests of filler-cement mixes also demonstrate that, compared to ordinary portland cement mix, the strength decreases and permeability increases. Analysis of photocatalytic properties of TiO₂-cement mixtures showed a lack of an appropriate testing procedure for nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) gas conversion by cement-based materials. Thus, a new standardized procedure and photocatalytic efficiency factor for characterizing photocatalytic NOₓ binding by cementitious materials is proposed. Life cycle analysis demonstrates that although inclusion of TiO₂ increases initial environmental impact of cementitious materials, the innovative photocatalytic properties of TiO₂ could improve sustainability. Life cycle analysis also shows that partial replacement of <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> limestone decreases environmental impact of cementitious mixtures due to lower processing “costs” of limestone compared to cement. Thus, the results from the current research demonstrate that variation of dosage and particle size of inert fillers can be used to tailor properties and structure of cement-based materials and that environmental sustainability can be improved by partial replacement of <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> inert <b>fillers</b> that introduce additional functionalities or <b>fillers</b> <b>with</b> lower embodied-energy and emissions.

40|$|Ecological {{concrete}} can {{be designed}} by replacing <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> <b>fillers.</b> <b>With</b> low amounts of cement it becomes increasingly important to control the water demand of concrete mixtures. In this paper a cyclic design method based on particle packing is presented and evaluated {{on the basis of}} experiments on <b>cement</b> pastes combined <b>with</b> quartz powder. The packing density of sixteen pastes is measured using the mixing energy test. Furthermore, the cement pastes were tested on compressive strength at 7 and 28 days. Adding quartz powder M 600 can increase the packing density by more than 10 %. This means that fine quartz powders can improve the packing density to such extent that the cement content can be decreased while simultaneously the water cement ratio is decreased. This occurs for pastes with a packing density higher than the completely saturated packing density of cement. Additional strength tests were performed on two mixtures <b>with</b> constant water <b>cement</b> ratio and showed a 15 % strength increase when 20 % of the cement was replaced by quartz powder M 600. In the design procedure for ecological concrete, increased strength efficiency can be balanced by lowering the amount of cement. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fillers</b> {{together}} <b>with</b> binders {{take part}} in microstructure formation of matrix basis and contact zones of a composite. The advantage of <b>cement</b> matrix structure <b>with</b> a <b>filler</b> is that inner defects are localized in it - microcracks, macropores and capillary pores, {{as well as that}} their quantity, their sizes and stress concentration decrease. Structure formation of filled cement composites is based on the processes taking place in the contact of liquid and stiff phases, which means, it depends on the quantitative relation of the cement, fillers and water, and also dispersivity and physical and chemical activity of the fillers. In the article the authors offer research results of the processes of hydration and physical-mechanical properties of <b>cement</b> composites <b>with</b> <b>fillers</b> from the fields of the Chechen Republic.

For this purpose, ultrafine calcium carbonate materials with different specific surface areas of 9. 7 and 15. 1 m 2 /g and limestone powder (0. 72 m 2 /g) were used. The {{results indicate that the}} ultrafine fillers enhanced the durability properties compared to the mixtures containing limestone. For instance, ultrafine fillers provided up to 20 % higher concrete surface resistivity and 20 % lower rapid chloride migration test (RCMT) coefficient, while limestone mixes showed equal or even lower durability levels compared to the plain mixture with 0 % supplementary cementitious materials. The influence of filler materials on the compressive strength was not significant. However, regardless of the surface area, incorporating filler materials at levels up to 5 % led to somewhat higher compressive strengths compared to the plain mixture. Generally, it seems that using finer fillers may lead to more durable concrete mixes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} seven Tunisian <b>cements</b> <b>with</b> varying limestone <b>filler</b> content, manufactured on an industrial scale. The {{purpose of the study}} is to promote Portland-limestone cement in countries where these cements are not usually used. Materials characterization showed that the grinding quality of the seven cements was very different. This parameter was defined by the ratio of specific surface (Blaine) and residue at 40 mu m. Generally limestone fillers behave in a similar way to crushed clinker although they do accelerate the setting because they are finer. Monocarboaluminate appeared from a young age when filler content was high. At a young age (2 days), mechanical strengths are equivalent, at least if grinding quality is satisfactory. At a medium age (28 days), grinding quality influences performance. At a later age (1 year), only those <b>cements</b> <b>with</b> high limestone content underperform.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of investigations of dynamic properties for bone <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> different <b>fillers</b> by means of DMTA method. Addition of any substance causes the change in mechanical properties. Pure PALAMED® material and material filled <b>with</b> four different <b>fillers</b> have been analysed. Design/methodology/approach: One of the methods of thermal analysis for polymeric materials has been used for investigations. DMTA method is based on the analysis of the signal (reaction) from the deformed material under particular conditions, at the changeable ambient temperature as well as vibrations frequency and amplitude. DMTA thermograms give information on change in storage modulus E’ and the mechanical loss factor tgδ, which is responsible for dissipation of energy during deformation. Pure cement as well as the cement filled with: BiO-OSS and PORESORB bone graft substitute materials, Al 2 O 3 ceramic material and powdered animal bones. Method of specimen preparation and proportion in which the specimens were prepared are presented in the text. Practical implications: As it results from the literature analysis, no investigations of such a wide group of fillers, both organic and inorganic have been carried out yet. The investigations enabled the storage modulus and tgδ to be determined for each of the prepared materials, thus to indicate the material whose properties enable this material to be used in further alloplasty surgeries for hip joint. Practical application {{of the results of the}} investigations described in this paper will be possible after long and comprehensive clinical trials.

The strength activity index (SAI) for 10 % pozzolana, and 5 % limestone blend at 7 and 28 days was 75. 5 % and 85. 0 % satisfying the minimum SAI limit of ASTM C 618. Twenty two percents natural pozzolana and five percents limestone were interground with clinker and gypsum {{in a laboratory}} ball mill to compare the power consumption <b>with</b> ordinary Portland <b>cement</b> (OPC) (95 % clinker and 5 % gypsum). The ternary blended cement took less time to reach to the same fineness level as OPC due to soft pozzolana and high grade lime stone indicating that intergrinding may reduce overall power consumption.

40|$|Aim: To verify {{whether the}} filler load of luting agents {{influences}} the radiopacity of intraradicularly placed posts. Methodology: Digital radiographs {{of the following}} posts were taken: RelyX Fiber Post (3 M ESPE), GC Fiber Post (GC Corporation), DT Light Post Illusion (RTD), DT Light SL Post (RTD), Endo-Composipost (RTD), FibreKleer Parallel Post (Jeneric Pentron Incorporated), FRC Postec (Ivoclar Vivadent), Parapost Taper Lux (Còltene/Whaledent AG), Radix Fiber Post (Dentsply Maillefer), EverStick Post (Stick Tech Ltd), Dentin Post X (Komet), Tech 21 X-op (Isasan), ENA Post (Micerium). Post radiopacity was measured in millimetres of aluminium (mmAl) with reference to an aluminium step wedge. Two extracted contralateral premolars were root filled. After post space preparation, taking {{the midpoint of the}} post hole as a reference, each tooth was cut longitudinally into two halves in a mesiodistal direction. On each half, the exposed root dentine was ground flat to the deepest point of the post space, and an even layer of cement was placed and light-cured. To obtain a clinically relevant layer of cement, the material thickness was reduced to 75 μm by grinding with wet abrasive paper. A <b>cement</b> formulation <b>with</b> 30 wt% of filler was tested in one premolar, whilst a formulation with 70 wt% of filler was utilized in the contralateral tooth. Posts were then placed between the two facing root halves of each premolar, and radiopacity was measured in mmAl. Data were analysed using t-test for paired samples (P < 0. 05). Results: Radiopacity of posts ranged between 1. 44 (ENA Post) and 5. 78 mmAl (FibreKleer). In the presence of the more heavily filled cement, significantly higher values of post radiopacity were measured (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The radiopacity of the luting agent contributed to the overall post radiovisibility within the root.

40|$|A {{series of}} Foam Index {{measurements}} {{were made with}} 7 different AEAs (abietic acids/resins/tall oil/tensides), 1 copolymer SuperPlaticizer, 2 different Fly Ashes, 1 blended (80 / 20 OPC/FA) cement, 2 different OPC and 2 inert fillers (limestone and quartz). Foam Index = FI = required dosage of AEA to produce stable foam of a particular binder in a w/p = 2. 5 slurry where AEA is added dropwise to a container that is shaken and the foam observed repeatedly until stable foam is obtained. The objective {{was to investigate the}} efficiency of the different AEAs with varying Fly Ash binders and the effect of mixing sequence of AEA and SP on the problems encounterd with air entrainment with Fly Ash with variable carbon content. The results show: that the ranking of the FI of the seven AEAs are the same for different OPC/FA binders (with different carbon content); the more carbon the higher the FI, that “tensides” are more robust than “resins”, and that FI in pure OPC binders are very low and not very different for the 7 AEAs. When adding SP before AEA the negative effect of carbon on foaming is reduced for most AEAs, presumably due to adsorption of SP before AEA is introduced in the mix, whereas the FI of some (presumably non-adsorbing) AEAs is not affected by SP addition. For those AEA/FA combinations where the FI is affected by SP, adding SP with the AEA and adding SP after the AEA reduces the efficiency of the AEA. Replacing blended <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> limestone <b>filler</b> and quartz filler seems to affect FI in terms of the specific surface of the filler added: the more surface that is taken away the more efficient becomes the AEA.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the interfacial fracture toughness (IFT) of composite <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> dispersed <b>filler</b> (DF) versus polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite blocks after 2 different surface pretreatments using the notchless triangular prism (NTP) test. Two DFs (Cerasmart [CRT] and Lava Ultimate [LVA]), 2 PICNs (Enamic [ENA] and experimental PICN [EXP]), and e. max CAD lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (EMX, control) prism samples were bonded to their counterparts with Variolink Esthetic DC composite cement after either hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) or gritblasting (GR). Both procedures were followed by silanization. All samples (n = 30 per group) were thermocycled (10, 000 cycles) and tested for their IFT in a water bath at 36 °C. Moreover, representative samples from each group were subjected to a developed interfacial area ratio (Sdr) measurement by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization. EXP-HF gave the highest IFT (1. 85 ± 0. 39 MPa·m 1 / 2), followed by EMX-HF and ENA-HF, while CRT-HF gave the lowest (0. 15 ± 0. 22 MPa·m 1 / 2). PICNs gave significantly better results with HF, and DF showed better results with GR. A 2 -way analysis of variance indicated that there were significantly higher IFT and Sdr for PICNs than for DF. A positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 872) was found between IFT and Sdr. SEM characterization showed the specific microstructure of the surface of etched PICNs, indicating the presence of a retentive polymerbased honeycomb structure. Etching of the typical double-network microstructure of PICNs causes an important increase in the Sdr and IFT, while DF should be gritblasted. DF exhibited significantly lower Sdr and IFT values than PICNs.

Mortars used today are to a large extent hybrid mortars with different additives and filler. Analysing complex mortars <b>with</b> additives and <b>fillers</b> requires analytical routines that are more versatile. In order to investigate the possibilities for characterisation of mortars using chemical and microscopical methods, test prisms were produced from lime <b>cement</b> mortars <b>with</b> dolomite <b>filler</b> and from lime cement slag mortars. After six months of hardening, the prisms were prepared for chemical and microscopical thin-section analysis. Acid-soluble components in the samples were analysed chemically and the constituents were quantified by optical microscopy using point counting and counting in fields. From these results the mix proportions were calculated. The chemical methods gave an assessment of the mix proportions calculated using a general algorithm. The calculation of the quantitative results based on microscopy was done according to the NT BUILD 370 method and the TNO method. These gave a good assessment of the lime cement mortars and the slag mortars with low slag content. However, the analysis of mortars with high slag content gave aggregate-binder ratios that were too low.

Fillers play a substantial role in the packing behaviour of low cement castable.
