5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is <b>condoms</b> <b>and</b> oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization.

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing <b>condoms,</b> <b>and</b> condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has taken}} many steps towards slowing {{the spread of}} HIV/AIDS, such as {{increasing}} access to <b>condoms</b> <b>and</b> improving testing services and treatment options. Many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including the World Bank, the Global Fund, the World Health Organization, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS). The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the Global Fund has agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.|$|E

40|$|This study {{utilizes}} qualitative methodologies including {{interviews and}} focus groups, {{to examine the}} relationship between <b>condom</b> fit <b>and</b> pleasure by exploring how variations in <b>condom</b> size, material, <b>and</b> shape affects sexual pleasure.

Additional interviews with public health officials regarding policies related to <b>condom</b> education <b>and</b> distribution highlight policy impacts on MSM <b>condom</b> preferences <b>and</b> experiences. Study findings suggest that a better condom fit should decrease <b>condom</b> problems <b>and</b> increase pleasure, thereby increasing condom usage among some sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM). Improvements in <b>condom</b> distribution <b>and</b> promotion on behalf of public health could also contribute to increased <b>condom</b> usage <b>and</b> improved attitudes related to <b>condoms.</b> Ultimately, discovering <b>and</b> accessing a better fitting condom could reduce HIV/STI acquisition rates among MSM...|$|R

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using <b>condoms,</b> <b>and</b> HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, <b>condoms</b> <b>and</b> pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11–12.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundAmong {{the sexual}} {{minority}} groups, the Men who have Sexwith Men (MSM) {{community is a}} large and scatterednetwork. Sexual activity among MSM is frequent and oftenunplanned. STI and HIV are major medical problems facedby this vulnerable group. Stigma and discriminationtowards this group result in poor access to preventiveservices that encourage <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> lubricant usage. MethodA cross-sectional, community-based study of 309 MSM wascarried out in the Davangere district between December 2008 and February 2010. Participants were identified inthree stages: cruising venue identification and mapping;determining eligibility and willingness to participate; andrecruitment to the study. Consecutive sampling was used torecruit the participants {{with the help of}} a snowballtechnique, obtaining informed and written consent. ResultsOf the participants 79. 61 % and 88. 03 % reportedinconsistent use of <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> lubricant during the threemonths prior to the interview, respectively. In multivariateanalysis, middle socioeconomic class, sex in a public placeand increased frequency of sex were significantly associatedwith inconsistent condom use. Whereas, practising bothtypes of anal sex (receptive and insertive), not using acondom during the last sexual encounter and increasedfrequency of sex were significantly associated withinconsistent lubricant use. ConclusionMany social and behavioural factors are involved in theinconsistent use of <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> lubricant among MSM. Preventive programmes must identify these factors in orderto target consistent <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> lubricant use among theMSM community...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors used {{data from}} a larger study to {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects of}} a peer advocate intervention on <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> contraceptive use among HIV-infected women and women at high risk for HIV infection. METHODS: HIV-infected women in one study and women at high risk for HIV infection in a second study were selected from the Women and Infants Demonstration Project and assigned to a standard or an enhanced HIV prevention treatment group. The enhanced intervention included support groups and one-on-one contacts with peer advocates tailored to clients' needs. The authors interviewed women at baseline and at 6 -, 12 - and 18 -months, and measured changes in consistency of <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> contraceptive use and in self-efficacy and perceived advantages <b>and</b> disadvantages of <b>condom</b> <b>and</b> contraceptive use. RESULTS: Of HIV-infected women, the enhanced group had improved consistency in condom use, increased perceived advantages of <b>condom</b> use, <b>and</b> increased level of self-efficacy compared with the standard group. Of women at risk, the enhanced intervention group at six months maintained consistent condom use with a main partner and perceived more benefit of condom use compared with the standard group. These differences diminished at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced intervention was generally effective in the HIV+ study. In the at-risk study, however, intervention effects were minimal and short-lived. Factors related to the theory, intervention design, and sample characteristics help explain these differences...|$|R
