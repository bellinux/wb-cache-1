In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Canada passedlegislation to reform these markets. One of the major reforms was the introductionof mandatory clearing for standardized over-the-counter (OTC) swaps through acentral counterparty clearing system (CCP). This reform requires customers thatenter into cleared swaps contracts to post margin with a <b>clearing</b> <b>intermediary</b> inorder {{to comply with the}} rules of the clearing system. The Canadian SecuritiesAdministrators OTC Derivatives Committee (CSA) has created a Model Law (theModel Provincial Rule, or MPR) for the provinces to implement in order toincrease legal certainty for cleared swaps customers that post margin with anintermediary...|$|E

Using cross-border payments as an example, as the clearing procedures for each country is different, a remittance requires nearly 3  days to arrive. This demonstrates the low efficiency and immense volume of occupied funds involved. 8 [...]...|$|R

This paper analyses the structure of co-authorshipnetworks in three different fields (Nanoscience, Pharmacology and Statistics) in Spain overa three-year period (2006 – 2008) and explores the relationship between the research per-formance of scientists and their position in co-authorship networks. A denser co-authorshipnetwork is found in the two experimental fields than in Statistics, where the network is ofa less connected and more fragmented nature. Using the g-index as a proxy for individualresearch performance, a Poisson regression model is used to explore how performance isrelated to different co-authorship network measures and to disclose interfield differences. The number of co-authors (degree centrality) and the strength of links show a positive rela-tionship with the g-index in the three fields. Local cohesion presents a negative relationshipwith the g-index in the two experimental fields, where open networks and the diversity ofco-authors seem to be beneficial. No <b>clear</b> advantages from <b>intermediary</b> positions (highbetweenness) or from being linked to well-connected authors (high eigenvector) can beinferred from this analysis. In terms of g-index, the benefits derived by authors from theirposition in co-authorship networks are larger in the two experimental fields than in thetheoretical one.
