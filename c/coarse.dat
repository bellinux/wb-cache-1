40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} which spaces have <b>coarser</b> connected topologies. If in a collectionwise normal space X, {{the density}} equals the extent, which is attained {{and at least}} c, then X has a <b>coarser</b> connected collectionwise normal topology. In the previous sentence, the separation property collectionwise normal can be replaced by other separation properties—for example, Hausdorff, Urysohn, regular, metrizable. A zero-dimensional metrizable space X of density at least c has a <b>coarser</b> connected metrizable topology. A non-H-closed Hausdorff space with a σ-locally finite base has a <b>coarser</b> connected Hausdorff topology. We give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for an ordinal to have a <b>coarser</b> connected Urysohn topology. In particular, every indecomposible ordinal of countable cofinality has a <b>coarser</b> connected topology. We present a nowhere locally compact Hausdorff space X with no <b>coarser</b> connected Hausdorff topology, yet X is dense in a connected Hausdorff space Y...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} algorithmic {{solution to the problem}} of determining a Bisimulation Relation on a finite structure. In fact, we consider the so-called Relational <b>Coarsest</b> Partition problem: the search of the <b>coarsest</b> partition refining a given one and stable with respect to a given initial relation. Starting from a set-theoretic point of view we propose an algorithm that optimizes the solution to the Relational <b>Coarsest</b> Partition problem given by Paige and Tarjan in 1987. Our algorithm reaches, in particular cases, a linear solution using the linear solution for the Single Function <b>Coarsest</b> Partition problem proposed by Paige, Tarjan, and Bonic in 1985. The approach consists in rewriting the bisimulation problem as an equivalence problem between hypersets. This allows to combine a negative and a positive strategy in the search of the <b>coarsest</b> partition stable with respect to the membership relation on the input structure...|$|R
50|$|Any wool finer than 25 microns can be {{used for}} garments, while <b>coarser</b> grades are used for {{outerwear}} or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it is, while <b>coarser</b> grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.|$|R
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of <b>coarse</b> silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of <b>coarse</b> sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it has a}} Sandbach postcode, <b>coarse</b> {{fishing is}} {{available}} in the southeast of Bradwall Civil Parish at Field Farm Fisheries with five pools stocked with barbel, bream, carp, chub, crucian, rudd, roach and tench. The equestrian governing body, British Eventing, holds horse trials in eventing at Manor Farm each year. Plum Tree Farm Riding Centre is the local riding school. Chellebeech Livery Yard is at Springbank Farm.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} <b>coarse</b> woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
40|$|Weak bisimilarity is a distribution-based {{equivalence}} notion for Markov automata. It {{has gained}} some popularity as the <b>coarsest</b> reasonable behavioural equivalence on Markov automata. This paper studies a strictly <b>coarser</b> notion: Late weak bisimilarity enjoys valuable properties if restricting to important subclasses of schedulers: Trace distribution equivalence is implied for partial information schedulers, and compositionality is preserved by distributed schedulers. The {{intersection of the}} two scheduler classes thus spans a <b>coarser</b> and still reasonable compositional theory of Markov automata...|$|R

30|$|The mesh-based hyper-ROM {{consists}} in {{the solution of}} the described ROM problem using a <b>coarser</b> mesh than the one of the FOM.

The manufacturer of Foden Trucks and their award-winning Fodens Motor Works Band, were based in Bradwall until a boundary change in 1936 placed them in the adjacent parish of Sandbach.|$|E
5|$|In wine making, the {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice, giving a markedly <b>coarse</b> taste and throwing off balance the Riesling's range of flavors and aromas.|$|E

5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite <b>coarse,</b> with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E

The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E
5|$|The pottery {{found at}} the site were in {{an early stage of}} hand crafting, of the <b>coarse</b> variety, in steel-grey, dull red, brown, and buff colours with mat prints at the bottom; they were in the shape of bowl, vase and stem.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} equity {{properties}} of insurance premium schemes where agents are partitioned into groups with different average accident probabilities and each individual {{has to pay}} a premium according to the average probability of the group to which it belongs. In particular, we examine the question whether choosing finer partitions to define these groups generates more equitable situations than <b>coarser</b> groups. Though it turns out that partitioning the agents into finer groups can never be Lorenz dominated by the <b>coarser</b> partition, it cannot be guaranteed that finer partitions represent improvements over <b>coarser</b> ones except in very restrictive circumstances. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to <b>coarse</b> stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E
