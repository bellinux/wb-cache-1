30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different surface treatments on the flexural strength of a pressable lithium disilicate ceramic. Sixteen bars (16 x 2 x 4 mm) were made, divided into subgroups (n[*]=[*] 10), and the following surface treatments were done: C - no treatment; H - etching with 5 % hydrofluoric acid; HC - etching with 5 % hydrofluoric acid, silanization, and cementation; N – etching with 5 % hydrofluoric acid, neutralization with supersaturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, silanization, and cementation; U – etching with 5 % hydrofluoric acid, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> in distillated water, silanization, and cementation; NU - etching with 5 % hydrofluoric acid, neutralization with supersaturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> in distillated water, silanization and cementation. The three points flexural strength was performed 24  h after cementation and the data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests (p-value[*]=[*] 0.05). The results showed that the surface treatment had a significant effect (p-value[*]<[*] 0, 05) on the flexural strength of the studied ceramic. The N and NU groups showed lower flexural strength than other groups. Thus, it was concluded that neutralization with supersaturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, followed or not <b>by</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> results in lower mechanical strength of a pressable lithium disilicate ceramic.

40|$|The microcontamination {{of optical}} {{surfaces}} or optical thin films affects {{many of their}} properties. In this work, we investigated several measurement systems to detect many types of surface contamination of coatings based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The attenuated total reflection (ATR) coupling, {{also known as the}} Kretschmann configuration, excited the nonradiative surface plasmon wave for SPR measurement. Several microcontamination layers thinner than 10 nm were studied. The results showed that in all the cases SPR curves shifted to larger incident angles. From the amount of angle shift, the thickness of contamination was determined with a sensitivity of as little as one angstrom. The optical constants of those contamination layers were also derived. The shifts of the SPR curves served as an index for the efficiency of cleaning processes. It was found that the contamination by moisture can be removed with Iso-propyl alcohol <b>by</b> the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning</b> process, while acetone was the more effective solvent in removing the contamination left by strippable coating residue show that the contamination layer was roughened <b>by</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaning.</b> In studies of island-like discontinuous thin layers of Ag, Al, and MgF₂, we found that the refractive index of MgF₂, a dielectric film material, slightly decreased as the thickness decreased, but for discontinuous metal films, the optical constants changed rapidly and became more dielectric in nature. Direct detection of contamination by coating processes in a small vacuum chamber was also carried out. In a chamber with high backstreaming from a diffusion pump, a broad SPR curve for an Ag film revealed obvious optical constant changes. Measuring and comparing the shift indicates that a significant amount of contamination was occurring right after the coating was completed. This suggests that for good evaporated optical thin films, {{it is important to have}} a more tightly controlled evaporation process. Finally, particulate, as well as layered, contamination can also be measured. A radiative SPR wave was generated by illuminating a contaminated surface. Similar radiative SPR waves also can be observed by adding a rough contaminant layer on an Ag film...|$|R

As a new technology, {{many aspects of}} its widespread utilization remain open to investigation. Among these are the cleaning processes {{that can be used}} for post finishing of parts and measurements to verify effectiveness of the cleaning processes. Many cleaning and drying processes and measurement methods that have been used for parts manufactured using conventional techniques are candidates that may be considered for cleaning and verification of additively manufactured parts. Among these are vapor degreasing, ultrasonic immersion and spray cleaning, followed by hot air drying, vacuum baking and solvent displacement drying. Differences in porosity, density, and surface finish of additively manufactured versus conventionally manufactured parts may introduce new considerations in the selection of cleaning and drying processes or the method used to verify their effectiveness.

Polycrystalline silicon thin film solar cells on cheap substrates are promising the hope to reduce the cost of photovoltaic devices. They share the benefits of reduced material consumption with other thin film candidates such as amorphous silicon, copper indium diselenide and cadmium telluride but retain the advantages of crystalline silicon [1].
