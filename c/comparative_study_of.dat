5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the geographic distribution of organisms {{and the corresponding}} evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|A <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> {{the amino}} acid {{composition}} of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis {{to have the}} highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E

5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} starling family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a starling. Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature {{similar to that of the}} common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a <b>comparative</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> skulls.|$|E
