5|$|Keynes's {{experience}} at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, {{yet it was}} not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments,</b> are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
50|$|As an {{independent}} legal action {{and as a}} second option, a <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> may be requested within a separate court procedure. A prerequisite for that is a court decision as to the illegality of the dismissal.

5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E

25|$|According to Danish {{physician}} and historian Kirsten Lylloff, these deaths were partially due to denial {{of medical care}} by Danish medical staff, as both the Danish Association of Doctors and the Danish Red Cross began refusing medical treatment to German refugees, starting in March 1945. The last refugees left Denmark on 15 February 1949. In the Treaty of London, signed 26 February 1953, West Germany and Denmark agreed on <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> of 160 million Danish crowns for its extended care of the refugees, which West Germany paid between 1953 and 1958.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 1931, the Supreme Court found Holmenkolbanen {{guilty in}} the lawsuit {{regarding}} the real estate damage, with the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> making the company insolvent. This resulted in Aker Municipality purchasing the majority of Holmenkolbanen, and merged the Røa Line and Sognsvann Line into the company. In 1939, Bærumsbanen started construction of a branch from the Lilleaker Line to Majorstuen. From 15 June 1942, the Kolsås Line, as it was renamed, started running via the tunnel to the city center. Bærumsbanen became part of Oslo Sporveier in 1971.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1987, Steimel {{endorsed}} a $30 million reduction in unemployment <b>compensation</b> <b>payments.</b> At the time Louisiana employers owed $1 billion to the unemployment fund, a situation Steimel termed another major deterrent to economic growth and a contributing factor to {{the high rate of}} unemployment in the state, which was 12.5 percent in 1986. According to Steimel, Louisiana employers were then paying $234 more per year per employee into the unemployment fund than were employers in competing southern states. The reduction approved by the legislature brought Louisiana in line with unemployment payments made by employers in neighboring states.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} had already paid substantial compensation to farmers {{because of the}} foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the bluetongue outbreak in 2007, {{against the background of}} EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis or enzootic bovine leucosis. In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of £1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> of around £1,000 on animals valued at over £3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Romanesque House is an {{impressive}} piece of evidence of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for their release from personal bondage. As {{a result of its}} aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia – and thus to Silesia – without being charged taxes or dues.|$|E

Scott Nova, executive director of Worker Rights Consortium, said the donation is too little to make the industry safe, particularly because many factories do not even have basic safety features such as fire escapes. On 15 May 2013, companies whose clothing was manufactured at the Tazreen Design Ltd. factory met in Geneva to discuss <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for the victims of the fire; Walmart and Sears declined to send representatives to the meeting for unknown reasons.|$|E

25|$|Charges and countercharges {{of border}} incursions and {{protection}} of fugitives led to an unsuccessful Bhutanese mission to Calcutta in 1852. Among other demands, the mission sought increased compensation for its former Duars territories; instead the British deducted nearly 3,000 rupees from the annual compensation and demanded an apology for alleged plundering of British-protected lands {{by members of the}} mission. Following more incidents and the prospect of an anti-Bhutan rebellion in the Bengal Duars, British troops deployed to the frontier in the mid-1850s. The Sepoy Rebellion in India in 1857-58 and the demise of the British East India Company's rule prevented immediate British action. Bhutanese armed forces raided Sikkim and Cooch Behar in 1862, seizing people, property, and money. The British responded by withholding all <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> and demanding release of all captives and return of stolen property. Demands to the Druk Desi went unheeded, as he was alleged to be unaware of his frontier officials' actions against Sikkim and Cooch Behar.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{south from}} the A2, Ringway 2 would have crossed {{golf courses and}} sports grounds west of Avery Hill to reach the A20 at Mottingham where its next {{junction}} would have been constructed. Next, heading west out of the London Borough of Greenwich, the motorway would have briefly crossed {{the northern tip of}} the London Borough of Bromley, via another group of playing fields before entering the London Borough of Lewisham to connect to the A2212 near Grove Park station. Here the route encounters the first substantial urban development cutting an alignment through the London County Council's Downham Estate – land already in public ownership, thereby avoiding the need for expensive land purchases and <b>compensation</b> <b>payments.</b> Here the motorway would have run parallel with Shroffold Road and Durham Hill to cross Downham Fields then run parallel with Downham Way to meet Bromley Road (A21) where the next junction would have been located.|$|E
500|$|Starting as {{a branch}} from Praed Street junction, a short {{distance}} east of the Met's Paddington station, the western extension passed through fashionable districts in Bayswater, Notting Hill, and Kensington. Land values here were higher and, unlike the original line, the route did not follow an easy alignment under existing roads. <b>Compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for property were much higher. In Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, a façade of two five-storey houses was built at Nos. 23 and 24 to conceal the gap in a terrace created by the railway passing through. To ensure adequate ventilation, most of the line was in cutting except for a [...] tunnel under Campden Hill. Construction of the District proceeded in parallel with {{the work on the}} Met and it too passed through expensive areas.

500|$|Unlike {{the railway}} the Metropolitan had opened in 1863, the route {{did not follow}} an easy {{alignment}} under existing roads and land values were higher, so <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for property were much higher.

Construction costs and <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> were so high that the cost of the first section of the District from South Kensington to Westminster was £3 million, almost three times the cost of the Met's original, longer line. On 24 December 1868, the District opened its line from South Kensington to Westminster, with stations at South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St. James's Park and Westminster Bridge (now Westminster), the Met extending eastwards from Brompton to a shared station at South Kensington on the same day.|$|E
