According to the invention, a method of arbitration in a network on an integrated circuit is provided, the network comprising a router unit, the router unit comprising a first <b>input</b> <b>port,</b> a second <b>input</b> <b>port</b> and an output port, wherein the router unit receives at least one first packet via the first <b>input</b> <b>port,</b> and wherein the router unit receives at least one second packet via the second <b>input</b> <b>port,</b> the router unit arbitrating between the first packet and the second packet, characterized in that the step of arbitrating is performed using a first label and a second label, the first label being attached to the first packet, and the second label being attached to the second packet.; This method relies on {{the perception that the}} arbitration performed by a router should be based on connection arbitration instead of <b>input</b> <b>port</b> arbitration. This means that instead of merely arbitrating between the contending <b>input</b> <b>ports</b> in a router, the arbitration should also take into account the connections to which packets correspond. This can be done by attaching labels to the packets, which labels are used in the arbitration process.

However, in a multibit modulator, quantization level errors in the internal multibit quantizer can limit the modulator's signal-to-noise-and-distortion and spurious-free dynamic range. For a CMOS {{analog-to-digital converter}} using a flash analog-to-digital converter as its internal quantizer, <b>comparator</b> <b>input</b> offset errors are {{a significant source of}} quantization level errors. This paper presents a dynamic element matching (DEM) technique, comparator offset DEM, that modulates the sign of the <b>comparator</b> <b>input</b> offsets with a random sequence and causes the offset errors to appear as white noise and attenuated spurious tones. Measured performance of a prototype modulator IC shows that comparator offset DEM enables it to achieve 98 -dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion and 105 -dB spurious-free dynamic range. Analysis and simulation of comparator offset DEM in a flash analog-to-digital converter with a periodic input and uniform dither give insight into its operation and quantify the spur attenuation it provides...|$|R
