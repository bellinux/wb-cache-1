The most basic defense against it is to monitor and audit the <b>computer</b> <b>logs.</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>logs,</b> however, have a huge amount of textual data. It is, therefore, almost impossible to inspect them manually using current systems. We propose a log visualization system called “Tudumi”. Tudumi consists of several functions which assist system administrators to perform such tasks manually. These functions are information visualization, log summarization and reflecting known rules into the visualization method. Tudumi makes it easier to detect anomalous user activities, such as intrusion, from a huge amount of <b>computer</b> <b>logs.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|Installation that is {{performed}} without user interaction during its progress or with no user present at all. One {{of the reasons}} to use this approach is to automate the installation {{of a large number}} of systems. An unattended installation either does not require the user to supply anything or has received all necessary input prior to the start of installation. Such input may be in the form of command line switches or an answer file, a file that contains all the necessary parameters. Windows XP and most Linux distributions are examples of operating systems that can be installed with an answer file. In unattended installation, it is assumed that there is no user to help mitigate errors. For instance, if the installation medium was faulty, the installer should fail the installation, as there is no user to fix the fault or replace the medium. Unattended installers may record errors in a <b>computer</b> <b>log</b> for later review.|$|E
5000|$|In F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, Alma {{initially}} {{appears to}} Sergeant Michael Becket {{at the beginning}} of the game in a hallucination in her child form, and subsequently appears for most of the game in her adult form after the destruction of the Origin reactor. Alma targets Becket due to his part in Project Harbinger, whereby he is endowed with the same psychic abilities as the F.E.A.R. Point Man and thus is affected by her in similar ways. Alma herself is drawn to him, with Genevieve Aristide describing Becket as a [...] "beacon" [...] for her (an entry in a <b>computer</b> <b>log</b> establishes Becket's 100-percent compatibility score). An Armacham researcher going by the moniker [...] "Snake Fist" [...] theorizes that Alma is drawn to Becket by a desire to kill and [...] "absorb" [...] him. When Alma initially makes contact with Becket in the school, she pulls back and regards him with interest; then she manifests in her third form, a naked, shapely young woman (reflecting her newfound desire towards Becket). During the course of the game, Alma attacks the other candidates for Project Harbinger, killing two of them. She also psychically attacks Harold Keegan, enthralling him and causing him to wander into the abandoned Still Island nuclear power plant. She attacks Becket himself physically, often assaulting and grappling with him, which he constantly fends off. Other times, she pulls Becket into hallucinations, often centering on a grassy hill and a single tree, from which Alma plays with a swing set that can be found on the Still Island reactor. Ultimately, when Becket is poised to be killed by Alma, she instead spares his life, having clearly developed feelings for him. Becket and squadmate Keira Stokes attempt to use a telesthetic amplifier to amplify Becket's own psychic abilities to defeat Alma, but before they can try, Genevieve Aristide kills Stokes and sabotages the plan, intending to seal Alma away with Becket and use her as leverage. Alma arrives before Aristide seals the device, and turns her attention on Becket, allowing Aristide to seal them both away. Alma establishes a psychic bond with Becket, and sends his mind into a hallucination where he fights off distorted images of Keegan while trying to activate the chamber within the hallucination; all the while Alma is raping Becket in the real world. At the end of the battle, Becket is apparently still sealed within the device. The door to the chamber then opens, revealing a destroyed landscape indicating that Becket is seeing things from Alma's point of view. Alma appears before him, and is now pregnant after conceiving a child with him. As she places Becket's hand on her belly, the fetus inside her utters 'Mommy'.|$|E

40|$|Patient {{encounter}} logs allow {{faculty to}} monitor students' clinical experiences, especially in decentralized clerkships. However, there are generally tradeoffs involving the expressiveness of patient encounter forms, {{the effort required}} to complete the forms, and {{the utility of the}} forms for informing the clerkship director. The family practice clerkship at Washington University changed the school's standard free text, paper log to a controlled vocabulary paper log, borrowing 93 generic ICD- 9 codes and the SNOMED concept of 'process at location' phrases for localized problems. Subsequently, this architecture was used in a Palm computer program. Students using the structured paper logs documented slightly more patient encounters than students using free text logs in the previous year, with similar numbers of problems per patient (1. 3 to 1. 4) and prevalence of common illnesses, but used the phrase structure and code vocabulary inconsistently. Students using computer logs documented many more patient encounters, but only documented 1. 09 problems per patient. Students' documentation of psychosocial diagnoses declined significantly with the <b>computer</b> <b>log.</b> Although the computer program was flexible, the effort required to enter multiple problems exceeded the effort of finding similar codes on a short paper form. This problem confounds efforts to monitor exposure to complex patients and hidden medical problems. Another design for the hand-held <b>computer</b> <b>log</b> is being tested...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the continual}} {{innovation}} in information technology, {{vast amounts of}} information in various forms have become available to people {{for the purpose of}} decision making and problem solving. Consequently, how to represent the information to facilitate the processes of decision making and problem solving becomes a significant issue. ^ The measurement scale and the shape of the decision matrix were proposed in this research as two information representation factors that influence the decision process. Hypotheses related to the transformation effort between measurement scales and the relationship between the number of alternatives and attributes were tested through two experiments based on the process tracing method. Sixty college students were recruited as subjects. A computerized information display board was developed to present the decision matrices and collect data. Subjects were also asked to verbalize their decision processes for further verbal protocol analysis. In Experiment 1, two independent variables were the value measurement scale with two levels (ordinal and interval), and the attribute measurement scale with three levels (nominal, ordinal and ratio). Three dependent variables representing the extent of particular decision strategies were obtained from subject 2 ̆ 7 s <b>computer</b> <b>log</b> and verbal protocol.
