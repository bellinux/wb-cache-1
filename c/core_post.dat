50|$|Some of the National's most {{challenging}} fences {{have also been}} modified, while still preserving them as formidable obstacles. After the 1989 Grand National, in which two horses died in incidents at Becher's Brook, Aintree began the most significant of its modifications to the course. The brook on the landing side of Becher's was filled in and, after the 2011 race which also saw an equine fatality at the obstacle, the incline on the landing side was levelled out and the drop on was reduced by between 4 and 5 inches (10-13 cm) to slow the runners. Other fences have also been reduced in height over the years, and the entry requirements for the race have been made stricter. Screening at the Canal Turn now prevents horses {{being able to see}} the sharp left turn and encourages jockeys to spread out along the fence, rather than take the tight left-side route. Additionally, work has been carried out to smooth the <b>core</b> <b>post</b> infrastructure of the fences with protective padding to reduce impact upon contact, and the height of the toe-boards on all fences has been increased to 14 in. These orange-coloured boards are positioned at the base of each fence and provide a clear ground line to assist horses in determining the base of the fence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the statue began on {{the last quarter of}} 2011 and was completed on January 5, 2015. The {{construction of}} the statue was done by a seven-man core team led by a Pilipino sculptor John A. Alaban from Roxas City and the foreman Jose Clarito. As of the date of completion, the giant statue of The Sacred Heart of Jesus of Roxas City is considered the largest life like statue of Jesus Christ in the Philippines. [...] It took a little more than three years for a seven-man core team to complete the construction but since the work runs on and off, the actual work span could be summed up to only about two years and 8 months more or less. The statue has a maximum height of 102 ft. / 31 m and mounted on a 9m / 30 ft high base making the total height 40 m. It is supported by a 0.40 m thick 3 m by 3 m elevator shaft style reinforced concrete <b>core</b> <b>post.</b> Every level of 3 meters high (equivalent to one standard building floor height) is separated by a horizontal slab. Inside the hollow statue is an access steel stair up to the 8th level. The stairs is {{for the use of the}} authorize crew only and is off limits to the public. Since one of the concepts of the construction is the so-called “built to last”, some forms or aesthetics have been deliberately compromised to give way to the stability of the structural design for the safety of the general public.|$|E
40|$|Three pollen {{diagrams}} {{were prepared}} to study Late Holocene vegetation change in the Kaikoura area. The vegetation on the Kahutara Hills has passed through a succession of formations; Leptospermum scrubland, Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest, pteridium fernland, and European grassland) over an undated time period. However, the Nothofagus element at Lake Rotoiti has remained relatively static and thus could imply that the <b>core</b> <b>post</b> dates the southward Nothofagus migration and spans about 6000 years. Fire throughout {{has been a constant}} feature of the environment, but correlates with the vegetation fonnations, suggesting that it may be responsible for the changes. The highest frequencies of fire correlate with the pteridium fernland and lowest frequencies with the Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest. Most of the fires were probably natural, however man has been at least partly responsible in the last 1000 years. The vegetation on the Kaikoura Peninsula, determined from dated pollen diagrams from Wairepo Lagoon and Mudstone Bay show that the vegetation has remained unaltered for 400 years. There is no record of the Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest recorded by Moar, (in Duckmanton, 1974), supposedly destroyed at about 300 years B. P. High charcoal frequencies, derived from Polynesian fires, could explain the lack of vegetation change. The environmental change of barrier beach building recorded by Duckmanton (1974), can be attributed to fire caused cliff instability and to Polynesian burning in the Kowhai and Hapuku Catchments. A coincidental tectonic uplift caused the barrier beaches to move and to enclose areas of shore platform behind which lagoons developed, slope deposits covering lagoonal peats (Duckmanton, 1974) are considered to be due to Maori Pa building. Sedimentation in European Times varied considerably. Silting at Lake Rotoiti, 4. 5 cms/ 10 years, was very rapid. On the Peninsula the effect of the European varied, from no effect at Wairepo Lagoon to a marked increase at Mudstone Bay. The pollen analysis however records no significant effect of the European on vegetation structure other than the change to introduced grassland...|$|E

As many endodontically treated posterior teeth loose more coronal tooth structure they need <b>post</b> and <b>core</b> for retention of their restorations. The researches have shown different results when using various <b>post</b> and <b>core</b> materials. A total of 20 recently extracted mandibular premolars were used in this study. After endodontic treatment all canals and coronal portions of teeth were prepared for amalgam cores. The teeth were randomly divided in two groups.

The {{purposes of this study}} were to investigate the properties of liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposites including biocompatibility, microhardness, and frictional forces of bracket-like blocks with different filler contents for further clinical applications. Methods: In this study, we evaluated liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials that exhibited various filler contents, by assessing their cell activity performance using a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and their microhardness with or without thermocycling. We also evaluated the frictional force between bracket-like duplicates and commercially available esthetic bracket systems using Instron 5566. Results: The liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials showed good biocompatibility. The materials having high filler content demonstrated greater microhardness compared with commercially available bracket materials, before and after the thermocycling treatment. Thus, manufacturing processes are important to reduce frictional force experienced by orthodontic brackets. Conclusion: The microhardness of the bracket-like blocks made by our new material is superior to the commercially available brackets, even after thermocycling. Our results indicate that the evaluated liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials are of an appropriate quality for application in dental <b>core</b> and <b>post</b> systems and in various restorations.

Materials and Methods: A 3 -dimesional finite element model of maxillary left canine tooth was constructed. All ceramic crown, composite <b>core,</b> tooth dentin, <b>post</b> and bone were modeled. In the first part {{of this study}}, initial body temperature was assumed to be 36. 5 °C and the outer temperature was reduced to 0 °C for 5 secs.

Materials and Methods: Sixty central incisor teeth were selected and grouped into six groups, viz. A, B, C, D, E, and F, each consisting of 10 specimens. Group A specimens were not subjected to any restorative treatment. Group B specimens were endodontically treated and crowned. Specimens of groups C and D were restored with custom cast <b>post</b> and <b>core.</b> Specimens of groups E and F were treated with prefabricated titanium <b>post</b> and composite <b>core.</b> Specimens of groups C and E were restored with porcelain-fused metal (PFM) crown having 2 mm ferrule. Specimens of groups D and F were restored with PFM crown having no ferrule. All the specimens were subjected to load (newton, N) on the lingual surface at a 135 &#x 00 B 0; angle to the long axis with a universal testing machine until it fractured. The fracture load and mode of fracture of each specimen were noted. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey honestly significant difference procedure was employed to identify the significant difference among the groups at 5 &#x 0025; level (P < 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences among the six groups studied (P < 0. 0001). The highest fracture strength was recorded with specimen of group C (1376. 7 N).
