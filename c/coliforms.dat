5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} fecal <b>coliforms,</b> {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal <b>coliforms</b> and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{water quality}} is not {{consistently}} good, especially in smaller systems. Portugal does {{not comply with}} a series of drinking water parameters (iron, manganese, total <b>coliforms,</b> faecal <b>coliforms,</b> faecal streptococci and clostridium) laid down in the EU drinking water directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total <b>coliforms,</b> while 20% of the zones do not comply with the faecal <b>coliforms</b> parameter.|$|E
30|$|For the {{identification}} of <b>coliform,</b> MPN test was done where 7 (18.42 %) samples showed positive. The standard plate count indicates that the total <b>coliform</b> in the drinking water was in the ranges of 14 – 40 in 100  ml of water samples in different areas and fecal <b>coliform</b> was detected in 6 (15.78 %) of total samples. But PCR analysis of LacZ gene for <b>coliform</b> and uidA gene for total <b>coliform</b> resulted in 10 (26.32 %) positive for faecal <b>coliform</b> and 7 (18.42 %) positive for only fecal <b>coliform</b> (Table  3, Fig.  2).|$|R
40|$|Four {{brands of}} {{membrane}} filters were examined for total and fecal <b>coliform</b> recovery performance by two experimental approaches. Using diluted EC broth cultures of water samples, Johns-Manville filters were superior to Sartorius filters for fecal <b>coliform</b> but equivalent for total <b>coliform</b> recovery. Using river water samples, Johns-Manville filters were superior to Sartorius filters for total <b>coliform</b> but equivalent for fecal <b>coliform</b> recovery. No differences were observed between Johns-Manville and Millipore or Millipore and Sartorius filters for total or fecal <b>coliform</b> recoveries using either approach, nor was any difference observed between Millipore and Gelman filters for fecal <b>coliform</b> recovery from river water samples.

40|$|Bacteriological {{data from}} 1980 to 1991 were {{reviewed}} {{to determine whether}} <b>coliform</b> bacteria occurred seasonally and spatially within a midwestern city's distribution system. <b>Coliform</b> bacteria are used as microbiological indicator organisms {{to determine if a}} public water supply is safe for consumption. The public water_ distribution system examined had at least a twelve year history of the presence of <b>coliform</b> bacteria. Previous investigations have described the occurrence of the <b>coliform</b> bacteria as sporadic because there were no apparent patterns to their presence. An analysis of bacteriological data has not previously been performed to specifically detect seasonal and spatial occurrences of <b>coliform</b> bacteria. This study attempted to determine if seasonal or spatial patterns of <b>coliform</b> occurrences exist within the in the dominant <b>coliform</b> species. Data indicate that the highest percentage of <b>coliform</b> positive samples occurred in the summer, followed by fall, then winter, with spring having the lowest percentage of <b>coliform</b> positive samples. While Enterobacter cloacae was the dominant <b>coliform</b> species during the spring, summer and fall, Klebsiella oxytoca was the dominant <b>coliform</b> during the winter. <b>Coliform</b> occurrence throughout the distribution system was variable among the 43 sample sites. The percentage of positive samples from the various sites ranged from 0 % to 10. 5 %. The five sites with the highest percentage of <b>coliform</b> positive samples were at the extremities of the distribution system. E. cloacae was dominant at 88 % of the sites. K. oxytoca was dominant at 9 % sites, which typically had a low percentage of <b>coliform</b> positive samples. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
25|$|According to 2002 figures by {{the service}} {{providers}} only 73.6% {{of drinking water}} quality samples showed satisfactory drinking water quality, {{as measured by the}} absence of total <b>coliforms,</b> compared to a standard of 95%. The presence of <b>coliforms</b> as such is not a health hazard, but that the presence of <b>coliforms</b> is an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{drinking}} water, Portugal {{still does}} not comply {{with some of the}} parameters of the EU directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total <b>coliforms,</b> while 20% of the zones do not comply with the faecal <b>coliforms</b> parameter. The situation improved in 2004, the most recent year for which Portugal provided data.|$|E
25|$|Although {{few studies}} on water quality {{have been carried}} out {{over the last two decades}} and there is a crucial lack of {{adequate}} and consistent monitoring, scattered evidence suggests that the levels of nutrients, organic matter, and bacteriological contamination in water are high. For example, the proportion of samples with <b>coliforms</b> in aqueducts served by INAPA (the main water company, supplying 40 percent of the population) increased from 17 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998. This is particularly striking because according to DR standards, presence of <b>coliforms</b> in more than 5 percent of samples indicates that water is no longer potable.|$|E

40|$|Waterborne {{outbreaks}} of pathogenic bacteria from contaminated water are serious threats for public health. <b>Coliform</b> bacteria have {{been regarded as}} one of the most important indicators for monitoring pathogenic bacteria. To address potential pathogenic bacterial outbreaks, the distribution and diversity of <b>coliform</b> bacteria in Jiahe river, which flows through densely-populated urban area in China, were detected. Escherichia Colt and other <b>coliform</b> bacteria were counted using the membrane filter technique to describe the distribution of the <b>coliform</b> bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis was applied to investigate the diversity of the <b>coliform</b> bacteria. The results suggested that the quantities of <b>coliform</b> bacteria varied greatly between five sampling sites with the highest value at site YT 4 and the lowest value at site YT 2. Highest concentrations of E. coli and other <b>coliform</b> bacteria were also observed at YT 4, while the lowest value was detected at sites YT 3 and YT 2, respectively. Various <b>coliform</b> bacteria were classified by phylogenetic analysis, including Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Raoultella. Components of <b>coliform</b> bacteria affiliated into these four genera were various in all sampling sites. The statistical analysis suggested that the distribution of <b>coliform</b> bacteria were remarkably influenced by total bacteria amount. Multiple environmental parameters were proved to affect the diversity of <b>coliform</b> bacteria. The results of this study revealed the correlation between <b>coliform</b> bacteria and the environmental parameters, which is important for predicting and preventing waterborne transmission of pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{survey of}} the {{occurrence}} of fecal indicator bacteria (total <b>coliform</b> TC, fecal <b>coliform</b> FC) in Kengeri lake was carried out {{during the period of}} 3 years (Jan 2005 to Dec 2007) using membrane filter (MF) technique. The study was implemented to assess the hygiene of water quality in order to give an indication about the actual magnitude of fecal pollution post the discharge of domestic sewage discharge. The total <b>coliform</b> was high in April, may and low in September while fecal <b>coliform</b> was high in June, July and September and low in April. On the basis of the result water was considered to be unsatisfactory for domestic and agricultural purposes throughout the study period.

25|$|After {{passing through}} Varanasi, and {{receiving}} 32 streams of raw sewage from the city, {{the concentration of}} fecal <b>coliforms</b> in the river's waters rises from 60,000 to 1.5 million, with observed peak values of 100 million per 100 ml. Drinking and bathing in its waters therefore carries {{a high risk of}} infection.|$|E
25|$|Originally, fecal {{contamination}} {{was determined}} {{with the presence}} of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful fecal pathogens. The presence of fecal <b>coliforms</b> (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia lamblia, Legionella, and viruses (enteric). Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.|$|E
25|$|In {{waters of}} the U.S., Canada and other countries, water quality is {{monitored}} to protect {{the health of the}} general public. Bacteria contamination is one monitored pollutant. In the U.S., fecal coliform testing is one of the nine tests of water quality that form the overall water-quality rating in a process used by U.S. EPA. The fecal coliform assay should only be used to assess the presence of fecal matter in situations where fecal <b>coliforms</b> of non-fecal origin are not commonly encountered. EPA has approved a number of different methods to analyze samples for bacteria.|$|E
30|$|<b>Coliform</b> {{group of}} {{bacteria}} are indicators of pathogenic organisms {{and the presence}} of <b>coliform</b> in water is an indicator of contamination of human or animal faecal waste. Human waste contamination in water causes water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid and hepatitis (Theron and Cloete 2002; Elko et al. 2003; Sood et al. 2008). According to BIS, the <b>coliform</b> count should be < 10 colonies/ 100  ml and absence of faecal <b>coliform</b> in water samples. During the analysis, average count of total <b>coliform</b> in water varied from 28  ±  4.26 to 105  ±  11.51 and from 25  ±  1.48 to 84  ±  10.45 colonies/ 100  ml and faecal <b>coliform</b> varied from 2  ±  2.12 to 23  ±  4.97 and from 2  ±  1.48 to 12  ±  2.69 colonies/ 100  ml in PRM and POM seasons, respectively. The analyzed data showed that water of all the rivers is contaminated with total and faecal <b>coliform.</b> High level of <b>coliform</b> counts in water samples indicates a contaminated source, inadequate treatments or post-treatment deficiencies and inadequate as well as unhygienic handling of solid waste.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of six {{different}} aeration rates on elimination of total and faecal <b>coliform</b> bacteria was investigated during in-vessel aerobic composting of vegetable–fruit wastes.

25|$|When {{analysing}} environmental samples, {{various types}} of indicator organisms are used to check for fecal pollution of the sample. Commonly used indicators for bacteriological water analysis include the bacterium Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) and non-specific fecal <b>coliforms.</b> With regards to samples of soil, sewage sludge, biosolids or fecal matter from dry toilets, helminth eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.|$|E
500|$|E. coli {{belongs to}} a group of {{bacteria}} informally known as <b>coliforms</b> that are found in the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. E. coli normally colonizes an infant's gastrointestinal tract within 40 hours of birth, arriving with food or water or from the individuals handling the child. [...] In the bowel, E. coli adheres to the mucus of the large intestine. It is the primary facultative anaerobe of the human gastrointestinal tract. (Facultative anaerobes are organisms that can grow in either {{the presence or absence of}} oxygen.) As long as these bacteria do not acquire genetic elements encoding for virulence factors, they remain benign commensals.|$|E
500|$|The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has {{monitored}} Little Butte Creek {{for eight}} different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity.

About 40percent of the streams in the Little Butte Creek watershed were listed on the 2002 DEQ 303d list. The entire main stem exceeded the standard level for temperature, oxygen saturation, fecal <b>coliforms</b> (bacteria), and turbidity.

40|$|The use {{of models}} for {{predicting}} changes in water quality parameters is currently considered {{an integral part of}} river basin management. The application of modeling techniques to <b>coliform</b> organisms is in its infancy due to the complexities involved and the lack of definitive information on <b>coliform</b> populations in natural environments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to make a comparative analysis of the available models for <b>coliform</b> organisms in order to improve on the state of the art of this subject. The available <b>coliform</b> models may be classified into deterministic or statistical types. In this study, six different models, three of each type, were selected for analysis and were applied to <b>coliform</b> data available on the Leaf River. Results of comparing the models indicated that a deterministic model was best suited for total <b>coliform</b> and a statistical model was best suited for fecal <b>coliform.</b> Ultimate selection of a model for <b>coliform</b> organisms is dependent not only on the accuracy of the model but on ease of implementation.

40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the sanitary quality of three freshwater springs by estimating the concentration of total <b>coliform</b> (TC) and faecal <b>coliform</b> (FC) bacteria as pollution indicators. Water samples were collected twice a month during the period August 2008 to January 2009; from springs on the island of Upolu, Samoa. For bacteriological analysis, the membrane filtration method was used for the two groups of bacteria. All samples from the three sites were found contaminated with total <b>coliform</b> and faecal <b>coliform</b> bacteria and the counts were higher than the maximum microbial contaminant level established by World Health Organization (WHO).
