40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> as a {{means of}} {{corroboration}} of a debt in business relations The theme of this Masterʼs degree thesis is the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> {{as a means}} of corroboration of a debt in business relations. The author has chosen this topic because the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> is a traditional private institution, which enjoys great popularity for its function and relative simplicity of negotiation in current practice. The <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> improves a creditorʼs status. It makes a borrowers fulfil their confirmed obligation since in case of its violation, they would have to provide the creditor with performance representing both generalized compensation of the damage and a penalty. In spite of a frequent use of the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty,</b> its legislation is rather brief and does not cover all problematic aspects. The relevance of the topic increased with recodification of the private law. The main aim of the thesis is to explore legislative changes and their impact on selected problematic aspects of the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> using chosen methodology.

The Master degree's thesis is concerned with <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty.</b> The topic was chosen because <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> has been an important often-used instrument of confirming debts for many years. Through its functions, it contributes to compliance with the fundamental principle of private law - "pacta sunt servanda". The aim of the study is to analyse and assess <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> on the basis of valid Czech law, related judicial decisions and professional literature chiefly with the use of language, logical, systematic and teleological method of legal reasoning. The text is based on the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., The Civil Code, which is to become effective on 1 st January 2014. The Act's legal rules are compared to the former ones so that the changes of law can be described as a result of recodification of private law. The thesis is focused on the most important and the most discussed issues regarding <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty.</b> Chapter one is devoted to general characterization of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> with respect to its functions and accessory character. Chapter two deals with the prerequisites for commencement of the claim on <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> - a valid and proper agreement on <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> and a breach of the secured [...] ...|$|E

The purpose of the thesis is to analyze selected contentious issues concerning the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty,</b> especially discretionary power of a judge to reduce its unreasonable amount, to confront controversial theoretical opinions as well as non-conforming conclusions drawn from the juristic theory and established practice of the courts and add own opinion on the discussed matters.

40|$|During {{economic}} crisis well developed public private partnerships (PPP) give {{an opportunity to}} even though realise necessary infrastructural projects. Four key characteristics of PPP – lifecycle view of the project, risk allocation, performance-oriented payments, output-oriented tenders – may lead to high efficiency advantages compared to traditional procurement as a result. So far three different types of PPP were used within motorway-projects in Germany – the so called F-Modell, A-Modell and Funktionsbauvertrag. An analysis of the to date realised projects showed, that – besides the actual choice of the project – the risk to determine the future traffic volume is a key issue of success. The {{in the course of}} this thesis developed availability based approach changes the projects financial basis from the PPP-traditional traffic volume based payments to availability remunerations. To obtain the basic availability payment it is necessary to calculate the total amount of costs that will occur during the projects entire lifecycle. Based on the thus determined net present value and the duration of payments you may identify a yearly annuity, which represents the maximum amount of the availability based payments and upper ceiling during the tender procedure. If the private operator is not able to provide full availability – be it quality or quantity based –, the public body is given the possibility to withhold parts of the payment as <b>contractual</b> <b>penalties.</b> These <b>contractual</b> <b>penalties</b> may be determined as a percentage of the payments (if quality based availability is not sufficient) or as a monetary amount, which is calculated by valuating the due to the construction site caused consequences to the national economy. For this purpose the necessary evaluation criteria are the extra time of traffic congestion, the change of costs of car accidents, the change of operating resources consumption and the variation of pollutant emissions. The in chapter 5 calculated example proved that this new approach offers more service for the same costs of the so far used A-Modell and gives the public body even the possibility to gain time, as there are some variations of payment which allow the concession donator not to pay during the entire construction phase. Another advantage of this new model is that the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalties</b> really do show the effects of an operators failure to the economy and are therefore not a result of negotiations between the public and private contracting partners but engineering calculations...|$|R

In this contribution {{we look at this}} question from a different angle by modelling a monopolist trying to find optimal prices when contracts without penalty as well as contracts with penalties are offered simultaneously to a class of buyers who face different levels of loss risks. We find that neither changes in legal indemnities nor in privately stipulated fines alter those prices. Also, seller’s profit and consumer surplus are not influenced by such changes. Therefore we conclude that full enforcement of penalty clauses as agreed upon is the best recommendation in order to reap benefits like optimal inter-party risk-allocation.

Author chose this topic because <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> is {{important}} and very often-used institute through which parties to the contract can secure their obligations. This instrument should guarantee that the debtor would perform his main (primary) commitment to the creditor. If not, he may be punished for a breach of the contract even if there won't arise any damage (loss) on the creditor's side. This fact represents considerable advantage over other similar institutes. The study is focused on issues of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> in commercial relations, specifically in a situation when both parties to the contract are businessmen and they entered into agreement in connection with their business. However the legislation of the instrument is relatively brief (articles 544 and 545 of the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., The Civil Code and articles 300 to 302 of the Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., The Commercial Code, which includes a special regulation for business relations), many questions and uncertainties can be found.

40|$|Abstract. Service-based Applications (SBA) are {{deployed}} in highly dy-namic and distributed settings, where {{various parts of}} the constituent components- services and their infrastructure- are controlled by dif-ferent third parties. In such a loosely coupled environment, adaptation capabilities are needed to manage deviations and unforeseen situations which might lead to negative consequences (e. g. <b>contractual</b> <b>penalties).</b> Current approaches either focus on cross-layer-adaptation or the pre-vention of SLA violations. In contrast to this, the approach presented in this paper combines both. The paper presents an architecture as a generic framework for the management of arising problems during ser-vice execution. Multiple adaptation mechanisms are available to react on adaptation needs, acting on different layers of the SBA (including e. g. the composition layer and the infrastructure layer). The final goal of the cross-layer adaptation capability is to avoid the violation of agreed Service Level (in SLAs) and thus ensure the benefits of SBAs for both customers and providers. ...|$|R
