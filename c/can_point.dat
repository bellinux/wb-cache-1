The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} a liquid crystal could also be {{characterized}} by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director <b>can</b> <b>point</b> in either of two antiparallel directions).

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player <b>can</b> <b>point</b> at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E

5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they <b>can</b> <b>point</b> out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna <b>can</b> <b>point</b> the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{question}} of external relationships of Kalaw Lagaw Ya is also complicated by tantalising resemblances between the Paman (Australian) and the Trans-Fly (Papuan) languages. Though few, these may be significant, and include forms such as those noted below, not all of which appear in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Such resemblances <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to a deep-level relationship dating back to before the flooding of Torres Strait {{at the end of}} the last age, as well as to later contacts.|$|E
25|$|At first glance, {{sea urchins}} often appear {{incapable}} of moving. Sometimes, {{the most visible}} life sign is the spines, which attach to ball-and-socket joints and <b>can</b> <b>point</b> in any direction. In most urchins, touch elicits a prompt reaction from the spines, which converge toward the touch point. Sea urchins have no visible eyes, legs, or means of propulsion, but can move freely over hard surfaces using adhesive tube feet, working {{in conjunction with the}} spines. Regular sea urchins don't have any favourite walking direction.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{are often}} {{monitored}} without treatment. While {{many of those}} with minor status do not require transfusion therapy, they still risk iron overload, particularly in the liver. A serum ferritin test checks iron levels and <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to further treatment. Although not life-threatening on its own, it can affect quality of life due to the anemia. Minor often coexists with other conditions such as asthma and can cause iron overload of the liver and in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, lead to more severe outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Blood testing {{includes}} liver enzymes, serology (i.e. for autoantibodies), {{nucleic acid}} testing (i.e. for hepatitis virus DNA/RNA), blood chemistry, and complete blood count. Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to certain causes or stages of hepatitis. Generally, AST and ALT are elevated {{in most cases}} of hepatitis {{regardless of whether the}} patient shows any symptoms. However, the degree of elevation (i.e. levels in the hundreds vs. in the thousands), the predominance for AST vs. ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{interest}} in power-law relations stems partly from {{the ease with}} which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are the Pareto's law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, and scaling laws in biological systems. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, sociology, economics and more.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

Deviation of the trachea (a condition in which the trachea shifts from its position at the midline of the neck), [...] in conjunction with other known symptoms of OFC <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.|$|E
500|$|A stroke is a {{decrease}} in blood supply to {{an area of the}} brain causing cell death and brain injury.

Symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and <b>can</b> <b>point</b> to the likely site and cause of the stroke. Difficulties with movement, speech, or sight usually relate to the cerebrum, whereas imbalance, double vision, vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum.|$|E

40|$|Several topics {{related to}} packing on a sphere are discussed: packing points, packing lines through the center, and packing k-flats in {{dimension}} d. Two {{frequently asked questions}} in the graphics community (e. g., on the Usenet newsgroup comp. graphics. algorithms) are: How <b>can</b> <b>points</b> be randomly placed on a sphere?, and, How <b>can</b> <b>points</b> be regularly arranged on a sphere? I will start with these two questions and move to generalizations: packing lines in space and packing affine subspaces in higherdimensional spaces. 1 Random Points on a Sphere Define a zone on a sphere to be the portion between two parallel planes that both intersect the sphere. For a sphere S of radius r, the area of a zone of width h is 2 ßrh. This area is independent of where S is sliced, a fact that may seem countertuitive. The implication is that the z-coordinates (say) of random points on a sphere are uniformly distributed. Thus random points (x; y; z) on a sphere of radius 1 can be generated as follows: 1. Choose z [...] ...|$|R
