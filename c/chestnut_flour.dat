5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. <b>Chestnut</b> <b>flour</b> is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} drying {{conditions}} on morphological and chemical properties of two Portuguese Castanea sativa varieties (Longal and Martainha) was evaluated. All chestnut drying curves {{were found to}} be different according to drying temperatures (40 C, 50 C, 60 C and 70 C). Those conditions also affected both chemical composition of flours and morphological properties of starch. Colour parameters of the flours (L* c*h) generally decreased with increasing drying temperature, total colour difference (TCD*) also significantly changed for samples dried at different tested conditions. The drying temperature seems to affect starch morphology, with Longal starch granules always somewhat smaller. The results showed that the higher the drying temperature, the higher the reducing sugars content and the lower the starch content. In what concerns differences among the studied varieties, it can be stated that Longal presents whiter flours, higher reducing sugars content, lower starch and sucrose contents. In opposition, Martainha flours presented lower percentage of amylose and damaged starch. From the results it can be concluded that the marked effects that drying temperature exerted on the characteristics and properties of <b>chestnut</b> <b>flours</b> are different in both varieties studie...|$|R

40|$|Sweet {{chestnut}} (Castanea sativa Mill.) {{belongs to}} the family Fagaceae and sub family Castaneoideae. Bioactive components such as tannins are present in sweet chestnut in high proportion giving astringent bitter taste and reducing their palatability. Roasting reduces the anti-nutritional factors in chestnut. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the effects of pan and microwave roasting on physicochemical, functional, rheological and antioxidant properties of sweet chestnut. Antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH inhibition activity, reducing power, and total phenolic content. Structural analysis was carried out using FT-IR analysis. Protein, fat, and ash contents displayed insignificant (P >  0. 05) variations. “L” value decreased from 90. 66 to 81. 43, whereas, “a” and “b” values increased from 0. 02 to 0. 90 and 11. 99 to 20. 5, respectively, upon roasting. Significant (P <  0. 05) increase in water absorption capacity (1. 32 – 3. 39  g/g), oil absorption capacity (1. 22 – 1. 63  g/g), and antioxidant properties was observed following roasting. Flour obtained from roasted chestnuts exhibited a significant decrease in light transmittance, foaming, and pasting properties. Higher gelatinization temperatures and lower enthalpies were reported in microwave and pan roasted <b>chestnut</b> <b>flours.</b> Roasting also reduced the viscoelastic behavior of native sweet chestnut and changed the transmittance of identical functional groups as revealed by FT-IR analysis...|$|R

Ground beef was purchased on three different days, each defining a batch during study 1. Treatments, added based on meat weight, included a control, 0. 2 percent rosemary (RM), 0. 02 percent BHA/BHT, 0. 5 percent Chardonnay grape seed flour (CG), 0. 1 percent and 0. 25 percent <b>chestnut</b> wood <b>flour</b> (CN), and 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent of four sorghum bran varieties: black (BS), black with tannin (BTS), white (WS), and high tannin (TS). Patties, formed in duplicate, were randomly designated as cooked or raw and by 0 to 5 day storage, and were aerobically stored at 4 degrees C. Cooked patties were analyzed using the TBARS method. Raw patties were analyzed for subjective and objective color, number of ingredient specks, and pH. In study 2, six treatments were chosen for sensory evaluation including a control, 0. 2 percent RM, 0. 02 percent BHA/BHT, 0. 5 percent CG, 0. 1 percent CN, and 0. 5 percent BTS. Preparation, and raw and cooked analysis occurred similar to study 1. Additional patties were made for day 1 consumption by consumer panelists. In study 1, all treatments except 0. 25 percent WS reduced TBARS values over time compared to 0. 2 percent RM. Four treatments (0. 5 percent BTS, 0. 5 percent CG, 0. 25 percent CN, and 0. 1 percent CN) showed no significant increase in TBARS values over storage. BS and BTS yielded the lowest color space values (CIE L*, a*, and b*; P< 0. 0001). Ingredient specks were possible color measurement influences. In both studies antioxidant addition reduced TBARS values over time compared to the control (P< 0. 0001), and percent discoloration was highest in patties containing a sorghum treatment (P< 0. 0001). Patties containing 0. 1 percent CN were significantly favored in terms of overall like (P< 0. 0002) and flavor like (P< 0. 0001). Patties containing 0. 2 percent RM were ranked lowest in overall and flavor like, and ground beef-like bite. Patties containing 0. 5 perent CG were least liked according to tenderness level (P< 0. 005).

5000|$|Large-scale {{cultivation}} of the chestnut tree {{was introduced in}} Corsica during the Genoese domination. Rich in calories, the fruits were plucked (without gloves) and dried, and placed on a wooden grating (a grata) above a fire (u fucone) for one month: this fire, placed on a dry clay base 1 m2 wide and 20 cm thick, smokes also the charcuterie and heats the house. After that, they are ground to produce <b>chestnut</b> <b>flour,</b> which gets an unmistakable smoke flavour from this process. The unplucked chestnuts are eaten by the pigs scratching around in the forest. These are additionally fed with <b>chestnut</b> <b>flour,</b> so that their meat acquires a characteristic taste. Used to prepare polenta (pulenta, pulenda) and cakes, this flour was the basic staple food for the Corsican. The importance of chestnut in Corsican life can be argued {{from the fact that}} during a traditional wedding lunch taking place in 19th century Castagniccia, not less than twenty-two different courses were prepared using chestnuts as main ingredient.Today <b>chestnut</b> <b>flour</b> is a French AOC and a European AOP, under the name [...] "Farine de châtaigne corse-Farina castagnina corsa".

Especially stuffed pasta is popular, like ravioli and cannelloni: both are stuffed with brocciu, similar to the Italian ricotta, ravioli together with spinachs. Pasta sauce with tomatoes and minced meat (Salsa pe a pastasciutta) is also typical. Other preparations reflect the Italian tradition too: sturzaprezi (literally [...] "priest chokers") are large gnocchi baked in an oven made with brocciu and spinach, akin to the Italian dumpling version of this dish; Panizzi are fritters prepared with gram flour [...] similar to the Sicilian panelle. Lasagne and gnocchi with meat sauce (lasagne incu a salsa and Gnocchi manera bastiaccia, [...] "Gnocchi at the mode of Bastia"), are also popular. Although corn polenta is known, in Corsica Pulenta for antonomasia is that prepared with <b>chestnut</b> <b>flour,</b> pulenta castagnina. Another dish whose main ingredient is <b>chestnut</b> <b>flour</b> is Maccaredda, fritters fried together with panzetta (bacon). Razighe, from Rusio, are thin dough pancakes made of wheat flour, yeast, egg and cracklings (a byproduct of sdruttu processing).
