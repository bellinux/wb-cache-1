5|$|The Civil Air Patrol is {{well known}} for its search {{activities}} in conjunction with search and rescue (SAR) operations. <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> involved with approximately threequarters of all aerial inland SAR missions directed by the United States Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. Outside of the continental United States, CAP directly supports the Joint Rescue Coordination Centers in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> credited with saving an average of 100 lives per year.|$|E
5|$|The driver gets to add {{their own}} {{personal}} touch every year to the Wreck. The front license plate is chosen by the driver every year and the radiator <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> replaced yearly as well. The <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> typically a flying quail or a wreath. After each driver's term, the driver gets to keep the two pennants as well.|$|E
5|$|All health {{policies}} {{sold in the}} United States {{must provide}} an annual maximum out of pocket (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums).

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky <b>cap,</b> <b>is</b> an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{resembles the}} various species of true morel, {{although}} {{the latter are}} more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> generally darker and larger.|$|E
50|$|After the Machtergreifung of the Nazis, the {{gymnasium}} <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> banned for political reasons. Literature describing student <b>caps</b> <b>was</b> burned.Students received new clothing from the League of German Girls and the Hitler Youth. gymnasium students {{were forbidden to}} wear clothing that identified them as members of their school.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} light driving force induced surface deformation on azobenzene-containing polymers. The surface deformation is attributed to light-induced mass migration inside the polymers. Circular <b>cap</b> arrays <b>are</b> firstly fabricated by high power laser ablation via polarization controlled three-beam interference. The circular <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> subsequently exposed to polarization controlled two-beam interfering field. The results illuminate that when the interfering laser beams are both set to P polarization, the circular <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> deformed. While the laser beams are of other interfering modes like (S, S) and (+ 45 °, - 45 °), the <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> seldom deformed. The circular <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> also exposed to single intensity-homogeneous linearly polarized laser beam. The deformation of the caps keeps {{the same direction as}} the irradiating polarization. A model based on the focusing effect of the circular <b>caps</b> <b>is</b> addressed to explain the origin of the light driving force for mass migration in azopolymers. The all-optical approach for the production of deformed <b>caps</b> can <b>be</b> used to generate aspherical lens, which may be applied to many domains...|$|R

5|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis, {{commonly}} known as the Mt. Baker waxy cap, the brown almond waxy cap or the tawny almond waxy <b>cap,</b> <b>is</b> a species of fungus in the Hygrophoraceae family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> brown in the center and cream to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide, <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> a major {{operator}} of single-engine general aviation aircraft, {{used in the}} execution of its various missions, including orientation flights for cadets {{and the provision of}} significant emergency services capabilities.

50|$|A center <b>cap,</b> or centercap <b>is</b> a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center <b>caps</b> for automobiles <b>were</b> small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the spindle nut and wheel bearings of vehicles. Center <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> often found on new cars to hide the lug nuts, and/or the bearing. Center <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> a type of hubcap, the other primary type being wheel covers. Some modern center <b>caps</b> <b>are</b> retained to the wheel using spring clips, while others are retained by the wheel lugs or other threaded fasteners.|$|R
50|$|The Concerned Alumni of Princeton (<b>CAP)</b> <b>was</b> a {{group of}} {{politically}} conservative former Princeton University students that existed between 1972 and 1986. <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> born in 1972 {{from the ashes of}} the Alumni Committee to Involve Itself Now (ACTION), which was founded in opposition to the college becoming coeducational in 1969. Some claim that <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> founded to bring the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) back to the Princeton campus after the ROTC building was burned down by anti-war activists and the Princeton administration refused to rebuild it. However, the ROTC had returned to campus by the time <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> founded. The primary motivation behind <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> {{to limit the number of}} women admitted to the university. CAP also opposed affirmative action designed to increase minority attendance at the Ivy League institution. CAP also exhibited strong support for Princeton's eating clubs, which were male-only at the time.|$|R

Its <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy <b>cap,</b> <b>is</b> a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol (<b>CAP)</b> <b>is</b> a congressionally chartered, federally {{supported}} non-profit {{corporation that}} serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership that includes people from all backgrounds, lifestyles, and occupations. It performs three congressionally assigned key missions: emergency services, which includes search and rescue (by air and ground) and disaster relief operations; aerospace education for youth and the general public; and cadet programs for teenage youth. In addition, CAP has recently been tasked with homeland security and courier service missions. CAP also performs non-auxiliary missions for various governmental and private agencies, such as local law enforcement and the American Red Cross. The program is established as an organization by Title 10 of the United States Code and its purposes defined by Title 36.|$|E
5|$|The death <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> {{native to}} Europe, {{where it is}} widespread.

50|$|The Monmouth <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> {{an item of}} woollen {{headgear}} fashionable {{between the}} 15th and 18th centuries, and associated with the town of Monmouth in south east Wales. The knitted round <b>caps</b> <b>were</b> used by both soldiers and sailors, and they were widely exported.|$|R
5|$|The flesh in the <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} irregularly {{arranged}} cylindrical hyphae from 5 to 15μm wide. They stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The flesh in {{the stem}} {{is made up of}} hyphae which run down the stem and measure 4 to 11μm in thickness. The smooth cell walls are colorless, but again stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The septa have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the <b>cap,</b> <b>is</b> a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{yellowish}} hyphae {{are between}} 15 and 13.5μm wide with {{a wall of}} variable thickness. There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> radial, and {{is made up of}} yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20μm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a cutis, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm.|$|E
