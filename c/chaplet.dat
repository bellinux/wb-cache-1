During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.|$|E

25|$|On 13 September 1935, {{while still}} in Vilnius, Faustina wrote of a vision about the <b>Chaplet</b> of Divine Mercy in her diary (Notebook I item 476). The <b>chaplet</b> is {{about a third of}} the length of the Rosary. Faustina wrote that the purpose for chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.|$|E

There is also a <b>Chaplet</b> to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion. It is also used in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{escutcheon}} (shield), {{there are}} three main features: the heath, the escallop shells and the book. The heath refers to the common heath (epacris impressa), which is the floral emblem of the State of Victoria, a highly relevant symbol being Victoria's third university. In a sense, it also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians, particularly regional Victorians, {{which at the time}} had felt excluded by the establishment of metropolitan-centred universities. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both sprigs of heath together to form a <b>chaplet.</b> The <b>chaplet</b> itself is a seemingly unintended reference to the State, as it traditionally represented victory (and hence, Victoria).|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} <b>chaplets.</b> These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the <b>chaplets</b> become part of the casting, the <b>chaplets</b> must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper <b>chaplets</b> are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|R

25|$|Later in 1936, Faustina became ill, since speculated to be tuberculosis. She {{was moved}} to the {{sanatorium}} in Prądnik, Kraków.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known monument {{is a small}} terracotta {{found in}} Athens, with a dedication to Hecate, in writing of {{the style of the}} 6th century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a <b>chaplet</b> bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at Athens to be earlier than the Persian invasion.|$|E
40|$|This study, {{conducted}} in the 'open' reef systems of Solomon Islands, assessed growth and survival of blacklip pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera, L.) on <b>chaplets</b> in suspended culture. Oysters were robust and mortalities after handling and drilling were low (< 0. 6 %). Survival of an initial batch of P. margaritifera was 87 % after 1 year. Groups of oysters with mean dorsoventral measurements (DVM) of 63 and 71 mm showed mean (± SE) annual growth rates of 64 ± 2 and 60 ± 1 mm, respectively. Growth rates compared favorably with those reported for P. margaritifera in Polynesia and indicate that oysters caught as spat (approx. 11 mm, DVM) would reach acceptable size for 'seeding' (110 mm DVM) in around 16 months. Oysters on <b>chaplets</b> were subject to significant fouling by algae, however, survival of oysters cleaned every 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks was 96 - 97 % over a 7 -month period. Growth of oysters cleaned every 3 weeks was significantly greater than those cleaned every 2 or 6 weeks. Oysters became detached from <b>chaplets</b> (through drill-hole breakage) in significant numbers; this problem was greater for smaller oysters. When oysters were attached singly on <b>chaplets,</b> approximately 54 % made byssal attachments to the rope; however, 90 % of oysters held in pairs on <b>chaplets</b> made byssal attachments to each other. Although paired oysters could be cleaned more rapidly than oysters hung singly, shell growth (DVM) of paired oysters was significantly reduced...|$|R
