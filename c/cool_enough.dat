5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog <b>cool.</b> <b>Enough</b> food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5000|$|The Archean Eon ( [...] , also spelled Archaean) is a {{geologic}} eon, [...] (4 to 2.5 billion years), {{that followed}} the Hadean Eon and preceded the Proterozoic Eon. During the Archean, the Earth's crust had <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to allow the formation of continents.|$|R
40|$|The CMB {{polarization}} {{was produced}} as light scattered off a primordial cloud of protons and electrons nearly 14 billion years ago, about 400, 000 {{years after the}} Big Bang.

50|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 20th century, this cone had eruptions as high as 40 feet (12 m). As the water level in Yellowstone Lake has increased, the cone is now {{inundated}} during the spring and the temperatures in the cone have <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> {{that it no longer}} erupts and is now considered a hot spring.|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E
50|$|Among {{these was}} a {{suitable}} local oscillator about 45 MHz {{different than the}} transmitter signal, which fed the intermediate frequency section of the receiver circuits. The {{problem was that the}} magnetron's frequency drifted as it warmed and <b>cooled,</b> <b>enough</b> that some sort of tuneable microwave source was needed who's frequency could be adjusted to match. A second magnetron wouldn't work, they would not drift in sync.|$|R
60|$|It was true, and {{to pacify}} her, Mrs. Norris sent a child up to bid Petros have the horses ready, and Anna was persuaded to swallow a little too, which happily had <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> for her haste, but she hurried off, leaving Mrs. Norris to expend her {{hospitality}} on Davy, who endured his drenching like a fish, and {{could hardly wait}} even to swallow thick bread-and-butter till he could rush off to hear of his dear Master Fergus.|$|R
50|$|The cycling {{historian}} Raymond Henry says repairs before Rustin’s invention {{were made}} by cutting a patch from a discarded air tube, scraping it with a file, then cleaning it with petrol. The repair patch and punctured tube were then coated with rubber solution and each heated above a flame until the rubber had reached the correct temperature and softeness. The patch was then pressed on to the air tube and held until the rubber had <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to make the attachment permanent.|$|R
25|$|Spectral {{lines from}} {{titanium}} oxide are prominent in class M stars, which are <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to allow molecules of this chemical to form.|$|E
25|$|Unlike stars, older {{brown dwarfs}} are {{sometimes}} <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> that, over very {{long periods of}} time, their atmospheres can gather observable quantities of methane which cannot form in hotter objects. Dwarfs confirmed in this fashion include Gliese 229B.|$|E
25|$|Class L dwarfs {{get their}} {{designation}} {{because they are}} cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs. They are a very dark red in color and brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra.|$|E
50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down the sprue, into the mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the rough casting. The rough casting is separated from the sprue and riser(s) either by sawing them off, or just breaking the thin metal of the gates and runners.|$|R
25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it {{is removed from the}} equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are <b>cooled</b> <b>enough,</b> whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.|$|R
50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{compression}} may be used: liquid ring, reciprocating, or centrifugal. The chlorine gas is compressed {{at this stage}} and may be further cooled by inter- and after-coolers. After compression it flows to the liquefiers, where it is <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to liquefy. Non condensible gases and remaining chlorine gas are vented off {{as part of the}} pressure control of the liquefaction systems. These gases are routed to a gas scrubber, producing sodium hypochlorite, or used in the production of hydrochloric acid (by combustion with hydrogen) or ethylene dichloride (by reaction with ethylene).|$|R
25|$|In a fire, PVC-coated wires {{can form}} {{hydrogen}} chloride fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge free radicals {{and is the}} source of the material's fire retardance. While hydrogen chloride fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, it dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels and communal areas), PVC-free cable insulation is preferred, such as low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) insulation.|$|E
25|$|The XP-13 {{fuselage}} had a corrugated aluminum skin {{built over}} a metal frame; the flying surfaces were also metal-framed, but {{covered with the}} traditional fabric. While designed to use the 600hp Curtiss H-1640-1 Chieftain engine, (a novel 12-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial with the rear cylinders directly behind the front cylinders rather than staggered as normal in a two-row radial) for which the XP-13 incorporated a complex system of baffles to direct cooling air over the engine, the engine simply would not stay <b>cool</b> <b>enough,</b> and in September 1930 it was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney SR1340C Wasp of 450hp. Ironically, the lower-power engine actually resulted in a speed increase of 15mph, at least {{partly because of the}} weight savings.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forests although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species); a complete lack of modern development around the bay; the water is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> and deep enough; and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, being the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships to choke off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area, {{was the work of}} the devil ('El Diablo') and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.|$|E
50|$|The olla is {{also useful}} for keeping water cool. When an {{unglazed}} olla {{is filled with}} water, the water permeates the clay walls of the vessel, causing the olla to “sweat”. The evaporation of the sweat cools the olla and its contents. In the early 20th century, many ranches in the American Southwest used the practice of hanging an olla from a rope on the verandah in a shady, breezy spot. Several hours after the olla was hung, it was <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> by evaporation to keep butter and milk safely cold.|$|R
5|$|Ubiquitousness and {{stability}} of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature {{is much higher than}} ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination, when the expanding Universe <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.|$|R

25|$|Moisture {{management}} and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture {{management and}} humidity control may conflict with efforts {{to try to}} optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, Moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply Make Up Air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, {{for most of the}} US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.|$|E
25|$|As the {{universe}} expands, it cools. Free neutrons and protons are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons {{have a strong}} tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the temperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the binding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed (a situation known as the deuterium bottleneck). Hence, the formation of helium-4 is delayed until {{the universe}} became <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which {{there was a sudden}} burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low for any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the radioactive decay of the two major unstable products of BBN, tritium and beryllium-7.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.|$|E
2500|$|The Earth of {{the early}} Archean (...) {{may have had a}} {{different}} tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's crust <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events.|$|R
50|$|One such {{observation}} {{is that of}} anisotropies (that is, variations with direction - see below) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is electromagnetic radiation which fills the universe, left over from an early stage in its history when {{it was filled with}} photons and a hot, dense plasma. This plasma cooled as the universe expanded, and when it <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> to form stable atoms it no longer absorbed the photons. The photons present at that stage have been propagating ever since, growing fainter and less energetic as they spread through the ever-expanding universe.|$|R

25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{predicts a}} primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, {{irrespective of the}} initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it was <b>cool</b> <b>enough,</b> the neutrons quickly bound with {{an equal number of}} protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in COROT-7b mass {{does not allow}} precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core {{with no more than}} 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is different {{from one side of the}} planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by downwelling and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which is the evidence that all the surface of this hemisphere being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.|$|E
25|$|Through {{much of the}} {{few minutes}} {{after the big bang}} during which {{nucleosynthesis}} could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too cool for any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|E
