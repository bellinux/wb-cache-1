40|$|We {{report the}} bulk {{magnetic}} characterization of a dimeric <b>chain</b> <b>material,</b> BiMnVO 5, {{by means of}} magnetic susceptibility, magnetization and heat capacity measurements. Our results provide compelling evidence of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at (T-N) similar to 11. 5 K. Moreover, the magnetic entropy change in zero field saturates to 14. 6 J mol(- 1) K- 1 which {{is close to the}} total spin entropy of Mn 2 +. The development of long-range magnetic order in this <b>chain</b> <b>material</b> demonstrates the interplay of strong intra-chain and inter-chain interactions between the dimers, in addition to the intra-dimer interaction. Low-temperature (T < T-N) heat capacity data indicate the presence of a gap (Delta/k(B) approximate to 5 K) in the spin excitations. Furthermore, the isothermal magnetization below T-N shows an anomaly in the slope between 30 and 40 kOe which is suggestive of a spin-flop transition. Such a low-field spin-flop transition and gapped spin wave excitations may be attributed to the presence of (weak) magnetic anisotropy in this material. We attempt to construct a phase diagram in the magnetic field-temperature plane by extracting data from in-field heat capacity and isothermal magnetization measurements...|$|E
