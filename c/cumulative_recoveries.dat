40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. When {{designing}} or optimizing flotation circuits in {{mineral processing}} plants, {{it is necessary}} to have accurate values of the flotation kinetics to ensure the correct mass pulls and material balances on the plant. Previous studies have shown that rate constants measured by single cell batch testing can cause a shift in the recovery—grade curve. The shift in the recovery—grade curve is the result of poor separation in conventional laboratory flotation devices. This project involved the development and modelling of a flotation device that provides a better separation than a conventional batch flotation cell. The device is called a semi—batch flotation apparatus (SBFA) because it simulates the operations of a pilot plant in a laboratory environment. It also provides dynamic data which facilitates the evaluation of model parameters. The SBFA tested a synthetic ore made from limestone, talc and silica. The synthetic ore was used as it was economical and easy to analyze. The results from the SBFA were compared to results obtained from conventional batch flotation tests; by using recovery—grade curves to assess the degree of separation achieved from both devices. The SBFA separated the limestone from the gangue (silica and talc) much better than the batch tests. For instance the final grade for a concentrate obtained from a single cell batch test was 20 % limestone while the final grade for a concentrate obtained from the SBFA was between 40 % and 70 % limestone. The improvements in separation {{can be attributed to the}} multistage design of the SBFA which has a pulp recycle between the stages. A model has been developed for the SBFA. The model fitted the experimental data well with a correlation coefficient close to unity. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>recoveries</b> predicted from the SBFA model was compared to the actual <b>cumulative</b> <b>recoveries,</b> by using a global set of parameters (& 2 and RMAX) - The investigation showed that the model had problems in fitting the data for the early periods of the experiments because of the complex interaction between the stages in the SBFA...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{assisted}} {{gravity drainage}} (SAGD) {{is an effective}} method to produce heavy oil and bitumen which are important energy resources. In a typical SAGD approach, steam is injected into a horizontal well located directly above a horizontal producer helping to displace heated oil. Single-well (SW) SAGD attempts to create a similar process using only one horizontal well. To improve early-time response of SW-SAGD, {{it is necessary to}} heat the near-wellbore area to reduce oil viscosity and allow gravity drainage to begin. Ideally heating should occur with minimal circulation or bypassing of steam. We have investigated early-time processes to improve reservoir heating. A numerical simulation study was performed to gauge combinations of cyclic steam injection and steam circulation prior to SAGD in an effort to better understand and improve early-time performance. Results from this study, include <b>cumulative</b> <b>recoveries,</b> temperature distributions, and production rates.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is well {{documented}} that levels of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), a particularly toxic form of iron, are increased in iron overload disorders. In light of the pathogenetic importance of NTBI in chronic iron overload, we have studied the ability of new orally active iron chelators to promote the biliary excretion of iron originating as plasma 55 Fe-NTBI. METHODS: Biliary iron kinetics of plasma 55 Fe-labeled NTBI and <b>cumulative</b> <b>recoveries</b> of 55 Fe in bile were determined in normal and carbonyl iron-loaded rats receiving a single intragastric dose of iron chelator. These chelators were the novel hydroxypyridin- 4 -one compounds CP 102, CP 41, and their respective pro-drugs CP 117 and CP 165. RESULTS: The cumulative recovery of 55 Fe in bile of normal rats was increased by 5. 2 -, 7. 9 -, 11. 5 -, and 9. 2 -fold with CP 102, CP 117, CP 41 and CP 165, respectively. In iron overloaded rats, these compounds increased the cumulative recovery by 28. 6 -, 48. 6 -, 72. 6 -, and 32 -fold, respectively. All the chelators had a choleretic effect, were metabolized by the liver as demonstrated by HPLC study of bile, and were not cytotoxic since normal plasma transaminase levels were maintained {{at the end of}} the experiments.

The study was conducted at the township level, and as with all assessments conducted at such a broad level, readers must recognize and understand the limitations and appropriate use of the results. Raw and derived data provided in this report will not generally apply to any specific location. The coal geology in the basin is complex, which makes correlation with individual seams difficult at times. Although more than 12, 000 wells have been drilled to date, {{large areas of the}} Powder River Basin remain relatively undeveloped. The lack of data obviously introduces uncertainty and increases variability. Proxies and analogs were used in the analysis out of necessity, though these were always based on sound reasoning. Future development in the basin will make new data and interpretations available, which will lead to a more complete description of the coals and their fluid flow properties, and refined estimates of natural gas and water production rates and <b>cumulative</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Throughout the course of the study, critical data assumptions and relationships regarding gas content, methane adsorption isotherms, and reservoir pressure were the topics of much discussion with reviewers.

These models have been incorporated into the froth simulation package FrothSim and used to predict flotation performance for the bank of cells modelled, at different air distribution profiles.

When a polymer flooding is performed, the mobility ration between the displaced fluid and the displacing fluid become favourable compared to the normal water flooding, therefore, the sweep efficiency and the <b>cumulative</b> oil <b>recovery</b> is improved.|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} constraint to {{upland rice}} production on highly weathered, low activity clay soils in the humid zone of West Africa. There is a paucity {{of information on the}} long-term fertilizer P effects on rice on these soils. A field experiment was conducted for six years (1993 – 1998) to determine the response of four upland rice cultivars to fertilizer P applied at 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg P ha− 1 only once in 1993, and to residual P in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998. The experimental site was located on an Ultisol, low in available P, in the humid forest zone of Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. This paper discusses long-term P effects on P uptake and efficiency of upland rice cultivars. The cultivars evaluated differed in cumulative agronomic and physiological P efficiencies, and the efficiencies were higher at lower P rates for the P-efficient cultivars. The P uptake response and P harvest index were affected by P rate and its residual effect, which decreased with time after P was applied. The mean <b>cumulative</b> <b>recovery</b> of applied P in five crops of four rice cultivars varied from 5. 5 to 9. 4...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND GOALS: The 13 C-methacetin {{breath test}} (MBT) {{measures}} {{the activity of}} the cytochrome P 450 dependent enzyme system and has been developed to assess the functional hepatic mass. We evaluated simple modifications of the 13 C-MBT to further increase its practicability and therefore clinical acceptance. STUDY: One hundred and four patients with different chronic liver diseases (including 35 patients with histologically proven cirrhosis) and 65 healthy controls underwent the 13 C-MBT. Breath test results of 2 -point measurements were compared with conventional breath test results (<b>cumulative</b> <b>recovery</b> after 30 min) and liver histology. RESULTS: The 2 -point-measurement at 0 and 15 minutes (with a cut-off < 14. 6 per thousand delta over baseline) had 92. 6 % sensitivity and 94. 1 % specificity in identifying the presence of cirrhosis compared with liver histology. The 2 -point-measurements at 5 and 10 minutes also provided good discrimination between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 13 C-MBT using 2 -point-measurement of breath samples at baseline and after 15 minutes reliably indicates decreased liver function in liver cirrhosis. This simplification of the 13 C-MBT will increase practicability and cost efficiency, thus facilitating its clinical acceptability...|$|R

CFCL completely eradicated P. mirabilis from the urine and the stone in the short-term regimen (5 days). CFCL completely eradicated both IPM-sensitive P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis from the urine, the stones and the kidneys as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen (11 days), reflecting the superior antibacterial activity of CFCL. CFCL also significantly prevented the development of infection stones as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen. There {{was no significant difference in}} the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values between the CFCL or IPM-treated and the non-treated groups.

40|$|We have {{purified}} with a <b>cumulative</b> <b>recovery</b> of 48 % {{from the}} serum {{of a patient}} the immunoglobulin A kappa subunit of the lactate dehydrogenase-immunoglobulin A kappa (LD-IgA kappa) complex. It appears that the pI range of the complex is 5. 4 - 5. 8. The Ig part of the complex showed a monoclonal character, and the complex exhibited a 1 : 2 molar ratio of the Ig to the LD isoenzyme. From reconstitution experiments by two different methods we concluded that LD- 3 is essential for restoring the original complex. Additional studies showed a recombination of the IgA kappa with both autologous and homologous LD- 3, and a binding of LD- 3 at the Fab region of the Ig. The estimated value of the affinity constant (Keq) was 2. 1 X 10 (9) liters/mol. Analysis of the specific LD- 3 -binding IgA kappa concentrations in the sera of five cases revealed {{a broad range of}} the individual immune response. Our first quantitative data on the lymphocyte subpopulations revealed a significantly increased OKT 4 /OKT 8 ratio due to a reduction in the absolute number of T suppressor cell...|$|R
