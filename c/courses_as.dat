5|$|FSU Panama City began {{offering}} full-time daytime programs in fall 2000. This scheduling, coupled with programs {{offered in the}} evenings, serves to accommodate the needs of its diverse student population. Over 30 resident faculty were hired to help staff the programs. Nestled among oaks along the waters of North Bay and only three miles from the Gulf of Mexico, the Florida State University Panama City campus offers upper-division undergraduate <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> well as some graduate and specialist degree programs.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of racing in futuristic hovercrafts and using their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> {{quickly as possible}} in settings like the recurring Mute City, Big Blue and Port Town. The first game was labeled by critics as an influential video game that created the futuristic racing subgenre as well as inspired the creation of numerous racing games such as Daytona USA and the Wipeout series. The series casually centers around the F-Zero racer Captain Falcon and his talented racing and bounty hunting abilities {{as well as his}} encounters with the other F-Zero characters.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their <b>courses,</b> <b>as</b> long as they completed 150 credits.|$|E
5|$|In 1925–26, while {{teaching}} at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> the basis for full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{tuition fee}} caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, {{universities}} in England {{could begin to}} charge variable fees of up to £3000 a year for students enrolling on <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> from the academic year of 2006-07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the cap rose to £3225 a year {{to take account of}} inflation. Following the Browne Review in 2010, the cap was controversially raised to £9,000 a year, sparking large student protests in London.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} school stage (Years 11 and 12) {{students}} {{are prepared for}} the New South Wales HSC. The curriculum at this stage has a clear university orientation. The Board of Studies requires stage 6 students to study a minimum of 12units in the Preliminary Year and 10units in their HSC Year (most subjects being worth 2units). HSC English is compulsory; Standard and Advanced Extension <b>courses,</b> <b>as</b> well as 2-unit English as a Second Language are also offered. Students may then choose from all levels of Mathematics, Senior Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Modern History, Ancient History, Business Studies, Economics, Geography, Legal studies, French, German, Latin, Japanese, Italian, Indonesian (Beginners), Mandarin, Design and Technology, Textiles and Design, Food Technology, Visual Arts, Music (Course 1 and 2), Drama and PDHPE.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario explores Princess Peach's {{castle and}} must rescue her from Bowser. As {{one of the}} earlier 3D {{platform}} games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, {{in addition to the}} occasional linear obstacle <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games, and the same visual style.|$|E
5|$|The 1940s, {{including}} World War II and its aftermath, brought {{big changes}} to BGSU. The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing {{the lack of}} male students. The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon’s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport. Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities {{to take part in}} the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war. The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> well as naval training. Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs. Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students would be the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential <b>courses</b> <b>as</b> part of their degree programs.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor <b>courses,</b> <b>as</b> well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training courses on the Sabre began on 1January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E
