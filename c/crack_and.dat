30|$|The {{overlying}} {{fine silt}} contains <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges filled with black mud derived from above. These can {{be recognized as}} open <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges. Some <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges were observed in a sandy interval (Fig.  4). Montenat et al. (2007) summarized the characteristics of thixotropic wedges that are developed in coarse-grained layers and {{are similar to the}} <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges in this case. Such wedges are attributed to the limited and periodical occurrence of liquefaction and subsequent sediment collapse (Montenat et al., 2007). However, Montenat et al. (2007) suggested that the <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges should be discriminated from those of cryogenic origin in order to specify the seismic origin. In this case, the Kathmandu Valley was located in subtropical and temperate climate zones and the presence of ice wedges is not realistic (cf. Gayer et al. 2006).|$|R

5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E

5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanisms for}} layer interface-parallel discontinuities and {{their interactions with}} vertical cracks in layered rocks with varying layer thickness are investigated. The interface behaviour between rock layers is modeled by a shear displacement response <b>and</b> rock <b>crack</b> behaviour is described by a damage model. Three typical failures can be captured: (1) vertical <b>cracking,</b> (2) delamination <b>and</b> (3) interface-parallel <b>cracking.</b> The result further indicates these crack modes are determined by a threshold of the interfacial strength. When the interfacial strength {{is higher than the}} threshold, a combined pattern of vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interface-parallel <b>cracking</b> occurs. If the strength is lower than the threshold, a combined pattern of vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interfacial delamination can be found. If the strength for the interface is near the threshold, a combined pattern of interface-parallel <b>cracking,</b> vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interfacial delamination occurs. The result shows the interface-parallel discontinuities are induced by interface-delamination, interface-parallel cracks, or their coupling behaviour. Both interfacial delamination <b>and</b> interface-parallel <b>cracking</b> can reduce the tensile stress between two adjacent <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> thus lead to a saturation state. Layer thickness variations can further influence the infilling process of vertical <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> the <b>crack</b> spacing to average layer thickness ratios...|$|R
