5000|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{package is}} a metal, plastic, glass or ceramic casing containing {{one or more}} semiconductor electronic components. Individual discrete components are typically etched in silicon wafer before being cut and [...] assembled in a package.

25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and <b>contact</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>contact</b> plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the wire}} guiding nozzle {{can be moved}} freely {{throughout}} the room, {{it is possible for}} the nozzle to terminate the wire at the contact points if equipped with an additional swivel device. As {{in the case of the}} conventional linear winding technology, a <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> or a hook contact can be terminated for the electrical connection and for interconnecting the single poles in a star connection or delta connection.|$|R
50|$|The MD-4H was {{essentially}} a speeded-up MD4, with the gearing increased by 1.5 and the voltage raised to the standard, already capable, motor. There is one additional gold <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> surrounding the rewind spigot, that joins with the electrical connection {{on the base of}} the camera. The front face of the drive features a slightly extended area with a switch that enables the option of using the drive at a constant 6 frames per second.|$|R
50|$|The Pentax K-F mount added five {{electrical}} <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> protruding {{through the}} lens mount flange at the 5 o'clock position (when viewing the ME F body from the front) to the original Pentax K mount (introduced 1975) to pass focus control information between the camera and the lens. The Pentax K-AF and K-AF2 autofocus lens mounts (introduced 1987 and 1991, respectively) have contacts of different number, position and function, and therefore the 35mm-70mm AF Zoom cannot autofocus on any other Pentax SLR.|$|E
5000|$|... 1981: Pentax ME F (Japan): first {{built-in}} autofocus 35 mm SLR. Had passive contrast detection AF system. Autofocused poorly {{and was not}} commercially successful.

Note that the Ricoh AF Rikenon 50mm f/2 (Japan) lens of 1980 had a self-contained passive electronic rangefinder AF system in a bulky top-mounted box {{and was the first}} interchangeable autofocus SLR lens (for any Pentax K mount 35 mm SLR).|$|E
5000|$|From 2000 and onwards, manufacturers, such as BMW, Citroen, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Rover, Audi, Seat, Opel and Škoda have {{sometimes}} started using a 40 pin connector instead, called the Quadlock. The Quadlock connector {{consists of a}} block of 16 flat pins analogous to the two main ISO 10487 connectors. While the physical <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> are the same, the pin allocation is not entirely the same, and the connector housing is not compatible. In addition to the 16 pins, like ISO 10487, there are minor connectors for optional equipment. They fit within {{the frame of the}} main connector, and has coding so that they cannot be interchanged. Minor connector B has 12 pins for audio output signals. Minor connector C has 12 pins for various audio sources such as CD-changers, MP3 players.|$|E

50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to <b>contacts</b> (<b>pins)</b> in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
5000|$|California {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used at outdoor events, shows and conventions and at construction sites. The connector gets it name from being developed as a safer connector during {{the early days of}} Hollywood film studios in California. The first high amperage connectors used in the studios were stage pin (also referred to as [...] "paddle plugs") used in theaters, which were not grounded. The California plug, however, is grounded by the outer steel shroud. This also helped protect the male <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> from damage from the constant dragging of cables around a set throughout the day. The grounded shroud helps absorb the arc-flash if the connector is plugged or unplugged while energized. The original paddle plugs were known for dangerous arc-flashes, especially in the older DC-powered theaters {{in the early years of}} electrical stage lighting.|$|E
50|$|The chamber {{block is}} locked to the handle block, which {{contains}} the locking surface, firing button (pushed by the trigger when the chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. The cartridge primers are ignited electrically, {{so there are}} four circular contact plates on the locking surface (contacting the case bottom) and four <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> {{in the center of}} each plate (contacting the primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. The electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. The weapon is only capable of firing one round at a time. There are different models of PB-4; in some, the firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others by a piezoelectric igniter similar to those used by kitchen gas lighters.|$|E
50|$|The rotors (alternatively wheels or drums, Walzen in German) {{formed the}} heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc {{approximately}} 10 cm in diameter made from hard rubber or bakelite with 26 brass, spring-loaded, electrical <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plate electrical contacts. The pins and contacts represent the alphabet—typically the 26 letters A-Z (this will be assumed {{for the rest of this}} description). When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.|$|E

50|$|MC4 {{connectors}} are single-contact electrical connectors {{commonly used}} for connecting solar panels. MC4 {{stands for the}} manufacturer Multi-Contact (currently Stäubli Electrical Connectors) and a 4 for the 4mm (diameter) <b>contact</b> <b>pin.</b> MC4s allow strings of panels to be easily constructed by pushing the connectors from adjacent panels together by hand, but require a tool to disconnect them to ensure they do not accidentally disconnect when the cables are pulled. The MC4 and compatible products are universal in the solar market today, equipping almost all solar panels produced since about 2011. Originally rated for 600 V, most versions since are rated to 1000 V, which allows longer strings to be created.|$|R
