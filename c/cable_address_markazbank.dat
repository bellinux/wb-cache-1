50|$|A telegraphic <b>address</b> or <b>cable</b> <b>address</b> was {{a unique}} {{identifier}} code for a recipient of telegraph messages. Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication. Rather like a uniform resource locator (URL), the telegraph address did not contain any routing information (aside from possibly a city name), but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel, who would then manually direct {{the message to the}} office nearest the destination or to an intermediate office. Since the destination address of a telegram counted as part of the message, using a short registered address code saved the expense of sending a complete street address. Telegraph addresses were chosen either as versions of a company's name or as a memorable short word, somehow associated with the recipient. Occasionally, an organization would be best known by its telegraphic address, for example Interflora or Interpol. A telegraphic address was a valuable part of a company's corporate identity, and disputes sometimes arose when a competitor registered a telegraphic address similar to a trade name or identifier used by a rival.|$|R

The diagnostic graph of a RAM unit is drawn by using this relatioon and a sequence in which tests have to be performed obtained from this graph. By using this sequence faulty components in a RAM unit are located when at most one type of fault in the model is present.

Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions GmbH (formerly Lurgi GmbH) {{has been part of}} Air Liquide S. A. since 2007. Lurgi was the <b>cable</b> <b>address</b> of Metallurgische Gesellschaft founded on 5 February 1897. Its origin dates back to the technical branch of Metallgesellschaft, which had been established by Wilhelm Merton in 1881. By the end of World War I, the company had gained a foothold in the steam and absorption business and gathered expertise in the upgrading of solid fuels and the processing of the resulting gaseous and liquid products. As a consequence of this diversification, the company divided into process-specific subsidiaries, which from 1919 traded under the name of LURGI. In 1923, they jointly moved into offices at Gervinusstrasse, Frankfurt am Main. In order to meet the requirements of the international markets, Lurgi constituted itself as a German stock corporation in 1990. Its operating limited liability companies - chemistry, metallurgy and industry construction; energy and environmental techniques; gas- and mineral oil techniques - each had their own engineering and commercial staff. In 1991, Lurgi pooled its polymer activities by taking over Zimmer AG from the British Davy-McKee AG as the fourth operating company. In 2001 Lurgi sold their metallurgical division (Lurgi Metallurgie) to Outokumpu. After acquisition into the Air Liquide company, the Zimmer technology portfolio was sold in end of 2014 to Technip.|$|R

5000|$|Jews {{started coming}} to Japan in the 1860s, when Japan was opened to trade. There {{quickly became a}} small {{population}} of Jewish businessmen in Kobe, {{along with the other}} port cities of Yokohama and Nagasaki. By the early 1900s (decade), there existed a Zionist organization and well established Jewish community in Kobe, and the city received its first synagogue in 1912. So, when trade with Russia declined in Nagasaki prior to the Russo-Japanese War and the great Kanto earthquake struck Yokohama in 1923, the majority of the Jewish population in Japan ended up in Kobe. As a trickle of Jewish immigrants continued, by the start of World War II Kobe had a well-off Jewish community of about 1000 people and 50 families. [...] As one scholar puts it, [...] "Kobe was the center of what little Jewish life existed in Japan at that time. The community, which numbered several dozen families, was composed primarily of Sephardim originally from Iraq and Iran, and Ashkenazim who had originally lived in Russia." [...] This Jewish community of Kobe, which {{came to be known as}} JEWCOM, its <b>cable</b> <b>address,</b> was treated without prejudice by the Japanese government. A Japanese official stated in 1922, [...] "The number of Jews in Japan is comparatively small. We treat them the same as we treat all foreigners. We do not distinguish between them." [...] Such an attitude towards Jews was rare in the world at that time, and would prove to be lifesaving for the community in Kobe. As the world became more anti-Semitic and the Nazis began their plans to annihilate the Jews in Europe, Kobe would serve as a safe haven for thousands of refugees fleeing the Holocaust.|$|R

Shortening, elongation and bending capabilities have been assessed by testing different patterns of activations.
