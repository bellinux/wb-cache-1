25|$|Economic water {{scarcity}} {{is caused by}} a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic {{water scarcity}}. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique, average daily water <b>consumption</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} {{to examine the relationship between}} military expenditures and unemployment rate in the panel of selected SAARC countries namely India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka over the period ranging from 1990 to 2013. In particular, the study used multivariate framework to examine the long-run relationship between military expenditures and unemployment rate by taking into account the effect of macroeconomic variables namely energy <b>consumption,</b> GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita,</b> Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) net inflows and population growth rate. The empirical results show that all the variables exhibit non-stationary behavior and have long-run relationships between them. The results of panel DOLS show that military expenditures favor the employment rate in the SAARC region, as the estimated coefficient of military expenditure has a negative and more elastic relationship with the unemployment rate. Other factors i. e., energy <b>consumption,</b> GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> and incoming FDI significantly decreases the unemployment rate in the SAARC region. However, population growth rate does not exhibit significant association with the unemployment rate during the period under the study. In a second regression apparatus, energy <b>consumption,</b> and GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> significantly decrease the military spending, however, population growth rate significantly increases the military expenditures in the region. The results of causality indicate that there is an inverse causality between energy <b>consumption,</b> GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> and population growth rate with the unemployment rate, while there is no significant causation between military spending and the rest of the variables in the short-run. In the long-run, there is a significant causation between the variables with the exception of population growth rate in SAARC region. These results are valuable both for policy makers and government officials to formulate their strategic polices for SAARC countries...|$|R

Water production before network losses is about 120 liters per person and day while actual consumption is close to 80 liters per capita and day. A survey of water consumption habits by households in Eastern Amman and in 14 villages in the Northern Governorates showed that total <b>consumption</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> lies between 60 and 80 liters per day. About 20-30% of this water is obtained from sources other than the public piped system, including from bottled water, water bought from tankers, rainwater harvesting and springs. In rural areas, 28% of households surveyed harvested rainwater and stored it in cisterns for drinking, since they considered it to be of better quality than piped water. In Eastern Amman, 12% of households bought water in large bottles and 30% bought water from private tankers. Most households have roof storage tanks with a volume of 1–2 m3. According to the 2009 Population and Family Health Survey, 31% of households use bottled water, 7% use rainwater, 2% tanker water and 60% tap water as their primary source of drinking water. According to the same survey, 22% of households filter tap water and the majority does not apply any type of treatment. A 2007–08 survey by the German-Jordanian water programme in the middle governorates Zarqa, Balqa and Madaba showed that 79% of households use tap water as their main source of drinking water and that 37% of households treat water before drinking it.

We base our analysis on stepwise regression and geographically weighted regression models, with study areas of 31 provinces in China. Our results show that SO 2 (sulfur dioxide) concentration decreases the centenarian ratio; PM 10 (particles with diameters of 10 mu m or less) concentration and coal <b>consumption</b> (CC) <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> decrease the longevity index, and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> prolongs life expectancy at birth, while energy <b>consumption</b> (EC) <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> decreases life expectancy at birth.
