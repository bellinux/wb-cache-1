However, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK,</b> inorganic fertilization (especially N 2) also caused soil acidification and salinization. In the N 2 treatment, soil total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from 14. 1 ± 0. 27 g kg- 1 at the beginning of the long-term experiment in 1988 to 12. 6 ± 0. 11 g kg- 1 (P< 0. 05). Compared to CK, N 1 and N 2 exhibited higher soil α-galactosidase and β-galactosidase activities, but lower soil α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase activities (P< 0. 05), indicating that inorganic fertilization had different impacts on these C transformation enzymes. <b>Compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK,</b> the M, MN 1 and MN 2 treatments exhibited higher enzyme activities, soil TOC, total nitrogen, dissolved organic C, and microbial biomass C and N.

40|$|Crop {{residues}} are {{the primary}} source of carbon input in the soil carbon pool. Crop rotation can impact the plant biomass returned to the soil, and influence soil respiration. To study the effect of previous crops on soil respiration in cucumber (Cucumis statirus L.) fields in solar greenhouses, soil respiration, plant height, leaf area and yield were measured during the growing season (from the end of Sept to the beginning of Jun the following year) from 2007 to 2010.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} humic acid (HA) can be affected by fertilization, but the short-term effects are difficult to detect using traditional analysis methods. Using a 35 -year long-term experiment in Black Soil, the molecular structure of HA was analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Variation in HA was analyzed after long-term fertilization, including fertilization with manure (M), inorganic N, P and K fertilizer (NPK), manure combined with inorganic N, P, and K fertilizer (MNPK), and a no-fertilizer control (CK). The application of each fertilizer treatment increased crop yields <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>CK</b> treatment, and the MNPK treatment increased crop yield the most. The ratio of main IR absorption peak of HA at 2, 920 cm- 1 <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the peak at 2, 850 cm- 1 (2920 / 2850) was higher in the NPK and MNPK treatments <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>CK</b> treatment. The application of manure (MNPK and M treatments) increased the ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) in HA, and raised {{the ratio of the}} main IR absorption peak of HA at 2920 cm- 1 to that at 1720 cm- 1 (2920 / 1720). Manure treatments also raised the ratio of aliphatic carbon (C) to aromatic C, alkyl C to alkoxy C and hydrophobic C to hydrophilic C and the fluorescence index (f 450 / 500), but decreased the degree of aromatization of HA, when <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>CK</b> treatment. The ratio between each type of C in HA was similar among all the fertilizer treatments, but NPK had a lower ratio of H/C and a lower content of aliphatic C <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>CK</b> treatment.

It has been shown in table 1 that {{the value of a}} ⋅ b significantly decreases with the application amount of SP increasing, and that is to say the application of SP significantly decreases the migration rate of wetting front, and the larger the application amount of SP is the smaller the migration rate of wetting front is, and also the time needed by wetting front to reach a certain distance. For instance, as for the treatments of CK, SP 0.08, SP 0.2, SP 0.5 and SP 1, under the irrigation condition of small amount of high drops on the surface, the time needed by wetting front to reach the distance of 20 cm are 5.4, 7.7, 9.4, 22.1 and 498.9 min respectively, which increases by 42.59 %, 74.07 %, 309.26 % and 9138.89 % respectively <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b>|$|E

Understanding mulching effects on nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen dynamics is important for optimizing N management strategies. A 3 -year field experiment {{was performed on the}} Loess Plateau of China to investigate the GM and FM effects on plant N accumulation, N translocation, N harvest index (NHI), NUE and soil NO 3 (-) -N dynamics in dryland maize fields. <b>Compared</b> <b>with</b> the control (<b>CK,</b> non-mulching), the mulching treatments markedly promoted plant N accumulation and especially maintained higher N uptake rates during the post-silking stage. At harvest, the total N accumulation was 12. 8 - 41. 2 and 33. 2 - 55. 8 % higher in the GM and FM treatments, respectively, than in the CK treatment. The NHIs of the mulching treatments were significantly higher by 9. 6 - 32. 4 % than the CK treatment, primarily due to greater N translocation and N accumulation post-silking. Overall, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>CK</b> treatment, the GM and FM NUEs increased significantly by 17. 1 and 28. 3 % in 2010, 70. 3 and 87. 6 % in 2011, and 16. 7 and 38. 2 % in 2012, respectively.

A 3 -year study {{on the effects of}} saline water irrigation on tomato yield, quality and blossom-end rot (BER) was conducted at different lower limits of soil matric potential (- 10 kPa, - 20 kPa, - 30 kPa, - 40 kPa and - 50 kPa). Saline water differing in electrical conductivity (EC) (3 dS/m, 4 dS/m, 4. 5 dS/m, 5 dS/m and 5. 5 dS/m) was supplied to the plant after the seedling establishment. In all three years, irrigation water with 5. 5 dS/m salinity reduced the maximum leaf area index (LAIm) and chlorophyll content the most significantly when compared with other salinity treatments. However, compared with the control treatment (CK), a slight increase in LAIm and chlorophyll content was observed with 3 ~ 4 dS/m salinity. Saline water improved tomato quality, including fruit density, soluble solid, total acid, vitamin C and the sugar-acid ratio. There was a positive relationship between the overall tomato quality and salinity of irrigation water, as analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The tomato yield decreased with increased salinity. The 5. 5 dS/m treatment reduced the tomato yield (Yt) by 22. 4 ~ 31. 1 %, 12. 6 ~ 28. 0 % and 11. 7 ~ 27. 3 %, respectively in 2012, 2013 and 2014, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b> Moreover, a significant (P≤ 0. 01) coupling effect of salinity and soil matric potential on Yt was detected. Saline water caused Yt to increase more markedly when the lower limit of soil matric potential was controlled at a relatively lower level. The critical salinity level that produced significant increases in the BERi was 3 dS/m~ 4 dS/m. Following the increase in BERi under saline water irrigation, marketable tomato yield (Ym) decreased by 8. 9 %~ 33. 8 % in 2012, 5. 1 %~ 30. 4 % in 2013 and 10. 1 %~ 32. 3 % in 2014 <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>CK.</b> In terms of maintaining the Yt and Ym, the salinity of irrigation water should be controlled under 4 dS/m, and the lower limit of soil matric potential should be greater than - 20 kPa...|$|E
