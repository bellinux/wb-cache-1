40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assessment <b>of</b> scoliotic <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> and {{stiffness}} {{is essential}} for planning surgical treatment in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Measurement <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> is currently insufficiently precise. The {{purpose of this study}} was to introduce and validate a novel method of superimposing radiographs for more reliable measurement <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent radiologists measured Cobb angles separately on standard anterior-posterior (AP) (n[*]=[*] 48) and supine bending radiographs (n[*]=[*] 48), in patients with AIS, who were randomly included from a surgical database. The same readers repeated the measurements after the bending radiographs were semi-automatically superimposed on the AP radiographs by fusing the caudad end vertebra. Curve flexibility was calculated. Inter-reader agreement between the two independent readers was calculated using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: A moderate inter-reader agreement was achieved in the upper curve (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 57) and a good agreement in the lower curve (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 72) with the standard method <b>of</b> assessing <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> With the use of the semiautomatic superimposition, however, almost perfect agreement was achieved for both the upper and the lower curves flexibilities (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 93 and 0. 97, respectively). CONCLUSION: The introduced semi-automatic superimposition technique for measurement <b>of</b> scoliotic <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> in AIS is more precise and reliable than the current standard method. KEY POINTS: • A technique using semiautomatic superimposition of anterior-posterior and bending radiographs is introduced • Almost perfect agreement was achieved for scoliotic curves flexibilities measurements • This method is more precise and reliable than the current standard method...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to standardizing tree-ring time series is to divide raw ring widths by a fitted curve. Although the derived ratios are conceptually elegant {{and have a}} more homogenous variance through time than simple differences, residual heteroscedasticity associated with variance dependence on local mean ring width may remain. Incorrect inferences about climate forcing may result if this heteroscedasticity is not corrected for, or at least recognized (with appropriate caveats). A new variance stabilization method is proposed that specifically targets this source of heteroscedasticity. It is based on stabilizing the magnitude of differences from standardization curves to a common reference local mean ring width and uses data pooled from multiple radii. Application of the method to a multi-site kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindley) data set shows that (a) the heteroscedasticity issue addressed may be generic rather than radius-specific, at least for some species, (b) variance stabilization using pooled data works well for standardization <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>flexibility,</b> (c) {{in the case of}} kauri, simple ratios {{do not appear to be}} significantly affected by this cause of heteroscedasticity, and (d) centennial-scale variance trends are highly sensitive to the analytical methods used to build tree-ring chronologies...|$|R

40|$|Curve {{flexibility}} in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) {{was one of}} the major concerns of spinal surgeons since the evolution of surgical correction techniques. In this respect, many tried to identify which criteria denote more rigid curve. In the present study, we aimed toward determining important factors influencing AIS curve flexibility on supine bending films. We assessed radiographs of 100 patients with AIS for direction <b>of</b> <b>curves,</b> number <b>of</b> involved vertebrae, apical vertebral translation and rotation, magnitude <b>of</b> main thoracic <b>curve</b> and T 5 -T 12 kyphosis. Statistical analysis performed via stepwise linear regression model with these variables plus age and sex against {{flexibility in}}dex. According to regression analysis, there was a clear relationship between flexibility indexes (FI) and magnitude <b>of</b> main thoracic <b>curve</b> at all (P 50 %) against rigid curves, apical vertebral rotation was a major determinant <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> also (P< 0. 001).

Radiographical {{data was collected}} and calculated. Student t test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were {{used to analyze the}} data. 60 were included in this study. The mean age was 14. 7 y (10 - 18 y) with 10 males (17 %) and 50 females (83 %). The average Risser sign was 2. 7. The mean thoracic Cobb angle before operation was 51. 9 °. The mean bending Cobb angle was 27. 6 ° and the mean fulcrum bending Cobb angle was 17. 4 °. The mean Cobb angle at 2 week after surgery was 16. 3 °. The Pearson correlation coefficient r between CCI and BFR was - 0. 856 (P< 0. 001), and between FBCI and FFR was - 0. 728 (P< 0. 001). A modified FBCI (M-FBCI) = (CR- 0. 513) /BFR or a modified CCI (M-CCI) = (CR- 0. 279) /FFR was generated by curve estimation has no significant correlation with FFR (r=- 0. 08, p= 0. 950) or with BFR (r= 0. 123, p= 0. 349).

To compare {{the ability of}} four different instrumentation systems in correcting thoracic scoliosis based on the curve flexibility as reviewed by the fulcrum-bending radiograph. Summary of Background Data. The fulcrum-bending radiograph {{has been shown to}} be able to accurately reflect the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> thoracic <b>curves,</b> and the fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) predicts the amount of correction achieved by current surgical techniques. By recruiting <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> known <b>flexibility,</b> the efficacy <b>of</b> the different instrumentations in correcting coronal deformity can be truly compared. Methods. A consecutive series of 127 patients with Idiopathic scoliosis were treated by one of four implants: CD-Horizon (CD-H), Moss Miami (MM), TSRH, and ISOLA. All surgeries were performed by the same group of surgeons using the respective recommended techniques. FBCI was used to compare the correction achieved by these implants. Results. The mean FBCI/correction rate was 101. 0 %/ 57. 9 % in the TSRH group, 103. 5 %/ 58. 5 % in ISOLA, 109. 1 %/ 67. 6 % in CD-H, and 100. 2 %/ 62. 7 % in the MM group. The correction rate was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the CD-H group than those in the TSRH and ISOLA groups, while the differences in the FBCI between the four implants were not statistically significant. Conclusions. When curve flexibility is taken into account, despite differences in material and design of four commonly used instrumentations, their ability to correct thoracic scoliosis is the same. Future studies describing surgical correction results should be based on the FBCI. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
