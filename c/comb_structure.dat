50|$|A coating PUF can be {{built in}} {{the top layer of}} an {{integrated}} circuit (IC). Above a normal IC, a network of metal wires is laid out in a comb shape. The space between and above the <b>comb</b> <b>structure</b> is filled with an opaque material and randomly doped with dielectric particles. Because of the random placement, size and dielectric strength of the particles, the capacitance between each couple of metal wires will be random up to a certain extent. This unique randomness can be used to obtain a unique identifier for the device carrying the Coating PUF. Moreover, the placement of this opaque PUF in the top layer of an IC protects the underlying circuits from being inspected by an attacker, e.g. for reverse-engineering. When an attacker tries to remove (a part of) the coating, the capacitance between the wires is bound to change and the original unique identifier will be destroyed.

50|$|As a type {{of honey}} bee, Apis cerana must collect and store around {{a third of its}} nectar in a {{concentrated}} form in order to ensure an adequate supply for consumption during the harsh winter. The nest is multi-combed and somewhat insulated, allowing the species to achieve optimal nest temperatures and thereby optimize foraging at early hours. The nest itself is a simple vertical comb made from wax secreted by workers, while the thermoregulation is generated by fanning and water evaporation from water collected in the field. This large-scale storage tactic requires the construction of a stable and sturdy <b>comb</b> <b>structure</b> for such honey storage. However, as the production of beeswax for a comb is an energetically expensive endeavor, colonies do not generally build the entire structure very early on. Instead, the colony builds a smaller set of combs that satisfies the initial storage needs. Upon moving into the new nest, the colony will then continue to enlarge the combs until there are enough storage units to sufficiently account for all of the required honey. In general, the initial set of combs may account for around 20,000 cells, while the final, completed structure may contain up to 100,000. These nests are typically large enough to host around 6,000 to 7,000 individuals and are found {{in a wide range of}} external environments.|$|E

They are also known as paper wasps, which is a misleading term since other wasps (including yellow jackets) also build nests out of paper, and because some epiponine wasps (e.g., Polybia emaciata) build theirs out of mud, nonetheless, the name [...] "paper wasp" [...] seems to apply mostly, but not exclusively, to the Polistinae, especially the Polistini. Many wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, Polistes annularis, and Polistes exclamans, make their nests out of paper. Polistes annularis suspends its paper nests from cliff overhangs via a pedicel, whose free fatty acids induce the necrophoric response in ants and causes them to avoid the pedicel rather than cross and prey on the nest’s inhabitants. Polistes metricus foragers take off from their nests as if they already know how long their trip is. For short flights, they exit the nest flying horizontally, while for long flights they exit the nest flying straight up into a high altitude before pursuing their direction. Polistine brood cells are arranged in a hexagonal array, similar to the <b>comb</b> <b>structure</b> in a honey bee nest. At least one epiponine species (Brachygastra mellifica) stores honey in the comb, one of the only insects other than bees to store honey.|$|E

40|$|Typical {{applications}} for resonantly driven vacuum packaged MEMS scanners including laser projection displays require a feedback signal for closed-loop operation {{as well as}} high accuracy angle synchronization for data processing. A well known and widely used method is based on determining the angular velocity of the oscillating micromirror by measuring the time derivative of a capacitance. In this work we analyze a capacitive sensing approach that uses integrated vertical <b>comb</b> <b>structures</b> to synchronize the angular motion of a torsional micromirror oscillating in resonance. The investigated measurement method is implemented in a laser display that generates a video projection by scanning a RBG laser beam. As the 2 D-micromirror performs sinusoidal oscillations on both perpendicular axes a continuously moving Lissajous pattern is projected. By measuring the displacement current due to an angular deflection of the movable <b>comb</b> <b>structures</b> an appropriate feedback signal for ac tuation and data synchronization is computed. In order to estimate the angular deflection and velocity a mathematical model of the capacitive sensing system is presented. In particular, the nonlinear characteristic of the capacitance {{as a function of}} the angle that is calculated using FEM analysis is approximated using cubic splines. Combining this nonlinear function with a dynamic model of the micromirror oscillation and the analog electronics a mathematical model of the capacitive measurement system is derived.
