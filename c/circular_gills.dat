50|$|Morays secrete a {{protective}} mucus over their smooth, scaleless skin, {{which in some}} species contains a toxin. They have much thicker skin and high densities of goblet cells in the epidermis that allows mucus to be produced {{at a higher rate}} than in other eel species. This allows sand granules to adhere to the sides of their burrows in sand-dwelling morays, thus making the walls of the burrow more permanent due to the glycosylation of mucins in mucus. Their small, <b>circular</b> <b>gills,</b> located on the flanks far posterior to the mouth, require the moray to maintain a gap to facilitate respiration.|$|E
50|$|The leafy seadragon {{is related}} to the {{pipefish}} and belongs to the family Syngnathidae, along with the seahorse. It differs from the seahorse in appearance, form of locomotion, and its inability to coil or grasp things with its tail.A related species is the weedy seadragon, which is multicoloured and grows weed-like fins, but is smaller than the leafy seadragon. Another unique feature are the small, <b>circular</b> <b>gill</b> openings covering tufted gills, very unlike the crescent-shaped gill openings and ridged gills of most fish species.|$|R
60|$|Look, again, {{at those}} sea-slugs. One, some three inches long, {{of a bright}} lemon-yellow, clouded with purple; another of a dingy grey; (16) another {{exquisite}} little creature of a pearly French White, (17) furred all over the back with what seem arms, but are really gills, of ringed white and grey and black. Put that yellow one into water, and from his head, above the eyes, arise two serrated horns, while from the after-part of his back springs a <b>circular</b> Prince-of-Wales's-feather of <b>gills,</b> - they are almost exactly like those which we saw just now in the white Cucumaria. Yes; here is another instance of the same custom of repetition. The Cucumaria is a low radiate animal - the sea-slug a far higher mollusc; and every organ within him is formed on a different type; as indeed are those seemingly identical gills, {{if you come to}} examine them under the microscope, having to oxygenate fluids of a very different and more complicated kind; and, moreover, the Cucumaria's gills were put round his mouth, the Doris's feathers round the other extremity; that grey Eolis's, again, are simple clubs, scattered over his whole back, and in each of his nudibranch congeners these same gills take some new and fantastic form; in Melibaea those clubs are covered with warts; in Scyllaea, with tufted bouquets; in the beautiful Antiopa they are transparent bags; and in many other English species they take every conceivable form of leaf, tree, flower, and branch, bedecked with every colour of the rainbow, as you may see them depicted in Messrs. Alder and Hancock's unrivalled Monograph on the Nudibranch Mollusca.|$|R
