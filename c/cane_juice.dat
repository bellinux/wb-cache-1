This work reports on efforts to enhance the performance of an anionic flocculant {{by the addition of}} cationic polymers. Homopolymers of poly(trimethylammonium ethyl methacrylate chloride) (TMAEMAC) and cationic copolymers of poly(trimethylammonium ethyl acrylate chloride) (TMAEAC) and acrylamide were synthesized and their performance, to enhance the flocculation and sedimentation of <b>cane</b> sugar <b>juice</b> particles, was evaluated by turbidity and settling rate measurements. The charge-patch mechanism best explains the performance of the homopolymers, whereas the action of the copolymers is attributed to the bridging mechanism. The results of this work indicate that the copolymers are more effective than the homopolymers to aid flocculation and sedimentation of the <b>cane</b> sugar <b>juice</b> particles, and that the best-performing polymers are those that act by the bridging mechanism. Addition of increased amounts of anionic flocculant did not confer an improvement, suggesting that the cationic bridging flocculant targets a different population of particles that is largely responsible for the residual turbidity...|$|R

40|$|The {{clarification}} of mixed juice {{has been the}} subject of research for decades, due mostly to its large impact on sugar quality. Much, if not all, of the work has however been done on mixed juice originating from milling rather than from diffusion. This paper examines a back-to-basics, laboratory approach, involving <b>cane</b> <b>juices</b> produced from conditions simulating milling and diffusion. Furthermore, different types of cane, for example fresh versus deteriorated, clean stalks versus stalks plus tops and trash, have been used. Saccharate and milk of lime have also been compared. Analytical techniques were carefully considered and methods such as X-ray fluorescence were used, and material balances across clarification were done. The laboratory work shows that, for the same <b>cane</b> quality, clear <b>juice</b> quality in terms of phosphate, calcium, magnesium, silica and sulphated ash is the same whether milling or diffusion has been used. Saccharate liming always yields better clear juice in terms of turbidity, colour, phosphate and calcium contents. Material balances closed well across clarification, except for phosphate and for silica; this highlights the need for sampling/analytical improvements for these two species. Finally, the effect of clarifier mud carryover on sugar quality is discussed...|$|R

Detailed measurements of stalk and juice yield were recorded at harvest time.

2500|$|Due to the {{profitable}} Slave Trade and {{the high}} quality of Nevisian sugar cane, the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for Great Britain and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the Leeward Islands were separated from Barbados in 1671, Nevis became {{the seat of the}} Leeward Islands colony and was given the nickname [...] "Queen of the Caribees". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to Antigua for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands. The island outranked larger islands like Jamaica in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the British Colonial Office Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as [...] "head tax on slaves", a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in Montserrat, and 5,500 total in the other five islands. [...] The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced {{by the fact that the}} <b>cane</b> <b>juice</b> from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of <b>cane</b> <b>juice</b> from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres).

Studies of different liming techniques have been conducted to identify which liming technique gives the best clarification performance from juice expressed from green cane containing half of all trash extracted (GE). Results have shown that lime saccharate addition to juice at 76 °C either continuous or batchwise gives satisfactory settling rates of calcium phosphate flocs(50 − 70 cm/min) and CJ with low turbidity and minimal amounts of mineral constituents. Surprisingly, the addition of phosphoric acid (≤ 300 mg/kg as P 2 O 5), prior to liming to reduce juice turbidity (≤ 80 %), increased the Mg (≤ 101 %) and Si(≤ 148 %) contents particularly for clarified GE juices. The increase was not proportional with increasing phosphoric acid dose. The nature of the flocs formed, including the zeta potential of the particles by the different liming techniques, has been used to account for the differences in clarification performance.
