5000|$|Reed's {{execution}} {{was set for}} 6pm on Friday June 20, 2008, but {{a series}} of appeals stopped the execution from occurring until 11:20pm, when the curtains were opened so that witnesses could view the execution. Reed was strapped into the chair, with a strap or mask that covered most of his head. Electrodes were connected to his head through a wire that could be seen connecting from the ceiling to a cap on his head and another wire was connected to the calf of his right leg. Reed was not seen to look at anyone and he declined to state any last words. He had earlier also declined to opt for a last meal or any spiritual advisor. After his declination to last words was announced, a leather hood was tied around his head. When the switch was thrown, witnesses heard a noise similar to the sound made by the key ring <b>clip</b> <b>lock</b> on a gas station pump handle when the tank is [...] "full". The sound indicated that the circuit of the electric chair had been completed and current was now passing into Reed's body. Reed jerked forward, but other than that there was no significant movement. The electrodes were disconnected at 11:25pm and he was pronounced dead at 11:27pm.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of several bridge deck fastening systems is being evaluated on the steel bridge at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at the Transportation Technology Center, Pueblo, Colorado. Fastening systems tested to date include several variations using hook bolts, {{as well as}} spring clips. Results to date indicate that minor, inexpensive installation details can lead to significant increases in time required between maintenance. Details {{such as the use}} of double nuts and threaded fastener adhesive has proven to be particularly effective. At FAST, more than 500 million gross tons (MGT) of traffic passed over the bridge before tightening was required after this retrofit was applied.

5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition.

Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the operating rod handle and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the operating rod moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the operating rod handle should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the operating rod spring. The operating rod handle may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|R

40|$|Dramatic {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in NASA s Whole Blood Staining Device (WBSD) since it was last described in "Whole-Blood-Staining Device," NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23, No. 10 (October 1999), page 64. The new system has a longer shelf life, a simpler and more effective operational procedure, improved interface with instrumentation, and shorter processing time. More specifically, the improvements have targeted bag and <b>locking</b> <b>clip</b> materials, sampling ports, and air pocket prevention. The WBSD stains whole blood collected during spaceflight for subsequent flow cytometric analysis. In short, the main device stains white blood cells by use of monoclonal antibodies conjugated to various fluorochromes, followed by lysing and fixing of the cells by use of a commercial reagent that has been diluted according to NASA safety standards. This system is compact, robust, and does not require electric power, precise mixing, or precise incubation times. Figure 1 depicts the present improved version for staining applications, which is a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) bag with a Luer-lock port and plastic <b>locking</b> <b>clips.</b> An InterLink (or equivalent) intravenous- injection port screws into the Luer-lock port. The inflatable/collapsible nature of the bag facilitates loading and helps to minimize the amount of air trapped in the fully loaded bag. Some additional uses have been identified for the device beyond whole blood staining. The WBSD has been configured for functional assays that require culture of live cells by housing sterile culture media, mitogens, and fixatives prior to use [Figure 2 (a) ]. Simple injection of whole blood allows cell-stimulation culture to be performed in reduced gravity conditions, and product stabilization prior to storage, while protecting astronauts from liquid biohazardous materials. Also, the improved WBSD has reconstituted powdered injectable antibiotics by mixing them with diluent liquids [Figure 2 (b) ]. Although such mixing can readily be performed on Earth by shaking in glass vials, it cannot readily be performed this way in outer space without entraining air bubbles. The present device can be preloaded with the powder and diluent(s) in separate compartments. The powder and diluent(s) can be mixed, without introducing air bubbles, by removing the clip(s), then shaking. This use of the device could also be advantageous in terrestrial applications because it maintains the isolation of the constituents until the time of use...|$|R

Many suture patterns have been used in equine anastomoses to minimise post operative complications, which include leakage from the anastomosis site, stenosis and adhesions. Because of the critical condition of horses undergoing colic surgery, it is imperative this is performed as quickly as possible. Objectives: To evaluate, in vitro, differences in the time of execution and leakage pressure between the Lembert single layer (Lsl), Gambee and Lembert double layer suture patterns for intestinal anastomosis in the horse and correlate the time taken to complete the anastomosis and hemicircumference of the anastomotic site Methods: Small intestinal loops immersed in polyionic solution were anastomosed with one of the 3 suture patterns. The intestines were insufflated via a flexible rubber hose, connected to a pressure gauge, inserted into the lumen at one end and fixed at 25 cm fromthe anastomosis site with a <b>locking</b> <b>clip</b> and, using a tube fixed in the same manner at the other end connected to a sphygmomanometer bulb, the pressure at which leakage from the anastomosis site was revealed by the presence of bubbles.
