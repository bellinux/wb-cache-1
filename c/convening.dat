5|$|The local congresses {{preceding}} the 6th National Congress {{were far more}} organized than those held before the 5th National Congress. Unlike the previous Congress, the central party leadership issued instructions and training programs for party cadres on how to organize party congresses and conferences. Certain party cadres were made responsible for tutoring the executive committee directly subordinate {{to them on the}} Central Committee's draft Political Report. Local executive committees started <b>convening</b> conferences in early August to study the draft report. These conferences acted as precursors to the village-, municipal-, ward- and enterprise-level Party committee congresses, which started <b>convening</b> in mid-August. By early August, some grassroots-level party organs had begun the election of delegates to the 6th National Congress. At least five provinces had completed preparations for the basic-level party congresses by September, in four of these the basic-level congresses ran until late September.|$|E

5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported.

In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even <b>convening</b> a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E
5|$|Castelli and Martín Rodríguez {{moved to}} the Fort for an {{interview}} with Cisneros. Juan Florencio Terrada, commander of the Infantry Grenadiers, joined them, because their barracks were located under Cisneros' window, and his presence would not allow the Viceroy to request military aid to take Castelli and Martín Rodríguez prisoners. The guards let them pass unannounced, and they found Cisneros playing cards with Brigadier Quintana, prosecutor Caspe and aide Coicolea. Castelli and Rodríguez demanded once again the <b>convening</b> of an open cabildo, and Cisneros reacted angrily, considering their request an outrage. Rodríguez interrupted him and forced him to give a definitive answer. After a short private discussion with Caspe, Cisneros reluctantly gave his consent.|$|E

5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the <b>convening</b> of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{continued}} to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, {{hoping to be}} absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup {{with the support of}} Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, <b>convening</b> their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the <b>convening</b> magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct up or down vote. Without a magistrate, there would be nobody to legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E
