5000|$|The gate is {{crowned with}} the {{inscription}} [...] "Batterie de Bouviers" [...] and [...] "1879," [...] with a relief of a mortar on the keystone. Rainwater was <b>collected</b> by <b>gutters</b> and channeled to cisterns under the battery, supporting at least 200 troops and 19 artillery pieces.|$|R
5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced transpiration, but dew collects {{on the outside of the}} structure and can easily be <b>collected</b> by <b>gutters.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rooftop {{disconnection}} (RD) {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} means of reducing stormwater from residential lots. RD takes roof runoff that has been <b>collected</b> in <b>gutters</b> and piped directly to streets, storm drains, and streams and redirects it away from impervious surfaces to land-scaped areas (figure 1). Rooftop disconnection is a very sustainable best management practice (BMP) because it controls pollutants in runoff near their source. Redi-rected runoff from downspouts is infiltrated, filtered, treated, or reused prior to draining into a stormwater conveyance system...|$|R
5000|$|The Tuscanicum {{corresponds}} to the greater number apparently of those at Pompeii, in which the timbers of the roof are framed together, so as to leave an open space in the center, known as the compluvium. It was through this opening that all the light was received, {{not only in the}} hall itself, but in the rooms around. The rain from the roof was <b>collected</b> in <b>gutters</b> around the compluvium, and discharged from thence into a tank or open basin in the floor called the impluvium.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the lighthouse, an unlit {{day beacon}} was {{constructed}} {{to mark the}} spot of a dangerous reef {{near the center of}} the relatively shallow Mount Hope Bay. In June 1880, $25,000 was appropriated for the construction of a new lighthouse on Borden Flats, which consisted of a 50 ft cast-iron tower that included a keeper's quarters. The light went into service on October 1, 1881, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens producing a fixed red light 47 ft above mean high water. Rainwater was <b>collected</b> in <b>gutters</b> and stored in a cistern in the structure's basement level, providing the keeper's water supply.|$|R

There were no public toilets {{in the streets}} or squares. Visitors, especially women, often became desperate when nature called. In the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive....As a metropolis, Berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870." ...|$|R
50|$|The pyramid stands about 26 feet (8 meters) tall, 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, {{and has a}} conical shape. It is {{constructed}} of plastic sheeting, which is inflated using a fan powered by solar energy generated by the pyramid. Within the pyramid, temperatures reach up to 167 °F (75 °C), which evaporates water pumped into thin layer of water inside the cone. Distilled water runs {{down the sides of}} the pyramid wall and is <b>collected</b> by <b>gutters</b> that feed into a collection tank. When sunshine is replaced by rain, the falling water is also collected {{around the edge of the}} base of the cone and stored for use in dry weather. Each pyramid can desalinate approximately 265 gallons (1000 liters) of water each day. To increase water production, a village simply adds additional pyramids.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{homes are}} in the main villages of Vingt-Cinq and Les Fourchettes on the North Island, and St. Rita on the South Island. The road {{connecting}} the different localities is sandy and coral. The North Island is home to an airstrip, a government primary school [...] "Jacques Le Chartier", the police station, the weather station, the central telecommunications office (Mauritius Telecom) and the health service. There is no running water on the island. Drinking water comes from rainwater <b>collected</b> by <b>gutters.</b> Water for other uses is sourced from wells. Electricity is supplied by generators running on diesel, with supply limited to certain hours. The company that manages the remote islands, such as Agaléga and St Brandon, {{is working on a}} project to ensure power supply to these islands, via submarine connection.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{adjacent}} to the station building, at its south-west end, is a detached signal cabin. This is a small square structure with a skillion roof, clad with metal sheeting, and has aluminium-framed windows. A modern water tank <b>collects</b> rainwater from <b>gutters</b> of the signal cabin. The signal cabin building and the rain water tank are not of cultural heritage significance, but the cabin houses two culturally significant elements: a steel, 15 lever frame, set into timber floorboards, and a timber-framed cabin diagram mounted on the rear wall.|$|R

The metals investigated were chromium, lead, arsenic, selenium, cadmium and barium using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results obtained further revealed elevated concentrations metals from both selected gutters and the Lagos bar beach. It was also observed that the Lagos bar beach is {{the receiving end of}} all the pollution loads arising from the channeled gutters. These elevated trace element concentrations obtained in sediment in this study were compared with other similar studies. The sediment contaminations by metals were traceable to industries and anthropogenic substances in Lagos metropolis. @JASE...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by <b>collecting</b> runoff in <b>gutters</b> and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|R
5000|$|Owing to {{the lack}} of water sources on the island, roofs were and are still used for {{rainwater}} collection. Early water tanks were placed not underground, but in adjacent stone structures later likened by one American observer to a lean-to. These tanks were fed via a stone gutter from the roof. [...] Sunk six to eight feet down, they were typically rectangular and appeared barrel-vaulted above the surface. A distinctive style of Bermudian roof developed, with a stepped profile of limestone slabs, grouted to make it impermeable and to stay clean. Rain on such a roof is slowed by the steps, rather than sloping tiles, and is <b>collected</b> by the <b>gutter.</b> This dependence on harvester rain led to a culture of water conservation, even with today's desalination plants.|$|R

ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to provide epidemiological information on the distribution and diversity of vector mosquito species in conventional larval breeding habitats in Minna Metropolis, Nigeria. Selected larval habitats were rice-fields, gutters, septic tanks, rain pools and streams, which were sampled weekly during the months of September through November of 2013. The results indicated the occurrence of seven vector mosquito species in the area namely, Culex pipiens pipiens (38. 84 %), Cx. salinarius (28. 78 %), Aedes aegypti (10. 71 %), Anopheles gambiae (7. 29 %), Cx. restuans (6. 52 %), Cx. nigripalpus (4. 72 %), and An. funestus (4. 15 %). Culex p. pipiens was the most widely distributed species, being absent only in the stream habitats, that was totally devoid of mosquitoes. Cx. nigripalpus and Cx. salinarius were encountered in three of habitat types (i. e., rice-fields, gutters and septic tanks), while Ae. Aegypti was encountered in the gutters and the rain pools. In addition to the rain pools, Cx. Restuans was also <b>collected</b> from <b>gutters.</b> The two anopheline species encountered had similar pattern of larval habitat distribution been found only in rice fields and rain pools. On the whole, the rice-fields and gutters were the most productive larval habitats, in terms of mosquito abundance (28. 04 % and 29. 67 % respectively) and diversity (diversity index= 0. 6940 and 0. 4834 respectively). Overall mosquito species diversity for the area was 0. 6985, largely contributed by Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. salinarius. The {{findings of this study}} suggest serious threat of mosquito-borne disease...|$|R
5000|$|At {{least ten}} of the company's {{surviving}} structures, seven fish cabins and three ice houses, have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] The cabins and ice houses are [...] "frame vernacular cabins set on wood pilings" [...] and were all built on submerged land between approximately 1920 and 1941. Most of these locations {{were added to the}} National Register pursuant to a 1991 Multiple Property Submission titled the [...] "Fish Cabins of Charlotte Harbor." [...] The Multiple Property Submission cited the cabins' significance in the development of southwest Florida's commercial fishing industry, and [...] "their architecture, materials, and workmanship" [...] as examples of distinctive and functional architecture. [...] In a 2008 feature story on the area's historic fish shacks, The News-Press wrote:"Commercial fishermen ... lived months at a time in simple one-story wood-frame cabins on pilings in Pine Island Sound and Charlotte Harbor. They had no electricity, no plumbing, no telephone. Rain <b>gutters</b> <b>collected</b> water they rationed. ... The fish cabins ... are the legacy of a thriving industry that worked Charlotte Harbor waters before World War II. Fishermen netted fish by hand and stored their catch in the fish companies' ice houses, where boats picked up the harvest and carried it to Punta Gorda." ...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the Second International Conference on Rainwater Cistern Systems, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, June 25 - 27, 1984. A urban water harvesting system in Tucson, Arizona is described. The system consists of a 100, 000 gallon reservoir fed through a 6 -inch pipe by a 4 -acre urban watershed. In addition a 3 -acre watershed {{is connected to the}} pond with both a earth lined and fibreglass reinforced asphalt channel. The 3 -acre watershed includes the acre lot on which the reservoir is located. A <b>gutter</b> <b>collects</b> the runoff from the house on this lot and directs it into the pond. The front driveway is paved and directly connected to the pond so that a high percentage of its rainfall is harvested. The reservoir is multipurpose providing irrigation for a large (4000 sq. ft.) garden and orchard area in addition to landscape irrigation. Also in the future the reservoir will provide sufficient water {{to take care of the}} flushing of toilets for a family of 8. The reservoir also is used for the raising of fish thus providing both food and recreation. Trout is raised in the winter and tilapia in the summer. The pond also provides swimming, rafting and aesthetic enjoyment in an arid environment. The cost effectiveness of the reservoir is high primarily because of the high watershed area to capacity ratio. With a relatively high demand the reservoir refills several times each year. Only a small percentage of the rainfall on the watershed is utilized because of the relatively small storage capacity of the reservoir. This percentage of utilization is estimated to be about 15 percent...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{material}} eroded by urban runoff and <b>collected</b> in the <b>gutters</b> can contain contaminants. Taraxacum officinale {{is a very}} ubiquitous species of degraded soil found in urban environment and. It can grow in very shallow spaces between {{the cracks in the}} pavements. This study represents a preliminary approach to verify the presence of metals in the soil-like material collected by urban runoff, the metal uptake by dandelion, and therefore check the possible alteration of some of its physiological parameters {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of its adaptation. The run off was collected in three sites in the town of Pisa and analyzed for Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn after nitric-perchloric microwave digestion by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The total values of Pb and Zn exceeded the limits for residential areas respectively in two and three sites. Trials were set up growing dandelion seedlings on the soil runoff material in floating cultivation. Poyphenols, antioxidants, sulphydryl groups and chlorophyll were measured in dandelion leaves grown on the contaminated material and on the control. The phenolic compound content was extracted with methanol, and was assayed quantitatively at A 765 with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, whereas 'antioxidant power' was determined using the FRAP method. Chlorophylls a (Chla) and b (Chlb) were extracted from young leaf discs (10 mm) with N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) and determined spectrophotometrically. The first two parameters (polyphenols and antioxidants) were higher in the run off samples compared to the control in one case, sulphydryl groups showed no difference, and chlorophyll was lower in the run off samples. These results indicate thatdandelion can survive in case of plant stress by simply altering its physiological parameters...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen wooden {{structures}} with two roofs each were installed to study runoff quality for four commonly used roofing materials (wood shingle, composition shingle, painted aluminum, and galvanized iron) at Nacogdoches, Texas. Each roof, either facing NW or SE, was 1. 22 m wide x 3. 66 m long with a 25. 8 % roof slope. Thus, there were 32 alternatively arranged roofs, consisting of four roof types x two aspects x four replicates, in the study. Runoff from the roofs was <b>collected</b> through galvanized <b>gutters,</b> downspouts, and splitters. The roof runoff {{was compared to}} rainwater collected by a wet/dry acid rain collector for the concentrations of eight water quality variables, i. e. Cu(2 +), Mn(2 +), Pb(2 +), Zn(2 +), Mg(2 +), Al(3 +), EC and pH. Based on 31 storms collected between October 1997 and December 1998, the results showed: (1) concentrations of pH, Cu, and Zn in rainwater already exceed the EPA freshwater quality standards even without pollutant inputs from roofs, (2) Zn and Cu, the two most serious pollutants in roof runoff, exceeded the EPA national freshwater water quality standards in virtually 100 % and more than 60 % of the samples, respectively, (3) pH, EC, and Zn were the only three variables significantly affected by roofing materials, (4) differences in Zn concentrations were significant among all roof types and between all roof runoff and rainwater samples, (5) although {{there were no differences}} in Cu concentrations among all roof types and between roof runoff and rainwater, all means and medians of runoff and rainwater exceeded the national water quality standards, (6) water quality from wood shingles was the worst among the roof types studied, and (7) although SE is the most frequent and NW the least frequent direction for incoming storms, only EC, Mg, Mn, and Zn in wood shingle runoff from the SE were significantly higher than those from the NW; the two aspects affected no other elements in runoff from the other three roof types. Also, Zn concentrations from new wood-shingle roofs were significantly higher than those from aged roofs of a previous study. The study demonstrated that roofs could be a serious source of nonpoint water pollution. Since Zn is the most serious water pollutant and wood shingle is the worst of the four roof types, using less compounds and materials associated with Zn along with good care and maintenance of roofs are critical in reducing Zn pollution in roof runoff...|$|R
40|$|Terre Haute, Indiana, {{is similar}} to many older cities {{throughout}} the United States {{with a history of}} manufacturing and industry that relied on extensive road and rail networks. This industrial history has resulted in the presence of over 20 brownfields and even a Superfund Site within the city today. Historic neighborhoods and abundance of pre- 1950 ’s homes is another characteristic of the city. Unfortunately, improper removal and deterioration of lead (Pb) paints, as well as high Pb solder used in gutters, appear to be significant sources of soil Pb in Terre Haute. Despite the fact that most new environmental sources of Pb pollution have been eradicated, many areas of the city still have elevated soil Pb concentrations and the city continues to have children with elevated blood Pb levels. With the Center for Disease Control’s recent reduction in screening levels for blood Pb from 10 μg/dL to 5 μg/dL, the occurrence of children with childhood Pb poisoning could be greater than previously recognized. The goal {{of this study was to}} better understand the modern-day spatial distribution of Pb in surface soils across the city of Terre Haute. To achieve this goal, surface soil samples were collected across the city. New data were collected from city-owned properties (i. e. parks, cemeteries, and abandoned lots), Indiana State University land holdings within the city, residential properties, and community gardens. Data collected from residential areas included samples near the road, from beneath the gutter dripline of the house, in the backyard, in the garden, and other areas of importance to the homeowner. Samples were analyzed via handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer on site to provide homeowner with immediate feedback with the ultimate goal of increasing the use of safer urban gardening practices. Samples were then dried and crushed to re-analyze with the portable XRF, and samples with values > 200 ppm Pb were processed and analyzed with the ICP-OES to verify the results. Results produced a wide range of Pb concentrations, from 30, 000 ppm for the residential areas. The spatial distribution of Pb was determined using a simple ordinary kriging method and Empirical Bayesian Kriging method by analyzing the total sample set, samples collected near the road, samples from yards and gardens, and under the gutter driplines of homes were also kriged. Samples <b>collected</b> near the <b>gutter</b> dripline had the highest Pb concentrations, while overall spatial trends depict higher Pb concentrations in the historic portion of the city, with concentrations decreasing with distance from the older part of the city. The predicted Pb concentrations generated from the total sample set was then compared to demographic, environmental, and infrastructure characteristics for Terre Haute. OLS regressions using both maximum and average Pb concentrations indicate a statistically significant (p= 0. 000) positive correlation between high Pb concentrations and percentage of vacant homes. Maximum and average Pb concentrations were then linked to individual U. S. Census block groups with associated demographic attributes. Bivariate local indicator of spatial association (Bi-LISA) analysis indicates populations of low socio-economic status are regularly being exposed to higher Pb concentrations in their neighborhoods, while populations with higher socio-economic status are exposed to lower Pb concentrations. The higher Pb concentrations and populations with lower socio-economic status both occur in the central portion of the city where historic development occurred representing environmental injustice...|$|R
