40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the provision of high performance multicast services which has the potential to fulfill the requirements of upcoming distributed applications. The conventional approach of error control performed in end systems is appropriate for small groups, low error probability, and low path capacities. Where these conditions are not met, the deployment of Group <b>Communication</b> <b>Servers</b> offers superior scaling properties. In heterogeneous internetworks, reliable multicasting involving Group <b>Communication</b> <b>Servers</b> can be based on XTP. In a homogeneous ATM environment, a reduced overhead in comparison with XTP can be achieved by the deployment of the Reliable Multicast Service Specific Transfer Protocol RMC-SSTP on top of AAL 5 CPCS. This paper also {{presents a}} highly modular implementation architecture for a communication co-processor that is especially targeted towards the support of protocols like XTP or RMC-SSTP. Key features are high flexibility and performance due to parametrizable and programmable VLSI components. Promising synthesis results show that a much higher performance can be reached with this approach compared to conventional systems. ...|$|R
