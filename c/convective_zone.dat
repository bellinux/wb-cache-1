Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

Angular momentum transport is strong, leading to strong concentration of angular momentum in the outer <b>convective</b> <b>zones</b> which develop envelope masses greater than 30 earth masses. When the models are allowed to contract near the calculation's end, the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity at the outer radius rises sufficiently to validate the quasi-spherical approximation...|$|R

500|$|The {{occurrence}} of convection {{in the outer}} envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass. Stars with several times {{the mass of the}} Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> located in the outer layers. Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 [...] are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core. For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.|$|E
500|$|Above {{the level}} of the {{photosphere}} is the stellar atmosphere. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. Above this is the transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only [...] Beyond this is the corona, a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres. The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> in the outer layers of the star. Despite its high temperature, and the corona emits very little light, due to its low gas density. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the details}} of sunspot {{generation}} are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of magnetic flux tubes in the Sun's <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> that get [...] "wound up" [...] by differential rotation. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature.|$|E
40|$|The current {{understanding}} of the turbulent dissipation in stellar <b>convective</b> <b>zones</b> {{is based on the}} assumption that the turbulence follows Kolmogorov scaling. This assumption is valid for some cases in which the time frequency of the external shear is high (e. g. solar p-modes). However, for many cases of astrophysical interest (e. g. binary orbits, stellar pulsations e. t. c.) the timescales of interest lie outside the regime of applicability of Kolmogorov scaling. We present direct calculations of the dissipation efficiency of the turbulent convective flow in this regime using simulations of anelastic convection with external forcing. We show that the effects of the turbulent flow are well represented by an effective viscosity coefficient and we provide the values of the effective viscosity as a function of the perturbation frequency. In addition we justify a perturbative method for finding the effective viscosity (proposed by Goodman & Oh (1997)) that can be applied to actual simulations of the surface <b>convective</b> <b>zones</b> of stars...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field topology and differential rotation are fundamental signatures of the dynamo processes that generate the magnetic activity {{observed in the}} Sun and solar-type stars. To investigate how these dynamo processes evolve in stars with shallow <b>convective</b> <b>zones,</b> we present high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the young GO dwarf HD 171488 over three epochs. Using the Zeeman–Doppler tomographic imaging technique, we have reconstructed surface brightness images that are dominated by polar and high-latitude starspots and a {{magnetic field}} topology that shows large-scale radial and azimuthal magnetic field components. Over the time-span of our observations, we do not observe {{a reversal of the}} magnetic field polarity as has been observed in other solar-type stars with shallow <b>convective</b> <b>zones.</b> The phase coverage of our data was sufficient to determine the differential rotation for two epochs where in conjunction with previous work, we conclude that there is no evidence for the temporal evolution of differential rotation...|$|R
30|$|After {{reviewing}} the literature, the anterior numerical and analytical models studied the transient {{evolution of the}} temperature and concentration profiles in a one-dimensional salinity gradient solar pond.

2500|$|Features {{revealed}} by helioseismology include that the outer <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> {{and the inner}} radiative zone rotate differently, which is thought by some to generate the main magnetic field {{at least in the}} outer layers of the Sun by a dynamo effect. Broadly speaking, the angular velocity of the convection zone decreases from equator to the poles, varying only weakly with depth; the radiative envelope beneath rotates almost uniformly. [...] These two regions are separated by a shear layer called the tachocline, which is too thin to be resolved directly by seismological analysis alone. The <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> has [...] "jet streams" [...] of plasma (called torsional oscillations) thousands of kilometers below the surface. The jet streams form broad fronts at the equator, breaking into smaller cyclonic storms at high latitudes. Torsional oscillations are the time variation in solar differential rotation. They are alternating bands of faster and slower rotation. So far there is no generally accepted theoretical explanation for them, even though a close relation to the solar cycle is evident, as they have a period of eleven years, as was known since they were first observed in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Stellar {{magnetic}} fields, {{according to}} solar dynamo theory, are caused within the <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> of the star. The convective circulation of the conducting plasma functions like a dynamo. This activity destroys the star's primordial magnetic field, then generates a dipolar magnetic field. As the star undergoes differential rotation—rotating {{at different rates}} for various latitudes—the magnetism is wound into a toroidal field of [...] "flux ropes" [...] that become wrapped around the star. The fields can become highly concentrated, producing activity when they emerge on the surface.|$|E
2500|$|There is a phase on {{the ascent}} of the asymptotic-giant-branch where a deep <b>convective</b> <b>zone</b> forms and can bring carbon {{from the core}} to the surface. [...] This {{is known as the}} second dredge up, and in some stars there may even be a third dredge up. [...] In this way a carbon star is formed, very cool and {{strongly}} reddened stars showing strong carbon lines in their spectra. [...] A process known as hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and nitrogen before it can be dredged to the surface, and the interaction between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra of carbon stars in particular clusters.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} stars with transiting planets {{for which the}} stellar {{obliquity}} is large are preferentially hot (T [subscript eff] > 6250 K). This could explain why small obliquities were observed in the earliest measurements, which focused on relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys, as opposed to hotter stars that emerged more recently from transit surveys. The observed trend {{could be due to}} differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass. Alternatively, we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin {{with a wide range of}} obliquities, but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to tidal dissipation in their <b>convective</b> <b>zones,</b> while hot stars cannot realign because of their thinner <b>convective</b> <b>zones.</b> This in turn would suggest that hot Jupiters originate from few-body gravitational dynamics and that disk migration plays at most a supporting role.

40|$|We present {{here the}} first stellar models on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), in which {{convection}} is treated {{according to the}} novel scale-free convection theory (SFC theory) by Pasetto et al. (2014). The aim is to compare {{the results of the}} new theory with those from the classical, calibrated mixing-length (ML) theory to examine differences and similarities. We integrate the equations describing the structure of the atmosphere from the stellar surface down to a few percent of the stellar mass using both ML theory and SFC theory. The key temperature over pressure gradients, the energy fluxes, and the extension of the <b>convective</b> <b>zones</b> are compared in both theories. The analysis is first made for the Sun and then extended to other stars of different mass and evolutionary stage. The results are adequate: the SFC theory yields <b>convective</b> <b>zones,</b> temperature gradients of the ambient and of the convective element, and energy fluxes that are very similar to those derived from the "calibrated" MT theory for main sequence stars. We conclude that the old scale dependent ML theory can now be replaced with a self-consistent scale-free theory able to predict correct results, one which is simpler and more physically grounded than the ML theory. Fundamentally, the SFC theory offers a deeper insight of the underlying physics than numerical simulations. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Teleconnections have {{traditionally}} been studied for the case of dry dynamical response to a given diabatic heat source. Important anomalies often occur within <b>convective</b> <b>zones,</b> for instance, in the observed remote response to El Niño. The reduction of rainfall and teleconnection propagation in deep convective regions poses theoretical challenges because feedbacks involving convective heating and cloud radiative effects come into play. Land surface feedbacks, including variations of land surface temperature, and ocean surface layer temperature response {{must be taken into}} account. During El Niño, descent and negative precipitation anomalies often extend across equatorial South America and the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone. Analysis of simulated mechanisms in a case study of the 1997 / 98 El Niño is used to illustrate the general principals of teleconnections occurring in deep <b>convective</b> <b>zones,</b> contrasting land and ocean regions. Comparison to other simulated events shows similar behavior. Tropo-spheric temperature and wind anomalies are spread eastward by wave dynamics modified by interaction with the moist convection zones. The traditional picture would have gradual descent balanced by radiative damping, but this scenario misses the most important balances in the moist static energy (MSE) budget.
