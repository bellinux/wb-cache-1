Spatial and temporal variations in the gradients are indicative of multiple causative sources during unrest, in particular for ground subsidence from 1988 onwards. Supported by results obtained from time-series inversion for the period 1988 – 2000 using a random search approach of a purely elastic earth model and a genetic algorithm accounting for elastic-gravitational effects, we propose a centre of dilatation undergoing predominantly pressure changes yet negligible mass changes as the dominant cause for caldera deflation.

5000|$|La Pacana has a {{diameter}} of 60 x 35 km with a north-south elongation. This {{is one of the}} best exposed and largest calderas in the world; the largest caldera known is Toba in Sumatra with a maximum length of 100 km. La Pacana might not be a single caldera; some reconstructions imply that the northern parts of the caldera are actually a separate collapse structure. The floor of the caldera lies at an elevation of 4200 - 4500 m, the central uplift and the caldera rim are higher and reach 5200 m. The caldera rim is well exposed except in the northern and western sides, where later volcanism has buried it. After the formation of the caldera, sediments and tuffs within the caldera were uplifted over an angular area of 350 km2, forming the 1 km high resurgent dome known as Cordón La Pacana. This resurgent dome is cut by numerous faults and features a poorly developed graben on its summit. Originally it was believed that the present-day calder raim did not coincide with the <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fault, which was instead identified to coincide with margins of the resurgent dome; later research however indicates the present-day topographic margin as the caldera edge. The resurgent dome is separated from the caldera rim by a 2 - 10 km wide moat that makes up about two thirds of the entire surface of the caldera, but is interrupted on the northern side of the caldera by the [...] "hinge" [...] of the caldera collapse, which assumed the form of a trap-door. The moat is filled by sediments formed by erosion and by alluvial, evaporite and lacustrine sediments left behind by lakes.|$|E

40|$|Near-bottom {{magnetic}} field {{data were collected}} using a towed magnetometer over selected parts of Palinuro and Marsili submarine volcanoes in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. We obtained equivalent magnetizations maps at these sites by inverting the corresponding magnetic anomalies, highlighting the seafloor expression of hydrothermal alteration. Zones of reduced magnetization are interpreted as evidence for alteration related to hydrothermal processes; they are associated with water-column and seafloor observations of hydrothermal activity and altered host rocks. At Marsili volcano, a large elliptical area of reduced magnetization is located south of the summit cone and perpendicular to the trend of Marsili volcano itself. This confirms {{the presence of a}} large hydrothermal system centered over the more recent eastern volcanic ridge and its associated magma chamber. Similarly, areas of reduced magnetization over Palinuro caldera are consistent with hydrothermal venting occurring along the caldera walls, consistent with permeability structures related to <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> faults providing preferred pathways for the upflow of hydrothermal fluids...|$|E
40|$|Nili Patera is a 50 [*]km {{diameter}} caldera at {{the center}} of the Syrtis Major Planum volcanic province. The caldera is unique among Martian volcanic terrains in hosting: (i) evidence of both effusive and explosive volcanism, (ii) hydrothermal silica, and (iii) compositional diversity from olivine-rich basalts to silica-enriched units. We have produced a new geological map using three mosaicked 18 [*]m/pixel Context Camera digital elevation models, supplemented by Compact Remote Imaging Spectrometer for Mars Hyperspectral data. The map contextualizes these discoveries, formulating a stratigraphy in which Nili Patera formed by trapdoor collapse into a volcanotectonic depression. The distinctive bright floor of Nili Patera formed either as part of a felsic pluton, exposed during caldera formation, or as remnants of welded ignimbrite(s) associated with caldera formation—both scenarios deriving from melting in the Noachian highland basement. After caldera collapse, there were five magmatic episodes: (1) a basaltic unit in the caldera's north, (2) a silica-enriched unit and the associated Nili Tholus cone, (3) an intrusive event, forming a ~ 300 [*]m high elliptical dome; (4) an extrusive basaltic unit, emplaced from small cones in the east; and (5) an extreme olivine-bearing unit, formed on the western <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fault. The mapping, together with evidence for hydrated materials, implies magmatic interaction with subsurface volatiles.

40|$|Hutchison {{was funded}} by NERC studentship NE/J 5000045 / 1. In volcanically and seismically active rift systems, preexisting faults may control the rise and {{eruption}} of magma, and direct the flow of hydrothermal fluids and gas in the subsurface. Using high-resolution airborne imagery, field observations, and CO 2 degassing data on Aluto, a typical young silicic volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift, we explore how preexisting tectonic and volcanic structures control fluid pathways and spatial patterns of volcanism, hydrothermal alteration and degassing. A new {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) digital elevation model and evidence from deep geothermal wells show that the Aluto volcanic complex is dissected by rift-related extensional faults with throws of 50 - 100 m. Mapping of volcanic vent distributions reveals a structural control by either rift-aligned faults or an elliptical <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fracture. Soil-gas CO 2 degassing surveys show elevated fluxes (>> 100 g m- 2 d- 1) along major faults and volcanic structures, but significant variations in CO 2 flux along the fault zones reflect differences in near-surface permeability caused by changes in topography and surface lithology. The CO 2 emission from an active geothermal area adjacent to the major fault scarp of Aluto amounted to similar to 60 t d- 1; we estimate the total CO 2 emission from Aluto to be 250 - 500 t d- 1. Preexisting volcanic and tectonic structures have {{played a key role in}} the development of the Aluto volcanic complex and continue to facilitate the expulsion of gases and geothermal fluids. This case study emphasizes the importance of structural mapping on active rift volcanoes to understand the geothermal field as well as potential volcanic hazards. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. In the San Juan Mountains {{there exists a}} group of structural and topographic features which suggest a common origin. The relative positions of the San Juan Depression with the Silverton and Lake City Calderas indicate they are possibly {{on the edge of}} a large circular feature. Comparison with the 1 : 250, 000 scale Durango Geologic Map reveals a series of radial and arcuate faults concentric with the major circular feature. Such a fracture pattern implies that the circular feature may represent the extent of a major domal uplift in the area. The uplift was very likely due to the sub-crustal emplacement of the parent magma of the San Juan volcanics and intrusives. The broad doming led to the formation of a zone of tensional ring fractures which acted as conduits of release for the magma and the eventual development of the various <b>calderas.</b> The <b>ring</b> fracturing was probably incomplete with hinging occurring in the southern and southwestern portions of the dome accounting for the lack of development of caldera structures in that portion of the area...|$|R

40|$|A {{spectrum}} of precious and base metal, and lithophile element deposits is genetically, spatially, and temporally related to {{four types of}} high-level magmatic systems, each char-acterized at the surface by a distinct volcanic landform: stratovolcano, flow dome complex, caldera, and maar. Porphyry copper-bearing stocks and base metal-rich, precious metal veins are known from the deeper central zones of andesitic stratovolcanoes, and modern examples of such systems may be represented by roots of high-temperature geothermal fields in stra-tovolcano settings.

40|$|Fumaroles are {{the surface}} manifestation of {{hydrothermal}} circulation {{and can be}} influenced by magmatic, hydrothermal, hydrological and tectonic processes. This study investigates the temporal changes in fumarole temperatures and spatial extent on Aluto, a restless volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), {{in order to better}} understand the controls on fluid circulation and the interaction between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images, acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) over the period of 2004 to 2016, are used to generate time series of the fumarole temperatures and areas. The thermal anomalies identified in the ASTER images coincide with known fumaroles with temperatures > 80 °C and are located on or close to fault structures, which provide a pathway for the rising fluids. Most of the fumaroles, including those along the major zone of hydrothermal upwelling, the Artu Jawe Fault Zone, have pixel-integrated temperature variations of only ~ 2 ± 1. 5 °C. The exception are the Bobesa fumaroles located on a hypothesised <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fault which show pixel-integrated temperature changes of up to 9 °C consistent with a delayed response of the hydrothermal system to precipitation. We conclude that fumaroles along major faults are strongly coupled to the magmatic-hydrothermal system and are relatively stable with time, whereas those along shallower structures close to the rift flank are more strongly influenced by seasonal variations in groundwater flow. The use of remote sensing data to monitor the thermal activity of Aluto provides an important contribution towards understanding the behaviour of this actively deforming volcano. This method could be used at other volcanoes around the world for monitoring and geothermal exploration...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} that magma {{plays a key}} role in the extension and eventual break-up of the continental lithosphere. One of the most intriguing aspects of magmatism during the transition from continental rifting to sea-floor spreading is that large silicic magmatic systems develop within the rift zone. However, the processes by which these silicic magmatic centres develop as well as their larger role in rift development remains poorly understood. This thesis focuses on silicic volcanism in the Main Ethiopian Rift; the most extensive active continental volcanic field in the world, and home to over 10 million people. I use a variety of geological, geochemical, geophysical and geochronological techniques to explore spatial and temporal variability in volcanism in this active rift segment. In particular I focus on Aluto volcano, a restless caldera volcano just ∼ 200 km south of Addis Ababa, but by extension I make inferences about what this means for past, present and future volcanism at other caldera systems in East Africa. Aluto has been active for over 300, 000 years, and has overwhelming erupted chemically-evolved peralkaline rhyolites that are derived through protracted (> 80 %) fractional crystallisation. Tectonic faults dissect the volcanic complex, and along with an underlying <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fault provide key pathways for fluid release. Episodic ground deformation events occur at Aluto, and are characteristic of a coupled magmatic-hydrothermal system, where faults networks connecting the surface and deep reservoirs play an important role in the deflation. Finally, new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology suggest that silicic volcanism in this segment of the rift is pulsed, not steady, on human evolutionary timescales. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTurbulent {{volcanic}} jets {{are produced}} by highly-energetic explosive eruptions and may form buoyant plumes that rise many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere to form umbrella clouds or collapse to generate ground-hugging pyroclastic flows. Ash injected into the atmosphere can be transported for many hundreds of kilometres {{with the potential to}} affect climate, disrupt global air travel and cause respiratory health problems. Pyroclastic flows, by contrast, are potentially catastrophic to populations and infrastructure close to the volcano. Key to which of these two behaviours will occur {{is the extent to which}} the mechanical entrainment and mixing of ambient air into the jet by large (entraining) eddies forming the jet edge changes the density of the air–ash mixture: low entrainment rates lead to pyroclastic flows and high entrainment rates give rise to buoyant plumes. Recent experiments on particle-laden (multi-phase) volcanic jets from flared and straight-sided circular openings suggest that the likelihood for buoyant plumes will depend strongly on the shape and internal geometry of the vent region. This newly recognised sensitivity of the fate of volcanic jets to the structure of the vent is a consequence of a complex dynamic coupling between the jet and entrained solid particles, an effect that has generally been overlooked in previous studies. Building on this work, here we use an extensive series of experiments on multi-phase turbulent jets from analogue linear fissures and annular ring fractures to explore whether the restrictive vent geometry during cataclysmic caldera-forming (CCF) eruptions will ultimately lead a relatively greater frequency of pyroclastic flows than eruptions from circular vents on stratovolcanoes. Our results, understood through scaling analyses and a one-dimensional theoretical model, show that entrainment is enhanced where particle motions contribute angular momentum to entraining eddies. However, because the size of the entraining eddies scales approximately with vent width, the extent of entrainment is reduced as the vent width becomes small in comparison to its length. Consequently, our work shows that for specified mass eruption rates, the high length-to-width ratio vents typical of CCF events are more likely to produce pyroclastic flows. We suggest that the enigmatic trend in the geological record for the largest CCF eruptions to produce pyroclastic flows is an expected consequence of their being erupted through continuous or piece-wise continuous <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fractures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn April 2007, Piton de la Fournaise volcano {{experienced}} a caldera collapse during its largest historical eruption. We present here a structural analysis {{both of the}} caldera and the surrounding area, and precise GPS data recorded with a dense GPS network specifically dedicated {{to the analysis of}} deformation related to the summit collapse structures. Despite a collapse of more than 300 m in the central zone, the geometry of the new caldera is similar in map view to that of the pre-existing collapsed structure, which was formed from the coalescence of several pit craters. The caldera shows an asymmetric inner geometry with sub-vertical walls in the NW quadrant and steep scarps composed of inward tilted blocks in the southern half. The presence of preserved polished surfaces on {{the lower part of the}} sub-vertical scarp indicates that it corresponds to the <b>caldera</b> north-western <b>ring</b> fault. The April 2007 caldera collapse led to the development and the reactivation of concentric fractures on the caldera rim, mostly along the southern limit of the caldera. GPS data show that fractures result from radial extensional stresses that are restricted within the first tens of meters of the caldera edge. GPS data also reveal that the caldera collapse was coeval with a centripetal deflation, whose magnitude is largest along the southern half of the caldera. The displacements recorded by GPS result from both a general deflation, due to magma withdrawal from Piton de la Fournaise's summit magma chamber, and additional local effects related to the caldera collapse. Comparison of the caldera collapses at Piton de la Fournaise, Miyakejima and Fernandina reveals striking similarities, with cyclic seismic signals accompanying small-scale deflation–inflation cycles. This strongly suggests a common mode of collapse. Hence, we propose a unifying model of caldera collapse in basaltic setting, in which the inward deflation due to magma withdrawal from the magma chamber prevents the collapse of the caldera roof until the gravitational stress acting on the rock column above the magma chamber exceeds the shear strength along pre-existing ring faults. The downward displacement stops when the pressure increase into the magma chamber is able to again sustain the rock column. The succession of (1) inward deflation that prevents the collapse, (2) collapse due to gravitational stress and (3) stopping of the downward motion is repeated many times. The frequency of the cycles is influenced by the rate of magma withdrawal and by the amount of intrusion of magma along the ring faults...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the role of an asymmetrically shaped magma chamber on the resurgence-related deformation of a caldera collapsed in a previously deformed crustal sector, a set of analogue models has been carried out. The obtained results have been compared with those of similar experiments, previously performed imposing a symmetrical magma chamber. Two lines of experiments were performed to simulate: a) resurgence in an area with a simple graben-like structure; b) resurgence in a caldera collapsed within the previously generated graben-like structure. On the basis of commonly accepted scaling laws, we used dry-quartz sand to simulate the brittle behaviour of the crust and newtonian siliconee to simulate the ductile behaviour of the intruding magma. An asymmetrical shape of the magma chamber has been simulated moulding handily only the upper surface of the siliconee. The resulting empty space has been then filled with sand. The results of the experiments are similar to those obtained with simmetrically shaped silicone. In the sample with a simple graben-like structure, resurgence occurs through the formation of a discrete number of differentially displaced blocks. The most uplifted portion of the deformed caldera floor is affected by newly formed, high-angle, inward dipping reverse faults. The least uplifted portion of the caldera is affected by normal faults with similar orientation, either newly formed or resulting from reactivation of the pre-existent graben faults. This asymmetric block resurgence has been also observed in the experiments performed with a previous caldera collapse. In this case the <b>caldera</b> collapse-related reverse <b>ring</b> fault is completely erased along the shortened side, and enhances the effect of the extensional faults on the opposite side, facilitating the intrusion of the siliconee. The most uplifted sector, due to an asymmetrically shaped intrusion, is always in correspondence with the thiker overbunden. These results suggest that the stress field induced by resurgence is likely dictated by the geometry of the intruding magma body...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeismic {{records from}} the RER very {{broad-band}} seismic station (La Réunion Island) belonging to the GEOSCOPE network are investigated to understand the eruptive succession (February to May) of Piton de la Fournaise and the caldera collapse episode of April 2007. Data first indicate that the short-lived, small volume, summit eruption of February 18 occurred during a phase of continuous inflation initiated in January 2007. Inflation decelerated around 2 weeks before a second short-lived small volume eruption on March 30 - 31 on the SE flank, almost simultaneous with a sudden, large deflation of the edifice. Deflation rate, which had stabilized at a relatively low level, increased anew on April 1 while no magma was emitted, followed on April 2 by a more distant {{and one of the}} most voluminous eruptions of the last two centuries at La Réunion Island. The RER station shows that very long period (VLP) and ultra long period (ULP) events developed during this period. Seven ULP events preceded the caldera collapse and 48 ones occurred during the caldera collapse over 9 days, most of which during the first 30 hours. A thorough examination of the seismic signals corrected for tide effects shows that each collapse event was coeval with VLP and ULP signals. Each individual collapse showed similar ULP and VLP signals characterized by periods of ∼ 500 s and ∼ 7 s, respectively. The back-azimuth of most ULP signals related to the caldera collapse points clearly toward the Dolomieu caldera. The strikingly constant duration of the VLP signals (around 20 s) related to the collapse events and their occurrence before the collapse initiation suggest a physical control of the volcanic edifice. Waveforms and spectrograms of the various caldera collapse events show very homogeneous patterns, suggesting a similar and repeating volcano-tectonic process for the formation of the VLP signals events. Although tilt may be responsible of part of the ULP signals observed during the collapse events, we show that it cannot explain most of the records. The ULP signals occurring during the collapse and also recorded by the OVPF GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) permanent network likely correspond to relaxation of the volcanic edifice. This analysis allows us to propose a scenario that may explain each successive collapse event as starting with a short-period event induced by the rock failure, followed by a VLP signal induced by dip-slip motion on the <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fault, and ending with a ULP signal likely related to a relaxation process of the edifice...|$|E
40|$|Postglacial {{activity}} on the Askja volcanic system, north Iceland, {{has been dominated by}} basaltic volcanism. Over 80 % of Askja's postglacial basalts fall within a relatively narrow compositional range containing between 4 and 8 wt. % MgO. The 'main series' is further divided into two groups separated by a distinct compositional gap evident in major and trace element concentrations. The most evolved basalts formed by fractional crystallisation within shallow magma reservoirs, followed by the extraction of residual liquid from a semi-rigid, interconnected crystal network. This process is analogous to the formation of melt segregations within single lava flows, and was responsible for generating several small-volume, aphyric basaltic lavas erupted along <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> fractures surrounding the Oskjuvatn (Askja lake) caldera in the early 20 th century. Further examples of evolved basalt are found throughout Askja's postglacial volcanic record. However, Askja's early postglacial output is dominated by more primitive compositions. Some of the most primitive basalts erupted within the Askja caldera are found in phreatomagmatic tuff cone sequences which crop out in the walls of Oskjuvatn caldera. one such tuff sequence has been dated at between 2. 9 and 3. 6 ka. This tuff cone shares geochemical source characteristics, such as Nb/La and Nb/Zr, with basaltic tephras erupted during precursory activity to the Plinian-phreatoplinian eruption of 28 th- 29 th March 1875. It may therefore be considered to be compositionally representative of the primitive basaltic magmas supplied to Askja during the postglacial period. The predominance of relatively primitive basalt (6. 8 wt. % MgO) within Askia's postglacial lava succession suggests that it did not have a permanent shallow magma chamber during the postglacial period. It is envisaged that the postglacial Askja magmas evolved by a process of polybaric factionation in transient, sill-like magma storage zones located at various levels in the crust. The most primitive magmas erupted directly from deeper reservoirs, while the more evolved magmas experienced longer crustal residence times. The buoyant rise of volatile-enriched melt from these sill-like bodies, without mobilising phenocryst phases, explains the observation that almost all lavas on Askja's eastern and southern lava aprons are essentially aphyric. The 28 th- 29 th March 1975 eruption marked the climax of a volcanotectonic episode on the Askja volanic system lasting from late 1874 to early 1876. Fissure eruptions also occurred at the Sveinagja graben, 45 - 65 km north of Askja, between February and October 1875, producing the Nyjahraun lava. A strong similarity exists between whole-rock major element concentrations from Myjahraun and the Askja 20 th century basalts. This has led to the suggestion that these basalts originated from a common shallow magma reservoir beneath Askja central volcano, with the Nyjahraun eruptions being fed by a lateral dyke extending northwards from Askja. This theory also offers an explanation for the observation that the volume of phyolitic ejecta from 28 th- 29 th March 1875 is significantly less than the volume of Oskjuvatn caldera, which was formed {{as a result of this}} eruption. New major and trace element data from whole-rock and glass samples indicated that Nyjahraun and the Askja 20 th century basalts did not share a common parental magma. A detailed investigation of historical accounts from explorers and scientists who visited Askja between 1875 and 1932 reveals that Oskjuvatn caldera took over 40 years to reach its current form, and that its size in 1876 was equal to the volume erupted on 28 th- 29 th March 1875. Small injections of magma into an igneous intrusion complex beneath Askja, coupled with background deflation, are sufficient to provide the required accommodation space for continued caldera collapse after 1876. Lateral flow is therefore not required to explain the volume of Oskjuvatn caldera, nor the eruption of evolved basaltic magma on the Askja volcanic system in 1875. It has been conjectured that the Holuhraun lava, located at the southern tip of the Askja volcanic system, was also connected with the 1874 - 76 Askja volcanotectonic episode. However, major and trace element data from whole-rock samples, glass and melt inclusions receal the Holuhraun is geochemically more similar to basalts erupted on the Bardarbunga-Veidivotn volcanic system than to postglacial basalts from Askja. The division between the 'Askja' and 'Veidivotn' geochemical signatures appears to be linked to east-west-striking lineations in the region south of Askja. This indicates that a particular geochemical signature is not necessarily confined to the tectonic expression of a single volcanic system, and has important implications for the identification and delineation of individual volcanic systems beneath the northwest sector of Vatnajokull.

40|$|THESIS 8606 Calderas are 1 - 100 km diameter, {{volcanic}} depressions {{that form}} primarily through m-scale to km?scale subsidence of a magma reservoir roof into an underlying magma reservoir. This study addresses several fundamental geometric and kinematic {{aspects of the}} structure of caldera volcanoes via a series of scaled physical (or analogue) modelling experiments. Results of these models are combined in detail with observations from natural calderas recorded in the literature, in order to provide as strong an element of ?ground-truthing? for the experimental results as possible. The basic experimental materials and methods are common to all the results chapters (2 - 6), and so for convenience are summarised together in Chapter 1. An exception to some extent is the experiment set described is Chapter 5; these were made with different materials and apparatus, the particulars of which are described in that chapter. Each of the results chapters is otherwise self-contained, with its own specific introduction to the problems addressed, summary of data, discussion, and conclusions. The contents of Chapters 1, 5, and 6 have been published in two peer-reviewed articles. The remaining chapters are presently unpublished, although Chapter 3 and part of Chapter 4 have been submitted for peer review, whilst the rest of Chapter 4 and a part of Chapter 2 will be submitted for publication at a later date. Given the assistance of co-authors in the preparation of manuscripts now integrated into the thesis, my contribution to the individual chapters as presented here may be summarised as: Chapter 1 : 85 %, Chapter 2 : 90 %, Chapter 3 : 75 %, Chapter 4 : 80 %, Chapter 5 : 50 %, Chapter 5 : 75 %. The structure of the thesis, the major aspects of caldera evolution investigated, and the main results are as follows: Chapter 1 : Introduction and Methodology - outlines the current understanding of caldera structure as achieved to date by previous authors and supplies the rationale for using physical models to help unravel caldera evolution. This section also summarises the insights for how these. Details of the experimental methodology employed in this study, as well as scaling considerations for the application of small-scale models to the study of large-scale deformation associated with caldera subsidence in nature, are also provided. Chapter 2 : The Geometry and Evolution of Circular Caldera Collapse Structures - details the results of experimental subsidence of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are circular in plan view. This baseline experiment set illustrates the generalised kinematic evolution of caldera subsidence. Structures resolving radial and concentric strains are documented, the latter for the first time. The control of the roof?s thickness/diameter ratio upon these structures? development is also highlighted. The kinematics of <b>caldera</b> <b>ring</b> faults, the generation of polygonal caldera outlines and the development of piecemeal-type subsidence are also discussed in light of the evidence from experiment and nature. Chapter 3 : The Caldera Collapse Continuum - systematically integrates results of simple circular collapses in Chapter 2 with those from past experimental, numerical and field studies to produce a ?state-of-the-art? synthesis of the mechanics and kinematics of caldera collapse. This synthesis sheds new light on the long-standing but poorly-defined continuum between end-member caldera collapse styles. Structural elements characteristic of each end-member are shown to reflect progressively overlapping structural sub-processes in a single collapse event. The continuum between end-member collapse styles is thus defined primarily as a progressive evolution related to increasing subsidence, although the regulatory role of roof thickness/diameter and caldera subsidence/diameter ratios in the development of structural elements of each collapse end-member is also highlighted. Chapter 4 : The Role of Magma Chamber Ellipticity in Caldera Collapse ? documents the results of experimental collapse of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are varyingly elliptical in plan view. Physical models demonstrate that an elliptical reservoir roof predictably fails first at the ends of its shorter principal axis, and show that lateral propagation (?unzipping?) patterns vary systematically with ellipticity. The models also highlight a characteristic geometric arrangement of elliptical ring structures and provide a first comprehensive view of the elliptical caldera structural architecture in 3 D. Chapters 5 & 6 : Regional tectonic influences on the evolution of caldera collapse ? outlines the results of experimental collapse of reservoir roofs that contain pre-existing mechanical anisotropies in the form of regional-tectonic faults and collapse under regional tectonic stress. Although disregarded in most previous physical and numerical models of calderas, regional faults have long been thought {{to play a major role}} in caldera development, principally through their reactivation during collapse. In Chapter 5, caldera formation in areas of orthogonal regional deformation is examined; in Chapter 6, caldera collapse in strike-slip regimes is investigated. In physical models, regional faults reactivated during collapse where they coincided with and ran parallel to the magma reservoir margins. Here, where syn-collapse strain usually tends to localise, pre-collapse faults are optimally orientated for reactivation. Contrary to inferences from some previous field studies, differential movement on pre-collapse faults was not observed in central parts of the subsiding reservoir roof. Physical models thus confirm that regional fault reactivation is an important process, and help clarify conditions favouring it. Chapter 7 : Summary of Main Conclusions and Outlook - provides a brief overview of the main findings of this thesis, notes their general implications for our understanding of calderas, and outlines some potential avenues for future work. An electronic appendix (DVD) is attached to the back of the thesis. This appendix contains photos of all experiments (in jpeg format), animations of the experiments (in MS PowerPoint files), and copies of the two published articles (in PDF format) ...|$|E
