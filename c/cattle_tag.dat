40|$|Gene {{expression}} phenotypes {{were evaluated}} for intramuscular fat (IMF) in bovine skeletal muscle {{as an alternative}} to traditional estimates of IMF%. Gene expression data from a time course of LM development in high- and low-marbling Bos taurus cattle crosses were compared to identify genes involved in intramuscular adipocyte lipid metabolism with developmentally similar gene expression profiles. Three sets of genes were identified: triacylglyceride (TAG) synthesis and storage, fatty acid (FA) synthesis, and PPAR. -related genes. In an independent analysis in the LM of 48 Bos indicus <b>cattle,</b> <b>TAG</b> and FA gene sets were enriched in the top 100 genes of which expression was most correlated with IMF% (P = 1. 2 x 10 (- 24) and 3. 5 x 10 (- 9), respectively). In general, genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of FA and TAG in the intramuscular adipocytes were present in the top 100 genes. In B. indicus, effects of a steroid hormone growth promotant (HGP), 2 experimental sites [New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA) ], and 3 tenderness genotypes on the expression levels of genes in the TAG gene set and the correlation of gene expression with IMF% were investigated. Although correlation between expression of 12 individual TAG genes and IMF% was observed in HGP-treated animals in both experimental sites (mean r = 0. 43), correlation was not observed for untreated animals at the NSW site (mean r = - 0. 07, P 0. 05) on the correlation of TAG genes with IMF%. In general, the interactions among genotype, treatment and location, and TAG gene set gene expression were consistent with the interactions among the same factors and IMF% detected using 255 animals, of which the 48 in this study were a subset. Thus, the TAG gene set constitutes a gene expression phenotype able to predict effects of different genotypes and treatments on IMF% using much smaller groups than current approaches, even in animals with very low IMF%.

40|$|Survival and {{reproductive}} rate estimation requires following uniquely identified individuals through time, and many statistical models assume markings {{used to identify}} individuals are permanent. However, survival rates are underestimated when single marks are lost, since the models will effectively score those animals as dead. In order to account for mark loss, some researchers use a double-mark approach, assuming the probability of losing one mark is independent of losing the other one. Therefore, mark loss can be estimated using animals that have lost one mark. Using a 17 -year dataset of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) marked with permanent brands and two <b>cattle</b> <b>tags</b> in their hind flippers, {{we were able to}} compare tag loss and survival rate estimates with and without the assumption of independent tag loss with respect to age, sex, and wean mass. We demonstrate the assumption of independent tag loss is not valid, showing it is more likely for an animal to lose both tags than just one or the other. The assumption of independent tag loss leads to an underestimate of survival rates which in turn leads to underestimates of population growth rate. In addition, tag loss rates are different by sex and age, with older males more likely to lose tags. Tag loss is also a quadratic function of wean mass through age two, with smaller and larger animals more likely to lose both tags. Such differences are possibly due to differences in behavior, flipper growth, and immune response. Using a Bayesian approach, {{we will be able to}} use our tag loss estimates as priors in future analyses for a subset of marked animals that only have flipper tags. With this population, the independent tag loss models are more likely to incorrectly estimate a declining population (growth rate < 1. 0), potentially leading to unwarranted management action. To account for non-independent mark loss in survival rate studies, we recommend researchers use at least two forms of marking on at least a subset of animals. However, neither form of marking need be permanent as long as mark loss is independent between the different forms...|$|R

Three fixed-antenna stationary readers were used to determine the variability between reading ranges of each reader. Tensile strength parameters differed among tag designs. Only one tag design did not display tamper-evident characteristics. Average reading ranges differed among all eight tag designs, and there were significant differences in performance ranges among the three readers. Performance variation in tags and readers exists due to differences in material makeup (die and copper) and design characteristics.

Animals {{were randomly selected}} and identified at the primary markets using uniquely coded ear tags. Data on identification, ownership, source (village), and the site of recruitment (primary market) were collected and posted to an online database. Similar data were collected in all the markets where tagged animals passed through until they got to defined slaughterhouses. Meat samples were collected during slaughter and later analyzed for tetracycline and diminazene residues using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Follow up surveys were done to assess the pilot system. The database captured a total of 4260 records from 741 cattle. Cattle recruited in the primary markets in Narok (n = 1698) either came from farms (43. 8 %), local markets (37. 7 %), or from markets in Tanzania (18. 5 %).

40|$|Population biology, {{behavioural}} thermoregulation {{and site}} preference of the New Zealand fur seal, Arctocephalus forsteri (Lesson, 1828) are described for the breeding colony on Taumaka, Open Bay Islands, Westland, New Zealand (43 ° 52 'S, 168 ° 53 'E), from data collected at irregular intervals between October 1974 and February 1977. Sixteen fur seals (6 females : 10 males) were shot and aged by counting growth rings in a canine tooth. The age determinations suggest that females produce their first pup at age 5 years, and that bulls attempt to hold territories by age 8 years, but rarely are successful until about age 10 years. During their delayed 'social maturation', bulls may gain experience necessary to maximize reproductive success once territorial. A bull's territorial success ultimately depends on his fighting ability, which {{depends largely on}} {{the presence or absence}} of lower canine teeth. Canines are broken off during fighting; bulls without lower canines rarely defeat an opponent. Females prefer sites on the rookery which provide pools of water, shade, and direct access to the sea. Both sexes use water and shade for cooling. The theoretical 'mean' pupping date on Taumaka is 10 December. The sex ratio at birth is about 1 : 1. Males are heavier than females at birth, and are heavier and larger than females at mean age 55, 140, 235 and 290 days. Pups are weaned at about 300 days. Pup growth rates differed dramatically between 1974 / 75 and 1975 / 76. For example, male pups were about 22 percent heavier at 235 days in 1975 / 76 than in 1974 / 75. Differential growth rates probably are a consequence of food availability to lactating females and differing environmental temperatures between seasons. Mortality to age 50 days is 20 percent. First year mortality may be 50, percent. Starvation may account for 70 percent of all deaths to age 50 days. Other causes of death include suffocation, drowning, trampling and predation. Human disturbance can kill pups indirectly by causing panic on the rookery. Tagging pups with monel metal <b>cattle</b> ear <b>tags</b> may increase mortality. About 1400 pups are born on Taumaka annually. Using this figure for pup production, and incorporating reproductive data from other fur seal species (where none exist for the New Zealand fur seal), the estimated population of pups, females of breeding age and bulls on Taumaka is about 3700. The estimated population size associated with Taumaka, either through birth or by breeding on the rookery, is about 6000 - 6500. Using these estimates, and incorporating population data from the Northern fur seal, the estimated population growth rate on Taumaka is about 2 percent per annum...|$|R

SchroederElectronic animal {{identification}} systems {{are becoming more}} common in livestock auction markets because of increased numbers of cattle being electronically identified. More cattle are being individually identified because of increasing enrollment in marketing alliances and verification programs. Also, the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has increased awareness and perhaps use of electronic identification. In this study, individual characteristics of livestock markets were analyzed to determine how they relate to a livestock market operator's views, concerns, {{and knowledge of the}} NAIS as well as adoption of RFID reading equipment. Investments in RFID tagging services and RFID reading equipment by livestock markets were estimated and price premiums associated with RFID <b>tagged</b> and preconditioned <b>cattle</b> were estimated. Data were from a national survey of livestock auction markets and cattle transaction data were obtained from three Kansas livestock markets. Auction markets that indicated they currently plan to add a RFID tagging service are likely to have more knowledge of the NAIS program standards, how to adopt the NAIS practices, and the probable costs involved. Managers of facilities that sell a large volume of livestock annually tend to have a higher level of understanding of how to adopt the NAIS practices and be more knowledgeable of the NAIS standards than operators of smallvolume facilities. Managers of markets that have operating RFID reader systems tend to be more understanding of how to adopt the NAIS practices and of costs associated with adopting the NAIS.

40|$|Generally, the {{movement}} of cattle within any country including Italy is very essential to the economics of livestock industry. However, this transmission can also carry and spread the risk of contracting the disease (infectious diseases) by other cattle in various geographical areas. For example, this pattern of animal movements brought about an outbreak of foot-and-mouth infectious disease throughout the UK in 2001. Also as Taylor et. al (2001) mentioned that these diseases can give rise to the productivity decline and even can lead to some threats to human health. Therefore, {{to reduce the risk}} and economic loss of this kind of contagious diseases, authorities should be able to manage and control them (Andesron, 2002). This control measures can consist of monitoring the animal trades, inspecting entry to and exit from premises, adopting some eradication programs (say, sending sick cattle to slaughterhouses), quarantining cattle, and etc. To properly assess this kind of control measures, we need a comprehensive and detailed information and regulation about the cattle movement pattern. To address these issues, European Economic Community (EEC) devised some regulations and imposed them on its member states to adhere to these measures (EU traceability framework). Actually, these measures originate from the public health and food health concerns, which are related to animal health and the economic impacts of the outbreak of infectious diseases. The EEC issued Council Directive 92 / 102 /EEC in 1992 (with latest modifications in 2013), which obliged member states to record the origin and destination point of each cattle. Also, each <b>cattle</b> should be <b>tagged</b> by an ear tag to be traceable. Specifically, European Parliament and European council in 2000 tried to simplify and implement this process through a digital framework that allows countries to identify and register their bovines. In Italy, this procedure was done by Italian National Animal Identification and Registration Database which proposes us a rich and valuable dataset, including the all required parameters, to perform and analyze some important determinants of Bovines movements and the effects of this kind of disease outbreaks on the pattern of bovines trade among different holdings. In recognition of the importance of national and international bovines’ trade, this thesis attempts to assess and investigate some relevant determinants of bovines movements among Italian holdings and Italian provinces. This study consists of three chapters. In the first chapter, we introduced a structural gravity model of trade and then we linked it to the Italian bovine trade system. Then, we assessed two important determinants of any animal movements, i. e. feed prices and financial literacy rate of farmers. In addition, we tried to analyze the interaction of these determinants on {{the movement}}s of bovines among Italian provinces. We found that feed (corn, in our case) price shocks and financial literacy rate of farmers could significantly affect on the pattern of bovines movement. Furthermore, our findings suggest that this two factors have a close relationship together and can offset each other's effects, {{in the sense that the}} enhancing financial literacy rate of farmers can somehow immune them to the unexpected price shocks and actually undermine the effects of unfavorable price shocks on their business. In the second chapter, we used again the structural gravity model and employed it to investigate the risk of the outbreak of bovine diseases among Italian provinces. We found that the disease incidence rate has a significant positive effect of {{the movement of}} bovines from origin nodes to destination points. Also, we tried to merge our findings with the feed (corn) price effects and saw that these two factors act in a different direction. That is the more is the incidence rate, the effect of feed prices become less relevant to the movement of bovines among different provinces. In chapter 3, we tried to have a more detailed view on the effects of disease outbreaks on the movements of bovines among farms and slaughterhouses. In general, we found that the disease status has a negative effect on bovines movement from farms to farms, and a positive influence on the movements of bovines from farms to slaughterhouses. In addition, we found that the ownership has a significant role in determining the pattern of trade among holdings, in the sense that the results are reliable only if two trading partners have different owner/keeper. Although, if the effects were driven by movements between farms with the same owner, it would be a rational decision by the owners in order to separate and protect healthy bovines from sick bovines. However, we found that in the case of positive disease tests, distance has a positive effect on the movement of bovines between various farms. This somehow shows us that some farms may act in such an opportunistic behaviors that can even lead to the spread of diseases among different regions. Finally, we analyzed some network characteristics of the bovines movements to see the effect of network structure and its interaction with disease status on the pattern of movements. More specifically, we used the most commonly used feature of any network i. e. indegree, outdegree, and degree and found that in the case of diseases the farms tend to send more bovines to the slaughterhouses. Actually, the results on the interaction of indegree and disease tests show us that the farms that have received more (probably sick) bovines from more suppliers in the previous period, tend to send more bovines to other farms in the current time period. Also, we should note that the indegree analysis can help us tracing back the diseases to the nodes that are more exposed to receiving bovines and consequently more subject to contracting diseases. On the other hand, we found the outdegree is also important only in case of the trade from farms to other farms. This tells us that in the case of diseases, the farms tend to not change significantly the pattern of their trading partners (other farms), and probably they tend to send their (probably sick) bovines to the other farms and this situation can even decrease the number of heads which transfer from farms to slaughterhouses. This confirms the importance of such nodes in the network in the sense that those with higher outdegree can be considered as most dangerous nodes and can act as a source of spreading diseases among different premises...|$|R
