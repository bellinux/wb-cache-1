25|$|The {{percussion}} {{section of}} the band has been using Pearl percussion for several years. In 2014, {{a decision was made}} to experiment with metal drum carriers. Drum carriers had been used {{for a number of years}} by tenor drum players, however the bass drums and snares continued to use <b>cloth</b> <b>sling</b> harnesses. Through a large amount of experimentation, metal carriers made their debut midway through the 2014 season for halftime and parade use only. The snares and basses are still carried by traditional sling for pregame, due to the visuals done with the drums that add to the excitement of the Ramp entrance.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the hammock in the Americas is often {{obscured}} in English-language sources from the late 18th century onward. Samuel Johnson claimed that the word hammock was of Saxon origin. This etymology was soon debunked, and later 19th-century sources attributed the invention to the Athenian politician Alcibiades. This was inferred from Plutarch, who wrote that Alcibiades had his galley bed hung from ropes, but did not specifically describe it as a net or sling. A few European sources mention the historical use of <b>cloth</b> <b>slings</b> as carriage seats, but not as regular beds.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{before sunrise}} {{the mothers of}} {{children}} under the age of three go to the common well to draw fresh water. In it they dip a sprig of basil or geranium. Then they take a bar of soap and a new towel and make way to the house of the midwife.The bathing ritual is performed outdoors - under a fruit tree in the garden, on the wood chopping block or on the front stairs of the house. (Traditional Bulgarian houses have their bottom floor half dug in the ground, under the street level; thus the main housing level is slightly elevated with a stone staircase leading to the front door of the house.) Every woman hands the midwife the soap, pours some water to wash her and then presents her with the new towel. The midwife, however, wipes her hands dry with the skirts of woman - to be fertile and to have easy deliveries. The midwife then presents the woman with a bunch of geraniums tied with red and white threads. While washing, the midwife may splash the water up in the air, jump three times and say [...] "So may jump the kids and become white and red healthy clear skin with rosy cheeks! May the harvest and health beas abundant as these water droplets!"After the bathing the women present the midwife with gifts of shirts, socks, <b>cloth,</b> which they <b>sling</b> on her right shoulder. In return the midwife ties a bracelet of red and white threads with a silver coin on the right arm of each child she has delivered and gives him or her socks and shirts. Then she ritually washes the face of the child as it is believed that the water which passes the hands of the baba on Babinden has cleansing properties.In some part of Bulgaria it is customary for mothers to take their children to be blessed by the baba until the children reach the age of three.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the corps style of marching has brought about new equipment for drumlines. In the 1970s and 1980s, specific drum harnesses were developed to accommodate marching {{with a set of}} bells, a single fiberglass timpani, or a xylophone. These types of harnesses are also used for snares, tenors (quads/quints), and bass drums, a significant upgrade to the traditional <b>cloth</b> <b>sling.</b> Multiple sizes of bass drums are often used for corps style bands, with the bass drums playing melodic or [...] "moving" [...] parts (similar to a hand bell choir) rather than a traditional military bass drum keeping a steady beat.|$|E
