60|$|Yesterday evening Mr. William Morris {{delivered}} a most interesting and fascinating lecture on Carpet and Tapestry Weaving at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition now {{held at the}} New Gallery. Mr. Morris had small practical models of the two looms used, the <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> where the weaver {{sits in front of}} his work; the more elaborate tapestry loom where the weaver sits behind, {{at the back of the}} stuff, has his design outlined on the upright threads and sees in a mirror the shadow of the pattern and picture as it grows gradually to perfection. He spoke at much length on the question of dyes--praising madder and kermes for reds, precipitate of iron or ochre for yellows, and for blue either indigo or woad. At the back of the platform hung a lovely Flemish tapestry of the fourteenth century, and a superb Persian carpet about two hundred and fifty years old. Mr. Morris pointed out the loveliness of the carpet--its delicate suggestion of hawthorn blossom, iris and rose, its rejection of imitation and shading; and showed how it combined the great quality of decorative design--being at once clear and well defined in form: each outline exquisitely traced, each line deliberate in its intention and its beauty, and the whole effect being one of unity, of harmony, almost of mystery, the colours being so perfectly harmonised together and the little bright notes of colour being so cunningly placed either for tone or brilliancy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{based on}} the {{structure}} of tufted <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> (DHGN 801 D- 400), the lumped parameter models were built, in which included the massless shafts, lumped masses, disk and elastic support. Secondly, according to various parts of the relationship between force and deformation, the transfer matrix of right and left ends were established, thus the universal transfer matrix of shaft units was determined by solving the various parts transfer matrix simultaneously. Thirdly, the dynamic behavior model of coupling shafts in tufted <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> was given, and different natural frequencies were acquired by simulating the model in Matlab. Lastly, the dynamic behavior model using transfer matrix was verified to be effective and feasible by experiment. Introductions The structure of coupling shafts in weaving equipments is very complicated. Many parallel axis and multiple sets of drive mechanisms are included, and every parallel axis is multi-span rotor system with bearing different dynamic load...|$|R

5000|$|In 1839 he {{contracted}} {{to produce a}} power-loom capable of weaving two-ply ingrain carpets, such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving [...] "Brussels" [...] (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, {{all of which were}} direct results of his inventive ability. The <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> made his name widely known.|$|E

The carpets, known as Donegals, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Áras an Uachtaráin, Buckingham Palace and internationally the Vatican, The White House, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime & Heritage Centre. The Centre provides information on the carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot. There is also a ship simulator which is the most modern in Ireland. The simulator offers three levels of technique providing great fun for children and the not so young testing their navigation skills. The centre is open all year round.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{to improve the}} existing tools and processes used by the artisans engaged in carpet sectors to enhance the productivity {{and the quality of}} the finished products in a cost effective manner have been initiated in 2000 by IIT Delhi [1]. Several machines like <b>Carpet</b> <b>Loom,</b> Scrapping Machine, Drying Machine, and Tools used in carpet manufacturing have been developed and tested in many carpet manufacturing belts, namely, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Jaipur, Srinagar and other places of India. Among those two machines, namely, a <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> and a scrapping machine are taken up in this paper for further improvement to reduce their cost. The loom is a static structure and the scrapping machine is a dynamic system. This paper presents the overview of these newly developed machines and the associated features. In order to get wider acceptance to the users, the machines should be available at affordable prices. Hence, as a part of further improvement, modelling and optimization of the loom [4] and scrapping machines are undertaken.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2009 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 61 - 63) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishix, 63 leavesThis thesis {{covers a}} study on the design of micromechanisms which are capable of imitating the knotting operation and their applications on carpet manufacturing. For this purpose, motion generation synthesis of a planar two degree-of-freedom serial manipulator is performed for a given path by using interpolation approximation. For a given four points, four design parameters are solved as a result of non-linear equations. Also, analysis of each stages of knotting operation is kinematically performed for the design of a cam-actuated mechanism which is designed as an alternative concept. Results of these analysis are used for the design of cam profiles those of which actuates the manipulators. After design stage of knotting micromechanisms, fully automated <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> design is introduced for a real-life experiment of designed mechanisms. Finally, assembly considerations of <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> and knotting mechanisms are given for carpet manufacturing purpose...|$|E
40|$|India {{produces}} a large variety of carpets {{in terms of}} quality, size, and raw material. At present, carpets are woven on wooden looms, which have several drawbacks, like susceptibility to termites, low life (2 - 3 years), loss of environment friendly trees, etc. Moreover, {{it is very difficult}} to provide tension to the warp, as it requires 4 to 5 persons and about 30 - 40 minutes. The tension is given by pulling a rope tied with a metal rod on the upper and lower beams. The present work deals with the design and development of a <b>carpet</b> <b>loom,</b> which can overcome all the above problems faced due to the wooden structure. Metallic channels and beams are used. Field trials indicate that the designed metallic looms in which one person can easily give tension in about 10 min are very much acceptable to the users. Moreover, beam bending is also very small, providing uniform tension that improves the quality of carpets...|$|E

50|$|Now after {{a period}} of 8 years, around 2800 plots have been allotted and the {{population}} is about 18,000 persons. Five doctors provide health services along with permanent health care unit of Family Planning Association of Pakistan. Private buses ply every 30 minutes. There are 110 shops to serve the daily need of the population. More than 247 <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> provide jobs to at least 600 persons. In 8 years residents have collected and spent some 5.0 million rupees in water supply, sewerage and electrification in the Basti. Presently every house has electricity and indoor water supply. Over 2000 houses have already been built. The most important fact is that the allottees have occupied their plots and they live there as they built their houses. Nearly all families started with reed-huts and within a short period all houses have been converted into permanent structures. However, majority of the roofs are still not weather proof.|$|R
5000|$|In 1917, {{the union}} began admitting women and textile workers outside carpet and {{tapestry}} weaving, changing {{its name to}} the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Association. This produced a jump in membership, which reached 4,500 by the end of 1918, and remained fairly constant thereafter, peaking at 6,000 in 1980. The 1980s proved a difficult time for the union as the industry declined in the Kidderminster area, and membership had fallen to 2,300 by 1991. [...] It changed its name slightly to the [...] "Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Union" [...] then, in 2000, it merged into the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.|$|R
50|$|However {{the decline}} of British {{manufacturing}} jobs in these industries led the union to diversify its membership merging with the National League of the Blind and Disabled (NLBD) in 1999 and the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers and Textile Workers Union (PLCWTWU) in 2000.|$|R

The NCTU was formed later than the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Association, based in Kidderminster, and was considerably smaller. Approximately a fifth of eligible workers {{were members of the}} NCTU in 1939, compared to 50 percent for the Kidderminster union. Attempts to amalgamate all unions in the carpet trade failed, but in 1917 the National Affiliation of Carpet Trade Unions was established with equal representation from the NCTU, Scottish Carpet Workers' Union, National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers and Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers and Textile Workers Association.|$|R

50|$|Carpets were woven in town {{manufactures}} by organized manufactories. Usually, town manufactures have {{a larger}} range of patterns and ornaments and more artistically developed designs which can be executed by the weavers, the palette of colours is rich, and the weaving technique may be finer due to their access to high-quality wool, and the employment of specialized weavers. Larger formats can be produced on the larger, stationary <b>looms.</b> <b>Carpets</b> are woven from cartoons, using material provided by the manufacturer. The town manufactories may accept commissions even from foreign countries, and produce carpets for export.|$|R

In the study, hence, it is aimed at {{determining the}} profile of tourists “speaking Spanish” visiting Nevşehir. Some suggestions are listed about what to do for tourists to prefer Nevşehir as a destination and to make them as much satisfied as possible during their trip. In order to present suggestions, “chi-square analysis” is applied to find out whether there is a relationship between various variables and “cluster analysis” is applied to rate tourist attractions that tourists have visited or will visit. The study found out that there are relationships between age and travel type (alone-with family-with friends-others) and between age and planning travel type (package tour via travel agency- package tour with tour operator- independent via travel agent- independent). Cluster analysis, besides, revealed that tourists visit mostly Göreme, Göreme Open Air Museum and <b>carpet</b> weaving <b>looms...</b>|$|R
50|$|Men shear {{sheep in}} spring and autumn, while women collect dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. The weaving is {{undertaken}} during winter by the female members of the extended family, girls learning from their mothers and grandmothers and wives assisting their mothers-in-law. The carpet is made on horizontal or vertical looms using multi-coloured wool, cotton or silk yarn coloured with natural dyes. Applying special techniques to create pile carpets, weavers knot the pile yarn around threads of the warp; pile-less carpets are variously made with interlacing structural warps, wefts, and patterning wefts. The cutting of a finished <b>carpet</b> from the <b>loom</b> is an unusually solemn celebration.|$|R
40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) are {{a common}} problem among carpet weavers. This study was undertaken to introduce affecting personal and occupational factors in developing the number of MSDs among carpet weavers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 862 weavers in seven towns with regard to workhouse location in urban or rural regions. Data were collected by using questionnaires that contain personal, workplace, and information tools and the modified Nordic MSDs questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed by applying Poisson and negative binomial mixed models using a full Bayesian hierarchical approach. The deviance information criterion was used for comparison between models and model selection. Results: The majority of weavers (72 %) were female and carpet weaving was the main job of 85. 2 % of workers. The negative binomial mixed model with lowest deviance information criterion {{was selected as the}} best model. The criteria showed the convergence of chains. Based on 95 % Bayesian credible interval, the main job and weaving type variables statistically affected the number of MSDs, but variables age, sex, weaving comb, work experience, and <b>carpet</b> weaving <b>looms</b> were not significant. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that occupational factors are associated with the number of MSDs developing among carpet weavers. Thus, using standard tools and decreasing hours of work per day can reduce frequency of MSDs among carpet weavers...|$|R
