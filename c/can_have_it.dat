Jerry promises that George <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E

In a February 2014 interview, Shinji Hashimoto said that the audio drama was simply meant to expand on the universe and did not mean a sequel was in development. Prior to this, Nojima stated {{that if there was}} enough demand, there could be developments, and {{that he would like to}} write the story for a second sequel. Nojima later revealed to Famitsu [...] "For the record, there’s a plot from start to finish, and if there’s some way we <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> show up elsewhere… well, so I’ve said to Square Enix.” ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> all but you never stop / 'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others {{are quick to point out}} that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the [...] "Friday" [...] video went viral on YouTube, Black and her mother, Georgina Kelly, got into legal issues with Ark Music over rights to the song. In a March 29, 2011 letter from Kelly's lawyer to Ark Music, it was alleged that Ark Music failed to fulfill the terms of their November 2010 {{agreement}} by not giving her the song and video's master recordings, by claiming Black as exclusively signed to the label, and by exploiting the song without permission – for example, selling a [...] "Friday" [...] ringtone. While Wilson stated that Kelly [...] "will get the masters and the song ... hey <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> all", and agreed that Black was not exclusive to Ark, his attorney claimed that Ark owns the copyright for the song and the November agreement is invalid. In June 2011, Ark Music Factory started charging $2.99 to watch the music video on YouTube. Black's initial response was through a message through her Twitter account saying: [...] "Thanks for all the messages regarding the $2.99 fee added to Friday video, I {{have nothing to do}} with this!!" ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking in 2000 {{about this}} first session, Harrison {{said that the}} music sounded [...] "really nice" [...] in the room, [...] "with all these nice {{acoustics}} and piano, and no echo on anything", but he was shocked during the playback when he heard how Spector had recorded the track. In Leng's words, Spector [...] " [...] his full armory of reverb-flooded production values" [...] on [...] "Wah-Wah". Harrison dismissed the result as [...] "horrible", and recalled that when Clapton said he liked the way it sounded, he replied, [...] "Well, you <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> on your album, then." [...] Although Harrison said [...] "I grew to like it", he subsequently reverted to his original opinion that the song, like much of All Things Must Pass, was overproduced. Overdubs {{on many of the}} album's basic tracks were carried out at either Abbey Road or Trident Studios, without Spector's assistance, and completed by 12 August. After receiving Harrison's initial mixes, Spector wrote back with suggestions for each song; in the case of [...] "Wah-Wah", these included the addition of a saxophone solo by Keys, and backing vocals. As well as overdubbing his slide guitar solos, Harrison sang all the various vocal parts, crediting himself as [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers" [...] on the album sleeve.|$|E

[...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} you <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me because of what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
