40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Web-based system for annotating {{digitised}} old maps. Using bibliographic metadata and geographical reference information associated with the map, annotations are represented as spatially and temporally defined RDF resources. At the same time, named entity recognition and semantic link discovery are applied to each annotation’s text content to further facilitate its interlinking within the Web of Data. To ensure quality and correctness, the system relies on human feedback. This feedback is introduced through a novel interaction metaphor: <b>contextual</b> <b>link</b> suggestions are continuously generated in the background, and superimposed on the annotated map region {{in the form of}} a tag cloud. The user can create semantic links by simply clicking on the corresponding tags. The system thus acts both as a visualisation aid for contextually relevant linked data and as a tool for authoring new linked spatiotemporal data entities...|$|E

Interests and skills of people evolve over time depending in performed activities and joint collaborations.

In this work we address the problem of expertise mining based on performed interactions between people. We argue that an expertise mining algorithm must consider a person’s interest and activity level in a certain collaboration context. Our approach is based on the PageRank algorithm enhanced by techniques to incorporate <b>contextual</b> <b>link</b> information. An approach comprising two steps is presented. First, offline analysis of human interactions considering tagged interaction links and second composition of ranking scores based on preferences.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} examines plagioclase crystallization kinetics in {{a series}} of continuous decompression experiments on H 2 O-saturated rhyodacite magma. Experimental studies provide a <b>contextual</b> <b>link</b> between observations in natural volcanic samples and interpretations of magma ascent processes because they allow examination of the kinetic response of the system to decompression and devolatilization through crystal nucleation, growth, and maturation processes. Comparisons of plagioclase crystallization in samples decompressed at different rates reveals a strong dependence of nucleation and growth rates on decompression rate. However, a shifting balance is maintained between nuclei formation and growth of existing crystals such that a constant (non-equilibrium) total volume of plagioclase is observed in all samples at the same quench pressure, regardless of decompression rate. Comparisons of multi-step and continuous decompression experiments at the same integrated rate reveal that decompression path influences crystal textures. Thus, considerations of ascent style, in addition to rate, are necessary to strengthen the interpretive power of experimental studies for constraining natural magma ascent processes. Crystal nucleation and growth rates derived from 3 D crystal size distribution (CSD) analysis are substantially lower than corresponding values determined using 2 D measurements of bulk crystal populations (batch methods). Although plagioclase growth rates are relatively constant during decompression at a given rate, the average growth rate in a rapidly decompressed sample is approximately five times faster than the growth rate in a more slowly decompressed sample...|$|E
40|$|Appeal to {{the causal}} history of items has been, for the {{etiological}} theory of function, {{an argument for}} realism, against a dispositionnal or causal-role account of functions that makes them relative to an explanatory strategy. The reference to selection and, in the end, to fitness - each functional item being characterized by its enhancing-fitness capacity - gave the etiological theory of function its realistic tone : functions are not relative to the scientist's explanatory strategy, or choice of explanans. But using fitness in determining function can only discriminate between functional effects and side-effects, like the classical difference between heart circulating blood and heart's noise. It needs more than considerations about fitness to decide which of these effects is the real function of the item. Sometimes various effects may be ordered {{in a series of}} more and more general effects, one entailing the other (for example : escaping tiger / escaping predator / flight); sometimes, they are necessary related to another (eat food/ chew the meat); sometimes, they have only a contingent and <b>contextual</b> <b>link</b> (hiding from predators / retain heat). Considering those three cases, this paper will examine several methods of functional attribution, that go further than the purely etiological criterium, and through which identification of functions can satisfy the realistic requirement. Those methods are the comparative method, between different populations in different contexts, or between different species; and the reverse engineering strategy, which search a mechanical integration into systems and subsystems of functional effects in an artificially reconstructed context. I will finally wonder if the initial realistic commitment of the etiological theory has to be weakened in order to account for such an epistemological situation...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} 300 {{repositories}} of research material (Source: IAR), {{most of which}} have an OAI-PMH interface, but no current Institutional Repositories export reference data - nor do they provide their users with citation impact metrics. We propose a model for extending IR's to be citation aware and to expose that data to citation indices using the OAI-PMH and OpenURL. We present some techniques for the export of citation data using the OAI-PMH in Citebase Search. As part of a proposed Open Access Citation Information study we have developed a proposal for the integration of reference parsing and linking into the author- deposit process. This highly-distributed approach to citation linking utilises the OAI-PMH to transfer structured citation data between IRs and citation indexing services. OpenURL - a standard for <b>contextual</b> <b>linking</b> using bibliographic data - is now a NISO standard. As well as it's linking role, OpenURL is a useful standard for the transfer of bibliographic data {{for the purposes of}} citation indexing. The developing DCMI guidelines for encoding citation metadata makes use of OpenURL context objects in XML. A more lightweight approach is implemented by Citebase Search for transferring bibliographic data using OpenURLs by encoding the metadata as URIs (OpenURL 'KEV' format) and including these in repeated simple Dublin Core relation elements. The widespread adoption of OpenURL for <b>contextual</b> <b>linking</b> and the transfer of citation links will lower the barriers to citation indices as well as enabling novel new interactions between services (e. g. through the embedding of citation analysis services into IRs).

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a portfolio of musical compositions and a written commentary. The submitted works creatively challenge {{the form of a}} conventional concert by exploring methods of bringing to the fore the theatrical side of musical performance: its inherited or implemented conceptual and visual aspects. The portfolio is divided into three main categories. The first comprises a series of pieces that balance between music theatre and conventional concert practices. The second category includes works that reform many aspects of the traditional concert presentation, without breaking away from it. The third category includes works that experiment within the territory determined by the previous categories. The written commentary presents theoretically the compositional approach used throughout the portfolio and provides a brief philosophical background, such as is necessary to explain the underlying concepts, ideas, preoccupations and concerns. It also contains a comprehensive analysis of the submitted works, their aims, <b>contextual</b> <b>links,</b> applied methodologies, associations with other composers’ works and interconnections between them.
