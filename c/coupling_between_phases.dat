40|$|Abstract:- To {{evaluate}} the Switched Reluctance (SR) motor design and performance properly, an accurate magnetic model is required. However the SR motor has significant mutual inductances between adjacent phases, which are normally ignored in present design. In this paper the mutual <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> especially of an off phase has been {{obtained from a}} 4 -phase 8 / 6 SR motor. The <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> of the 4 -phase SR motor is examined by exciting only two phases from the power converter and observing the voltages on the terminals of the remaining two phases which are open circuited. The approach to the problem is initially experimental aimed at recording the mutually induced voltage waveform {{for a variety of}} torques and speeds. This is followed by a more theoretical consideration of mutual effects, to find a theoretical basis for the observed voltages. Key-Words:- Switched reluctance motor, mutual inductance...|$|E

The theory of Henry, et al., assumes no mechanical <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> the <b>phases,</b> a condition which was simulated in their somewhat artificial "slug flow " experiments performed to confirm their theory. The theory of Martin and Padmanabhan takes ac-count of this mechanical <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> the <b>phases,</b> which in reality is almost complete, as is the case for bubble flow.

40|$|In many cases, {{the normal}} {{operation}} of switched reluctance machines requires excitation {{of two or}} more phases simultaneously. When multiple phases are conducting simultaneously, the flux paths from each phase will overlap, which may lead to localized saturation. In such cases, the flux linkage must be considered a function not just of the current in the test winding but of all excited windings. The degree of mutual <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> influences the per-phase magnetization curves and torque characteristics. In machines with even phase numbers, the degree of mutual <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> varies due to discontinuities in the phase polarity arrangement. From nonlinear finite element simulations, it is possible to compare the i-ψ loop diagrams under single-phase and multiphase excitations, and hence the torque produced. The mutual flux linkage from each phase can be calculated separately for each rotor position using the frozen permeability method, to further analyze the mutual coupling effects.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between structural and functional connectivity in neural systems forms {{the challenge in}} understanding general brain functioning. To pinpoint a mapping between structure and function, we investigated the effects of (in) homogeneity in coupling structure and delays on synchronization behavior in networks of oscillatory neural masses by deriving the phase dynamics of these generic networks. For homogeneous delays, the structural coupling matrix is largely preserved in the <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases,</b> resulting in clustered stationary phase distributions. Accordingly, we found {{only a small number}} of synchronized groups in the network. Distributed delays, by contrast, introduce inhomogeneity in the phase coupling so that clustered stationary phase distributions no longer exist. The effect of distributed delays mimicked that of structural inhomogeneity. Hence, we argue that phase (de-) synchronization patterns caused by inhomogeneous coupling cannot be distinguished from those caused by distributed delays, at least not by the naked eye. The here-derived analytical expression for the effective <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> as a function of structural coupling constitutes a direct relationship between structural and functional connectivity. Structural connectivity constrains synchronizability that may be modified by the delay distribution. This explains why structural and functional connectivity bear much resemblance albeit not a one-to-one correspondence.

40|$|We {{present a}} new variational {{approach}} {{to the study of}} phase transitions in frustrated 2 D XY models. In the spirit of Villain’s approach for the ferromagnetic case we divide thermal excitations into a low temperature long wavelength part (LW) and a high temperature short wavelength part (SW). In the present work we mainly deal with LW excitations and we explicitly consider the cases of the fully frustrated Laboratoire associé au CNRS 1 triangular (FFTXY) and square (FFSQXY) XY models. The novel aspect of our method is that it preserves the <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phase</b> (spin angles) and chiral degrees of freedom. LW fluctuations consist of coupled phase and chiral excitations. As a result, we find that for frustrated systems the effective interactions <b>between</b> <b>phase</b> variables is long range and oscillatory in contrast to the unfrustrated problem. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations we show that our analytical calculations produce accurate results at all temperature T; this is seen at low T in the spin wave stiffness constant and in the staggered chirality; this is also the case near Tc: transitions are driven by the SW part associated with domain walls and vortices, but the <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phase</b> and chiral variables is still relevant in the critical region. In that regime our analytical results yield the correct T dependence for bare couplings (given by the LW fluctuations) such as the Coulomb gas temperature TCG of the frustrated XY models. In particular we find that TCG tracks chiral rather than phase fluctuations. Our results provides support for a single phase transition scenario in the FFTXY and FFSQXY models.

This kind of SRMs has both {{the merits of}} conventional SRMs and Fully Pitched SRMs, i. e. shorter end-windings and higher torque density. A comparison based on Finite Element Method (FEM) between conventional and mutually coupled SRMs, in terms of self flux-linkage and inductance per phase, mutual flux-linkage and inductance be-tween phases, and output torque is realized. The conventional SRM is excited in unipolar mode, while the MCSRM is excited in bipolar overlapping mode. With a high <b>coupling</b> <b>between</b> <b>phases</b> for MCSRM, mutual inductances are employed to produce torque. Furthermore, the flux pathways are separated and distributed between phases, {{this leads to a}} less sensitivity to magnetic saturation. At high current density and high con-duction angle, the MCSRM has a higher output torque and a lower torque ripple.

Exchange coupling is therefore of crucial importance in composite systems made of magnetically hard and soft grains or in partially crystallized media including nanosized crystallites in a soft matrix. It has been shown also to be a key point in the control of stratified hard / soft media coercive field in the research for optimized recording media. A signature of the exchange coupling due to the nanostructure is generally obtained on the magnetization curve $M(H) $ with a plateau characteristic of the domain wall compression at the hard/soft interface ending at the depinning of the wall inside the hard phase. This compression / depinning behavior is clearly evidenced through one dimensional description of the interface, which is rigorously possible only in stratified media.
