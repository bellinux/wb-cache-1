40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} hull forms {{with respect to}} their hydrodynamic performance in calm and rough water is presented. The method is based on an initial optimization of a parent hull form for seakeeping and the improvement of the resulting optimum hull form for calm water resistance. In {{the first part of the}} method, variant hull forms differing from a parent in the main dimensions and/or in one or more hull form parameters, such as C-WP, LCF, C-B, LCB, KB, C-P, are automatically generated and their seakeeping qualities evaluated. When appropriate ranges for the principal characteristics and parameters of the hull form under investigation are prescribed, a formal optimization procedure is used to obtain the variant with the best seakeeping behavior. The weighted sum of the resonant values of selected ship responses for a number of ship speeds and headings in regular waves forms the objective function. The Hooke and Jeeves algorithm is used to accomplish the optimization. The procedure results in a set of trends regarding the proposed variations of the selected hull form parameters, within the specified constraints. These trends are then applied on the parent hull to derive an optimized hull form with fair lines. Subsequently, this hull form can be locally modified to improve its calm water resistance or, as it should be done, its propulsion characteristics. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two cases: a <b>conventional</b> <b>reefer</b> <b>ship</b> and a naval destroyer. Scaled models of the parent and the optimized hull forms have been tested for calm water resistance and seakeeping. In both cases the validity of the methodology is demonstrated...|$|R

25|$|The new {{refrigerating}} technology {{first met}} with widespread industrial {{use as a}} means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in <b>reefer</b> <b>ships</b> from the British Dominions and other countries to the British Isles. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to New Zealand. William Soltau Davidson thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world wool markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the Dunedin to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the Dunedin sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of trim on the fuel consumption of <b>reefer</b> <b>ships</b> have been investigated. The project {{have been carried}} out at NYKCool AB, a <b>ship</b> operator of <b>reefer</b> vessels.   In the speed range 17 - 19 knots and deadweight percentage of approximately 70 % the smallest calculated resistance is obtained for bow trims which are between - 1 m and - 2 m depending on the speed.    Stored voyage data from the <b>reefer</b> <b>ships</b> shows {{that the majority of the}} voyages are made with positive trims. The data also shows that the mean fuel consumption in ton per hour is smallest for the even keel condition in comparison with aft (positive) trims. The conclusions have been made for deadweight conditions of 70 - 80 % DWT. Savings of bunker are in the order of magnitude of 3 - 4 % and have been seen from the data analysis.    The average fuel consumption in traffic is approximately 37 tons of heavy fuel oil per day. Due to factors such as different docking schedules the ships have different performance. The tests shows a correlation between the fuel consumption and optimal trims. Bow trims are always more favorable from a saving perspective.    The largest bow trim that was possible and which ensured proper propeller immersion was approximately - 1 m and was achieved by planning the stowage together with burning bunker from the fuel tanks in the right order.    The stability is affected due to less buoyancy in the bow area compared to the mid ship sections, but always above the minimum criteria of GM 0 <o 0. 15 m with enough margins. GM 0 remains in the interval of 2 - 3 m depending on the deadweight percentage and trim condition.    Economical savings will be seen over longer periods of time by operating the reefer vessels with the optimal trims. ...|$|R

50|$|The Type R ship is a United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) {{designation}} for World War II {{refrigerated cargo}} ship, also called a <b>reefer</b> <b>ship.</b> The R type ship {{was used in}} World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War and the Cold War. Type R ships were used to transport perishable commodities which require temperature-controlled transportation, such as fruit, meat, fish, vegetables, dairy products and other foods. The US Maritime Commission ordered 41 new refrigerated ships for the US Navy. Because {{of the difficulty of}} building refrigerated ships only two were delivered in 1944, and just 26 were delivered in 1945 and the remainder in 1946-48. The 41 R type ships were built in four groups. Two of design types were modified type C1 ships and two were modified type C2 ships. The United Fruit Company operated many of the R type ships in World War 2. The type R2-S-BV1 became the US Navy Alstede-class stores ship and the type R1-M-AV3 became the US Navy Adria-class stores ship.|$|R
