50|$|The <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> (Zyzomys pedunculatus) is a {{critically}} endangered rodent that was presumed extinct {{until it was}} rediscovered in the MacDonnell Ranges Northern Territory in 1996. The last of the zoo's central rock rats were sent to Alice Springs Desert Park in 2007 and the breeding program closed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> Zyzomys pedunculatus {{is one of}} five rock-rat species {{native to}} Australia. It is a nocturnal species that {{specifically}} forages for food in the nighttime. They can range from 10.6 to 14.9 cm long for the head and body, and around 30 cm from head to tail. They weigh between 50 and 120 g. Their fur is a light mustard above with a pale underbelly [...] The lightly furred tail is the most noticeable feature of the <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat.</b> The tail base is thick and bulky. The thickness of the tail has been reported to be a fat storage adaptation. This is an effect of scarce food distribution. Rock-rats are known to lose their tails, fur and skin very easily and are, therefore, known to be difficult to handle. As for their birthrate, captive animals have bred and have had litters of various sizes, such as 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 and 4 young.|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{degradation}} is {{an obstacle}} to Central rock rat conservation. Fires limit the available habitat, {{and the spread of}} Buffalo grass kills off native grasses that Z. pedunculatus feeds on and helps contribute to the spread of fire. They face predators such as dingos, and grazing from feral herbivores hurts their food supply. Despite all this, the species is believed to be making strides, which is supported by the sightings near the Haasts Bluff Aboriginal land trust west of Alice Springs, in Australia. The rat's predators can also give insight on how the species is recovering. The excrement of feral cats near the location site often includes the fur and bone skeletons of the Z. pedunculatus. Until the 1996 capture, the <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> had not been seen since 1960. Between 1970 and 1995, there were no recorded sightings of the species and it was declared that this species was indeed extinct. It wasn't until it was rediscovered in 1996 in the MacDonnell Ranges that this was proven false. On September 3, 1996, the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers trapped an animal which was later identified from photographs as the <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat.</b> Since that time sub-populations have been found at 15 other sites over a small area of the West MacDonnell Ranges. The full range of the current distribution of the species is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The central rock rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus), {{also known}} as the <b>central</b> thick-tailed <b>rock-rat,</b> Macdonnell Range rock-rat, Australian native mouse, rat à grosse queue (French), or rata coligorda (Spanish), is a species of rodent in the family Muridae that is found only in Australia. The rats have been found in rocky {{outcrops}} and on mountainsides with loose stones, as well as hilly grasslands and low open shrubland or woodland. Historically, Z. pedunculatus is only known to be found in a 77 km length of the West MacDonnell Ranges, Northern Territory. The species has previously been recorded from living animals or cave deposits in Northern Territory at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Illamurta (James Range), Haast's Bluff (West MacDonnell Ranges), Mount Liebig, Napperby Station, Devils Marbles, The Granites (Tanami Desert), and the Davenport Range. It is known from cave deposits in the Cape Range, Western Australia.|$|R
40|$|Haematological and serum {{biochemical}} {{data have}} been collected from a total of 19 captive-bred Australian native murids (Plains rat, Spinifex hopping-mouse and <b>Central</b> <b>rock-rat).</b> These animals were maintained in a captive population at Alice Springs Desert Park (NT, Australia) and are all central desert inhabitants of Australia. They are currently listed as common, threatened and critically endangered, respectively. Given the status and size of these animals, only small sample numbers and volumes were analysed. The study, however, provides some basic haematology and serum biochemistry information for these three species and will serve as an effective management tool for assessing and monitoring the health status of individuals, particularly those in captivity. 8 page(s...|$|E
30|$|The {{morphological}} appearance of leukocytes {{in the two}} species {{was similar to that}} described previously for other murids including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) (Thrall et al. 2012), plains rat (Pseudomys australis), spinifex hopping-mice (Notomys alexis) (Old et al. 2005) and the <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> (Zyzomys pedunculatus) (Old et al. 2005). Neutrophils of both species in this study were larger in diameter when compared to the house mouse (Mus musculus) and brown rat (Thrall et al. 2012). Lymphocyte size greatly fluctuates from the size of erythrocytes to neutrophils (Thrall et al. 2012). Both species’ lymphocytes did not exceed the size of neutrophils. Monocyte size and morphology were similar to that previously described for other murid species (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} of sampling rare fauna limit efforts {{to understand and}} mitigate the factors that restrict their distribution. Camera traps have become a standard technique for sampling large mammals, but their utility for sampling small, rare species remains largely unknown. The <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> (Zyzomys pedunculatus) is critically endangered and restricted to rugged range country in central Australia. Using Z. pedunculatus as a focal species, we sought {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of camera trapping for sampling small mammals in this environment and to better understand the factors driving the occurrence of this species. We installed baited camera traps at 50 sites across 1795 ha of core refuge habitat for Z. pedunculatus. We recorded all six species of small mammals known previously from this area, including the highly detectable Z. pedunculatus at five sites. Occupancy modelling showed that distance to the nearest occupied site was the most important predictor of Z. pedunculatus occurrence, suggesting that this rodent occurs in discrete sub-populations within the matrix of refuge habitat. Fire history and ruggedness may also influence occupancy of Z. pedunculatus at the landscape-scale and could assist in locating additional sub-populations. At the site-scale, occupancy of Z. pedunculatus was high and there was no clear influence of any site-scale variables. Management of Z. pedunculatus will require protection and expansion of known sub-populations. We conclude that camera trapping provided useful and cost-effective insight into the factors limiting rock-rat distribution, and predict that it will become a standard tool for sampling rare small mammals in difficult-to-access environments...|$|E
40|$|Irruptive {{population}} dynamics {{are characteristic of}} a wide range of fauna in the world’s arid (dryland) regions. Recent evidence indicates that regional persistence of irruptive species, particularly small mammals, during the extensive dry periods of unpredictable length that occur between resource pulses in drylands occurs as a result of the presence of refuge habitats or refuge patches into which populations contract during dry (bust) periods. These small dry-period populations act as a source of animals when recolonisation of the surrounding habitat occurs during and after subsequent resource pulses (booms). The refuges used by irruptive dryland fauna differ in temporal and spatial scale from the refugia to which species contract in response to changing climate. Refuges of dryland fauna operate over timescales of months and years, whereas refugia operate on timescales of millennia over which evolutionary divergence may occur. Protection and management of refuge patches and refuge habitats should be a priority for the conservation of dryland-dwelling fauna. This urgency is driven by recognition that disturbance to refuges can lead to the extinction of local populations and, if disturbance is widespread, entire species. Despite the apparent significance of dryland refuges for conservation management, these sites remain poorly understood ecologically. Here, we synthesise available information on the refuges of dryland-dwelling fauna, using Australian mammals as a case study to provide focus, and document a research agenda for increasing this knowledge base. We develop a typology of refuges that recognises two main types of refuge: fixed and shifting. We outline a suite of models of fixed refuges on the basis of stability in occupancy between and within successive bust phases of population cycles. To illustrate the breadth of refuge types we provide case studies of refuge use in three species of dryland mammal: plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), <b>central</b> <b>rock-rat</b> (Zyzomys pedunculatus), and spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis). We suggest that future research should focus on understanding the species-specific nature of refuge use and the spatial ecology of refuges with a focus on connectivity and potential meta{{population dynamics}}. Assessing refuge quality and understanding the threats to high-quality refuge patches and habitat should also be a priority. To facilitate this understanding we develop a three-step methodology for determining species-specific refuge location and habitat attributes. This review is necessarily focussed on dryland mammals in continental Australia where most refuge-based research has been undertaken. The applicability of the refuge concept and the importance of refuges for dryland fauna conservation elsewhere in the world should be investigated. We predict that refuge-using mammals will be widespread particularly among dryland areas with unpredictable rainfall patterns. Chris R. Pavey, Jane Addison, Rob Brandle, Chris R. Dickman, Peter J.
