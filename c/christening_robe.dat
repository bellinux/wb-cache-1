60|$|Having {{delivered}} his message as instructed, Johnny consented {{to sit down}} until the famous <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> and the tray were ready, {{but he would not}} talk, for that was not in the bond. Jess's sweet face beamed over the compliment Mrs. Tully, known on ordinary occasions as Jean McTaggart, had paid her, and, after Johnny had departed laden, she told me how the tray, which had a great bump in the middle, came into her possession.|$|E
60|$|They {{knew now}} that she was dying. She told them to fold up the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> and almost sharply she watched them put it away, and then for some time she talked of the long lovely life that had been hers, and of Him to whom she owed it. She said good-bye to them all, and at last turned her face to the side where her best-beloved had lain, and for over an hour she prayed. They only caught the words now and again, and the last they heard were ‘God’ and ‘love.’ I think God was smiling when He took her to Him, as He had so often smiled at her during those seventy-six years.|$|E
60|$|Every {{one of the}} hundred, I believe, is dead, {{and even}} I cannot now pick out Jess and Hendry's grave; but I heard {{recently}} that the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> is still in use. It is strange that I should still be left after so many changes, {{one of the three}} or four who can to-day stand on the brae and point out Jess's window. The little window commands the incline {{to the point where the}} brae suddenly jerks out of sight in its climb down into the town. The steep path up the commonty makes for this elbow of the brae, and thus, whichever way the traveller takes, it is here that he comes first into sight of the window. Here, too, those who go to the town from the south get their first glimpse of Thrums.|$|E

2500|$|Swedish men who {{travelled}} to Denmark, England, or Saxony and the Byzantine Empire {{played an}} important part in the introduction of Christianity in Sweden, and two runestones tell of men baptized in Denmark, such as the runestone in Amnö, which says [...] "He died in <b>christening</b> <b>robes</b> in Denmark." [...] A similar message is given on another runestone in Vallentuna near Stockholm that tells that two sons waited until they were on their death beds before they converted: [...] "They died in (their) christening robes." [...] <b>Christening</b> <b>robes</b> or baptismal clothes, hvitavaðir, were given to pagan Scandinavians when they were baptized, and in Uppland there are at least seven stones that tell of convertees having died in such robes.|$|R
50|$|The lace, worn by {{the wealthiest}} women across Europe was made {{by some of the}} poorest women in Ireland. Lace was a luxury commodity, used to {{decorate}} elaborate wedding dresses, <b>christening</b> <b>robes,</b> and church vestments, but it also played a vital part in saving many families from starvation and destitution. Irish lace reflects the social and political changes that took place between 1700 and the present.|$|R
60|$|She {{was always}} {{delicate}} from that hour, {{and for many}} months she was very ill. I have heard that {{the first thing she}} expressed a wish to see was the <b>christening</b> <b>robe,</b> and she looked long at it and then turned her face to the wall. That was what made me as a boy think of it always as the robe in which he was christened, but I knew later that we had all been christened in it, from the oldest of the family to the youngest, between whom stood twenty years. Hundreds of other children were christened in it also, such robes being then a rare possession, and the lending of ours among my mother’s glories. It was carried carefully from house to house, as if it were itself a child; my mother made much of it, smoothed it out, petted it, smiled to it before putting it into the arms of those to whom it was being lent; she was in our pew to see it borne magnificently (something inside it now) down the aisle to the pulpit-side, when a stir of expectancy went through the church and we kicked each other’s feet beneath the book-board but were reverent in the face; and however the child might behave, laughing brazenly or skirling to its mother’s shame, and whatever the father as he held it up might do, look doited probably and bow at the wrong time, the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> of long experience helped them through. And when it was brought back to her she took it in her arms as softly as if it might be asleep, and unconsciously pressed it to her breast: there was never anything in the house that spoke to her quite so eloquently as that little white robe; it was the one of her children that always remained a baby. And she had not made it herself, which was the most wonderful thing about it to me, for she seemed to have made all other things. All the clothes in the house were of her making, and you don’t know her in the least if you think they were out of the fashion; she turned them and made them new again, she beat them and made them new again, and then she coaxed them into being new again just for the last time, she let them out and took them in and put on new braid, and added a piece up the back, and thus they passed from one member of the family to another until they reached the youngest, and even when we were done with them they reappeared as something else. In the fashion! I must come back to this. Never was a woman with such an eye for it. She had no fashion-plates; she did not need them. The minister’s wife (a cloak), the banker’s daughters (the new sleeve)—they had but to pass our window once, and the scalp, so to speak, was in my mother’s hands. Observe her rushing, scissors in hand, thread in mouth, to the drawers where her daughters’ Sabbath clothes were kept. Or go to church next Sunday, and watch a certain family filing in, the boy lifting his legs high to show off his new boots, but all the others demure, especially the timid, unobservant-looking little woman in the rear of them. If you were the minister’s wife that day or the banker’s daughters you would have got a shock. But she bought the <b>christening</b> <b>robe,</b> and when I used to ask why, she would beam and look conscious, and say she wanted to be extravagant once. And she told me, still smiling, that the more a woman was given to stitching and making things for herself, the greater was her passionate desire now and again to rush to the shops and ‘be foolish.’ The <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> with its pathetic frills is over half a century old now, and has begun to droop a little, like a daisy whose time is past; but it is as fondly kept together as ever: I saw it in use again only the other day.|$|E
60|$|To {{those who}} dwell in great cities Thrums {{is only a}} small place, but what a clatter of life it has for me when I come to it from my school-house in the glen. Had my lot been cast in a town I would no doubt have sought country parts during my September holiday, but the school-house is quiet even when the summer takes brakes full of sportsmen and others past the top of my footpath, and I was always light-hearted when Craigiebuckle's cart bore me into the din of Thrums. I only once stayed during the whole of my holiday at the house on the brae, but I knew its inmates for many years, {{including}} Jamie, the son, who was a barber in London. Of their ancestry I never heard. With us it was only some of the articles of furniture, or perhaps a snuff-mull, that had a genealogical tree. In the house on the brae was a great kettle, called the boiler, that was said to be fifty years old in the days of Hendry's grandfather, of whom nothing more is known. Jess's chair, which had carved arms and a seat stuffed with rags, had been Snecky Hobart's father's before it was hers, and old Snecky bought it at a roup in the Tenements. Jess's rarest possession was, perhaps, the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> that even people at a distance came to borrow. Her mother could count up a hundred persons who had been baptized in it.|$|E
60|$|My mother lay in {{bed with}} the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> beside her, and I peeped in many times at the door and then went to the stair and sat on it and sobbed. I know not if it was that first day, or many days afterwards, that there came to me, my sister, the {{daughter}} my mother loved the best; yes, more I am sure even than she loved me, whose great glory she has been since I was six years old. This sister, who was then passing out of her ‘teens, came to me with a very anxious face and wringing her hands, and she told me to go ben to my mother and say to her that she still had another boy. I went ben excitedly, but the room was dark, and when I heard the door shut and no sound come from the bed I was afraid, and I stood still. I suppose I was breathing hard, or perhaps I was crying, for after a time I heard a listless voice that had never been listless before say, ‘Is that you?’ I think the tone hurt me, for I made no answer, and then the voice said more anxiously ‘Is that you?’ again. I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to, and I said in a little lonely voice, ‘No, it’s no him, it’s just me.’ Then I heard a cry, and my mother turned in bed, and though it was dark I knew that she was holding out her arms.|$|E
50|$|The costume {{collection}} comprises some 4000 {{items and}} {{is thought to}} be the largest collection {{of its kind in the}} county. It includes men’s, women’s and children’s clothes and accessories, household furnishings and needlework samplers. A large proportion of the items date to the Victorian period, but the collection includes items from the 18th century to the present day. Among the wide range of garments are <b>christening</b> <b>robes,</b> wedding dresses and mourning clothes, evening gowns, wartime utility clothing, uniforms and modern high street clothing.|$|R
60|$|Carts pass up {{and down}} the brae every few minutes, and there comes an {{occasional}} gig. Seldom is the brae empty, for many live beyond the top of it now, and men and women go by to their work, children to school or play. Not one of the children I see from the window to-day is known to me, and most {{of the men and women}} I only recognize by their likeness to their parents. That sweet-faced old woman with the shawl on her shoulders may be one of the girls who was playing at the game of palaulays when Jamie stole into Thrums for the last time; the man who is leaning on the commonty gate gathering breath for the last quarter of the brae may, as a barefooted callant, have been one of those who chased Cree Queery past the poor-house. I cannot say; but this I know, that the grandparents of most of these boys and girls were once young with me. If I see the sons and daughters of my friends grown old, I also see the grandchildren spinning the peerie and hunkering at I-dree-I-dree--I-droppit-it--as we did so long ago. The world remains as young as ever. The lovers that met on the commonty in the gloaming are gone, but there are other lovers to take their place, and still the commonty is here. The sun had sunk on a fine day in June, early in the century, when Hendry and Jess, newly married, he in a rich moleskin waistcoat, she in a white net cap, walked to the house on the brae that was to be their home. So Jess has told me. Here again has been just such a day, and somewhere in Thrums there may be just such a couple, setting out for their home behind a horse with white ears instead of walking, but with the same hopes and fears, and the same love light in their eyes. The world does not age. The hearse passes over the brae and up the straight burying-ground road, but still there is a cry for the <b>christening</b> <b>robe.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{were buried}} {{together}} on my mother’s seventy-sixth birthday, though {{there had been}} three days between their deaths. On the last day, my mother insisted on rising from bed and going through the house. The arms that had so often helped her on that journey were now cold in death, but there were others only less loving, and she went slowly {{from room to room}} like one bidding good-bye, and in mine she said, ‘The beautiful rows upon rows of books, ant he said every one of them was mine, all mine!’ and in the east room, which was her greatest triumph, she said caressingly, ‘My nain bonny room!’ All this time there seemed to be something that she wanted, but the one was dead who always knew what she wanted, and they produced many things at which she shook her head. They did not know then that she was dying, but they followed her through the house in some apprehension, and after she returned to bed they saw that she was becoming very weak. Once she said eagerly, ‘Is that you, David?’ and again she thought she heard her father knocking the snow off his boots. Her desire for that which she could not name came back to her, and at last they saw that what she wanted was the old <b>christening</b> <b>robe.</b> It was brought to her, and she unfolded it with trembling, exultant hands, and when she had made sure that it was still of virgin fairness her old arms went round it adoringly, and upon her face there was the ineffable mysterious glow of motherhood. Suddenly she said, ‘Wha’s bairn’s dead? is a bairn of mine dead?’ but those watching dared not speak, and then slowly as if with an effort of memory she repeated our names aloud in the order in which we were born. Only one, who should have come third among the ten, did she omit, the one in the next room, but at the end, after a pause, she said her name and repeated it again and again and again, lingering over {{it as if it were}} the most exquisite music and this her dying song. And yet it was a very commonplace name.|$|E
60|$|She lived twenty-nine {{years after}} his death, such active years until toward the end, that you never knew where she was unless you took hold of her, and though she was frail {{henceforth}} and ever growing frailer, her housekeeping again became famous, so that brides called {{as a matter of}} course to watch her ca’ming and sanding and stitching: there are old people still, one or two, to tell with wonder in their eyes how she could bake twenty-four bannocks in the hour, and not a chip in one of them. And how many she gave away, how much she gave away of all she had, and what pretty ways she had of giving it! Her face beamed and rippled with mirth as before, and her laugh that I had tried so hard to force came running home again. I have heard no such laugh as hers save from merry children; the laughter of most of us ages, and wears out with the body, but hers remained gleeful to the last, as if it were born afresh every morning. There was always something of the child in her, and her laugh was its voice, as eloquent of the past to me as was the <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> to her. But I had not made her forget the bit of her that was dead; in those nine-and-twenty years he was not removed one day farther from her. Many a time she fell asleep speaking to him, and even while she slept her lips moved and she smiled as if he had come back to her, and when she woke he might vanish so suddenly that she started up bewildered and looked about her, and then said slowly, ‘My David’s dead!’ or perhaps he remained long enough to whisper why he must leave her now, and then she lay silent with filmy eyes. When I became a man and he was still a boy of thirteen, I wrote a little paper called ‘Dead this Twenty Years,’ which was about a similar tragedy in another woman’s life, and it is the only thing I have written that she never spoke about, not even to that daughter she loved the best. No one ever spoke of it to her, or asked her if she had read it: one does not ask a mother if she knows that there is a little coffin in the house. She read many times the book in which it is printed, but when she came to that chapter she would put her hands to her heart or even over her ears.|$|E

5000|$|... "The least {{importance}} {{attaches to}} these external things, namely breathing under the eyes, signing with the cross, placing {{salt in the}} mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing {{the top of the}} head with chrism, vesting in the <b>christening</b> <b>robe,</b> and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism.

50|$|At first sight, the {{two women}} and their two babies appear almost identical, each mother wearing white clothes {{decorated}} with elaborate lace and jewellery, and each baby swaddled in a scarlet <b>christening</b> <b>robe.</b> On closer inspection, {{the details of the}} clothing of each pair and their eye colours differ. The women may be sisters, and they are often thought to be twins due to their close physical resemblance, but the different eye colours - one blue, one brown - mean that are not identical.|$|E
50|$|The first progression, {{for both}} boys and girls, was when they were shortcoated or {{taken out of the}} long dresses that came well below the feet that were worn by babies—and which have survived as the modern <b>Christening</b> <b>robe.</b> It was not {{possible}} to walk in these, which no doubt dictated the timing of the change. Toddlers' gowns often featured leading strings, which were narrow straps of fabric or ribbon attached at the shoulder and held by an adult while the child was learning to walk.|$|E
50|$|Limerick {{also had}} a few famous {{visitors}} during this time. In 1963 Irish-American US President John F. Kennedy visited Limerick {{as part of his}} tour of Ireland. He was presented with a locally produced <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> made of Limerick Lace. From 1956, about 500 Hungarian refugees were housed in Knockalisheen, near Meelick a few kilometres from the city, following the failed uprising in their country. A few settled, but the majority moved on within a few years to new lives in the UK and North America due to the bad economic situation in Limerick.|$|E
50|$|In March 1511, Hunne {{refused to}} pay the {{standard}} mortuary fee, the baby's <b>christening</b> <b>robe,</b> to the rector of St Mary Matfelon in Whitechapel, Thomas Dryffeld, after the funeral of his dead five-week-old son called Stephen. The matter was not pursued by the Church until Hunne and a friend challenged the rector of St Michael Cornhill over the title to a tenement in November 1511. Hunne was then sued by the rector of St Mary Matfelon for the mortuary fee and appeared in the ecclesiastical Court of Audience, presided over by Cuthbert Tunstall, chancellor to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in April 1512. The court found in favour of the rector.|$|E
5000|$|That {{afternoon}} and evening, TUI Cruises held a ceremony at Kiel's [...] cruise terminal, {{to celebrate the}} ship's entry into service. Around 1,000 guests were present inside Mein Schiff 4s theatre; an estimated 25,000 spectators watched the event from outside. At 9 pm, following performances {{by a number of}} singers, the ship's sponsor, Franziska van Almsick, was raised above the foreship, wearing a 15 m-long <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> weighing 300 kg and with a diameter of 20 m. Van Almsick then christened Mein Schiff 4, by smashing a bottle of Pommery champagne against the ship’s side. The ceremony later concluded with a late-night fireworks display, accompanied by an electro and house set from DJ Tanja La Croix.|$|E
5000|$|She {{was born}} at sea {{off the coast of}} Java, [...] "her <b>christening</b> <b>robe</b> was the Union Jack" [...] and the birth was {{registered}} on Thursday Island. Her Scottish parents were migrating to Australia and they had wanted the baby born in North Queensland, where her father was hired to be the inspector of schools. She was raised in the Croydon, Queensland gold fields. She made her theatrical debut in Hans, the Boatman. She came to the United States in 1910. She was with the National Broadcasting Company since 1925 and for seven years had her own radio program. She sang on all of NBC's light opera and Gilbert and Sullivan shows. She was the original Mrs. Hudson in NBC's Sherlock Holmes series, and the Madam Louise in The Goldbergs radio show. She had a Broadway career from 1932 to 1946. In 1942 she was living on Staten Island. She had a son, Harry E. Walker (1920-1998), who was a chemical engineer with the Shell Oil in Wood River, Illinois. She died in 1947.|$|E
