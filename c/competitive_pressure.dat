In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired {{by the success of}} Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E

We specifically examine the behavior of altruistic non-profit hospitals in the supply of charity care. The effects of <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> and past charity care provision on the supply of philanthropic donations to nonprofit hospitals are also examined. Empirical models of the supply of donations and charity care are specified and estimated using data on nonprofit hospitals in Florida for the years 1980 - 1984. The coefficient estimates imply strong income effects in the charity care supply equations. This raises the possibility that <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> and limits on hospital payments, under public insurance programs, may reduce the supply of indigent care. The results from the supply of donations models suggest that philanthropic donations will alleviate the <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> to a small degree. ...|$|R

25|$|The bearing {{of these}} ideas on current {{thinking}} on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong <b>competitive</b> <b>pressure</b> not to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might {{prove to be a}} fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.|$|E

40|$|As {{consumers}} simultaneously {{consider a}} broader range of festivals in a crowded market, festivals often face higher <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures.</b> Configuration theory suggests that these pressures lead to specific groups of festival configurations that best fit their competitive environment. In this study, data on the <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> of 139 Dutch music festivals are used to explore design features that organizations use to adapt to their <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures.</b> The empirical results show that there are three distinctive groups of music festival configurations in the Netherlands. One group of typically larger festivals is orientated towards the music industry at large and involves industry participants, music fans and other festival visitors that come together on a festival site. For this particular group of festivals, the location per se plays a minor role in the competition for visitors. In contrast, the location plays a key role for visitors in the midrange and smaller festival groups: urban music festivals and countryside Pop and Rock festivals. The results explain why certain festivals {{seem to be able to}} move to another location without losing too many visitors (or even grow). From a hospitality management perspective, the results show that some festivals have a lower location-dependency than others...|$|R
40|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> in {{corporate}} and personal income taxation {{have increased the}} mar-ginal economic and political costs of taxation during the last 25 years. This contributed {{to the fact that}} since the mid- 1980 s, capital income and total tax revenues as well as public expen-ditures (all as percentage of GDP) of the 18 most advanced OECD countries have, on average, no longer shown a medium-term upward trend. However, contrary to widespread beliefs, the OECD- 18 averages for these three variables do not show a downward trend, either. How can this medium-term stability of capital income tax revenues, total tax revenues and public expenditures be explained? On the basis of an investigation of the nature of adjustment pres-sures and strategies, the paper highlights two explanations. First, <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> on the tax mix, the revenue mix, and the budget size have partly been offset by countervailing – domestic and international – pressures. Second, given strong budgetary constraints on gen-eral cuts in effective income tax rates, most governments have pursued three revenue-preserving adjustment strategies that take the precise nature of <b>competitive</b> <b>pressures</b> into ac-count.
