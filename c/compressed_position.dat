50|$|In a soft-recoil system, {{the spring}} (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward {{position}} starts {{out in a}} nearly fully <b>compressed</b> <b>position,</b> then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, {{about half of the}} recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring. A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with hangfires or s. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cervical {{lordosis}} {{has been}} shown to be an important outcome of care; however, few conservative methods of rehabilitating sagittal cervical alignment have been reported. Objective: To study whether a seated, retracted, extended, and <b>compressed</b> <b>position</b> would cause tension in the anterior cervical ligament, anterior disk, and muscle structures, and thereby restore cervical lordosis or increase the curvature in patients with loss of the cervical lordosis. Study Design: Nonrandomized, prospective, clinical control trial. Methods: Thirty preselected patients, after diagnostic screening for tolerance to cervical extension with compression, were treated for the first 3 weeks of care using cervical manipulation and a new type of cervical extension-compression traction (vertical weight applied to the subject’s forehead in the sitting position with a transverse load at the area of kyphosis). Pretreatment and posttreatment Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain ratings were compared along with pretreatment and posttreatment lateral cervical radiographs analyzed with the posterior tangent method for changes in alignment. Results are compared to a control group of 33 subjects receiving no treatment and matched for age, sex, weight, height, and pain. Results: Control subjects reported no change in VAS pain ratings and had no statistical significant change i...|$|E
40|$|Competitive surfing {{includes}} high -risk manoeuvres, such as aerials, {{that require}} landing from height onto the water surface, absorbing high loads through the lower limbs. The injuries reported during aerial manoeuvres have been mainly {{located in the}} knee and ankle joints; however, {{there is a lack}} of information about the types and mechanisms of these injuries. This case report describes two cases of Anterior Inferior Tibio - Fibular Ligament (AITFL), or syndesmosis, injuries that occurred during one professional surfing competition. Video recordings and clinical examination information were used to analyse the two cases. Both injuries were due to unsuccessful landings of aerial manoeuvres, and the video recordings showed similar movement patterns with the landing occurring in an already <b>compressed</b> <b>position.</b> The result suggests that the performance of aerial manoeuvres in competition can lead to high load compression injuries, and that syndesmosis injury may be a typical surfing injury due to the modern type of manoeuvres. This information can be used to direct training interventions and landing strategies for surfing athletes, to make them more effective in coping with the dynamic high load compression forces that occur during aerial manoeuvres...|$|E

40|$|The second {{flight of}} NASA's Shuttle Flight {{experiment}} program known as MEPHISTO {{suffered from a}} void in the liquid portion of the sample, even though a piston arrangement was in place to keep the ampoule filled. In preparations for the next flight of the MEPHISTO furnace an animated computer program, called MEPHISTO Volume Visualizer (MVV), was written to help avoid the formation of unwanted voids. A piston system on MEPHISTO {{has the ability to}} move approximately 5 mm in compression, to accommodate expansion of the solid during heating; then from the completely <b>compressed</b> <b>position,</b> the piston can move up to 25 mm in towards the sample, effectively making the ampoule smaller and hopefully eliminating any voids. Due {{to the nature of the}} piston design and ampoule and sample arrangement, the piston has gotten stuck during normal directional solidification; this creates the risk of a void. To eliminate such a void, the liquid in the hot zones of the furnace can be heated, thereby expanding the liquid and consuming any void. The problem with this approach is that if the liquid is heated too much an overpressure could result, breaking the ampoule and ending the experiment catastrophically. The MVV has been found to be a useful tool in the assessment of the risks associated with the formation of a void and the additional heating of the liquid in the hot zone of this Bridgman type furnace. The MVV software will be discussed and copies available; it is written in the Delphi 2 programming language and runs under Windows 95 and NT. The strategies used in other flight experiments, such as the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment, will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|In surfing, {{the athlete}} rides a board across the wave, {{performing}} manoeuvres that require lower-body strength and power. The lower limb {{position on the}} board will range from fully flexed to completely extended, demanding full range of motion of the lower extremity joints. Furthermore, the athlete will need to produce and arrest high forces throughout this range of motion, due to the complex manoeuvres that are required to ensure success in competition. High-risk manoeuvres, such as vertical turns, aerials and tube-rides, all score high in competition, however, such tasks require high velocity change of direction, landing and compression, which may put the surfer in a vulnerable position for lower extremity joint injury unless proper development of strength and flexibility is implemented. Among all injuries in surfing, about 40 % occur in the lower extremities with approximately 15 - 20 % occurring specifically in the ankle and foot. Although only {{a few studies have}} used weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion as a measure to predict injury risk, initial evidence has shown that limited dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) increases injury risk, suggesting that this may be an important measure for athletes, especially those using the full ROM at the ankle joint. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM can be measured in different ways, however a weight bearing assessment that {{has been shown to be}} highly reliable for both injured (ICC 0. 99) and non-injured populations (ICC 0. 99), and moderately reliability for a younger age group (ICC 0. 83), is the knee to wall measurement (KW). Previously Hoch, et al. reported on KW measurements for 14 males and 21 females around 25 years of age. They found an average knee to wall distance of 11. 9 ± 2. 8 and 12. 0 ± 2. 8 cm for the left and right limb respectively, with the maximum score just above 17 cm. Furthermore, they did not find any statistical relationship between KW and age, limb length, height, mass or posterior talar displacement, indicating that these measures do not influence the KW score. Another study that compared ballet dancers to a control group found that the control achieved 3. 8 ± 2. 2 cm and the dancers 6. 4 ± 2. 8 cm. Since surfing manoeuvres are highly dynamic movements, surfing athletes need a large ROM in the ankle joint to be able to assume a fully <b>compressed</b> <b>position.</b> To the authors’ knowledge, there is no data published that describes the ankle ROM among surfers, and compares different groups of surfers. Whether ankle ROM is an important measure for surfing athletes to perform at their highest level and to avoid ankle injury is yet to be determined. However, this study aimed to describe the ankle ROM among different groups of surfers, compare the ankle ROM to previously published data and surfers with a previous ankle injury, and last compare the weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion ROM test measured with two different systems (KW and inertial sensors) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} {{reason for not}} using a centralized location of information is that tar was originally meant for tapes, which are bad at random access anyway: if the Table Of Contents (TOC) were {{at the start of}} the archive, creating it would mean to first calculate all the positions of all files, which needs doubled work, a big cache, or rewinding the tape after writing everything to write the TOC. On the other hand, if the TOC were at the end-of-file (as is the case with ZIP files, for example), reading the TOC would require that the tape be wound to the end, also taking up time and degrading the tape by excessive wear and tear. Compression further complicates matters; as calculating <b>compressed</b> <b>positions</b> for a TOC at the start would need compression of everything before writing the TOC, a TOC with uncompressed positions is not really useful (since one has to decompress everything anyway to get the right positions) and decompressing a TOC at the end of the file might require decompressing the whole file anyway, too.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{events have}} stimulated {{interest}} in the joint behavior of prices and quantities in credit markets. Data sources such as the Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA) provide statistics on a rich set of credit market instruments. However, {{it is challenging to}} interpret such data using economic models that speak to the allocation of risk across agents, such as households or intermediaries. On the one hand, an instrument class such as “Treasury bonds ” typically contains many different instruments that trade at different prices and have different exposure to interest rate shocks (for example, because of differences in duration). On the other hand, a lot of the price movements in instruments like Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities are due to common interest rate shocks, making those instruments close substitutes from a portfolio choice perspective. For understanding how interest rate risk is allocated in the economy, one would thus like to use information on many positions at the same time, rather than, say, focus on one set of instruments only. At the same time, models with many closely substitutable assets are problematic. Instead, it would be desirable to <b>compress</b> <b>position</b> data into simple sets of portfolios, like “long ” and “short ” bonds, but with some confidence that the risk properties of the original instruments are not lost along the way...|$|R

The main focus is to enable real-time decoding of <b>compressed</b> vertex <b>positions</b> while providing reasonable compression ratios. Our scheme is based on local quantization of vertex positions with mesh partitioning. To prevent visual seams along the partitioning boundaries, we constrain the locally quantized cells of all mesh partitions {{to have the same}} size and aligned local axes. We propose a mesh partitioning algorithm to minimize the size of locally quantized cells, which relates to the distortion of a restored mesh. Vertex coordinates are stored in main memory and transmitted to graphics hardware for rendering in the quantized form, saving memory space and system bus bandwidth. Decoding operation is combined with model geometry transformation, and the only overhead to restore vertex positions is one matrix multiplication for each mesh partition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During the {{recording}} of a haptic interaction session both position and force-feedback data have to be saved. This work proposes two novel methods for haptic data compression which allow to keep the reconstruction errors during playback below human perception thresholds. Supported by well-known results from psychophysics, the first proposed non-iterative method determines {{the least amount of}} samples necessary to reconstruct the force-feedback signal within the perception thresholds. The second proposed method <b>compresses</b> the <b>position</b> signal in open-loop fashion exploiting the fact that for the replay of haptic interaction sessions the position signal no longer has influence on the force-feedback. Thus, the only position information perceived by the user is the displayed visual information and therefore it can be compressed exploiting the limits of human visual perception. Our experimental results show better haptic signal compression performance when compared to the state-of-the-art for both methods while maintaining good haptic and visual subjective experiences...|$|R

Besides, very few of the existing spatiotemporal compression algorithms, which cannot determine whether the final compression result is optimal, use optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swam Optimation (PSO) algorithm. With these two points in mind, we propose a new trajectory compression algorithm based on the GA, PSO, and Douglas-Peucker algorithms to <b>compress</b> time-stamped <b>position</b> data.

We compute a Fourier decomposition for polygons of different degrees and assume the highest frequencies to be zero for predicting missing points around the polygon.

However, the sensitivity of scintimammography using conventional gamma cameras is considerably less (40 - 50 %) for tumors with smaller size. Recently, the authors demonstrated how {{the use of a}} small FOV dedicated gamma camera (Single Photon Emission Mammography, or SPEM camera), with very high intrinsic spatial resolution (1. 7 mm FWHM), working with breast moderately <b>compressed</b> and <b>positioned</b> close to the breast tumor (i. e., analogously to X-ray mammography) increased sensitivity up to 80 % for tumors sized between 0. 5 and 1 cm (T 1 b). The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate how the reduced breast thickness can play a primary role in small cancer detection. Five different methods were taken into account: clinical measurements, comparing tumor SNR values obtained from the same patients in prone scintimammography and in SPEM, comparing SNR values between compressed and uncompressed breast in craniocaudal projection, breast phantom measurements, Monte Carlo simulations and simplified theoretical model. Results confirm that the mechanism for the improvement in visualizing sub-centimeter lesions due to compression is a reduction of lesion-detector distance. As a result of this reduced distance there is a less reabsorption of signal by interposed breast tissue, and improved detector intrinsic spatial resolution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

Secondly, we suggest improvements on how to <b>compress</b> vortex <b>position</b> data effectively to enable visualisation of complex systems. A number of problems arise when long-range forces such as $K_ 1 (x) $ or $ 1 /x$ are used in particle-particle simulations. If a simple cut-off for the interaction is used, the system may find an equilibrium configuration at zero temperature that is not a regular lattice yet has an energy lower than the theoretically predicted minimum for the physical system: this is an artefact of the cut-off [1]. We have developed two methods to overcome these problems in Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. The first uses a smoothed potential to truncate the interaction in a single unit cell: this is appropriate for phenomenological characterisations, but may be applied to any potential. The second is a new method for the $K_ 0 (x) $ potential and sums the energy in an infinitely tiled periodic system, which is in excess of 20, 000 times faster than previous naive methods which add periodic images in shells of increasing radius: this is suitable for quantitative studies.

How should managers/entrepreneurs be able to know, even to predict at the start of an employment relation, what a worker's “marginal product” is, given the fact that total output of a firm can rarely be disaggregated and linked to individual contributions? Rather, it must be seen as the outcome of a complex pattern of ongoing cooperation of many contributors of diverse ranks and positions. What is needed here, instead, is some managerial metric of proportionality that links a worker's characteristics, as well as job characteristics, to a particular hierarchical position. Ideally, such a “meritocratic” metric would not only explain the resulting hierarchical structure but also justify the resulting pattern of intra-organizational inequality as legitimate, and the inferior as well as superior positions of individuals as somehow “appropriate” and “well deserved”.|$|R

Its applications include oblivious cloud storage, trusted processors, software protection, secure multi-party computation, and so on. This thesis improves the state-of-the-art Path ORAM in several aspects. On the theoretical side, we improve Path ORAM's memory bandwidth overhead {{by a factor}} of O(log logN) when the block size is small. With this improvement, Path ORAM is asymptotically the most ecient ORAM construction with constant or polylogarithmic client storage under any block size. Our technique to achieve this improvement involves using pseudorandom functions to <b>compress</b> the <b>position</b> map, a central component in Path ORAM and other position-based ORAMs. With small block size, managing the position map has huge overhead and is Path ORAM's performance bottleneck. Our technique reduces this overhead. On the practical side, we propose Unified ORAM with a position map lookaside buffer to utilize locality in real-world applications, while preserving access pattern privacy. We also propose a new variant of Path ORAM named RAW Path ORAM, which achieves a constant factor reduction in memory bandwidth and encryption overhead. It also features a much simpler proof for correctness compared with Path ORAM. Combining our techniques results in a roughly 2 improvement in ORAM bandwidth, and over 1. 43 speedup on SPEC benchmarks. We also study how to eciently verify the integrity of ORAM. Besides some customized optimizations for Path ORAM and RAW Path ORAM, we present a novel integrity verification scheme that works for any position-based ORAM and achieves an asymptotic reduction in hashing overhead over prior solutions. by Ling Ren.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{commercial}} Web search engines have augmented their underlying index structures by significantly enriching the information which describes {{the appearance of a}} word within a document Dean (2009) [7]. This enriched information is now used in complex and effective functions which rank documents by taking into consideration hundreds of features, with respect to a user query. Despite the evolution of the search engines, the past research has mainly concentrated on improving plain Web indexes storing typical data only. In this work we study the problem of organizing an inverted index storing additional information. In particular, we examine how the physical locations of a document, called zones, can be efficiently integrated with such an index structure. We introduce TZP, an encoder which compresses these zones in combination to the positions of a word in a document, by employing a fixed number of bits for each portion of a word's inverted list. We demonstrate that our method allows direct access to the <b>compressed</b> zones and <b>positions</b> without expensive look-ups, avoids decoding any unnecessary information, while its overall index size is analogous or even better when compared against state-of-the art schemes. Moreover, we examine how the word positions can be combined to the zones to improve retrieval effectiveness. We introduce BM 25 TOPF, a scheme which incorporates term proximity and zone weighting into a single ranking formula. Unlike other term proximity approaches, BM 25 TOPF also takes into account the ordering of the query terms by rewarding the documents containing them in the correct order. Our experiments with the Web Adhoc Task of TREC 2009 and a set of own queries show that BM 25 TOPF outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches by a margin between 6 % and 11 %.
