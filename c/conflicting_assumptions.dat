50|$|Instead of {{offering}} a comprehensive theory of knowledge, the argumentative approach tries {{to focus on}} a better description of what social scientist already do. Science is understood as a socio-cultural practice mediated by symbolic systems of meaning, located in historically specific places and communities. Therefore, the argumentative approach rejects neo-positivistic versions of correspondence theory, rather building scientific investigation on a coherence theory of truth, thereby giving voice to the importance of inter-subjective practices of argumentation and deliberation. Every empirical proposition is haunted by factors of indeterminacy, while empirical data only makes sense located in a meaningful context. The argumentative approach therefore tries to develop a richer perspective on political controversies, which cannot be understood to be about raw data, but rather about the <b>conflicting</b> <b>assumptions</b> that organize them. Logical deduction and empirical falsification cannot make sense of a world that is much more complex and in flux, than necessary for the maintenance of the neo-positivist perspective. Therefore, the post-empiricist framework involves a multimethodological approach, that substitutes the formal logic of neo-positivism, with something that Aristotle called phronesis - an informal deliberative framework of practical reason. This conception of reason proofs to be a more accurate response to the forms of rationality exhibited in real-world policy analysis and implementation.|$|E

This thesis is {{an investigation into the}} accounting practices by which British and American expatriates make sense of Western involvement in the Middle East. Based on the analysis of an audio-taped archive of some sixty hours of face-to-face interview material recorded in Kuwait during a ten-month period in the year immediately following the Persian Gulf Conflict of 1990 - 91, this project explores the interactional work by which speakers situate their conversational contributions in dialogic anticipation of a range of competing but mutually co-implicative demands for accountability which they take their talk and their participation in the circumstances of that talk to entail. Specifically, speakers are seen to manage the productive tension between the competing demands for accountability to <b>conflicting</b> <b>assumptions</b> about the nature of prejudice on the one hand, and the awareness of and/or sensitivity to cultural difference on the other, in and while attending to the situated concerns for their warrant in making the claims that they do {{and the degree to which}} they are implicated in those claims in and through the activity of their production.

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{a number}} of {{so-called}} &quot;agile &quot; software development methods have been proposed. Interestingly, these approaches have been met with &quot;both enthusiastic support and equally vigorous criticism &quot; among experts in the field. At present the software engineering community is split, and seemingly irreconcilable &quot;schools of thought &quot; have emerged. In this paper we identify an important characteristic of any software engineering method: its set of tacit basic assumptions. We retrieve some important basic assumption that underly agile software development and discuss an example to illustrate in detail how <b>conflicting</b> basic <b>assumptions</b> can lead to fundamental disagreement about software development methods. ...|$|R

We show that the democratic merits of participatory technology assessments probably owe as much to the institutional context as to the precise evaluative criteria or procedural designs. This calls for a closer interaction between science and technology studies research on public engagement and comparative politics scholarship...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there exists}} an {{extensive}} and growing literature on how firms should {{and should not}} allocate costs, this literature has had only a limited impact on cost allocation practices. A {{possible explanation is that}} cost allocation proposals have not always captured essential aspects of the settings in which demands for allocations arise. Another explanation relates to this literature's diversity. The varied and sometimes <b>conflicting</b> <b>assumptions,</b> definitions, and methodologies that the alternative approaches employ have made comparisons difficult for managers and researchers alike. Through a critique and synthesis of the major streams of cost allocation research, this study provides a concise and nontechnical overview. Its critical review of previous studies provides a framework for future research which emphasizes a necessary correspondence between allocation methods and management decisions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Different {{theoretical}} accounts {{have attempted}} to integrate anterior cingulate cortex involvement in relation to conflict detection, error-likelihood predictions, and error monitoring. Regarding the latter, event-related potential studies have identified the feedback-related negativity (FRN) component in relation to processing feedback which indicates that a particular outcome was worse than expected. According to the conflict-monitoring theory the stimulus-locked N 2 reflects pre-response <b>conflict.</b> <b>Assumptions</b> of these theories have been {{made on the basis}} of relatively simple response-mapping tasks, rather than more complex decision-making processes associated with everyday situations. The question remains whether expectancies and conflicts induced by everyday knowledge similarly affect decision-making processes. To answer this question, electroencephalogram and behavioral measurements were obtained while participants performed a simulated traffic task that varied high and low ambiguous situations at an intersection by presenting multiple varying traffic light combinations. Although feedback was kept constant for the different conditions, the tendency to cross was more pronounced for traffic light combinations that in reallife are associated with proceeding, as opposed to more ambiguous traffic light combinations not uniquely associated with a specific response. On a neurophysiological level, the stimulus-locked N 2 was enhanced on trials that induced experience-based conflict and the FRN was more pronounced for negative as compared to positive feedback, but did not differ as a function of everyday expectancies related to traffic rules. The current study shows that well-learned everyday rules may influence decision-making processes in situations that are associated with the application of these rules, even if responding accordingly does not lead to the intended outcomes...|$|R
