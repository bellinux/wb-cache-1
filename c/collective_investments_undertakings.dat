In {{a large portion of the}} thesis I focus on the definition of alternative investment funds to clarify the possible modes of operation and distinguish them from their earlier regulated standard counterparts. In the first of eight chapters I introduce this topic in the historical context, which provides a brief excursion into the progress of regulation of <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> at the European and Czech level, and further explain the reasons which led to creation of a unified regulation for <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> business. The second chapter describes the current regulatory framework in accordance with the European regulation, based primarily on the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and its subsequent transposition into the Czech Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds (ICIFA) [...] . ...|$|R

Such coordination intended to facilitate the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the internal market. For the purposes of internal regulation UCITS means an undertaking: (a) with the sole object of <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets of capital raised from the public and which operate on the principle of risk-spreading; and (b) with units which are, at the request of holders, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of those undertakings’ assets. The UCITS may be constituted in accordance with contract law (as common funds managed by management companies), trust law (as unit trusts), or statute (as investment companies). Key investor information should be provided as a specific document to investors, before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions. Investment funds enjoy in Romania a new regulatory framework: the contract of common society hosted by new Civil Code and the new Emergency Ordinance regarding UCITS...|$|R

At this moment, the Dutch, French, UK and German legislator already provide public authorities with resolution powers. In order to be effective in debt restructuring of failing (non-) ﬁnancial institutions, the measures taken by the resolution authorities need to be enforceable (before all courts) and effective in the entire European Union. Given the fact that not all the ﬁrm’s debt is issued in the home jurisdiction, the question of recognition is critically important. In regard of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms, the Dutch, UK, French and German jurisdictions provide for court proceedings to impose a collective settlement reached by the debtor and the majority of its creditors binding on the opposing minority. Outof-insolvency plans approved by the court are recognised under the Brussels I Regulation. If the European Union Commission’s Insolvency Regulation reform proposal is adopted, these court-approved debt restructuring plans in insolvency situations will be subject to the recognition regime of this regulation.

Methodology design and approach – This is a deductive, empirical, quantitative study {{on the performance of}} individual South African domestic equity <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes. The study evaluates performance using nominal returns, Treynor ratios, Sharpe ratios and Jensen's alpha. Jensen's alpha is calculated utilising ordinary least squares regression analysis, to ensure robustness the Newey-West method of correcting standard errors is applied. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index is used as a market portfolio proxy to compare the funds to. Empirical results: The empirical findings conclude that the average South African domestic equity <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> scheme underperforms the market index. These findings are in accordance with other studies on <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes internationally.
