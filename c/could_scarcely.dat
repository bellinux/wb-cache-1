5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> have {{satisfied}} in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E
5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies {{attempted}} to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could, and waited for the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.|$|E

His parents lived a life of shabby gentility, employing servants and tutors they <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> afford, although their financial situation improved somewhat following a move to Toronto around 1890, where King lived with them for several years in a duplex located in a then-respectable neighborhood, Beverley Street, while studying at the University of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|During {{these years}} {{he began to}} study {{literary}} matters and philology, instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe colic, which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused {{to keep up the}} regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.|$|E

It was imperative under any circumstances and at any price to secure his absolution from Gregory before the period named, otherwise he <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> foil his opponents in their intention to pursue their attack against him and justify their measures by an appeal to his excommunication. At first he attempted to attain his ends by an embassy, but when Gregory rejected his overtures he took the celebrated step of going to Italy in person.|$|E

25|$|The most {{explosive}} growth was experienced in Chabad-Lubavitch, whose head Menachem Mendel Schneerson adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary Shtreimel) and outreach-centered orientation. At {{a time when}} most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of Breslov, which remained without an acting Tzaddiq since the rebellious Rebbe Nachman's 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} {{fighting}} developed {{to the north}} of the 54th Brigade, who were now joined with the French and the survivors of the 18th Division, who <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> raise enough men to form a small Brigade. By 10:00 on the 25th, the left flank of 7th Bedfordshires was again exposed as the French around them retreated, so another retirement was ordered. They withdrew back to Mont Du Grandu further south and away from the British Fifth Army. Midday saw them in a stronger position until French artillery and machine guns opened fire on them, mistaking them for Germans, forcing them to retire to high ground west of Grandu.|$|E

500|$|England's frenzy {{over the}} Reform Bill in 1831, {{coupled with the}} effect of the bill itself upon its {{enactment}} in 1832, unleashed a wave of political modernization that the Whig Party eagerly harnessed and the Tory Party grudgingly, but no less effectively, embraced. Reform quickly destroyed the political system that had prevailed during the long reign of George III and replaced it with an essentially modern electoral system based on rigid partisanship and clearly articulated political principle. Hardly [...] "modest" [...] in its consequences, the Reform Act <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> have caused a more drastic alteration in England's political fabric.|$|E
500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> put {{one foot in front of}} the other and walked like an old thing".|$|E
500|$|Austen {{learned that}} the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent's {{librarian}} James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming Emma to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. [...] She later wrote , a satiric outline of the [...] "perfect novel" [...] based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the Plan of A Novel parodying [...] Clarke was intended as her revenge {{for all of the}} unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.|$|E

500|$|Taruskin {{points out}} this statement, which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote while Borodin and Mussorgsky were still alive, {{as proof of}} his estrangement {{from the rest of}} The Five and an {{indication}} of the kind of teacher he eventually became. By the time he instructed Liadov and Glazunov, [...] "their training hardly differed from [...] An ideal of the strictest professionalism was instilled in them from the beginning." [...] By the time Borodin died in 1887, the era of autodidactism for Russian composers had effectively ended. Every Russian who aspired to write classical music attended a conservatory and received the same formal education. [...] "There was no more 'Moscow', no 'St. Petersburg'." [...] Taruskin writes; [...] "at last all Russia was one. Moreover, by century's end, the theory and composition faculties of Rubinstein's Conservatory were entirely in the hands of representatives of the New Russian School. Viewed against the background of Stasov's predictions, there <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> be any greater irony." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{called the}} episode [...] "a fantastic launch {{for the sixth}} series," [...] adding [...] "the Doctor Who team's US {{location}} shooting has certainly paid off, lending these early scenes a grand scale that the series <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> have expected to achieve in 2005, let alone in 1963." [...] Commenting on the future-Doctor's death, Jeffery said [...] "seven minutes in, a nation's collective jaw dropped as The Doctor— this show's lead— is mercilessly gunned down. This plot twist is simply stunning, and it's difficult to imagine even casual viewers not sitting up to pay attention at this point." [...] Jeffery also believed that the series regulars were on [...] "top form," [...] adding [...] "the more abrasive aspects of Amy Pond's personality {{seem to have been}} toned down this year, and Karen Gillan responds with her best, most sympathetic performance to date. Arthur Darvill also lives up to his recent promotion to full-time companion. His comic timing is simply superb, but he excels too in the episode's darker moments." [...] Jeffery rated the episode five stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Away {{from its}} context as a song {{designed}} purely to {{bring attention to}} the Bengalis' cause, as Harrison himself described it, [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] has often been viewed by commentators as a rushed and underwhelming composition. Robert Rodriguez qualifies this opinion, however: [...] "As a single, the song was possibly not the most commercial of records, but as a call to service, it <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> have been improved upon." [...] "Bangla Desh"'s standing as rock music's first charity single is not overlooked, with Ian Inglis stating: [...] "'Bangla Desh' serves {{as a model for}} the charity singles that would become commonplace in the decades ahead, although, in this instance, the power of Harrison's song lies not in its assembly of famous performers but in its literal and absolute commitment." [...] On this point, Leng deems the song as having [...] "as much raw energy as anything [...] Plastic Ono Band ever offered". In The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes: [...] "Harrison's lyric and vocal were concise and powerful, a direct call for action in a specific crisis. As such, 'Bangla Desh' remains one of the most cogent social statements in music history." ...|$|E

25|$|Msiri's capital Bunkeya and {{surrounding}} villages had a population estimated at 60,000–80,000 in 1891. A year after Msiri's death, it was 10,000–20,000. In {{that part of}} Africa people disperse into the bush when threatened. For instance, David Livingstone reported twenty years earlier that Mwata Kazembe VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti so tyrannised his people that many had moved away, and he <b>could</b> muster <b>scarcely</b> 1000 men. Continuing the contrast with Msiri, when the assassins sent by Msiri and Tippu Tib advanced on his boma, Chinkonkole Kafuti’s people did not warn him, but let him be taken by surprise.|$|R
500|$|During the {{preceding}} 194748 season in Australia, Hamence was {{dropped from the}} national team. He had played sporadically in the Test team, being selected {{in three of the}} ten matches in the previous two seasons. In those three Tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27.00. Returning to domestic cricket following his omission, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, a performance which kept him in the running for a place in the national team. His selection for the 1948 tour of England under Bradman was the subject of considerable controversy, as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during the Australian summer. For his part, Bradman described his middle-orderHamence among themas [...] "an array of batsmen who <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> fail". From the start, Hamence was on the outer with regards to selection in the Tests. He was not selected for any of the Tests during the English campaign, but in a 2008 interview, emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission. Hamence was a popular member of the touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team. His roommate during the tour was the seamer Ernie Toshack.|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing from}} {{immigrants}} how European strikers had used this tactic during prolonged strikes, Haywood {{decided to take}} the gamble in Lawrence, a first in American Labor history. [...] He and the IWW used announcements in socialist newspapers to solicit host families, then screened strikers to see who might be willing to send their children into the care of strangers. [...] On February 10, 1912, the first group of [...] "Lawrence Strike Children" [...] bid tearful goodbyes to their parents and, with chaperones to guide them, boarded a train for New York. [...] The children arrived safely in Manhattan that evening where they were taken to a Labor hall. [...] They were soon lavished with food and clothes and would stay in New York another seven weeks. [...] Despite their excellent treatment, officials in Lawrence and elsewhere were shocked by the move. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> believe that the strike leaders would do such a thing as this," [...] Lawrence mayor Michael Scanlon said. [...] "Lawrence could have very easily cared for these children." [...] Though also denounced in the press, the children's exodus gained widespread publicity and made the city of Lawrence look bad. [...] While police and the mayor allowed smaller contingents of children to leave on two more occasions, plans were made to crack down).|$|E
500|$|Mauritius had {{previously}} been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, but was settled by neither. No records of dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, [...] "Cerne (swan) Island", {{may have been a}} reference to dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company henceforward. The earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by Dutch travelers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by admiral Jacob van Neck in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary. The 1602 journal by Willem Van West-Zanen of the ship Bruin-Vis mentions that 24–25 dodos were hunted for food, which were so large that two <b>could</b> <b>scarcely</b> be consumed at mealtime, their remains being preserved by salting. An illustration made for the 1648 published version of this journal, showing the killing of dodos, a dugong, and possibly Mascarene grey parakeets, was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in Hugh Strickland's 1848 translation: ...|$|E
