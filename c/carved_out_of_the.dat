5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On {{the two sides of the}} entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E

5|$|The inner German border {{originated}} from plans by the Second World War Allies to divide a defeated Germany into occupation zones. The boundaries between these zones were drawn along the territorial boundaries of 19th-century German states and provinces that had largely disappeared with {{the unification of}} Germany in 1871. Three zones were agreed on, each covering roughly a third of Germany's territories: a British zone in the north-west, an American zone {{in the south and}} a Soviet zone in the East. France was later given a zone in the far west of Germany, <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British and American zones.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{exception}} to this was when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it does today. During the Pleistocene the valley was <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E

5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which {{came to power in}} 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes them down to another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls themselves flank the street.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012, {{major changes}} were {{implemented}} in the administrative divisions of Tripura. Beforehand, there had been four districts– Dhalai (headquarters Ambassa), North Tripura (headquarters Kailashahar), South Tripura (headquarters Udaipur), and West Tripura (headquarters Agartala). Four new districts were <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing four in January 2012– Khowai, Unakoti, Sipahijala and Gomati. Six new subdivisions and five new blocks were also added. Each is governed by a district collector or a district magistrate, usually appointed by the Indian Administrative Service. The subdivisions of each district are governed by a sub-divisional magistrate and each subdivision is further divided into blocks. The blocks consist of Panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. As of 2012, the state had eight districts, 23 subdivisions and 58 development blocks. National census and state statistical reports are not available for all the new administrative divisions, as of March 2013. Agartala, the capital of Tripura, is the most populous city. Other major towns {{with a population of}} 10,000 or more (as per 2015 census) are Sabroom, Dharmanagar, Jogendranagar, Kailashahar, Pratapgarh, Udaipur, Amarpur, Belonia, Gandhigram, Kumarghat, Khowai, Ranirbazar, Sonamura, Bishalgarh, Teliamura, Mohanpur, Melaghar, Ambassa, Kamalpur, Bishramganj, Kathaliya, Santirbazar and Baxanagar.|$|E
