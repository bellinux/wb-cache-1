40|$|Background and Objectives: Studying gender {{differences}} among suicide attempters {{is important for}} identifying gender-specific risk factors and for planning management and prevention. Our objective was to delineate {{gender differences}} among a well-defined group of suicide attempters. Materials and Methods: This record-based study was conducted among patients presenting to a <b>Crisis</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Clinic</b> in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India. Information was gathered regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Hopelessness was measured using Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and stress was evaluated using Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES). Results: The sample comprised of 162 males and 137 females. Males were significantly older {{and were more likely}} to be employed as compared to females. Alcohol use was significantly more in males and number of men who attempted suicide under intoxication was significantly higher. Females had a greater proportion of attempts with the use of plant poisons and medication overdose. There was no significant difference between two genders on BHS though differences were noted on types of stresses reported on PSLES. Conclusion: Gender-specific differences were noted with regard to substance use, mode of attempt and types of stressors experienced. Identifying these factors might help us to design targeted interventions to prevent further attempts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Temporal {{variations}} of suicide attempts {{can help to}} better understand correlates of suicidal behavior. This study attempted to find the diurnal, weekly, and seasonal variations in suicide attempts at a tertiary care hospital in India. Materials and Methods: This record-based study was conducted among patients evaluated at a <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>clinic</b> over a 4 -year period at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Southern India. Patients who attempted suicide in recent past and had been medically stabilized were evaluated in this clinic. The distribution of suicide attempts across {{the time of the}} day, the day of the week, and month of the year was assessed. Results: Of the 407 patients who were included in the analysis, the frequency of suicide attempts varied across time of the day (χ 2 = 134. 504, P < 0. 001). The most common period of the day for the attempt was evenings (6 pm to 9 pm). There were no significant temporal associations between month of the year or day of the week and suicide attempts though peaks were observed for June among the months and Sundays among days of the week. Conclusion: Diurnal variations exist in the suicide attempts. This has implications on clinical caseloads on emergency departments, especially during the times when staffing might be sub-optimal...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Suicide {{attempt is}} a complex human {{behavior}} with multiple determinants. Literature suggests toward abdominal pain as {{a risk factor for}} a suicide attempt, but such patients need to be characterized further. This retrospective study aimed to compare individuals with abdominal pain as the reason of suicide attempt to those reporting other reasons for such attempt. Methods: This retrospective chart review-based case-control study was conducted among individuals registered at the <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>clinic</b> of a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India. Information was extracted from the records using a structured profroma. Characteristics of those with abdominal pain as the reason of suicide attempt were compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Results: Of 427 persons registered in the clinic in the period, abdominal pain was the stated reason for the attempt in 37 (8. 7 % of the sample). Suicide attempters whose stated reason for attempted suicide as abdominal pain had lower education (P = 0. 042), were more likely to suffer from physical illness (P < 0. 001), {{were more likely to have}} a recent visit to a health care professional (P = 0. 047), were less likely to give hint prior to attempt (P = 0. 010), and had lesser stressful life events compared to the controls (P = 0. 024). Conclusions: There seem to be certain differences between suicide attempters who report abdominal pain versus other causes for a suicide attempt...|$|E

Every person experiences their crisis in specific way. <b>Crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> doesn`t only mean communication skills, which include verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal areas. Even though <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> is especially a domain of psychiatric units, knowledge of it is important even in departments not specifically conversant with illnesses of psyche. In health care within the Czech Republic exist standards for <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> not yet clearly defined.

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{cross-cultural}} {{literature on the}} duration of suicide process among attempters. Aims: The primary aim {{was to assess the}} duration of suicide process among suicide attempters attending the <b>Crisis</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Clinic.</b> We also aimed to identify the characteristics of those who reported a longer duration for this process. Methods: In this retrospective record-based study, we collected the duration of the suicidal process from the records of all the suicide attempters evaluated over a 3 -year period (n = 319). Attempters were divided into four groups based on the quartile value of the duration of the suicidal process. For analysis, the characteristics of those in the last quartile with suicide process time of > 120 min (n = 75) were compared with those in the first three (n = 244). Those in the last quartile were considered to provide a window of opportunity for intervention. Results: The median time for the suicidal process was 30 min (interquartile range of 5 min to 120 min). Seventy-five (23. 5 %) subjects belonged to the fourth quartile (duration of suicide process > 120 min). A significant proportion of them came from urban areas (P = 0. 011), had a diagnosis of mood disorder (P = 0. 028), had visited a health professional in the recent past (P = 0. 015), and had lower rates of attempt under intoxication (P = 0. 005). A lesser proportion of them showed problem-focused disengagement style of coping strategy (P = 0. 015). Conclusions: The suicide process time among Indian suicide attempters is short. However, a quarter of them has suicide process duration of 2 h which provides some scope for intervention. Individual and community level interventions need further evaluation for their potential efficacy in preventing the progress of the suicidal process...|$|E
