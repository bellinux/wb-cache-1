40|$|This article {{describes}} a device intended to produce replicas on filters by liquid deposition of anion or metal solutions. Schematically, the filters {{are housed in}} <b>cassettes</b> <b>labelled</b> automati-cally {{by means of a}} code. An automatic arm takes each cassette, reads the code, and deposits the amount of element required. Weighing before and after deposition allows the amount deposited to be accurately checked and determined. This automated system allows the produc-tion of replicas with high deposition regularity, replica dispersion for the most part being < 1 %. The samples produced can be used during proficiency tests where the assigned value is determined either by the participants or by the organizer...|$|R
