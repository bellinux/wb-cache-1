40|$|Visual {{search is}} aided by {{previous}} knowledge regarding distinguishing features and probable locations of a sought-after target. However, how {{the human brain}} represents and integrates concurrent feature-based and spatial expectancies to guide visual search is currently not well understood. Specifically, {{it is not clear}} whether spatial and feature-based search information is initially represented in anatomically segregated regions, nor at which level of processing expectancies regarding target features and locations may be integrated. To address these questions, we independently and parametrically varied the degree of spatial and feature-based (color) <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> concerning the identity of an upcoming visual search target while recording blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in human subjects. Search performance improved with the amount of spatial and feature-based <b>cue</b> <b>information,</b> and cue-related BOLD responses showed that, during preparation for visual search, spatial and feature <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> were represented additively in shared frontal, parietal, and cingulate regions. These data show that representations of spatial and feature-based search information are integrated in source regions of top-down biasing and oculomotor planning before search onset. The purpose of this anticipatory integration could lie with the generation of a “top-down salience map, ” a search template of primed target locations and features.

40|$|Although normatively {{irrelevant}} {{to the relationship between}} a cue and an outcome, outcome density (i. e. its base-rate probability) affects people’s estimation of causality. By what process causality is incorrectly estimated is of importance to an integrative theory of causal learning. A potential explanation may be that this happens because outcome density induces a judgement bias. An alternative explanation is explored here, following which the incorrect estimation of causality is grounded in the processing of cue–outcome information during learning. A first neural network simulation shows that, {{in the absence of a}} deep processing of <b>cue</b> <b>information,</b> cue–outcome relationships are acquired but causality is correctly estimated. The second simulation shows how an incorrect estimation of causality may emerge from the active processing of both cue and outcome information. In an experiment inspired by the simulations, the role of a deep processing of <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> was put to test. In addition to an outcome density manipulation, a shallow cue manipulation was introduced: <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> was either still displayed (concurrent) or no longer displayed (delayed) when outcome information was given.

40|$|Much of our real-life {{decision}} making is bounded by uncertain information, limitations in cognitive resources, {{and a lack of}} time to allocate to the decision process. It is thought that humans overcome these limitations through satisficing, fast but "good-enough" heuristic {{decision making}} that prioritizes some sources of information (cues) while ignoring others. However, the decision-making strategies we adopt under uncertainty and time pressure, for example during emergencies that demand split-second choices, are presently unknown. To characterize these decision strategies quantitatively, the present study examined how people solve a novel multicue probabilistic classification task under varying time pressure, by tracking shifts in decision strategies using variational Bayesian inference. We found that under low time pressure, participants correctly weighted and integrated all available cues to arrive at near-optimal decisions. With increasingly demanding, subsecond time pressures, however, participants systematically discounted a subset of the <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> by dropping the least informative cue(s) from their decision making process. Thus, the human cognitive apparatus copes with uncertainty and severe time pressure by adopting a "drop-the-worst" cue decision making strategy that minimizes cognitive time and effort investment while preserving the consideration of the most diagnostic <b>cue</b> <b>information,</b> thus maintaining "good-enough" accuracy. This advance in our understanding of satisficing strategies could form the basis of predicting human choices in high time pressure scenarios. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of {{concurrent}} {{task and}} modality switching effects have to date been studied {{under conditions of}} uni-modal stimulus presentation. As such, {{it is difficult to}} directly compare resultant task and modality switching effects, as the stimuli afford both tasks on each trial, but only one modality. The current study investigated task and modality switching using bi-modal and bivalent stimulus presentation under various cue conditions: no cue, either task or modality (single cue) or task and modality (double cue), with participants responding to either the identity or the position of an audio–visual stimulus at each trial. In line with previous research, task and modality switching effects showed sub-additive patterns, with switching costs decreasing as pre-stimulus <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> increased. The current data also showed that modality switching costs were more malleable than task switching costs as the former were eliminated when full and single <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> was provided, as well as when participants responded to the more efficiently processed task (position relative to identity). Conversely, task switching costs were only eliminated in the full cue condition, but were present for both tasks and both modalities despite a similar asymmetry in efficiency (vision relative to audition). The data further show that the specific task-modality combination being responded to impacted on combined task- and modality switching effects, with those combinations leading to either the greatest or lowest costs contributing most heavily to sub-additivity...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge about cue {{polarity}} (i. e., {{the sign}} of a cue–criterion relation) seems to boost performance {{in a wide range of}} inference tasks. Knowledge about <b>cue</b> polarity <b>information</b> may enhance performance by increasing (1) the reliance on rule- relative to similarity-based strategies, and (2) explicit knowledge about the relative importance of cues. We investigated the relative contribution of these two mechanisms in a multiple-cue judgment task and a categorization task, which typically differ in the inference strategies they elicit and potentially the explicit task knowledge available to participants. In both tasks participants preferred rule-based relative to similarity-based strategies and had more knowledge about cue importance when <b>cue</b> polarity <b>information</b> was provided. Strategy selection was not related to increases in performance in the categorization task and could only partly explain increases in performance in the judgment task. In contrast, explicit knowledge about the importance of cues was related to better performance in both categorization and judgment independently of the strategy used.

40|$|The {{ability to}} engage in {{appropriate}} social interaction is {{a critical component of}} daily life that requires integration of multiple neural processes and can be perturbed in numerous psychiatric diseases (Adolphs et al. 2003; Frith et al. 2008). One approach to begin understanding how the brain supports a complex array of social behaviors is to study innate, evolutionarily conserved social behaviors. Observational fear learning is one such social behavior that offers a distinct advantage for survival and is thus highly conserved across various species including rodents (Heyes et al. 1990; Kavaliers et al. 2001), monkeys (Mineka et al. 1984), and humans (Olsson et al. 2007). The data presented in this thesis combines in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, and rodent behavior in order to answer a number of questions {{about the role of the}} anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in observational fear learning. We show that both the ACC and the BLA contain neurons that show conditioned responses to the cue and are therefore neural correlates of observational fear learning. We photo-identify neurons within the ACC-BLA network and show that the ACC-BLA network has an enhanced representation of <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> when compared to out of network neurons. In addition, we show that ACC neurons that project to the BLA encode <b>cue</b> <b>information.</b> Next, we inhibit ACC input to the BLA during the cue and show that this impairs observational learning but not classical fear conditioning. Further, inhibition of ACC input to the BLA changes the cue response of a subset of BLA neurons. Lastly, we show that ACC input to the BLA is necessary for normal social interaction. Together, this data provides the first circuit level analysis of observational fear learning. It establishes that the transfer of <b>cue</b> <b>information</b> from the ACC to the BLA plays a causal role in enabling observational learning and that this same input is needed for general social behavior. by Stephen Azariah Alisop.

The current study explored the effects of instructed strategy training on improving cognitive control functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Event-related fMRI was used to test whether effects of such training were associated with changes in brain activity dynamics during task performance. Patients with schizophrenia (N[*]=[*] 22) performed the AX-CPT cognitive control task in two-sessions, with the first occurring pre-training and second following strategy training. The training protocol emphasized direct encoding of contextual cues and updating response selection goals in accordance with <b>cue</b> <b>information.</b> A matched group of healthy controls (N[*]=[*] 14) underwent the same protocol but were only scanned in the pre-training session. In the pre-training session, patients exhibited behavioral evidence of impaired utilization of contextual <b>cue</b> <b>information,</b> along with reduced cue-related activity – but increased activation during probe and response periods – in a network of regions associated with cognitive control, centered on the lateral PFC. Following training, this pattern of activation dynamics significantly shifted, normalizing towards the pattern observed in controls.
