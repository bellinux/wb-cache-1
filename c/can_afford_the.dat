5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Antananarivo {{is the largest}} and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is {{reflected}} in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium. Concerts and night clubs are attended mainly by young people of the middle to upper classes who <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> entrance fees. More affordable are performances of traditional vakindrazana or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and hira gasy at the city's outdoor cheminots theater or Alliance française; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth. Nightlife is the most animated in the ville moyenne neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina and Andohalo.|$|E

25|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies and}} loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods {{to avoid paying}} taxes. Lawmakers then attempt to close the loopholes with additional legislation. That leads to a vicious cycle of ever more complex avoidance strategies and legislation. The vicious cycle tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> professional fees that come with ever more sophisticated tax planning, thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive.|$|E

25|$|Skyscrapers {{are rarely}} seen in small cities {{and they are}} {{characteristic}} of large cities, because of the critical importance of high land prices {{for the construction of}} skyscrapers. Usually only office, commercial and hotel users <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> rents in the city center and thus most tenants of skyscrapers are of these classes. Some skyscrapers have been built in areas where the bedrock is near surface, because this makes constructing the foundation cheaper, for example this is the case in Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan, in New York City, but not in-between these two parts of the city.|$|E
25|$|There is wide {{disparity}} between the facilities enjoyed by the national team and the regional ones. This makes the regional players far from finished products when they are called to represent their country, preventing a huge country like India from having adequate reserve strength in the national squad when key players are injured or retire. Also, the regional cricket boards depend on the BCCI for hand-outs of funds for infrastructure and grassroots development. The players who are entrenched at the top have strong backing from sports management firms and also <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> best in personal trainers, physiotherapists and technical consultants, which are well {{beyond the scope of}} the average player.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{marriage}}s in Comoros, the Mna dabo (little marriage) and the ada (grand marriage). The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride price is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> ada, or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bride price. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride’s family typically pays only a third of that of the groom’s. The grand wedding can cost up to £55,000. Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.|$|E

25|$|As to {{maintain}} a fair competitive field on consoles, Blizzard has spoken out {{against the use of}} input converters that would allow console players to use keyboard/mouse controllers, believing this gives an advantage to players that <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> converter. Some players have also criticized the ability to use these converters, as players with them often populate the top of the competitive ranking ladders. Though Blizzard has appealed to Sony and Microsoft to either prevent such converters, or to detect when such converters are used as to be able to segregate players into servers based on this, disabled players have spoken out against such action, as many need to use such converters to play the game on consoles lacking the ability to use a normal controller.|$|E
25|$|Aggressiveness also {{arises from}} a need of space. Young pike {{tend to have}} their food robbed by larger pike. Pike are {{aggressive}} if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as sit-and-wait. Unlike species such as perch, pike undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, {{a fair amount of}} inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the pike, the larger the area controlled by that particular pike. An inverse relation to vegetation density and pike size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest pike. This makes sense, as the smaller pike need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large pike do not have this worry and <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> luxury of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.|$|E
25|$|Upper Canada College is Canada's wealthiest {{independent}} school, {{having an}} endowment {{of more than}} $40 million (CAD). As of 2013, tuition fees range from $29,150 to $32,150 CAD (not including a $8,500 initial registration fee, books and uniform) for day-boy students and $52,010 to $58,510 for boarding (not including a $5,000 initial registration fee). An additional $500 technology fee is levied on {{all students in the}} Upper School, which covers the costs of a MacBook Air laptop computer, the associated software, and technological support. According to the school, less than 2% of the Canadian population <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> full cost of attending the school. The institution has strict admissions standards, accepting approximately 25% of all applicants. The college began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to obtain $100 million for scholarships; a donation of $11 million was received, the largest single gift in Canadian independent school history. In 2013, UCC disbursed $3.7 million in financial aid to its students. Only students in grade five and above are eligible for this assistance. 15% of students at UCC receive financial assistance. The school plans to increase this to 20% in 2015.|$|E

She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting, but dressed only as a man for male clients, never letting them know she is a woman. She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house, but before she can get to know her, Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana.

500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] see what we <b>can</b> <b>afford.</b> <b>The</b> film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chemotherapy {{and other}} {{medications}} dispensed in a physician's office are reimbursed {{according to the}} Average Sales Price, a number computed by taking the total dollar sales of a drug as the numerator {{and the number of}} units sold nationwide as the denominator. The current reimbursement formula is known as [...] "ASP+6" [...] since it reimburses physicians at 106% of the ASP of drugs. Pharmaceutical company discounts and rebates are included in the calculation of ASP, and tend to reduce it. In addition, Medicare pays 80% of ASP+6, which is the equivalent of 84.8% of the actual average cost of the drug. Some patients have supplemental insurance or <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> co-pay. Large numbers do not.

2500|$|There {{are other}} {{official}} rules of admission in certain top high schools. If a prestigious {{senior high school}} wants to admit 800 students a year, the admissions office ranks students’ scores from highest to lowest and then selects their first 700 students. The other 100 positions are provided to students who don't meet the requirement standard but still want to study at that school. [...] These prospects need to pay extra school fees. A student can’t perform badly in zhongkao, if their scores {{are close to the}} requirement standard, they could still study in that top school if they <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> expenses. Those who study in that high school must also place maximum 2 points below the standard requirement. Usually, 0.5 points is a standard. For instance, if you are 2 points below the standard requirement, you pay four times as much as the student who gets 0.5 points below the standard requirement. The admissions of the 100 students which are required to pay the school fees usually do not get the same admission letters as normal students receive, but they can still study and live with normal students in the same high school with the same teacher.|$|E
