5|$|If was a digest-sized {{magazine}} {{throughout its}} life. It began at 164 pages {{and with only}} the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The page count increased again to 134 pages with the July 1959 issue, and to 164 pages with the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The page count was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and to 164 for the very last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using <b>card</b> <b>stock</b> for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{commercial}} domino {{sets are}} usually made of synthetic materials, such as ABS or polystyrene plastics, or Bakelite and other phenolic resins; many sets approximate {{the look and}} feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of <b>card</b> <b>stock</b> like that for playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.|$|E

50|$|In the beginning, {{each player}} is dealt six cards, {{and the rest}} of the <b>cards</b> form the <b>stock.</b> As long as there are <b>cards</b> in the <b>stock,</b> each player takes a <b>card</b> from the <b>stock</b> after playing to a trick, so that there are six cards in both hands. As long as there are <b>cards</b> in the <b>stock,</b> the players do not need to follow suit, ruff or beat the high card.|$|R

2500|$|By the mid-1880s, Barber {{was back}} in DeKalb, where he {{produced}} his first architectural designs working for his brother's construction firm, Barber and Boardman, Contractors and Builders. [...] In 1887 or early 1888, Barber published The Cottage Souvenir, crudely produced on punched <b>card</b> <b>stock</b> and tied together {{with a piece of}} yarn, which contained 14 house plans (a revised edition published shortly afterward contained 18). [...] The earliest buildings constructed from Barber's designs include the Charles E. Bradt House (1887) and the Congregational Church (1888), both in DeKalb. [...] The Bradt house was featured in the March 1888 issue of Carpentry and Building.|$|E
50|$|If {{the player}} {{does not want}} the choice card then the card will be placed on {{discarded}} pile. The discarded pile will slowly build up while the <b>stock</b> <b>cards</b> will slowly goes down as the game progresses. If <b>stock</b> <b>card</b> is finished then all the discarded cards will be gathered and shuffled and kept face down to form <b>stock</b> <b>card</b> again.|$|R

2500|$|These shahivki {{were printed}} on {{perforated}} 11 ½ <b>card</b> <b>stock,</b> {{due to a}} shortage of metals needed for the war effort at the time. Each currency stamp was inscribed on the reverse with a tryzub (trident) and with some words stating that these shahivki circulate in lieu of coins {{and that they are}} prohibited to be used as stamps. However, they do appear on some postal envelopes as there was an acute deficiency of [...] "true" [...] stamps. Nevertheless, on July 18, 1918, the independent Ukrainian government authorized its first set of stamp issues, also called shahivki and having nearly identical designs.|$|E
2500|$|Twelve core modules provide {{representations}} of nearly every troop type, vehicle, and weapon to see combat action from any nationality involved in World War II.

50|$|What {{makes this}} {{different}} from Calculation {{is how the}} <b>cards</b> in the <b>stock</b> are dealt. There is no tableau to place the <b>cards</b> from the <b>stock.</b> Instead, there is a wastepile where <b>cards</b> from the <b>stock</b> are placed. <b>Cards</b> from the <b>stock</b> are laid {{one at a time}} to the wastepile and can be placed on the foundations if possible and/or necessary. Only the top card of the wastepile is available for play and once the stock has run out, the cards on the wastepile are turned over and become the stock. This conversion from leftover cards on the wastepile to stock can be done twice in the game.|$|R
50|$|Play {{starts with}} the dealer and {{proceeds}} counterclockwise. The player takes a card that was dealt to them and matches suit with a card {{that is on the}} table. If there isn't a matching card, the player discards a card {{to the center of the}} table. Then, the top <b>stock</b> <b>card</b> is turned face up, and if there is a matching suit on the playing field, the player takes the <b>cards,</b> otherwise the <b>stock</b> <b>card</b> is added to the playing field.|$|R
5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{cards are}} kept face down {{to form a}} stack.

5000|$|In the U.S., <b>card</b> <b>stock</b> {{thickness}} {{is usually}} measured in points or mils; {{the thickness of}} the sheet in thousandths of an inch. For example, a 10 pt. card is 0.010 in thick (roughly corresponding to a weight of 250 g/m2); 12 pt. is 0.012 in. The U.S. <b>Card</b> <b>Stock</b> Thickness Point size is 0.001" [...] - {{not to be confused with}} typographical point size, where 1 point = 1/ 12 traditional pica = exactly 0.01383 inch = 0.35136 mm. Paper sizes using the ISO system are often used for <b>card</b> <b>stock.</b> <b>Card</b> <b>stock</b> sizes can be labeled as A3 (420 &times; 297 mm or 16.5 &times; 11.7 in) referencing the ISO Standard system, instead of using the physical dimensions to describe its size.|$|E

5000|$|When a card {{leaves from}} either Row 1 or 2, the space it leaves behind must {{be filled with}} any card from the row {{immediately}} below it, not necessarily the one immediately below the space. The space, in essence, is pushed downwards until it reaches Row 4 (the [...] "People Row"), where {{it is filled with}} a <b>card</b> from the <b>stock.</b> This is the only way <b>cards</b> from the <b>stock</b> enter the game. Furthermore, <b>cards</b> from the <b>stock</b> cannot be played directly to the foundations. If no more spaces appear in Row 4 with cards still undealt from the stock, the game is lost.|$|R
