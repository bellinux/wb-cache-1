He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At the snap, quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, <b>catching</b> <b>the</b> Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
