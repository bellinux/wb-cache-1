To accomplish that, a set of attributes of the product that enters the system as a new order is selected, to characterise the case.

40|$|Drilling riser {{systems are}} {{subjected}} to hydrodynamic loads from vessel motions, waves, steady currents and vortex-induced motions. This necessitates a proper structural analysis during the design phase using techniques such as finite element analysis (FEA). Common approaches within the FEA packages approximate the individual components including BOP/LMRP (Blow-Out Preventer/Lower Marine Riser Package), subsea tree and wellhead using 2 D or 3 D beam/pipe elements with approximated effective mass and damping coefficients. Predicted system response can be very sensitive to the mass, hydrodynamic added mass and drag of the large LMRP/BOP/Tree components above the wellhead. In the past, gross conservative estimates on the hydrodynamic coefficients were made and despite this, design criteria were generally met. With the advent of large sixth-generation BOP stacks {{with the possibility of}} additional <b>capping</b> <b>stacks,</b> such approximations are no longer acceptable. Therefore, the possibility of relying on the more detailed capability of computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis for a better calculation of these coefficients is investigated. In this paper, we describe a detailed model developed for a 38 : 1 scaled down BOP and discuss the subsequent predictions of the hydrodynamic coefficients. The model output is compared against the data from the concurrent tests conducted in an experimental tow tank. The comparison demonstrates that computational FSI can be an effective and accurate tool for calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients of complex structures like BOPs...|$|R

50|$|On July 22, Adm. Thad Allen faced a {{difficult}} decision. Forecasts {{of the track}} of tropical storm Bonnie made it imperative that the support ships and rigs leave the site. The <b>capping</b> <b>stack</b> would thus be unsupervised for several days. The safe option {{would have been to}} open the valves and relieve pressure in the riser; however, that would obviously have the effect of turning back on the gush of oil and gas, with no option to either collect it or burn it off. Allen, in consultation with Energy Secretary Steven Chu, made the decision to leave the valves closed. Kent Wells, a senior vice president of BP, said “We have enough confidence to leave the well shut in.” Since the storm proved weaker than expected on July 24, the ships returned to finish off the job once and for all.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{available}} published data (2005 – 2014) describing {{the prevalence of}} multimorbidity in adult patients with pneumococcal disease, {{with a focus on}} the comorbidities considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the risk of pneumococcal disease in adults (immunocompetent persons with chronic medical conditions (at risk) and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed persons (high risk)). An analysis of case–control and population-based surveillance studies that have evaluated risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was also performed in order to estimate the importance of risk stacking. Methods: Studies that established the enrolment procedure for patients and reported the incidence of multimorbidity and risk factors for CAP and/or IPD were included. In order to obtain a risk stacking value based on the at-risk comorbidity odds ratios (OR), the multiplicative method described by Campbell was used. Results: Thirty-eight articles were selected, 19 for multimorbidity and 19 for risk factors for CAP/IPD. With regard to multimorbidity, the prevalence among adults aged ≥ 65 years ranged from 23 % to 98. 7 % for two or more comorbidities and from 18 % to 89. 7 % for three or more comorbidities. Diabetes (DBT), chronic heart disease (CHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the three most frequent comorbidities described (7. 6 – 28. 5 %, 6. 9 – 25. 8 %, and 3. 8 – 15. 4 %, respectively). With regard to risk factors, based on the multiplicative method, the hypothetical scenario of concurrence of the three most frequent at-risk conditions (DBT + CHD + COPD) showed an OR of ≥ 7. 5. In this group of patients, the addition of smoking, another common at-risk factor for <b>CAP</b> (<b>stacking</b> four concurrent conditions) increased the OR from 8. 5 to > 40. These ORs were generally similar to rates described by other authors in persons with a high risk. Conclusions: The ORs for CAP and IPD of patients with two or more comorbidities, with or without smoking, were found to be similar to the ORs for CAP and IPD described in the literature for patients currently classified as high risk. The potential impact of multiple, stacking comorbidities is underestimated and {{there is a need for}} the risk categories for pneumococcal disease to be redefined...|$|R

40|$|Helices are an {{essential}} element in defining the three-dimensional architecture of structured RNAs. While internal basepairs in a canonical helix stack on both sides, {{the ends of the}} helix stack on only one side and are exposed to the loop side, thus susceptible to fraying unless they are protected. While coaxial stacking has long been known to stabilize helix ends by directly stacking two canonical helices coaxially, based on analysis of helix-loop junctions in RNA crystal structures, herein we describe helix <b>capping,</b> topological <b>stacking</b> of a helix end with a basepair or an unpaired nucleotide from the loop side, which in turn protects helix ends. Beyond the topological protection of helix ends against fraying, helix capping should confer greater stability onto the resulting composite helices. Our analysis also reveals that this general motif is associated with the formation of tertiary structure interactions. Greater knowledge about the dynamics at the helix-junctions in the secondary structure should enhance the prediction of RNA secondary structure with a richer set of energetic rules and help better understand the folding of a secondary structure into its three-dimensional structure. These together suggest tha...|$|R
40|$|One {{environmental}} concern from the mining and milling of uranium is the byproduct called Uranium Mill Tailings (UMT), {{which are the}} residues remaining after the extraction of uranium from ore in the earth’s crust. The principle concerns with uranium mill tailings are the release of radon and the potential contamination of surface and ground water from the closed or abandoned UMT stacks. These environmental impacts {{have led to the}} Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) and to investigations of remediation technologies for the UMT stacks. Remediation technologies range from physical remediation by <b>capping</b> the <b>stacks</b> with clay to potential application of biotechnologies. Biotransformation of trace metals in the environment has been demonstrated by processes such as mobilization by oxidation and reduction reactions, biosorption, and hyperaccumulation. Potential remediation strategies applicable to UMT include: microbial reduction of radium sulfate (insoluble) to radium sulfide (soluble), leaching and subsequent microbial oxidation or biosorption as a means to concentrate the radioactive material. Phytoremediation utilizes plants for in-situ hyperaccumulation of radionuclides, followed by harvesting of biomass as a means of limiting radon emission.

We have examined the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase-induced membranes in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In this yeast, increased levels of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMG-CoA reductase isozyme encoded by HMG 1 induced several types of membranes, including karmellae, which formed a <b>cap</b> of <b>stacked</b> membranes that partially surrounded the nucleus. When expression of HMG 1 was repressed, the karmellae detached from the nucleus and formed concentric, multilayered membrane whorls that were then degraded. During the degradation process, CDCFDA-stained compartments distinct from preexisting vacuoles formed within {{the interior of the}} whorls. In addition to these compartments, particles that contained neutral lipids also formed within the whorl. As the thickness of the whorl decreased, the lipid particle became larger. When degradation was complete, only the lipid particle remained. Cycloheximide treatment did not prevent the formation of whorls. Thus, new protein synthesis was not needed for the initial stages of karmellae degradation. On the contrary, cycloheximide promoted the detachment of karmellae to form whorls, suggesting that a short lived protein may be involved in maintaining karmellae integrity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that karmellae membranes differentiated into self-degradative organelles. This process may be a common pathway by which ER membranes are turned over in cells...|$|R

40|$|The recent Ordinance of the Gallipoli Harbour Office and the Coast Guards {{with the}} {{consequent}} interdiction for any activities along more than 50 km of the Adriatic Salento coasts brought the widespread instability processes {{to the attention}} of the public opinion. The coastal morphology is characterized by vertical rock cliffs, locally with overhanging blocks, articulated in <b>caps</b> and promontories, <b>stacks,</b> inlets and beaches. The evolution of the coastal morphology of the Southern Apulian coasts is mainly related to the rock mass movements, erosion and weathering phenomena due to the abrasive action of the marine spray and the wave action at the cliff foots. A predisposing factor of the instability processes of the cliffs is represented by the outcropping geological formations made of poorly cemented Pleistocenic calcarenites and by the presence of ancient coastal quarries. The instability processes are represented by rock falls, block slidings and toppling. This paper is aimed at exploring the different causes that promote the instability processes and the possible landsliding kinematics, also by means of numerical modelling techniques. The knowledge of the cliff behavior may provide a valuable support for predicting the possible failure occurrence and modeling the coastal morphological evolution...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate (cAMP) signaling through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a ubiquitous mammalian signaling pathway involved in metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell death. While the PKA catalytic (C) subunit {{has served as}} a prototype for the protein kinase superfamily, the regulatory (R) subunit defines the mechanism whereby cAMP translates an extracellular signal into an intracellular biological response. This dissertation investigates three major areas of PKA research: 1) defining the molecular features that govern RIalpha:C complex formation as a means to understand the allosteric regulation of cAMP-induced PKA activation; 2) elucidating the molecular rules that govern substrate recognition; and 3) understanding the molecular basis for isoform-specific activation by cAMP derivatives. A structure of a PKA RIalpha:C holoenzyme was solved with a RIalpha deletion mutant that contains both cAMP binding domains. This structure revealed the extraordinary conformational range that the R-subunit can adopt as it toggles between binding the C-subunit and cAMP. Mutational analysis explains how Domain B is a "gate-keeper" for Domain A. A critical salt bridge links the two hydrophobic <b>capping</b> residues that <b>stack</b> against cAMP (for Domains A and B), such that binding of cAMP to Domain B can release the capping residue for Domain A. Small angle X-ray analysis of various mutant RIalpha-subunits revealed that Domain B is also highly dynamic. Dissection of the inhibitor sites from both cAMP binding domains shows that binding is only preserved for RII subunits. The differences observed between the RI and RII subunits suggest why the RII subunits, but not RI, can bind to the C-subunit in the absence of ATP. A crystal structure of a complex between PKA and a specific substrate, phospholamban, was solved, revealing an overall common docking mode as the protein inhibitors at this site. Peptide array methods, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical analysis combined defines a unique consensus substrate recognition motif for PKA substrates as R-Xy-R-R -X-S/T-hydro, where y is 0 - 4 residues. Finally, the crystal structure of RIalpha bound to a cAMP analog, HE- 33, was solved, revealing the structural basis of how cAMP analogs result in selective activation of Type Ialpha versus Type IIbeta isoforms...|$|R
