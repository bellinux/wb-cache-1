40|$|This paper {{reports about}} {{our use of}} model {{versioning}} mechanisms in the industrial project ConfNet. The ConfNet software is used to organize sessions and talks for medical conferences. In these medical conferences, the presenters come with PowerPoint files on USB memory sticks. The technical team checks the PowerPoint files for external references e. g. to images or videos and converts each presentation to a ppsx file. ppsx files are self contained and PowerPoint opens them in presentation mode directly. Presentations happen in parallel sessions in different rooms, cf. Fig. 1. For each session, ConfNet provides an HTML page listing the talks. This HTML page is shown in full screen mode. By <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> a <b>talk,</b> the corresponding PowerPoint presentation is opened (directly in presentation mode) and after the talk we fall back to the session overview page.

50|$|The {{characters}} are {{the stars in}} your movie. You can make your characters move just by selecting him or her and using tools in the movement tab to move your character around the background. You can also make your character do a certain action, such as cry, run, laugh, walk, or fall backwards. The action tab has a list of available actions you can use for your character instead of just simply moving your character around. You can also make your characters talk. To do this, <b>click</b> <b>on</b> the <b>talk</b> tab, and then select what you want your character to say by <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> it. There's three sections in the talk tab. The first one is hellos. This one is pretty self explanatory. You can make your character say hello to other characters or towards the audience (by breaking the 4th wall). The second one is goodbyes. This one is also pretty self explanatory. You can make your character say goodbye to other characters or towards the audience (again by breaking the 4th wall). The last one is sayings. This section is dedicated {{to a list of}} lines that your character can say towards other characters or towards the audience (yet again by breaking the 4th wall). You can also make your character cry, laugh, throw a tantrum, or make other sounds. Unfortunately, each character only has a limited amount of lines that you can use. Luckily, there is an option to record your own voice if you have a microphone. Sadly, you can only record 10 seconds of your own voice. Just select the character and say something short. You can further extend it by recording your voice over and over again. You can try to do voice impressions as well for your characters so you can sound like the characters and make them say whatever they want.|$|R
