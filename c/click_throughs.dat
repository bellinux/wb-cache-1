40|$|How to make online {{advertising}} more effective. Five studies by ARF, IAB, C|Net. com, MSN and DoubleClick all concluded that {{online advertising}} builds the brand (Briggs, 2001, v. 1 no 3). Companies will find, however, {{that the degree}} to which online advertising improves metrics such as brand awareness, purchase probability and brand perceptions will vary based on the size, placement and format of the ad. Below we will discuss different sizes and formats of online advertising and how the returns from an online advertising budget can be improved. Before a company can determine how to increase the ROI from online advertising, it must determine the goals for its online advertising. This is necessary because online advertising serves different purposes. Online ads can help to increase brand awareness, brand perception and click through rates, while they can also help to increase conversion rates, or {{the number of people that}} go to a Web site and actually purchase a product. For an online publication that is concerned with ROI, an increase in <b>click</b> <b>throughs</b> and page views may be the most important performance metric, while a company such as IBM may simply want to increase the number of people that believe it is a technology leader. When an online ad increases one of these performance metrics, it is considered effective. Ad size. As you might expect, larger ads help to improve branding metrics. On average, an improvement of 40 % (for single ad exposure) can be seen in the Skyscraper (160 x 600 pixels...|$|E

40|$|Recency ranking {{refers to}} the ranking of web results by {{accounting}} for both relevance and freshness. This is particularly important for “recency sensitive ” queries such as breaking news queries. In this study, we propose a set of novel click features to improve machine learned recency ranking. Rather than computing simple aggregate <b>click</b> <b>through</b> rates, we derive these features using the temporal <b>click</b> <b>through</b> data and query reformulation chains. One of the features that we use is click buzz that captures the spiking interest of a url for a query. We also propose time weighted <b>click</b> <b>through</b> rates which treat recent observations as being exponentially more important. The promotion of fresh content is typically determined by the query intent which can change dynamically over time. Quite often users query reformulations convey clues about the query’s intent. Hence we enrich our click features by following query reformulations which typically benefit the first query {{in the chain of}} reformulations. Our experiments show these novel features can improve the NDCG 5 of a major online search engine’s ranking for “recency sensitive ” queries by up to 1. 57 %. This is {{one of the very few}} studies that exploits temporal <b>click</b> <b>through</b> data and query reformulations for recency ranking...|$|R

40|$|Computational Advertising is the {{currently}} emerging multidimensional statistical modeling sub-discipline in digital advertising industry. Web pages visited per user {{every day is}} considerably increasing, resulting in an enormous access to display advertisements (ads). The {{rate at which the}} ad is clicked by users is termed as the <b>Click</b> <b>Through</b> Rate (CTR) of an advertisement. This metric facilitates the measurement of the effectiveness of an advertisement. The placement of ads in appropriate location leads to the rise in the CTR value that influences the growth of customer access to advertisement resulting in increased profit rate for the ad exchange, publishers and advertisers. Thus it is imperative to predict the CTR metric in order to formulate an efficient ad placement strategy. This paper proposes a predictive model that generates the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> rate based on different dimensions of ad placement for display advertisements using statistical machine learning regression techniques such as multivariate linear regression (LR), poisson regression (PR) and support vector regression(SVR). The experiment result reports that SVR based click model outperforms in predicting CTR through hyperparameter optimization.
