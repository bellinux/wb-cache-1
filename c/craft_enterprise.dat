In the sector structured European Union, the abovementioned stand for 80 – 95 % of the existing companies and moreover, they generate the biggest number of job positions and the national income. The article focuses on a selected part of SME sector: craft enterprises and especially, on ﬁnancing their activities. This ﬁnancing relates to both, ﬁnancing craft businesses’ investments and their current operations. In the ﬁrst part of the text one presents a literary query concerning the deﬁnition of a <b>craft</b> <b>enterprise</b> and the resulting from its characteristic functioning: conception and tools for ﬁnancing investments and current operations of craft enterprises. In the second part, one demonstrates the results of researches on the conception and the tools for ﬁnancing craft enterprises functioning on the Polish market. In the summary of the article one demonstrates conclusions concerning the ways of maintenance and (in many cases innovative) changes of the conception and the tools for ﬁnancing craft enterprises. The element congruous with the basic topic of the article relating to the current functioning of a <b>craft</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the real environment (both: inner and outer one), is its functioning in the digital surrounding (including {{with regard to the}} conception of ﬁnancing activities), which correlates with the dynamic development of ICT technologies.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{involves}} {{an examination of}} the internationalisation process of the smaller firm, focusing on the <b>craft</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Craft sector analysis was carried out in order to determine historical precedents as well as to assist in the identification of industry and firm level factors impinging upon domestic and export market behaviour. A range of internationalisation theories are discussed, with the conclusion that the majority of these frameworks fail to readily explain smaller firm exporting behaviour. More recent developments such as the born global firm, the instant international and networking for internationalisation are deemed more appropriate fits for smaller firm internationalisation research. Quantitative results identify the majority of craft firms as microenterprises with almost one half operating as a single person business. Qualitative analysis enabled profiling of craft firm types to be carried out. Four orientations are uncovered: the entrepreneur, the idealist, the lifestyler and the latecomer. A composite framework of the factors uncovered in the analysis is constructed in order to better explain the process of smaller firm internationalisa-tion...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. Many {{believe that}} small and medium natural resource-based {{enterprises}} (NRBEs) provide a vision to reduce {{poverty in the}} Third World’s rural communities and households. As a result, new rural enterprises should be created and existing ones reinforced within a framework of sustainable livelihoods that target all appropriate members in the communities. This study investigates {{the impact of the}} natural resource based enterprises income on the rural livelihoods in the households using a rural natural-based <b>craft</b> <b>enterprise</b> (using reeds, Cyperus spp, as raw material), as a case study, Ikhowe <b>Craft</b> <b>Enterprise,</b> situated in small town called Eshowe in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa [...] In designing this study, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative research methods was employed. This was influenced by the aim and the type of data required for the study. The said methods were (a) semi-structured interviews for producers (a questionnaire had a pre-determined mix set of both open-ended and closed-ended questions); (b) interviews for management were conducted with a purely qualitative questionnaire which consisted of only structured and open-ended questions; (c) field observations, and (d) a review of secondary materials (administrative records). Apart from how derived income impacts on the participants, data required also included performance of the enterprise, access to markets, support available, and livelihood analysis of the participants households which included issues such as households’ economies and exploring extent of, and reasons for diversification, and challenges both the enterprise and participants’ households face daily in relation to making a living. The results show that there was a significant increase in business annual turnover and producers’ earnings between 2003 and 2005. In 2003, about 50 % of the producers earned less than R 1000 per year, while in 2005 only 3 % earned less than R 1000 per year. Despite the total annual increase of earnings and the significant contribution of craft income to producers’ households’ incomes, individual earnings varied considerably amongst the producers and as a result the economic impact was also variable. Other than craft, strategies such as government grants enhanced livelihood diversification in the case study. However, lack of understanding of basic business principles and skills amongst both the crafters and management posed threats to the sustainability of the enterprise. The income derived from the NRBE activity, especially since it is based on natural resources with low economic value (reeds) was found to have both diversifying and supplementing effects on different producers’ other strategies. Although, the enterprise is achieving growth, there is a concern and a need to measure the future sustainability of the enterprise. In addition {{there is a need to}} improve the producers’ basic business skills and business management competenc...|$|E

This research considers the benefit of combining these three tools in a series of interventions with participants from Kutloano Papermaking and Thabong township of Welkom, Free State Province, South Africa. This project emerges out of a multi-year research activity, Cultural Action for Change: a Ford Foundation-funded project investigating the role of visual arts and social change. The partnership between the University of Johannesburg, Artist Proof Studio, Phumani Paper and sixteen papermaking enterprises across South Africa uses visual tools such as Paper Prayers, Photovoice and resource mapping to explore issues of health, economic development and creativity.

40|$|The {{economic}} structure of Germany is undergoing radical changes {{brought about by}} far-reaching alterations in the global division of labour, a weakening and modification of demand trends and by the dynamics of technological and organizational innovation. These structural changes affect the <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> as well. In the past <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> mastered these challenges in the competition, {{in the market and}} in the technology. Moreover, the <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> are responsible for many innovative products, processes and services {{as well as for the}} preservation of jobs and the creation of a large number of new jobs. The aim of our research was to find out <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> which have successfully mastered these challenges within the last years. Furthermore it is important to know something about the problems enterprises had with the adjustment to the structural changes. Discovering and analysing the weaknesses is the necessary condition to remove these weaknesses and to be successful on the markets in the future. Especially innovative enterprises are expected to have competitive advantages in opposition to enterprises that are not innovative. The paper is based on an empirical survey of 133 <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the area of the Chamber of Handicrafts Reutlingen, a mainly rural region within Baden-Wuerttemberg. The <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> in this area were examined with standardized questionnaires and interviews. The main focus in our survey was placed on variables, which describe the innovative behaviour and the information activities of the enterprises. The questionnaire included questions about process and product innovations, the product age and the three fundamental components in the strategic management of enterprises: The attitude to risk, which is proved by the choice of the growth strategy and the regional extension of sales markets. The innovative competence, i. e. the existence of activities in the areas of research and development, construction and design, business planning and staff development. The willingness to learn and the acquisition of knowledge, i. e. the employees' capability and readiness to take up know-how and to realize innovations with this know-how. The paper summarises the most significant results of the study. The examined <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> were divided into two different groups: the especially successful enterprises and the less successful enterprises. Compared with the less successful enterprises, the especially successful enterprises have a stronger attitude to risk, more innovative competences and a higher willingness to learn. The differences are also emphasized by the fact that successful enterprises formulate questions - not only at the beginning of the renewal process but during all their activities. By doing so they question about themselves and their traditional way of solving problems. They organize a permanent knowledge exchange. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of talent and rich {{cultural}} heritage that exists in Sub-Saharan Africa across {{the whole range of}} cultural activities, the majority of African nations remain largely marginal players in the cultural industries sector. Large-scale cultural enterprises are few and far between, and a large number of microenterprises operate alongside SMEs, often occupying the lower ends of the value chain and fail to attain economic viability. Numerous studies have stated the importance of the craft sector in employment and wealth creation but new research is needed to evaluate the impact of skills enhancement and enterprise development on social cohesion, community development, local identity and capacity building in the broadest sense. The available statistics focus primarily on the production and consumption of cultural goods that can be priced in the market. This perspective under-represents or completely excludes many of the cultural and social benefits. In fact the data may be said at present to be as much a process of discounting as of counting. How does the design and development of cultural enterprise promote healthier, more productive and satisfying lifestyles? The twentieth century transformed the entire planet from a finite world of certainties to an infinite world of questioning and doubt. Today it is even more necessary to cultivate connections and inter-disciplinary partnerships, for in our climate of rapid change, individuals, communities and societies can adapt to the new and transform their reality only through creative imagination and initiatives. The challenge lies in evolving a ‘bottom-up’ approach in which the objectives of the enterprise are framed through dialogue rather than unilateral, technocratic prescriptions from development agencies. Projects that do not take into account sufficiently the ‘human factor’ have a great chance of failing. Cultural enterprises stand at the crossroads between a subsidy-dependent sector and an economic sector. What are the keys to building the sustainability of these enterprises and optimizing both their economic and social benefits? This paper attempts to provide some answers to this question by examining the constraints faced, and the choices made by cultural entrepreneurs and the role played by the international community in shaping design education and <b>craft</b> <b>enterprise</b> in East and South Africa from the following perspectives: · the tension between skills acquired in the differing educational systems, cultural and physical environments and the ‘euro-centric’ educational model; · the impact and legacy of external expertise, technological aid and financial support · transforming welfare projects to viable enterprises · the centrality of building viable partnerships; · the symbiotic relationship between social, cultural and economic advancement of both the individual and the wider community...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses two {{case studies}} of small UK-based yarn {{businesses}} to explore whether <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> might make a distinctive contribution to sustainable development. The ways in which positive social, environmental and economic impacts are supported by these businesses are identified and their potential as niche sites contributing to a broader sustainability transition is considered. These businesses themselves believe there are strong links to the social dimensions of sustainability, particularly in terms of community building. There is also a distinctive contribution to economic aspects of sustainability with the outputs of <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> releasing latent financial value and attaching value associated with provenance and rarity compared to a commodity market, rather than contributing to conventional economic growth. Contributions to environmental sustainability are largely indirect, through changing the economic viability of marginal agricultural production and therefore allowing conservation management in less economically favoured areas. This preliminary analysis suggest that the smallest <b>craft</b> <b>enterprises</b> do offer insights into how a wide transition might be achieved, but realising such a transition is made more difficult by the ambitions and motivations of the individuals in the craft businesses themselves...|$|R

Finally it is intended to discuss some issues relating to the future of the craft manufacturing units, bearing in mind that not only are they vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes but also to the economic pressures which determine the ability of all firms to survive in a commercial and competitive market place...|$|R
