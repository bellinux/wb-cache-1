In June 1932, the Milky Way bar was sold as a two piece bar, but just four years later, in 1936, the chocolate and vanilla were separated. The vanilla version, with a dark chocolate coating, was called [...] "Forever Yours" [...] and it was produced until 1979.

5000|$|The candy {{is made of}} a whipped nougat filling {{covered with}} milk <b>{{chocolate}}.</b> The <b>nougat</b> <b>chocolate</b> center is first formed into very large slabs, which are cut to size, and after the centers are formed they are coated with milk chocolate through a process called [...] "enrobing" [...] wherein the centers pass through a continuous flowing vertical [...] "sheet" [...] of chocolate while, at the same time, a rotating, chocolate-covered wheel beneath the mesh belt coats {{the base of the}} bar. The bar is then cooled and prepared for wrapping. The candy is made in Chicago, Illinois; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; and Newmarket, Ontario.|$|R

5000|$|In November 2012, a new {{print and}} digital {{advertising}} campaign {{was launched in}} the US called [...] "Sorry, I was Eating a Milky Way". This campaign portrays the comical aftermath of what happens after someone (off camera) was distracted due to eating a Milky Way bar. This campaign originated from the insight that eating a Milky Way bar is a slow and involved process due to its caramel, <b>chocolate</b> and <b>nougat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>nougat</b> <b>chocolate</b> {{center is}} made by {{whipping}} egg whites until they are light and frothy. Sugar syrup is then added, stabilizing the foam and creating [...] "frappé." [...] Other flavoring ingredients are then added to the frappé to create specific flavors.|$|R
50|$|It is a cake {{filled with}} cake crumbs, <b>nougat</b> <b>{{chocolate}},</b> apricot jam and then soaked with rum. The cake is cut into 1-1/2 inch square cubes, covered with so called Punschglasur (punch icing), a thick pink rum sugar glazing often drizzled with chocolate and a cocktail cherry on top. Nowadays, {{there are also}} Punschkrapfen in cylindrical form.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nougat</b> {{filled milk}} <b>chocolates</b> were stored at {{different}} temperatures. Changes of the triglycerides compositions within <b>chocolate</b> coating and <b>nougat</b> filling were measured {{by means of}} HPLC analysis. The well-known diffusion equations {{could be applied to}} describe kinetics of migration of triolein from <b>nougat</b> into the <b>chocolate</b> layer. These kinetics may explain some practical experience and may be used in quality control of multilayer or coated chocolate products...|$|R
40|$|Fat {{migration}} {{is the main}} reason for the loss of quality of stored chocolate products. It includes the unpleasant softening of filled chocolates and the hardening of their fillings. <b>Chocolates</b> with nuts, <b>nougat,</b> marzipan or wafers often develop fat bloom because of migration of filling oils. The kinetics of fat migration and the major parameters as product geometry, diffusion constant, storage temperature and formulations are described. HPLC-analysis was used to study the diffusion of triglycerides...|$|R
5000|$|Universal Robina Corporation (URC) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} food and {{beverage}} manufacturers in the Philippines. They became famous for their instant coffee mix which catered towards Filipinos. They are also the company behind the Jack ‘n Jill brand which currently produces 26 snack products under its name. The Jack ‘n Jill products are classified into 3 categories namely Salty Snacks, Bakery, Confectionery. URC {{is one of the}} heaviest consumers of chocolate because majority of their Bakery and Confectionery snacks incorporate chocolate.  URC’s first breakthrough chocolate product was the Nips. The candy coated chocolate, similar to the famous M&M’s, which was popular among kids. This was successfully followed by multiple chocolate products such as the chocolate covered marshmallow, Wiggles; the chewy butterscotch caramel, Chooey Choco; the <b>chocolate</b> coated <b>nougat</b> bar, Cloud 9.|$|R
5000|$|Nougat ( [...] , [...] , or [...] , Azerbaijani: [...] لوکا, Persian: [...] نوقا [...] ) is {{a family}} of {{confections}} made with sugar or honey, roasted nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts are common), whipped egg whites, and sometimes chopped candied fruit. The consistency of nougat is chewy, and it is used {{in a variety of}} candy bars and <b>chocolates.</b> The word <b>nougat</b> comes from Occitan pan nogat (...) , seemingly from Latin panis nucatus 'nut bread' (the late colloquial Latin adjective nucatum means 'nutted' or 'nutty').|$|R

Desserts included a lemon tart, and dishes such as [...] "Crackling Pyramide" [...] and soufflés of chocolate served with <b>chocolate</b> sauce.

50|$|Austrian {{cakes and}} {{pastries}} are a well-known feature of its cuisine. Perhaps the most famous is the Sachertorte, a chocolate cake with apricot jam filling, traditionally eaten with whipped cream. Among the cakes with the longest tradition is the Linzer torte. Other favourites include the caramel-flavoured Dobostorte and the delicately layered Esterhazy Torte, {{named in honor of}} Prince Esterházy (both originating from Hungary during the Austro-Hungarian empire), {{as well as a number}} of cakes made with fresh fruit and cream. Punschkrapfen is a classical Austrian pastry, a cake filled with cake crumbs, <b>nougat</b> <b>chocolate,</b> apricot jam and then soaked with rum.|$|R

This includes nuts (mostly hazelnut, walnut and almond), dried fruits (apricots, figs and raisins), oranges, clementines, mandarins, pigeon apples, brændte mandler (sugarglazed almonds cooked in large open cauldrons in the streets), glazed apples on a stick, pancakes, æbleskiver, pebernødder, klejner, brun kager {{and other types of}} småkager (Danish cookies), gløgg (mulled wine) of various recipes and a variety of marzipan treats, some of which includes <b>chocolate</b> and Danish <b>nougat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Gosh all fishhooks!" [...] Ted wailed to Eunice, as they wolfed hot <b>chocolate,</b> {{lumps of}} <b>nougat,</b> and an {{assortment}} of glace nuts, in the mosaic splendor of the Royal Drug Store, [...] "it gets me why Dad doesn't just pass out from being so poky. Every evening he sits there, about half-asleep, and if Rone or I say, 'Oh, come on, let's do something,' he doesn't even take the trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says, 'Naw, this suits me right here.' He doesn't know there's any fun going on anywhere. I suppose he must do some thinking, same as you and I do, but gosh, there's no way of telling it. I don't believe that outside of the office and playing a little bum golf on Saturday he knows there's anything in the world to do except just keep sitting there-sitting there every night--not wanting to go anywhere--not wanting to do anything--thinking us kids are crazy--sitting there--Lord!" ...|$|R
40|$|Beside {{a loss in}} texture, {{the main}} quality aspect of filled {{chocolate}} products during storage {{is the development of}} fat bloom. For these products isothermal or cycling temperature storage tests are used for accelerated shelf life prediction. However, the applicability of these tests compared to real storage conditions is complicated and shelf life estimation is vague. Com; 1;paring storage tests of different authors is difficult because products and analysis methods vary. Additionally most of the storage tests are performed to identify the reasons for fat bloom and therefore the storage conditions are not separately investigated. However, all studies agree that temperature has a major impact due to its influence on migration and crystallization. While migration is accelerated at higher temperatures, crystallization shows an optimum at lower temperatures. Therefore, migration and crystal state have to be evaluated during storage, as well as fat bloom formation. In this study, cold stamped dark <b>chocolate</b> shells with <b>nougat</b> filling were chosen to compare isothermal and cycling temperature storage conditions. Cycling temperature storage at adequate levels includes optimum for fat bloom formation, but takes crystallization and migration influence in unequal account. In contrast, isothermal storage at optimum temperature leads to faster fat bloom formation...|$|R
