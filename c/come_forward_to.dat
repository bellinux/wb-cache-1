5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at the best of times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E
5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E

25|$|Father Peter Gumpel stated, on a 12 January 2016 {{documentary}} on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short it means {{that there are no}} controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification. In that same documentary, the cause's vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals' related to the healings do not <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause has stalled in the past as none have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> assist the postulation in their investigations.|$|E

25|$|In the first-round game of Australia versus Japan, Egyptian referee Essam Abd El Fatah {{awarded a}} 26th-minute goal by Shunsuke Nakamura to the Japanese despite a protest from Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Schwarzer {{appeared}} to have been impeded upon by Japanese forward Atsushi Yanagisawa as he had <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> punch the ball clear. Japanese striker Naohiro Takahara then collided with Schwarzer, leaving him unable to prevent the ball rolling into the goal.|$|E
25|$|Sportswomen of Pakistan {{have always}} been plagued by the patriarchal society and many have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> claim that coaches, {{selectors}} {{and others who are}} in position of power demand sexual favours. Sexual abuse of this kind has led some athletes to commit suicide due to inaction of authorities in pursuing the suspects. In some cases the female athletes who register the cases of sexual abuse and harassment are banned or put on probation.|$|E

25|$|Socrates says {{he never}} was a (paid) teacher; therefore, he is not {{responsible}} for the corruption of any Athenian citizen. That if he corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> bear witnesses? That if the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? In point of fact, Socrates indicates relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.|$|E

Acu-Gen claimed that their kit could predict a mixed sex set of fraternal twins, so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.|$|E

One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of death to life and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the French and Batavians had frantically been {{bringing}} up reinforcements. A French division under General Dominique Vandamme {{was brought up}} via Haarlem and occupied a line between Alkmaar and the sea. Brune directed Daendels to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> Oudkarspel and Sint Pancras. General Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau brought up two-thirds of his 2nd Batavian division in forced marches from Friesland and he arrived on September 8 {{to take on a}} position {{in the center of the}} Franco-Batavian front, around Alkmaar. He was then reinforced with the 7th Demi-brigade of Daendels' division.|$|E
25|$|The Abbasid Revolution was {{distinguished}} {{by a number}} of tactics which were absent in the other, unsuccessful anti-Umayyad rebellions at the time. Chief among them was secrecy. While the Shi'ite and other rebellions at the time were all led by publicly known leaders making clear and well-defined demands, the Abbasids hid not only their identities but also their preparation and mere existence. As-Saffah would go on to become the first Abbasid caliph, but he did not <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> receive the pledge of allegiance from the people until after the Umayyad caliph and a large number of his princes were already killed.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 Brel {{began his}} film career, {{appearing}} in André Cayatte's Les risques du métier (Risky business), co-starring Emmanuelle Riva, Jacques Harden, and Nadine Alari. Brel also produced the soundtrack with François Rauber. The film {{tells the story}} of a teenage girl who accuses her primary schoolteacher, Jean Doucet (Brel), of trying to rape her. The police and the mayor investigate, but Doucet denies the charges. Two other students <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> reveal more of Doucet's misconduct—one confessing to be his mistress. Doucet faces trial and hard labour if convicted. The film was released on 21 December 1967. Film critics praised Brel's performance.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 2013, the B.C. provincial {{government}} {{announced that the}} Hawaii Mars {{would no longer be}} placed on contract after the 2013 season, due to not having been used to fight any B.C. fires for two years and the operation of newer and more versatile aircraft by the Coulson group including a Lockheed C-130 Hercules converted to firefighting use. Although Coulson stated that the Hawaii Mars has been under numerous recent upgrades to make it safer and more reliable, no buyers have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> purchase the aircraft. Coulson also cautioned against any plans to open the aircraft as a tourist attraction because of the 2013 closure of the Flying Tankers Bomber Base Museum from poor attendance.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{witnesses}} to the murder, of whom more than 25 have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> the police. The killer was described by witnesses as a man between 30 and 50 years of age, about 180 to 185 centimetres tall, and wearing a dark jacket or coat. Many described him as having walked with a limp or otherwise clumsily. No witness {{was in a position}} to observe the killer's appearance in any detail. A police sketch of the supposed killer was widely circulated in the media a week after the murder, leading to a massive influx of tips from the public, but it was later determined that the witness on whose statement it was based probably had not seen the actual assailant. No good description of the killer's appearance therefore exists. Witnesses agreed on the killer's escape route.|$|E
