5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle {{could point}} to the falling stone, rising flames, or pouring water to {{illustrate}} his theory. His laws of motion emphasized the common observation that friction was an omnipresent phenomenon – that any body in motion would, unless acted upon, <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest.</b> He also proposed that heavier objects fall faster, and that voids were impossible.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual {{monopoly}} on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary Robert Hooke, an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> entirely on one man's shoulders. He was visited over the years by many notable individuals, such as the Russian Tsar Peter the Great. To the disappointment of his guests, van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.|$|E
25|$|Avalanches and {{avalanche}} paths {{share common}} elements: a start zone where the avalanche originates, a track along which the avalanche flows, and a runout zone where the avalanche comes to rest. The debris deposit is the accumulated {{mass of the}} avalanched snow once it has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in the runout zone. For the image at left, many small avalanches form in this avalanche path every year, {{but most of these}} avalanches do not run the full vertical or horizontal length of the path. The frequency with which avalanches form in a given area is known as the return period.|$|E
25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> (and no closer to the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E

25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E

500|$|While {{the ride}} was located at California's Great America, {{there was no}} theme for the ride. When it was {{relocated}} to Carowinds in 2004, it was built as the first Star Trek themed roller coaster in the world. It was renamed Borg Assimilator and the story was that [...] "Borg crash-landed {{in the middle of}} Carowinds and their ship – a giant gray and black sphere – has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> near the park's new flying roller coaster." [...] There was a gray and black sphere located in the pond underneath the ride that the Borg crashed in. In addition to other theming, a voice was played surrounding the ride saying Borg quotes. After Cedar Fair bought the park, all the Star Trek theming was removed and the name was changed for the 2008 season.|$|E

500|$|At 8:17 am, Missouri slid up on a shoal (or mud bar) {{and stuck}} to the ground. In a last-ditch effort to save the ship, Peckham {{sent a message to}} Brown stating [...] "Come right immediately! Twist ship!", but this effort was too little, too late; Missouri had already run aground. Her hull had {{traveled}} approximately , which was very nearly {{the entire length of the}} shoal, raising the battleship several feet out of the water, and her engines were shut down after the bay sand began to clog the battleship's intakes in engineering. She had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> on an almost even keel on the sandbar within plain sight of a number of admirals of the United States Navy stationed at Hampton Roads, and similar number of high-ranking officers of the United States Army stationed at Fort Monroe.|$|E
500|$|The name Oklahoma {{comes from}} the Choctaw phrase okla humma, {{literally}} meaning red people. It could also derive from the Dhegihan Sioux language and would translate roughly to [...] "All you Scattered, <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Rest</b> Here." [...] The main Sioux tribe that originally inhabited the state were the Ponca. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations {{with the federal government}} on the use of Indian Territory, in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language that described Native American people as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.|$|E
500|$|Investigators also {{focused on}} deicing {{practices}} at LaGuardia. They {{found that the}} airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At {{the time of the}} accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, it would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in the cold water surrounding Runway 13. The accident report, however, criticised the fact {{that the majority of the}} airplane operators in the United States relied only upon Type I fluids for protection, and they do not use Type II. The board stated that tests have shown that both Type I and Type II fluids do flow off the wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during the initial takeoff ground run.

500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E
500|$|The {{test train}} was {{traveling}} eastbound {{on the southern}} track when it entered a curve at —which was [...] above its assigned speed—causing the rear bogie of the lead power car to derail to the left (outside of curve) due to centrifugal forces. The lead power car separated {{from the rest of}} the train, and the rear of the lead power car struck the concrete parapet on the abutment to a bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal. The power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge and overturned, sliding down the embankment and coming to a rest [...] beyond the end of the bridge. Cars 2–7 derailed before the bridge and travelled off the embankment with enough speed to overshoot the canal and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> [...] beyond the beginning of the bridge. Cars 8–9 came to rest on the east bank of the canal and the rear power car ended up partially submerged in the canal. According to investigators, late braking, which led to the train entering the curve at excessive speed, was the immediate cause of the accident. Criminal and technical investigations are [...] French national rail operator SNCF suspended test trials at high speeds until the lessons learned from the investigation were integrated into testing process. The scheduled opening of the second phase of the LGV Est for commercial service was delayed three months, from 3 April 2016 to 3 July 2016.|$|E
500|$|In August 1968, the United States {{military}} sent a StarIII mini-submarine to {{the base}} to look for weapon debris, especially the uranium-235 fissile core of a secondary. A much bigger operation at Palomares {{off the coast of}} Spain two years earlier led to the recovery of a lost nuclear weapon from the Mediterranean Sea; the B28FI bomb was lost for 80days after a mid-air collision between a B-52 on a [...] "Chrome Dome" [...] mission and its KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft. Christensen asserts {{that the purpose of the}} underwater search at Thule was obvious to the Danish authorities, contrary to other reports that suggested its true purpose had been hidden from them. At lower levels, however, the dives were surrounded by some confidentiality. One document from July 1968 reads, [...] "Fact that this operation includes search for object or missing weapon part is to be treated as Confidential NOFORN", meaning it was not to be disclosed to non-US nationals. It continues, [...] "For discussion with Danes, this operation should be referred to as a survey, repeat survey of bottom under impact point." [...] Further indications of the search are apparent in a September 1968 interim report by the United States Atomic Energy Commission, which stated, [...] "It was further speculated that the missing ', in view of its ballistic characteristics, may have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> beyond the observed concentration of heavy debris." [...] This discussion was a reference to the unsuccessful search for the uranium cylinder of one of the secondaries.|$|E
