The other pipeline underneath the bridge could not be investigated because of construction and agricultural use; the end point could possibly be situated in the said irrigation zone in what is today known as the village of Aymavilles.|$|E

40|$|Piano del Tesoro at Poggio Civitate {{preserves}} {{evidence of}} the only 7 th century BCEarchitectural complex known to date in Central Italy. 1 Thus far, three buildings ofthis complex have been identified. These consist of OC 1 /Residence, an apparent-ly aristocratic household, the furnishings of which attest to the wealth of its inhabitants, OC 2 /Workshop, a large and ornately decorated multifunctional workshop, and OC 3 /Tripartite, a building whose tripartite interior division conforms to what we might expect of a religious structure of the Etruscan seventh century. All stood together on the plateau by {{the last quarter of}} the seventh century BCE. 2 Stratigraphic evidence suggests that the three buildings were destroyed in a sin-gle conflagration. 3 Although the specific causes of the fire can not be determined, evi-dence from OC 2 /Workshop suggests a sudden catastrophe. Numerous unfired <b>cover</b> <b>tiles</b> had been carefully placed on the floor to dry under the shade of the roof. As the building caught fire, either in an attempt to put out the fire or to flee from the building, those within the structure trod upon the tiles, leaving their footprints in the drying clay. 4 The fire may have begun in or near the workshop. Substantial evidence of bronze work-ing has been recovered in the vicinity and it is certainly likely that a kiln for the manu-facture of ceramics and/or architectural terracottas was located nearby.

Aufwuchs <b>covered</b> <b>tiles</b> {{were taken from the}} AIS during pre-application period (d−[*] 8). Grazers were from the same sampling as for the AIS experiment. In {{the first phase of the}} experiment, 8 aufwuchs <b>covered</b> <b>tiles</b> per treatment were placed in glass tanks (35.5 [*]×[*] 23 [*]×[*] 25.5  cm) with 3  L of modified Borgmann media. The respective LCH stock solutions were added into the tanks, and equal distribution of the substance was reached by aeration with Pasteur pipette (glass) and an air pump. The tiles remained in the tanks for 24  h to allow LCH to bind to the aufwuchs. Afterwards, the tiles were slightly dipped in unpolluted modified Borgmann media for washing and always two tiles were transferred into a glass beaker filled with 1  L of unpolluted modified Borgmann media. The beakers were placed in a water bath with a cooling unit (Compatible Control, Huber, Germany) and were aerated with Pasteur pipettes and an air pump. The exposure phase started with the introduction of 4 grazers into each beaker and was terminated after 28  days. Basic physicochemical parameters were measured weekly as in the AIS experiment. Grazer and aufwuchs analysis was performed at the end of the experiment.|$|R
