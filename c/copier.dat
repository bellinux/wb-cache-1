25|$|The laser printer, {{based on}} a {{modified}} xerographic <b>copier,</b> was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who had a fully functional networked printer system working by 1971. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox.|$|E
50|$|In 1990's Konica signed {{its first}} major {{contract}} with Los Angeles County providing leasing of <b>copiers</b> to the Los Angeles Superior Court.

The County initial order of 250 <b>copiers</b> required Konica to redirect all of it inventory throughout North America to the County.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, a small lab {{team was}} {{borrowing}} 914 <b>copiers</b> and modifying them. The lab was developing {{what it called}} long distance xerography (LDX) to connect two <b>copiers</b> using the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964. Many years later this work came to fruition in the Xerox telecopiers, seminal to today's fax machines. The fax operation in today's multifunction <b>copiers</b> is true to Carlson's original vision for these devices.|$|R

25|$|FedEx founder Fred Smith {{has stated}} in {{numerous}} articles that Xerox's {{development of the}} <b>copier,</b> and its need to quickly get parts to customers, {{was one of the}} economic issues that led him to pioneer the overnight delivery business in 1971. Because Xerox manufactured its copiers in Rochester, the city was one of the original 25 cities that FedEx served on its first night of operations on April 17, 1973.|$|E

25|$|Ulam and von Neumann {{created a}} method for calculating liquid motion in the late 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to {{consider}} a liquid {{as a group of}} discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbors' behaviors. Thus was born the first system of cellular automata. Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a universal <b>copier</b> and constructor working within a cellular automaton with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only orthogonal cells), and with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so. This design is known as the tessellation model, and is called a von Neumann universal constructor.|$|E
25|$|Generative art is {{art that}} has been generated, composed, or {{constructed}} in an algorithmic manner {{through the use of}} systems defined by computer software algorithms, or similar mathematical or mechanical or randomised autonomous processes. Sonia Landy Sheridan established Generative Systems as a program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution. The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike <b>copier</b> art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted {{to bridge the gap between}} elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.|$|E
25|$|Meyer and Mooyer, who {{published}} {{the contents of}} the manuscript in 1833, comment that the <b>copier</b> and compiler seemed to have organized his materials haphazardly and all-too freely (even carelessly) adapted spelling to his own taste; a sixteenth-century editor corrected many errors in the manuscript's margins. Still, many lines appear to be missing and others make little sense. The manuscript was long thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the city library of Bremen. How it got there from Switzerland is unknown. A page is retained in the fragment of a collection c. 1380, written on paper in the Alsace and edited by Robert Priebsch; the fragment was in the collection of August Closs, which was bequeathed to the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies. Modern scholars of the poem cite it from Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen's Hundert altdeutsche Erzählungen (1850; republished 1961); a new edition was announced as part of a project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Edition und Kommentierung der deutschen Versnovellistik des 13. und 14. Jahrhunderts.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} {{was built in}} 1974 as the Xerox Conference Center {{at a cost of}} $55 million. It was designed to assist in <b>copier</b> and technology training for company employees. It was designed by Vincent G. Kling & Partners, and is currently managed by NCC EE, LLC. In 1994 Xerox permitted outside organizations to use the grounds. The center was sold to Oxford Capital Partners in 2000. Two years later, the Center completed a $29 million renovation, in order to ameliorate its training operations. The current design implements [...] "living learning modules", a series of color-coded buildings; underground tunnels; a ballroom; and walking trails.|$|E

[...] In 1994 Xerox opened the facilities to other corporations, and sold it to Oxford Capital Partners in 2000 as part of an exit from the hospitality industry. [...] In part this exit was due to a continuous under-capacity in event bookings, despite such events as the National Veterans Golden Age Games being hosted at the site.

500|$|Another stanza {{appears to}} be part of the {{separate}} cycle of poems associated with Llywarch Hen. The third interpolation is a poem entitled [...] "Dinogad's Smock", a cradle-song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later <b>copier</b> who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript. According to Koch's reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde.|$|E
500|$|Ibis, {{reviewing}} the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself in 1862, compares {{the effect of}} Bewick and Gilbert White, writing [...] "It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends", and [...] "how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!" [...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful <b>copier</b> of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E

Regional Manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell), believing that Karen is doing this {{to get back at}} Jim for dumping her, decides to retaliate. Michael and salesman Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) trick Jim into joining them on a trip to Utica to prank Karen’s branch. After a failed attempt to steal the branch's industrial <b>copier,</b> the group is discovered by Karen, who chastises them in her office.

With the <b>copier</b> installed in her home in Stonington, Connecticut, Hill experimented with techniques such as moving an object over the platen of the <b>copier</b> as a copy was being made, occasionally using brightly colored <b>copier</b> paper, and spooning extra quantities of toner into the machine. The IBM <b>Copier</b> II created many of the features which distinguished Hill's work by allowing for richer blacks and producing [...] "flaws" [...] in the print where the toner did not adhere to the paper.
