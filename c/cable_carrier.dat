He used the cash flows from his growing cable company to purchase other remote cable companies, resulting in a profitable conglomerate.

5000|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands {{within the field}} of automation technology in the 1980s, such as increasing loads, moving cables guided inside <b>cable</b> <b>carriers</b> often failed, although the <b>cable</b> <b>carriers</b> themselves did not. In extreme cases, failures caused by [...] "corkscrews" [...] and core ruptures brought entire production lines to a standstill, at high cost. As a result, specialized, highly flexible cables were developed with unique characteristics to differentiate them from standard designs. These are sometimes called “chain-suitable,” “high-flex,” or “continuous flex” cables.|$|R

5000|$|Up to that point, Comcast was {{the only}} major <b>cable</b> <b>carrier</b> that refused to carry MASN. However, as Comcast is the {{dominant}} cable provider {{in most of the}} Nationals and Orioles territory—including Baltimore and Washington themselves—this left most Nationals fans unable to see games without satellite. Additionally, Adelphia Communications - then in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings and therefore unable to reach new carriage deals - {{was in the process of}} being sold to Comcast and Time Warner Cable on a piecemeal basis. On August 4, 2006, following a settlement, it was announced that Comcast would carry MASN starting that September. Comcast was forced to drop its lawsuit under the terms of the deal.

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan and {{graduated}} from Tohoku Imperial University in 1925. After entering the Ministry of Communications as an engineer, he proposed the idea of Long Distance Non-Loaded <b>Cable</b> <b>Carrier</b> Communication System in 1932. In 1933, {{he was sent to}} Germany by the Government for one year, and exchanged opinions with engineers such as of Siemens factories. The Long Distance Non-Loaded <b>Cable</b> <b>Carrier</b> Communication System was realized between Harbin of Manchuria and Japan. In 1940, he assumed the post of the general affairs department of the Taisei Yokusankai (大政翼賛会, [...] "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" [...] ) which was Japan's para-fascist organization created by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on October 12, 1940 to promote the goals of his Shintaisei movement. In 1941, he was appointed General Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Communications. In 1943, he established a school for airplane technology in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, and in 1949 a school for wireless science in Nakano, Tokyo; these schools joined later to a school called Tokai Science School. During World War II, he changed his opinions and left the Taisei Yokusankai and strongly opposed the policy of the Hideki Tojo cabinet. Matsumae was sent {{to the front of the}} Philippines, as a second class private in the Imperial Army. Right before the end of the war, he returned to Japan. He was appointed Minister of Communications in 1945. Between January 1950 and June 1951, he was purged from public service. Later, he assumed the post of the President of Tokai University, which was constructed based on the schools established earlier. In 1952, he was elected a member of the Lower House of the Japanese Parliament and served for 17 years belonging to the Socialist Party. In 1966, he established a cultural exchange system Nihon Taigai Bunka Kyokai at the request of Soviet Russia, and assumed the post of its president. He boasted that he could talk to the Chief Secretary personally by telephone. He was also a judo player and as the top of Students' Association of Judo, he staged harsh struggles with the Kodokan, the traditional association of judo. He established the Matsumae International Foundation in 1979.He has established a large number of educational cultural exchange programs with universities throughout the world. For his efforts he received numerous honorary degrees from various countries. He died in 1991 at the age of 89.|$|E

5000|$|Fixed line {{market is}} {{peculiar}} in Spain, since only two local loop providers can operate at each particular region (or demarcación as {{regulated by the}} CMT): a <b>cable</b> <b>carrier</b> (such as Ono, R and many others) and the former State monopoly (Telefónica). The sole of them operating statewide—Telefónica—is obliged to provide other firms with access to their exchange facilities or rental/transfer of their copper last-mile loops, at fees regulated by the CMT (practice known as local loop unbundling). As cable providers {{do not have a}} statewide footprint, many users have no actual chance of applying for [...] "true" [...] fixed number portability, that is, giving up Telefónica's service altogether. Some of them can however get their service from a third company who will bill the service and then pay Telefónica for the copper pair rental and maintenance fees, with the customer receiving a single bill. In the end, as Telefónica set up a reselling program for their fixed lines and DSL internet access, the former monopoly is still much in control of the fixed line market, including profitable broadband access. In fact, Telefónica was fined in excess of €152 million by the European Commission on July 4, 2007 on ground of [...] "impeding competition on the Spanish broadband internet access market for more than five years, and so depriving consumers and business of a choice of broadband suppliers".|$|E
