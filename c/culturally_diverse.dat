40|$|Background The {{number of}} <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> {{students}} in the U. S. is growing, and research shows they are often underassessed, misdiagnosed, and placed into special education unnecessarily. This problem mainly concerns high-incidence, or judgmental, disabilities such as learning disability, emotional disturbance, or mental retardation. Participants and procedure In this study, the author examines how some educators perceive and address <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> {{students in the}} U. S. A survey developed by the author {{was used to examine}} how educators perceive <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> student populations and how one Midwestern school system in the United States dealt with <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> students’ needs versus expected ideal practices. Results Results indicated that most participants recognized that the issue of disproportionate representation is nationwide, but did not believe that their district shared that problem. Conclusions Participants indicated that best practices were not being followed maximally to reduce and avoid the problem of disproportionate representation of <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> students in special education programs. Difficulties in meeting students’ needs may be related to cultural differences that school personnel are unable to assess or address. Recommendations include suggestions for further studies and for applying the survey in other school systems to increase the understanding and improve their practice in working with <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> students...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of cognitive function in individuals of <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> background poses considerable {{challenges for the}} psychologist, particularly when English proficiency is limited. This study explored the effects of diverse cultural background and non-Western educational background on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third edition (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III) performances in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury within an outpatient rehabilitation setting. Participants were aged 16 – 65 years and met careful selection criteria. IQ, index and age-scaled subtest scores were compared across three groups: (a) English-speaking background (n = 130), (b) <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> background and education completed in English (n = 33), and (c) <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> background and non-English education (n = 33). Cultural backgrounds included people of Asian, European, Middle Eastern, African and Oceania origin. Results were that the English-educated <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> group performed lower than the English-speaking background group on some verbal WAIS-III measures; effect sizes were small-moderate. The non-English-educated <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>diverse</b> group performed lower than both groups on several WAIS-III and one WMS-III measure, with large effect sizes. Clinical implications included the need for caution in interpreting test scores to avoid diagnostic errors {{and the need for}} further development of valid assessment tools. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the factors {{affecting}} elementary teacher’s ability to understand the academic needs of their racially, <b>culturally,</b> and ethnically <b>diverse</b> special education students {{and the ways in which}} their values and beliefs influenced their use of culturally responsive practices in the special education classroom. This study revealed five major reasons for the disproportionate number of Black students in special education as perceived by three White teachers in North Carolina: (a) the inadequate coursework in teacher education programs regarding teaching strategies to effectively teach racially, <b>culturally,</b> and ethnically <b>diverse</b> (RCED) students, (b) the cultural dissonance that created a divide between White teachers and their racially, <b>culturally,</b> and ethnically <b>diverse</b> students, (c) lack of knowledge on the instructional strategies that should be utilized in order to effectively teach racially, <b>culturally,</b> and ethnically <b>diverse</b> students, (d) cultural considerations for Response to Interventions (RtIs) and (e) a disconnect between the home-school cultures. It is significant because findings from this study could add to the knowledge base of strategies to close or eliminate the achievement gap of racially, <b>culturally,</b> and ethnically <b>diverse</b> students in special education programs. Furthermore, these experiences may provide an additional opportunity for local educational agencies (LEAS) to examine the impact of culturally responsive teaching practices on the achievement of RCED students in the special education classroom...|$|R

The region north of the mountains was a production center for grain, cotton and heavy farm machinery, while its two main oilfields, at Maykop, near the Black Sea, and Grozny, about halfway between the Black and the Caspian Seas, produced about 10 percent of all Soviet oil. South of the mountains lay Transcaucasia, comprising Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. This heavily industrialized and densely populated area contained some of the largest oilfields in the world. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was one of the richest, producing 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil—about 24 million tons in 1942 alone.|$|E
