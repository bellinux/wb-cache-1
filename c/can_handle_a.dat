25|$|On {{hearing this}} Duryodhana closed all the fingers and rested. Duryodhana {{concluded}} that these 3 factors should have surely brought him victory.

If Vidura had fought on his side, he would have had the best strategist, even better than Krishna. At last, Duryodhana {{came to the conclusion that}} Krishna was in fact the avatar of Lord Vishnu. If Duryodhana had named Ashwatthama the commander of the army after the death of Drona, victory would have surely be his as Ashwatthama was the avatar of Lord Shiva. No one <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> 'furious' Ashwatthama, the part incarnate of Lord Shiva. All Duryodhana need to do to win the war was to make Ashwatthama furious. The remorse about under-utilizing Ashwatthama prompted Duryodhana to rethink and make Ashwatthama the commander of his army after the war, after his defeat. These events led to the complete destruction of the Pandavas' army. After the night raid of Ashwatthama on the Pandava camp, Duryodhana felt like he had won the war, as the Pandavas lost everything and everyone they cared about.|$|E

500|$|Much {{like other}} sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and {{explosives}} {{to fight the}} opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate the city. Crackdown features a series of character-based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific traits {{that can be used}} in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: [...] "Agility", which increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; [...] "Driving", affecting how well he <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> vehicle and uprades it [...] "Explosives", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and explosive power [...] "Strength" [...] that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift and throw, as well as how hard he can strike an opponent and increses health and [...] "Firearms", which improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdowns skills make few concessions to realism: character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the physical layout of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to the pages of a book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E
2500|$|A bridge layer tank (BLT) {{based on}} the Arjun chassis has also been {{displayed}} by the DRDO. Developed in cooperation with Indian industry, this bridge layer is deemed superior to the T-72 based units, as it <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> larger load and uses a [...] "scissors type" [...] bridgelaying method, which does not raise the bridge high up into the air, and hence make it visible from afar. The R(E) did this by replacing the tank’s gun and turret with the bridge launcher. The bridge is cantilevered over chasms or across rivers to cover a distance of 26 m with a width of 4 m. The BLT-Arjun carries two-halves of a bridge. At a wet or dry gap, the launcher slides the two parts and docks them {{to each other in}} such a way that the far end of the second half touches the other bank. The BLT then crosses the bridge, turns around, retrieves the bridge after undocking its two-halves, folds it and is ready to move with the armoured column.|$|E

[...] Compared to simple 2D page, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> larger range of protein species size, but it is limited in the amount of protein sample it handle at once. [...] Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is also limited in its lack of a reference map from which to work with. [...] Complex algorithms are usually used to analyze the fringe results that occur after a procedure is run. [...] The unknown portions of the protein species are usually not analyzed in favor of familiar proteomes, however. [...] This fact reveals a fault with current technology; new techniques are needed to increase both the specificity and scope of proteome mapping.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>a</b> failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E
