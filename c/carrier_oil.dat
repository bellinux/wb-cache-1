The most popular types of <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> are coconut, grape seed, jojoba, saffron and argan.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION Aromatherapy {{is the use of}} essential oils distilled from plants and administered by inhalation, massage, or used in hydrotherapy. The use of the essential oils is believed to influence mood, and be associated with antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and sedative benefits. The two 1, 2 types of oils used are essential <b>oils</b> and <b>carrier</b> <b>oils.</b> Essential oils are flammable and evaporate rapidly to form vapours, and should only be used externally, and never undiluted. The <b>carrier</b> or base <b>oils</b> are used to blend the essential oils e. g. grape seed, olive oil, and apricot kernel <b>oil.</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>oils</b> inhibit evaporation of the essential oils and encourage absorption into the skin. The oil should be cold pressed to prevent changes in the oil composition which occurs if heated. 2 KEY POINTS 1.

50|$|Interest in {{essential}} oils has revived {{in recent decades}} with the popularity of aromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine that uses {{essential oils}} and other aromatic compounds. Oils are volatilized, diluted in a <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> and used in massage, diffused in the air by a nebulizer, heated over a candle flame, or burned as incense.|$|E
50|$|Lavender {{essential}} oil, when diluted with a <b>carrier</b> <b>oil,</b> {{is commonly}} used as a relaxant with massage therapy.

50|$|High quality oils {{sold for}} culinary use are often eminently {{suitable}} for massage use, and are economical; those obtained by cold pressing are preferred. All <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> {{should be kept}} cool, and away from strong light, to retard rancidification. Rancid oils should be avoided. Refrigerating oils helps preserve their freshness but some oils should not be refrigerated (e.g. avocado). Very cold oils may appear cloudy, but regain their clear state on returning to room temperature.|$|R

50|$|Oil based defoamers have an <b>oil</b> <b>carrier.</b> The <b>oil</b> {{might be}} mineral oil, {{vegetable}} oil, white oil {{or any other}} oil that is insoluble in the foaming medium, except silicone oil. An oil based defoamer also contains a wax and/or hydrophobic silica to boost the performance. Typical waxes are ethylene bis stearamide (EBS), paraffin waxes, ester waxes and fatty alcohol waxes. These products might also have surfactants to improve emulsification and spreading in the foaming medium.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>oil,</b> {{also known}} as base oil or {{vegetable}} oil, is used to dilute essential oils and absolutes before they are applied to the skin in massage and aromatherapy. They are so named because they carry the essential oil onto the skin. Carrier oils do not contain a concentrated aroma, unlike essential oils, though some, such as olive, have a mild distinctive smell. Neither do they evaporate like essential oils, which are more volatile. The carrier oils used should be as natural and unadulterated as possible. Many people feel organic oils are of higher quality. Cold-pressing and maceration are the two main methods of producing carrier oils.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} an article that found products containing essential oils such as catnip or geranium oil, when combined with a suitable <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> such as soybean, {{have been found to}} be effective as natural repellents. This was based on testing done by Johns Hopkins and Cornell Universities. Other commercial products offered for household mosquito [...] "control" [...] include small electrical mats, mosquito repellent vapor, DEET-impregnated wrist bands, mosquito fogging, and mosquito coils containing a form of the chemical allethrin. Mosquito-repellent candles containing citronella oil are sold widely in the U.S. These have been used with mixed reports of success and failure.|$|E
50|$|Because {{essential}} oils are highly concentrated they can irritate the skin {{when used in}} undiluted form. Therefore, they are normally diluted with a <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> for topical application, such as jojoba oil, olive oil, or coconut oil. Phototoxic reactions may occur with citrus peel oils such as lemon or lime. Also, many {{essential oils}} have chemical components that are sensitisers (meaning that they will, {{after a number of}} uses, cause reactions on the skin, and more so {{in the rest of the}} body). Some of the chemical allergies could even be caused by pesticides, if the original plants are cultivated. Some oils can be toxic to some domestic animals, with cats being particularly prone.|$|E
