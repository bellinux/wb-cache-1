She did cut into Wilhelm's time on the final loop, but not by enough, coming in 15.6 seconds behind.

Because a centerless grinding line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|R

50|$|Backscatter {{occurs because}} worms and spam {{messages}} often forge their sender addresses. Instead of simply rejecting a spam message, a misconfigured mail server sends a bounce message {{to such a}} forged address. This normally happens when a mail server is configured to relay a message to an after-queue processing step, for example, an antivirus scan or spam check, which then fails, {{and at the time}} the antivirus scan or spam check is done, the client already has disconnected. In those cases, it is normally not possible to reject the SMTP transaction, since a client would time out while waiting for the antivirus scan or spam <b>check</b> to <b>finish.</b> The best thing to do in this case, is to silently drop the message, rather than risk creating backscatter.|$|R

50|$|Running {{through the}} log file, we check for each entry, whether the {{modified}} page P on the entry {{exists in the}} DPT table. If it doesn't, then {{we do not have}} to worry about redoing this entry since the data persists on the disk. If page P exists in the DPT table, then we see whether the Sequence Number in the DPT is smaller than the Sequence Number of the log record (i.e. whether the change in the log is newer than the last version that was persisted). If it isn't, then we don't redo the entry since the change is already there. If it is, we fetch the page from the database storage and check the Sequence Number stored on the page to the Sequence Number on the log record. If the former is smaller than the latter, the page needs to be written to the disk. That check is necessary because the recovered DPT is only a conservative superset of the pages that really need changes to be reapplied. Lastly, when all the above <b>checks</b> are <b>finished</b> and failed, we reapply the redo action and store the new Sequence Number on the page. It is also important for recovery from a crash during the Redo phase, as the redo isn't applied twice to the same page.|$|R
