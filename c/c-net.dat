The ubiquitous Commodore 64 (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were Blue Board, Ivory BBS, Color64 and CNet 64.

There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the Atari 800, then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST. The earlier machines generally lacked hard drive capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, <b>C-Net,</b> Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 {{changed its name to}} America Online, and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{algorithm}} for sampling rooted 3 -connected planar graphs (<b>c-nets)</b> in deterministic polynomial time is presented. The algorithm {{is based on}} a decomposition strategy for <b>c-nets,</b> which is formulated as a system of bijections between classes of <b>c-nets</b> parameterized by the number of vertices, faces, and edges on the outer face. This system is then used in three ways: First, as system of recursive equations to derive the sizes of above classes by using an algorithm based on dynamic programming. Second, as system of equations of generating functions to derive an algebraic generating function and a single parameter recursion formula for <b>c-nets.</b> Third, as composition scheme to sample <b>c-nets</b> uniformly at random with the recursive method of sampling. The thesis is based on the paper A Direct Decomposition of 3 -connected Planar Graphs by Manuel Bodirsky, Clemens Gröpl, Mihyun Kang and the author [Bodirsky et al., 2005 a] and extends it by the parameter for the number of edges and a full proof of the decomposition...|$|R

40|$|Process {{discovery}} {{is probably the}} most challenging process mining task. Given an event log, i. e., a set of example traces, it is difficult to automatically construct a process model explaining the behavior seen in the log. Many process discovery techniques use Petri nets as a language to describe the discovered model. This implies that the search space—often referred to as the representational bias—includes many inconsistent models (e. g., models with deadlocks and livelocks). Moreover, the low-level nature of Petri nets does not help in finding a proper balance between overfitting and underfitting. Therefore, we advocate a new representation more suitable for process discovery: causal nets. Causal nets are related to the representations used by several process discovery techniques (e. g., heuristic mining, fuzzy mining, and genetic mining). However, unlike existing approaches, <b>C-nets</b> use declarative semantics tailored towards process mining...|$|R

The approach is implemented by adding two novel nets (layers) : the enhancing layers and the cropping layers, to a pretrained CNN model.

For the cropping layers, we crop facial regions around the detected landmarks and design convolutional layers to learn deeper features for each facial region (<b>C-Net).</b> We then fuse the E-Net and the <b>C-Net</b> to obtain our Enhancing and Cropping (EAC) Net, which can learn both feature enhancing and region cropping functions.

40|$|Abstract: Secondary school {{students}} and teachers located in remote areas are faced with barriers to educational access not seen in denser population areas. Students have the problem of accessing teachers of specialised subjects {{and access to the}} curriculum options their urban counterparts enjoy. In turn, teachers in remote locations have limited opportunities for professional learning and development, particularly for integration of ICTs into their classroom practices. Virtual clustering of local, small, rural schools using video conferencing and collaborative networks is one of the approaches adopted by some schools to overcome the barriers. Although the use of ICT for forming a collaborative cluster seems a good strategy, self-sustainability of the clusters initiated and led by the community of schools from the grass-roots level remains a problem and has generated potential for a knowledge gap. This qualitative case study research intended to identify the inhibiting factors that challenged the development of <b>C-Net</b> as a self-sustaining Learning Exchange cluster in New Zealand.

The net-shape was noted to be different in each net, especially in both the A-net (2 % of hanging-coefficent) and the B-net (5 % of hanging-coefficent), the cod-end was observed to be fairly expanded. 2. The maximum cross-section-area of net-mouth was obtained in the D-net (15 % of hanging-coefficent). 3. Concerning the total towing-net-resistance, the minimum value was showed by the <b>C-net</b> (10 % of hanging-coefficent), the maximum by A-net (of the largest mesh number) and the value next to maximum was showed by the F-net (30 % of hanging-coefficent; the smallest mesh number). Accordingly, we can assume that, the total net-resistance of bag-net is depending more upon net-shape than upon mesh number of the netting, except those of low hanging-coefficent. ...|$|E
