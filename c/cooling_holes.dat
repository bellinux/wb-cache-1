The primary or crossflow fluid enters from atmosphere through a smooth two dimensional contraction before entering the working section. The newly constructed supply loop has a single inlet from a high pressure source, in-line blower, and a 600 mm long rectangular passage working section. Various film cooling geometries can be installed to connect the supply loop passage to the main wind tunnel working section. The installation of the supply loop enables variation of <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> inlet conditions, including crossflow velocity, mass flow rate, and flow direction.

Large scale experimental investigations of the internal flow field for a laterally expanded 50 times scale fan-shaped hole are presented, together with a computational investigation of the flow, for three inlet velocity ratios.

40|$|Improvements to {{gas turbine}} {{efficiency}} depend closely on cooling technologies, as efficiency increases with turbine inlet temperature. To aid in this process, simulations that consider real engine conditions {{need to be}} considered. The first step towards this goal is a benchmark study using direct numerical simulations to consider a single periodic film <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> that characterizes the error in adiabatic boundary conditions, a common numerical simpliflication. Two cases are considered: an adiabatic case and a conjugate case. The adiabatic case is for validation to previous work conducted by Pietrzyk and Peet. The conjugate case considers heat transfer in the solid endwall {{in addition to the}} fluid, eliminating any simplified boundary conditions. It also includes an impinging jet and plenum, typical of actual endwall configurations. The numerical solver is NEK 5000 and the two cases were run at 504 and 128 processors for the adiabatic and conjugate cases respectively. The approximate combined time is 100, 000 CPU hours. In the adiabatic case, the results show good agreement for average velocity profiles but over prediction of the film cooling effectiveness. A convergence study suggests that there may be an area of unresolved flow, and the film cooling momentum flux may be too high. Preliminary conjugate results show agreement with velocity profiles, and significant differences in cooling effectiveness. Both cases will need to be refined near the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> exit, and another convergence study done.

This thesis deals {{with the development of}} a method to save computer power for these types of simulations. The cooling air is injected using additions to the source terms of the discretised governing equations. Cell lengths up to about one or two <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> diameters are used, thereby precluding modelling of the detailed flow around each <b>cooling</b> <b>hole.</b> Three different models for distributing the source terms are evaluated. In the first model, the sources are distributed to only one cell, namely the cell closest to the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole,</b> resulting in a poorly penetrating jet. To obtain better jet penetration {{and to be able to}} better control the concentration of coolant at the wall, the second model distributes the sources as a line source. This model produced reasonable results for the heat transfer rate on a film-cooled nozzle guide vane but not for temperature comparisons on multi-row effusion-cooled plates. The results were found to be sensitive to some input parameters. The third model uses limited parts of source term fields, evaluated from the averaged solutions of detailed jet simulations. This model showed the best and most realistic injection of the coolant. Owing to the different qualities of the results, especially for the first and second models, the method should be seen as a ``last way out`` when it is not possible to make detailed 3 D simulations of high quality due to a lack of computer power...|$|R

In particular, this experimental study focu. ied {{on the effect of}} different velocities in a coflowing channel at the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> entrance. Flows {{on both sides of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> (entrance and exit) were parallel and in the same direction. With the blowing ratio and the main. stream velocity at the hole exit re-maining fixed, only the flow velocity in the channel at the hole entrance was varied. The Mach number at the hole entrance was varied between 0 < Mac < 0. 5, while the Mach number at the hole exit remained constant at Ma«, = 0. 25. The velocity ratio and density ratio of the jet were unity giving a blowing ratio and momentum flux ratio also of unity. The single, scaled-up film-cooling hole was inclined at 30 deg with respect to the mainstream and had a hole length-to-diameter ratio of L/D = 6. Flowfield measurements were made inside the hole, at the hole inlet and exit, and in the near-hole region where the jet interacted with the crossflow at the hole exit. The results show that for entrance crossflow Mach numbers of Ma ^ = 0 and 0. 5, a separation region occurs on the leeward and windward side of the <b>cooling</b> <b>hole</b> entrances, respectively.

Using this configuration as a baseline, studies continued with three remaining geometries. It was found that for all three geometry variants the cooling effectiveness has considerable increase in comparison to that from the base model.

40|$|Designing turbine {{components}} for maximum aerodynamic performance with adequate cooling {{is a critical}} challenge for gas turbine engineers, particularly at the endwall of a turbine due to complex secondary flows. To complicate matters, impurities from the fuel and intake air can deposit on film-cooled components downstream of the combustor. Deposition induced roughness can reduce cooling effectiveness and aerodynamic performance dramatically. One method commonly used for reducing the effects of secondary flows on aerodynamic performance is endwall contouring. The current study evaluates deposition effects on endwall contouring given the change to the secondary flow pattern. For the current study, deposition was dynamically simulated in a turbine cascade to determine its effects on film-cooling with and without endwall contouring. Computationally predicted impactions were in qualitative agreement with experimental deposition simulations showing that contouring reduced deposition around strategically placed film-cooling <b>holes.</b> Deposition reduced <b>cooling</b> effectiveness by 50 % on a flat endwall and 40 % on an identically cooled contoured endwall.

Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery.

Furthermore, the process of meshing <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> is not only time consuming but cumbersome; thus making the parametric study of film cooling effectiveness for a given blade geometry, using hole geometry and distribution very difficult in a design environment. In this paper an immersed mesh block (IMB) approach is proposedwhich allows the refinedmesh of a cooling hole to be immersed into the coarser mesh of an NGV and solved simultaneously whilst maintaining mass conservation. By employing two-way coupling, the flow physics in and around <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> is able to interact with the mainstream, hence the length scales of both types of flow are appropriately resolved. A generic cooling hole design can then be mapped to a given aerofoil geometry multiple times to achieve an appropriate distribution of <b>cooling</b> <b>holes.</b> The results show that for a realistic transonic blade, a configuration consisting of up to 200 <b>cooling</b> <b>holes</b> can be efficiently and accurately calculated - whilst retaining the original aerodynamic mesh but with a much enhanced resolution for the film cooling.

The patented console geometry is designed to improve the heat transfer and aerodynamic performance of turbine vane and rotor blade cooling systems. These experiments follow the successful validation of the console design in low-speed flatplate tests described in Part 1 of this paper (Sargison et al [1]). Stereolithography was used to manufacture a resin model of a transonic, engine representative nozzle guide vane in which 7 rows of previously tested fan-shaped film-cooling holes were replaced by 4 rows of consoles. This vane was mounted in the annular vane ring of the Oxford Cold Heat Transfer Tunnel for testing at engine Reynolds numbers, Mach numbers and coolant to mainstream momentum flux ratios using a heavy gas to simulate the correct coolant to mainstream density ratio.
