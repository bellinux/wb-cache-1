A comparison of data on body weights of Siberian tigers indicates that {{up to the first}} half of the 20th century both males and females were on average heavier than post-1970 ones. Today's wild Siberian tigers are smaller than Bengal tigers. Their reduced weight as compared to historical Siberian tigers may be due to a combination of causes: when captured, they were usually sick or injured and involved in a <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> with people.|$|E

25|$|In psychology, {{capitalization}} {{refers to}} the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in good mood) from a positive event by sharing it with other people. Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself. Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., the willingness to respond positively in an unpleasant or <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> involving one's relationship partner). Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the future than support extended during discussion of negative events.|$|E

In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates.

[...] This was well displayed at the sittings of Mbanefo Panel on State Creation held at Ondo State House of Assembly Complex, Akure at the verge of the state creation and which suggest that agitation for Ekiti State on October 1, 1996, would not go unresolved without another conflict over the sighting of State capital and the creation of more local government areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{strategy for}} solving <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> on mutirobotics motion planning is presented. The strategy is performed with a function with minimal sharing information, which controls that such movements really assists to both robots. We {{show that a}} simple function with cooperative sense can retrieve good paths in <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations.</b> As a rule, finest movements are neccessary to avoid collisions in hard environments such as inside a tunnel. We developed a novel technique inspirated in regularisation and Markovian processes. This technique is currently implemented in a randomized algorithm with a cooperative strategy for solving <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> that often arrive in multi-robot manipulator environments. Randomized Algorithms (RA) have proven their capacity to escape from local minima. On the other hand, if collaborative attitudes are carried-out by {{the participants in the}} task, the time to solve <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> can be considerably reduced. Moreover, when <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> take long time to be solved, high risk of exploring not good free spaces can arrive and hence the search does not often drive directly the robots to their goals. Based on the above considerations, we built a framework of cooperative RA's aiming to facilitate the coordination of robots by establishing commitments to cooperate when <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> appear, and by interacting through the exchange of data to go as directly as possible towards their respective goals. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Context-aware {{systems in}} mobile and {{pervasive}} environments face many <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> while collecting sensor data, processing sensor data to extract consistent and coherent high level context information, and disseminating that context information {{to assist in}} making decisions {{to adapt to the}} continu-ously evolving situations without diverting human attention. These <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> pose stern challenges to the design and development of context-aware systems by making it extremely complicated and error-prone. Quality of Context parameters can be used to cope with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> that a context-aware system may face at different layers of its conceptual design and present the conflict resolving policies that are defined {{on the basis of the}} Quality of Context parameters. We also illustrate how these policies can be used in different <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> to improve the performance and effectiveness of context-aware systems. ...|$|R
