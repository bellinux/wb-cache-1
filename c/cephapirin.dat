40|$|<b>Cephapirin,</b> a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic, {{was administered}} intravenously to five healthy subjects in {{a dose of}} 1 g. Renal clearances of <b>cephapirin,</b> beta 2 -microglobulin, uric acid and amino acids were measured during the experiment and compared to timed control data, i. e. when no <b>cephapirin</b> was given. Renal clearance of <b>cephapirin</b> decreased when plasma concentrations declined. As protein binding of <b>cephapirin</b> is constant over a wide plasma concentration range, this finding may indicate that <b>cephapirin</b> is reabsorbed in the kidney by a saturable process. Renal clearance of endogenous amino acids, particularly those belonging to the basic group increased after <b>cephapirin.</b> There was no change in renal clearance of beta 2 -microglobulin which excludes a general toxic effect on tubular reabsorption of endogenous substances caused by <b>cephapirin.</b> A flow dependent increase of uric acid clearance was observed. Our results are suggestive of a competition between <b>cephapirin</b> and amino acids for some common step in the tubular reabsorption process...|$|E
40|$|Six {{patients}} undergoing chronic hemodialysis and 10 {{patients with}} chronic renal insufficiency hospitalized for nondialytic therapy received 1. 0 g of <b>cephapirin</b> sodium by the intravenous route. The concentrations of <b>cephapirin</b> in arterial and venous plasma, dialysate, venous blood, and urine were measured during the ensuing 6 hr. The serum half-life of <b>cephapirin</b> was 105 to 108 min for the dialyzed patients and 95. 9 min for the nondialyzed patients. Dialysis removed 22. 8 % of the administered dose. Nondialyzed patients excreted 19. 5 % of the administered dose in the urine. The concentration of <b>cephapirin</b> in the urine of all nondialyzed patients exceeded 50 μg/ml. The recovery of <b>cephapirin</b> in the urine collected for 6 hr after injection was from 34 to 770 mg (mean 195 mg). To maintain a concentration of <b>cephapirin</b> in the blood and urine which exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration for most gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, nondialyzed patients should receive 15 to 18 mg of <b>cephapirin</b> per kg every 12 hr.

40|$|<b>Cephapirin</b> was {{utilized}} {{to examine the}} interaction of β-lactam antibiotics with growing Bacillus subtilis cells and the biological effects simultaneously produced. Saturation binding and quantitative cell death were observed at the <b>cephapirin</b> concentration of 0. 1 μg/ml. <b>Cephapirin</b> bound to all penicillin-binding proteins except the d-alanine carboxypeptidase. A specific [14 C]benzylpenicillin-binding assay was developed for the d-alanine carboxypeptidase. At the lowest saturating concentration of antibiotic (0. 1 μg/ml), <b>cephapirin</b> inhibited formation of the d-alanine carboxypeptidase. Upon incubation with <b>cephapirin,</b> 18 % of the membranous d-alanine carboxypeptidase was released into the media.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} {{on the degradation of}} ceftiofur and <b>cephapirin</b> at physiological temperatures in kidney extract and in alkaline and acidic solution, conditions that regularly occur during sample preparation. Degradation products were identified using LC¿ToF/MS, NMR and microbiological techniques. Additionally kinetics of the degradation processes were studied. A slight instability of <b>cephapirin</b> and desfuroylceftiofur was observed at elevated temperatures. Ceftiofur and <b>cephapirin</b> degraded immediately and completely in an alkaline environment, resulting in inactive degradation products. Ceftiofur and <b>cephapirin</b> also degraded immediately and completely in kidney extract resulting in both formerly reported metabolites as well as not previously reported products. Our research shows that conditions often occurring during the analysis of ceftiofur or <b>cephapirin</b> result in rapid degradation of both compounds. From this it is concluded that underestimation of the determined amounts of ceftiofur and <b>cephapirin</b> is likely to occur. Therefore, a new approach is needed for the analysis of both compounds newly identified degradation product...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cephapirin,</b> a {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic, {{is used by}} {{the majority}} of dairy farms in the US. Fecal and urinary excretion of <b>cephapirin</b> could introduce this compound into the environment when manure is land applied as fertilizer, and may cause development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics critical for human health. The environmental loading of <b>cephapirin</b> by the livestock industry remains un-assessed, largely {{due to a lack of}} appropriate analytical methods. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a <b>cephapirin</b> quantification method to capture the temporal pattern of <b>cephapirin</b> excretion in dairy cows following intramammary infusion. The method includes an extraction with phosphate buffer and methanol, solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up, and quantification using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The LOQ values of the developed method were 4. 02 µg kg(- 1) and 0. 96 µg L(- 1) for feces and urine, respectively. This robust method recovered > 60 % and > 80 % <b>cephapirin</b> from spiked blank fecal and urine samples, respectively, with acceptable intra- and inter-day variation (< 10 %). Using this method, we detected trace amounts (µg kg(- 1)) of <b>cephapirin</b> in dairy cow feces, and <b>cephapirin</b> in urine was detected at very high concentrations (133 to 480 µg L(- 1)). <b>Cephapirin</b> was primarily excreted via urine and its urinary excretion was influenced by day (P = 0. 03).

The described method for quantification of <b>cephapirin</b> in bovine feces and urine is sensitive, accurate, and robust and allowed to monitor the pattern of <b>cephapirin</b> excretion in dairy cows. This data will help develop manure segregation and treatment methods to minimize the risk of antibiotic loading to the environment from dairy farms...|$|E

40|$|Twice-daily {{intramuscular}} ceforanide therapy of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in parenteral {{drug abusers}} was compared in a randomized prospective trial with intravenous <b>cephapirin</b> therapy. Dosage regimens were ceforanide, 1 g every 12 h, and <b>cephapirin,</b> 2 g every 4 h. Mean minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of ceforanide for S. aureus treated with ceforanide were 0. 78 and 1. 56 microgram/ml compared to <b>cephapirin</b> for patient isolates of 0. 08 and 0. 14 microgram/ml, respectively. Serum killing levels with ceforanide were 1 : 5. 7 and 1 : 1. 5 at peak and trough levels, compared to 1 : 134 (peak) and 1 : 4. 2 (trough) with <b>cephapirin.</b> Despite this apparent in vitro advantage of <b>cephapirin,</b> patients treated with ceforanide did {{as well as}} those with <b>cephapirin.</b> Of 16 ceforanide-treated patients, all responded initially to therapy, and 15 were cured with 28 days of therapy.

In addition, one ceforanide-treated patient and two cephapirin-treated patients developed central nervous system abscesses. These were cured with drainage and continuation of antibiotic therapy. Ceforanide was well tolerated by the intramuscular route. Cost analysis suggests that therapy with intramuscular ceforanide would result in an approximate 70 % decrease in drug therapy cost when compared to intravenous <b>cephapirin.</b> Ceforanide appears to be a safe, efficacious, convenient, and relatively inexpensive drug for treating staphylococcal endocarditis in parenteral drug abusers...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{therapy is}} the most {{commonly}} used treatment of bacterial infections in dairy cows, Polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMN) {{play an important role in}} the first line defence against invading bacteria and it is important that the function of PMN is not compromised by antibiotics. We investigated the in vitro effect of <b>cephapirin,</b> a first generation cephalosporin, and mecillinam, an amidinopenicillin with activity against mainly Gramnegative bacteria, on phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity of PMN isolated from bovine blood, After in vitro incubation of PMN with different concentrations of the antibiotics, phagocytosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and respiratory burst activity was evaluated by registration of chemiluminescence (CL) with a luminometer, None of the investigated concentrations of <b>cephapirin</b> and mecillinam had an effect in vitro on phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by PMN, At high concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g/mL), <b>cephapirin</b> and mecillinam reduced the respiratory burst activity of PMN. Part of these suppressive effects could be ascribed to oxidant scavenging, Inhibitory effects of <b>cephapirin</b> were stronger than mecillinam.

40|$|Standard {{groundwater}} tracers such as Rhodamine WT, Fluorescein, Eosin and Tinopal CBX effectively {{provide a}} snapshot of hydrological conditions over {{a brief period of}} time and in a tightly controlled setting. However, in complex environmental situations with multiple potential sources, groundwater hydrologists are often seeking groundwater tracers that have extended longevity in the natural environment and the ability to directly pinpoint source locations. After reviewing operations of the nearby dairy it was determined that emerging contaminants, specifically two bovine veterinary pharmaceuticals (antibiotics), <b>cephapirin</b> sodium (CEPNa) and <b>cephapirin</b> benzathine (CEPB), and a sanitation agent, elemental Iodine (I) may have potential as extended longevity groundwater tracers if analytical methodology could be established. Initially, sample analysis indicated that <b>cephapirin</b> is undetectable in unconcentrated samples of lagoon wastewater at parts per billion (ppb) concentration; pre-concentrated samples which utilized solid phase extraction allowed for better detection at part per trillion level. Concentrated samples from one of the two lagoon cells sampled (cell # 3), detected <b>cephapirin</b> at 13. 14 ppt level, while cell # 1 failed to detect any <b>cephapirin</b> present. Controlled laboratory testing later indicated that in a wastewater environment <b>cephapirin</b> degrades to approximately 20 % of initial concentrations within 4 days, with complete degradation within 6 days. Degradation patterns in surface water and groundwater samples were less dramatic and at slower rates. Degradation curves of the surface and groundwater samples indicate that concentrations of <b>cephapirin</b> are still detectable for approximately 25 days. Unconcentrated Iodine samples collected in lagoon cells ranged from 50. 896 ppb and 1, 704. 55 ppb with variations determined to be a result of the primary inflow of the lagoon. Cephapirin’s use as a long term groundwater tracer {{does not seem to be}} an immediate option. Further research may reveal that its degradation products are potentially useful as a tracer. In some instances, such as catastrophic discharges of large volumes of milk when samples can be collected and analyzed quickly, the use of <b>cephapirin</b> as an environmental tracer may prove possible. The validity of pharmaceutical iodine as a groundwater tracer appears to be much greater than that of <b>cephapirin.</b> Iodine was detected in all of the environmental samples including the highly organic and anaerobic environment of the dairy wastewater lagoon. This study concludes that iodine is capable of surviving the hostile wastewater environment. If sufficient data is collected to determine natural background levels, iodine may prove useful in determining hydrological connections between iodine laden dairy effluent and the underlying groundwater...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to quantify the effect of an intrauterine infusion of <b>cephapirin</b> on reproductive performance at first service of postpartum dairy cows affected by purulent vaginal discharge (PVD) and cytological endometritis (ENDO) using different diagnostic strategies, and to determine if the presence of prolonged anovulation would influence the magnitude of treatment benefit. In total, 2, 259 Holstein cows in 28 herds were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. At 35 (± 7) days in milk (DIM), cows were diagnosed with PVD using the Metricheck device (Simcro, Hamilton, New Zealand), with cytological endometritis using endometrial cytology (ENDO-CYTO), and with cytological endometritis using leukocyte esterase (ENDO-LE). Regardless of reproductive tract disease status, cows were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine <b>cephapirin</b> infusion or to not be treated. Serum progesterone was measured at 35 and 49 (± 7) DIM (14 d apart); cows were considered to have prolonged anovulation if progesterone was < 1 ng/mL at both times. Reproductive events of cows were collected until 200 DIM. Statistical analyses were conducted using multivariable mixed logistic regression models. Intrauterine <b>cephapirin</b> treatment was associated with an increased first-service pregnancy risk in cows diagnosed with PVD (no treatment: 15. 4 %; treatment: 31. 4 %), ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 16. 2 %, treatment: 24. 4 %), and ENDO-LE (no treatment: 15. 8 %; treatment: 25. 1 %), but not in cows unaffected by any form of reproductive tract disease (no treatment: 34. 8 %; treatment: 32. 6 %). <b>Cephapirin</b> treatment was also associated with an increased first-service reproductive performance in cows affected simultaneously by both PVD and ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 8. 7 %; treatment: 23. 4 %).

Influential factors such as crystallization time (4 to 12 h), crystallization temperature (45 º vs. 72 ºF), and centrifugation speed (25 to 3000 × g) were investigated. Optimized crystallization conditions were verified in antibiotic-tainted raw milk samples via the enzyme-linked receptor-binding assay and by solids partitioning. In water, β-CD precipitate increased significantly as β-CD concentration and crystallization time increased, but was independent of the centrifugation speed. In pasteurized whole milk, precipitate increased as β-CD concentration, crystallization time, and centrifugation speed increased. The best β-CD precipitation conditions in milk were designated as: 9. 1 % β-CD concentration (w/w), 4 hour crystallization time, 45 ºF, and centrifugation at 25 × g for 10 minutes.

The serum concentration curves appeared to decline bi-exponentially, suggesting that a two-compartment model was most applicable for pharmacokinetic analysis; accordingly, the t½ of cefamandole was significantly longer when the serum peak was omitted from the analysis (0. 86 versus 0. 73 h, P < 0. 05). The half-lives of cephalothin and <b>cephapirin,</b> 0. 34 and 0. 36 h, respectively, were probably underestimates reflecting the inclusion of distribution-phase values in the calculation. Repeated dosing had no effect on the peak serum levels, half-life, serum clearance, or apparent volume of distribution with one exception: peak serum levels of <b>cephapirin</b> were significantly lower after the sixteenth than after the first dose. Marked variations within a given subject were noted in the half-life and apparent volume of distribution of cefamandole in several instances. Renal clearances of cefamandole exhibited saturation kinetics similar to those of penicillin G...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of chephaloridine, cephalexin, cefatrizine (BL-S 640), and <b>cephapirin</b> (BL-P- 1322) was {{evaluated by the}} serial dilution method against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine udders and neonatal calf diseases. <b>Cephapirin</b> showed the comparatively greatest activity against the most common streptococcal species associated with bovine mastitis, whereas cephaloridine exhibited the best activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Cefatrizine was more active than the other cephalosporins against the gram-negative bacteria studied. In general, the minimal bactericidal concentration of each cephalosporin was two- to fourfold lower than the comparative value {{reported in the literature}} against the same type of pathogen of human origin...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{cephalosporins}} {{were tested}} for their activity against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci {{and for their}} resistance to beta-lactamase from methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. Susceptibility testing by the agar plate method was evaluated for the effect of inoculum size and duration of incubation. Methicillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci were highly susceptible to the cephalosporins, with <b>cephapirin</b> and cepahlothin showing the greatest activity, followed by cefazolin and cefamandole. Methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci displayed nearly total cross-resistance to the cephalosporins. Resistance increased with increasing inoculum size. Beta-Lactamases produced by methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci had a minimal hydrolytic effect on cepahlothin, <b>cephapirin,</b> cefazolin, and cefamandole and no measurable effect on cefoxitin. There was no correlation between the anti-staphylococcal activity and resistance to beta-lactamases...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To compare four {{different}} dry cow treatments (DCT) and establish their effectiveness in reducing intramammary infections (IIM). Materials and methods. DCTs included systemic tylosin (12 g) alone or accompanied by cefapirine intramammary infusions and or an internal teat sealant. A {{total number of}} 278 cows {{at the end of}} lactation period were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 4 dry cow treatment groups: CESE Group (n= 89), intramammary <b>cephapirin</b> and teat sealant. TYCESE Group (n= 84), intramammary <b>cephapirin,</b> tylosin 12 g intramuscular and teat sealant. TYSE Group (n= 86), 12 g intramuscular tylosin and teat sealant; TY Group (n= 76) 12 g intramuscular tylosin only. Milk samples for culture were collected at dry-off and 1 and 2 weeks after calving. Somatic cell counts (SCC) were taken from Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHI) tests at dry-off, and the first two test days after calving. Results. Bacteria cure rate for Gram-positive intramammary infections (IMI) for TYCESE group was 93. 6 %, CESE group 78. 9 %, TYSE group 88. 2 %, and TY group 78. 1 %. All four groups showed a decrease in the SCC upon the first and second test after calving. Conclusions. The use of systemic tylosin in combination with intramammary antibiotics increased DCT effectiveness improving the Gram-positive cure rate IMI. Furthermore, systemic tylosin alone plus teat sealant is as effective as <b>cephapirin</b> plus teat sealant when used as DCT...|$|E
40|$|Buffered cephalothin, cefamandole, and <b>cephapirin</b> were {{compared}} {{with respect to their}} tendency to produce phlebitis. Two grams of each agent was administered every 6 h for 4 days to 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind crossover fashion. Approximately 50 % of intravenous sites developed mild (grade 1) phlebitis and 25 % developed moderate (grade 2) phlebitis. The frequency of grade 1 inflammation did not differ significantly among the three cephalosporins. The proportion of individuals eventually exhibiting grade 2 phelebitis was highest with cefamandole, lowest with cephalothin (P = 0. 07), and intermediate with cephapirin; however, <b>cephapirin</b> required a substantially greater number of doses to produce grade 2 phelebitis than did the other two drugs. These findings, together with the results of other reports, suggest that interpretation of the phlebitogenic potential of these antibiotics must be made with caution...|$|E

40|$|Thirteen {{strains of}} the gram-negative, facultative phototrophic {{bacterium}} Rhodobacter sphaeroides were examined fro susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. All strains were sensitive to the semisynthetic penicillins ampicillin, carbenicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and methicillin, but 10 of the 13 strains were resistant to penicillin G, {{as well as a}} number of cephalosporins, such as cephalothin, <b>cephapirin,</b> and cephalosporin C. A beta-lactamase (EC 3. 5. 2. 6) with strong cephalosporinase activity was detected in all of the resistant strains of R. sphaeroides. With strain Y- 1 as a model, it was shown that the beta-lactamase was inducible by penicillin G, cephalosporin C, cephalothin, and to some minor extent, <b>cephapirin.</b> The beta-lactamase was located in the periplasmic space, from which it could be extracted by osmotic shock disruption. By using this fraction, the beta-lactamase was purified 34 -fold to homogeneity by steps involving batch adsorption to and elution from DEAE-Sephadex A 50, chromatography on Q-Sepharose, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular masses of the native and denatured enzymes were determined to be 38. 5 kilodaltons by gel filtration and 40. 5 kilodaltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, indicating a monomeric structure. The isoelectric point was estimated to be at pH 4. 3. In Tris hydrochloride buffer, optimum enzyme activity was measured at pH 8. 5. The beta-lactamase showed high activity in the presence of the substrates cephalothin, <b>cephapirin,</b> cephalosporin C, and penicillin G, for which the apparent Km values were 144, 100, 65, and 110 microM, respectively. Cephalexin, cepharidine, and cephaloridine were poor substrates. The beta-lactamase was strongly inhibited by cloxacillin and oxacillin but only slightly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or thiol reagents such as iodoacetate and p-chloromercuribenzoate...|$|E
