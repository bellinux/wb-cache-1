50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>chucking</b> <b>machine</b> is {{very similar}} to an automatic screw machine, except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one main spindle).|$|R
50|$|The site in Dillingen/Danube {{was founded}} in 1953. The 1650 square meters productionhall was {{constructed}} in 2007 and contains two turning and milling machines, which are adapted to RÖHM’s special requirements. The machines enabled the processing of parts of up to four meters in diameter and 25 tons in weight. Due to a net weight of 108 tons the machine required a foundation of 180 tons of iron and steel. The Dillingen site mainly produces lathe <b>chucks,</b> <b>machine</b> vices and special clamping equipment for turning and milling machinery {{as well as for}} machining centres.|$|R
5000|$|Multispindle lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic <b>chucking</b> <b>machines,</b> automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{electromigration}} (EM) test mask {{was designed}} to utilize both standard ASTM and Standard Wafer-level Electromigration Accelerated Test Structures (SWEAT) fourterminal EM test structures of varying line-widths. The mask was used to pattern 4 ” test wafers consisting of 300 nm of sputtered aluminum- 1 % silicon on a thermal SiO 2 layer. A custom thermal setup was developed for a Micromanipulator 6000 manual probe station. A new 4 ” brass <b>chuck</b> was <b>machined</b> to include cooling channels, wafer vacuum, and a thermocouple monitoring system. A resistive ring heater was bonded to the chuck and was controlled via a process temperature controller. Extensive electrical test of interconnect structures was necessary to generate EM lifetime data for the alloy film. Multiple measurements on a given type of test structure were used to generate acceptable sample sizes for mean-time-fail (MTF) statistics. Test data for both ASTM and SWEAT structures demonstrated a lognormal distribution for cumulative failure with a decrease in mean fail time for increased test temperatures. The activation energy for Al-Si at RIT was approximately 0. 5 eV for 2. 7 μm lines of both types of test structures. A test station and methodology are now in place for future EM lifetime studies to be completed at RIT...|$|R
50|$|And, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle <b>chucking</b> {{and turning}} <b>machines</b> were being {{manipulated}} by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese {{were working in}} the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.|$|R

5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a <b>chuck.</b> Some seaming <b>machines</b> have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|R
40|$|The {{electronics}} industry aims at following Moore's {{law which}} states {{that the amount of}} transistors per unit area doubles every two years. To achieve this, the industry manufacturing Integrated Circuits (ICs) requires production technologies capable of producing smaller details. The machines capable of fulfilling these demands become more expensive and so does the cost per chip. This increase in cost is undesirable and a solution to this problem is to increase the production volumes per unit of time per machine. The industry's approach to increase the production volumes is to increase the diameter of the wafer from 300 mm to 450 mm. The increase in size of some components in the lithography machines introduces a number of challenges to the position control of the wafer <b>chuck</b> in lithography <b>machines.</b> The main challenge is the positioning accuracy requirements of the wafer chuck with respect to {{the focal point of the}} projection optics. This is caused by the decreased stiffness of the wafer chuck, which induces undesirable deformations of the wafer resulting in decreased positioning accuracy of the chuck with respect to the focal point. Recently, two new algorithms for estimating the wafer and wafer chuck deformations have been developed that may help solve this problem. The estimation algorithms rely on models to generate accurate estimates. In general the input, output, or both signals are not measurable. Therefore, it is not straight forward to apply system identification techniques to obtain a model. As alternative a model can be obtained from physical modeling. Both approaches are likely to result in a mathematical model with high uncertainties. The effect of model uncertainty on one of the estimation algorithms is studied in this thesis. The model uncertainty is propagated through the algorithm to obtain a theoretical upper bound on the estimation error. The error bounds are also used to solve the constructed Least Squares (LS) problems using Robust Least Squares (RLS) algorithms where for a case study the estimation accuracy is analyzed and compared with the estimates obtained using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). It is concluded that the usage of RLS algorithms together with the obtained error bounds increases the estimation quality under certain conditions. Furthermore, to show that these algorithms work, experimental results are preferred over simulation results and therefore an experimental setup is designed. The setup will also be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the estimation algorithms under conditions that are topologically similar to those in a real lithography machine. Finally, the setup has been build and its performance is validated using measurements. From these measurements it is concluded that the setup's specification matches with the designed specifications.
