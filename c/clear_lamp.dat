40|$|Tungsten halogen lamps {{are widely}} used as sources of radiant {{intensity}} because of their compactness and long life. Little is known, however, about their usefulness as secondary standards of radiant intensity. What is unknown is the polar distribution of the emitted light. If it is irregular in space, {{it may be possible}} to use a frosting as a means of providing for a more uniform distribution. In addition, use of a black sleeve over the lamp may be used to control emitted light, and also control the temperature of the lamp. To perform the experiment, a lampholder was designed and constructed, which allows the lamp to be moved on its horizontal and vertical axis. The lampholder was set up on an optical bench along with a foot-candle meter, for lamp testing. Using this set up a <b>clear</b> <b>lamp,</b> and lamps frosted by mechanical buffing and acid treatement were tested for direction characteristics. A black sleeve was designed and constructed and tested with the machine frosted lamp. Experimentation shows favorably tward the fact that a machine frosted lamp can be used as a secondary standard...|$|E

50|$|The QR25DE was {{not only}} sported in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims of the B15 Sentra, but also came in the 2003 Sentra 2.5LE and 2004 Sentra 2.5S. These {{versions}} did not sport any exterior resemblance to the SE-R trims; they clone the exterior and interior of the lower trims (GXE, 1.8S), to include <b>clear</b> head <b>lamps,</b> beige-colored interior cloth, and softer suspension than the SE-R's.

50|$|Lysosome-associated {{membrane}} glycoproteins (lamp) {{are integral}} membrane proteins, specific to lysosomes, and whose exact biological function {{is not yet}} <b>clear.</b> Structurally, the <b>lamp</b> proteins consist of two internally homologous lysosome-luminal domains separated by a proline-rich hinge region; at the C-terminal extremity there is a transmembrane region (TM) followed by a very short cytoplasmic tail (C). In each of the duplicated domains, there are two conserved disulfide bonds. This structure is schematically represented in the figure below.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury vapor lamps {{are more}} energy {{efficient}} than incandescent and most fluorescent lights, with luminous efficacies of 35 to 65 lumens/watt. [...] Their other advantages {{are a long}} bulb lifetime {{in the range of}} 24,000 hours and a high intensity, clear white light output. [...] For these reasons, they are used for large area overhead lighting, such as in factories, warehouses, and sports arenas as well as for streetlights. <b>Clear</b> mercury <b>lamps</b> produce white light with a bluish-green tint due to mercury's combination of spectral lines. [...] This is not flattering to human skin color, so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores. [...] "Color corrected" [...] mercury bulbs overcome this problem with a phosphor {{on the inside of the}} outer bulb that emits white light. They offer better color rendition than the more efficient high or low-pressure sodium vapor lamps.|$|R
5000|$|There seems {{no special}} reason to {{attribute}} to the lampadarii any ecclesiastical character, though their functions were imitated by the acolytes and other clerics who preceded the bishop or celebrant, carrying torches in their hands, in the solemn procession {{to the altar}} and in other processions. There is very little evidence that any strictly liturgical use was made of lamps in the early centuries of Christianity. The {{fact that many of}} the services took place at night, and that after the lapse of a generation or two the meetings of the Christians for purposes of worship were held, at Rome and elsewhere, in the subterranean chambers of the Catacombs, make it <b>clear</b> that <b>lamps</b> must have been used to provide the necessary means of illumination. Of these lamps, mostly of terra cotta and of small size, many specimens survive some of them plain, some decorated with various Christian symbols.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for feeding simuliids artificially in a feeding-tube containing blood {{covered by a}} membrane has been developed {{with a view to}} studying the development of Onchocerca volvulus of man and O. gutturosa of cattle in their respective vectors. A number of different kinds of membranes were tested, but skin from 2 -day-old chicks was found to be most satisfactory. S. ornatum, the vector of O. gutturosa in England, fed readily on human and ox blood. The trials were carried out in a constant-temperature room with artificial lighting supplied by 60 - or 100 -watt <b>clear</b> blue-glass <b>lamps</b> illuminating the feeding-tube with 20 lumens per ft 2. Ultraviolet illumination was not satisfactory but light filtered through coloured screens gave good results {{in the middle of the}} spectrum.

25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate <b>clear</b> cornering <b>lamps</b> had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, Todd Motors {{was even}} more adventurous with the VJ. The base Ranger XL and Charger were updated, as in Australia, with similar NZ-only {{variations}} as the VH but the VJ Regal 770 {{was something of a}} 'parts bin special' and essentially a merger of a VJ Regal with a CH Chrysler. The nose - also used for several hundred VH Chargers built for the Japanese market - combined the CH's four headlamps and grille with VH Valiant sheetmetal (retaining the older, larger, <b>clear</b> park/indicator <b>lamps)</b> {{while the rest of the}} body was as per Australian VJ. Inside, new front seats were CH style, with individual chairs forming a bench shape, and a column automatic shifter was now used. Earlier cars had all-vinyl upholstery but cloth was fitted as standard later. New Zealand VJ Regals also had a vinyl roof in black or beige and the panel between the tail lights was also trimmed in vinyl to match - the vinyl trim could be deleted to order.|$|R

50|$|Ceravision's {{invention}} {{was a clear}} quartz waveguide {{and integrated}} lamp, which forms a single piece construction. The generated light can now be collected because the waveguide is optically <b>clear,</b> giving excellent <b>lamp</b> lumens per watt. The integrated burner and waveguide, which is source of light, is very small meaning {{that it is possible}} to design exceptionally efficient luminaires. HID (high intensity discharge) luminaires have typical utilization efficiencies of 75%. Fluorescent lamp luminaires have efficiencies of 70% - meaning that 25% and 30% respectively of the light produced by the lamp is wasted. The ionCORE(TM) range has utilization efficiencies of more than 90%. The burner is integrated into the thick walled quartz waveguide, high powers from 100 - 5000W's are possible without damage to the lamp.|$|R
