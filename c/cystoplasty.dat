40|$|Augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> (AC) has {{traditionally}} {{been used in the}} treatment of the low capacity, poorly compliant or refractory overactive bladder (OAB). The use of intravesical botulinum toxin and sacral neuromodulation in detrusor overactivity has reduced the number of AC performed for this indication. However, AC remains important in the pediatric and renal transplant setting and still remains a viable option for refractory OAB. Advances in surgical technique have seen the development of both laparoscopic and robotic augmentation <b>cystoplasty.</b> A variety of intestinal segments can be used although ileocystoplasty remains the most common performed procedure. Early complications include thromboembolism and mortality, whereas long-term problems include metabolic disturbance, bacteriuria, urinary tract stones, incontinence, perforation, the need for intermittent self-catheterization and carcinoma.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of HER 2, p 53 and Ki 67 proteins in <b>cystoplasties.</b> METHODS: Sixty rats were distributed randomly into three groups of 20 animals. Bladder augmentation was held to increase with ileum (Group I), colon (Group II) and stomach (Group III). Tissue samples of neobladder was collected from each rat to its own control. The animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks. The neobladder was withdrawn for immunohistochemitry analysis of p 53, HER 2 and Ki 67 expression. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical study. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in {{the expression of}} p 53 and HER 2 proteins. It was observed significant increase (p< 0. 0001) in Ki 67 expression in all groups, when compared with their respective controls. When the study groups were compared with each other, there was increase of cell proliferation in the largest gastrocystoplasties in respect of ileocystoplasties (p= 0. 004) and colocystoplasties (p= 0. 003). CONCLUSION: We observed significant increase of cell proliferation characterized by Ki 67 protein in the digestive tract of the ileocystoplasties, the colocystoplasties and the gastrocystoplasties and this increase was significantly greater in gastrocystoplasties...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{most common}} methods of bladder {{augmentation}} are gastrocystoplasty and enterocystoplasty. Gastrocystoplasty is advantageous due to minimal mucous secretion and a well developed muscular wall {{as well as}} good urodynamic properties of the patch. However, the permanent contact of urine with the gastric mucosa is not free of complications. We report the urodynamic, macroscopic and histological outcomes of a pedicled de-epithelialized gastric patch incorporated in the bladder. We compared the results to those of our previous study, which sought to analyze these techniques of patch coverage using sigmoid patches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed 20 augmentation <b>cystoplasties</b> in the mini-pig model using a pedicled de-epithelialized gastric patch and 5 techniques of patch coverage. RESULTS: Three months after surgery all bladders had an increase in volume except those in which the auto-augmentation technique was used. However, all gastric patches were smaller compared to preoperative size. Many had irregular fibrosed inner surfaces and histological evaluation revealed a fibrosed newly formed submucosal layer with a complete urothelial coverage in every patch. No gastric mucosal remnant was found. CONCLUSIONS: De-epithelialized gastrocystoplasty is an attractive procedure that can increase bladder capacity {{as well as provide}} a complete urothelial lining without mucosal remnants. However, the success of this procedure seems to be limited by increased morbidity and fibrotic changes, and decreased surface of the patch...|$|R

40|$|Augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> is {{evolving}} into a common method of surgical {{treatment for a}} low capacity and/or low compliance neurogenic bladder. Although {{an increasing number of}} successful results have been recently reported, the operative indication of augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> is yet to be established. Herein, we report two cases of neurogenic bladder due to spina bifida which required abandonment of augmentation <b>cystoplasty.</b> The first case was in a 23 -year-old female with a severely deformed bladder and right vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). She refused to undergo ileocystoplasty because we could not assure her of postoperative conception which she eagerly anticipated. The second case was in a 19 -year-old male with a severely deformed bladder and right VUR. He experienced recurrent episodes of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (V-P shunt) difficulty which required exchanging the shunt tube each time, and each exchange proved to be very difficult or nearly impossible. Based on lengthy neurosurgical consultation, we {{came to the conclusion that}} ileocystoplasty was not a preferable treatment of choice for the correction of his disease due to the possibility of V-P shunt infection, which could be fatal. Alternatively, both cases were treated with Cohen's ureteral reimplantation, which resulted in the recurrence of VUR. These cases presented still unresolved issues concerning the operative indication of augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> in spina bifida patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES : To {{study the}} outcome of {{composite}} <b>cystoplasty</b> using cultured urothelial cells combined with de-epithelialized colon or uterus in a porcine surgical model, using appropriate controls, and to characterize the neo-epithelium created by composite <b>cystoplasty.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS : Urothelial cells were isolated and propagated in vitro from open bladder biopsies taken from nine female minipigs. Cohesive sheets of confluent urothelial cells were transferred to polyglactin carrier meshes and sutured to de-epithelialized autologous colon in four animals and de-epithelialized autologous uterus in five. These composite segments were then used for augmentation <b>cystoplasty.</b> Conventional colocystoplasty, de-epithelialized colocystoplasty and sham operations were carried out in six control animals. After killing the animals at ≈ 90 days the bladders were removed for examination and immunohistochemical analysis, using a panel of antibodies against cytokeratins and urothelial differentiation-associated antigens. RESULTS : Macroscopically, the bladders augmented with composite segments derived from uterine muscle had no evidence of shrinkage or contracture. Histological analysis showed that in four of five composite uterocystoplasties, the neo-urothelium was stratified and had a transitional morphology, although in some areas coverage was incomplete. Immunohistochemical analysis showed evidence of squamous differentiation in both native and augmented segments. All composite and de-epithelialized colonic segments showed significant contraction with poor urothelial coverage, reflecting the unsuitability of the thin-walled porcine colon for de-epithelialization. CONCLUSIONS : The functional and macroscopic outcome of bladder augmentation with a composite derived from cultured urothelium and de-epithelialized smooth muscle of uterine origin endorses the feasibility of composite <b>cystoplasty.</b> ...|$|E

The aim {{of this article is to}} describe urodynamic changes after augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> in children with myelomeningocele. Materials and methodsA descriptive cross-sectional study including children aged 8 – 16 years with a myelomeningocele operated on for augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> surgery with sigmoid colon segments due to a neurogenic bladder from the years 2003 – 2013. A urodynamic study was conducted before and after the surgical procedure. Non-probabilistic sample of consecutive cases. Descriptive statistics with frequencies and percentages, medians, and ranges. Inferential intra-group comparison with the Wilcoxon test and inter-group with Mann–Whitney U. SPSS 20. 0 statistical package. ResultsThe study included 50 patients, of whom 25 were male and 25 were female, with a median age of 12 years (range, 6 – 15 years). Bladder capacity improved from 52. 8 % to 95. 9 % (p< 0. 001), uninhibited contractions 1. 4 – 1. 8, contraction intensity 47 – 8. 5 (p< 0. 001), mean pre-surgical and post-surgical filling pressure 40. 8 cmH 2 O and 11. 0 cmH 2 O, respectively (p< 0. 001), mean emptying pressure 48. 5 vs. 3. 6 cmH 2 O (p< 0. 001), and bladder accommodation 4. 6 vs. 41. 3 cmH 2 O (p< 0. 001).

After induction of anesthesia each animal underwent bed side urodynamic study, bladder capacity and bladder pressure was recorded. Then via mid line incision abdominal cavity was entered, right kidney was identified and its capsule was dissected. Bladder augmentation was done by anastomosing the renal capsule to the bladder. After 6 months bed side urodynamic study was performed again and changes in bladder volume and pressure were recorded. Then the animals were sacrificed and the augmented bladders were sent for histopathology evaluation. Results: Mean maximum anatomic bladder capacity before <b>cystoplasty</b> was 334. 00 ± 11. 40 cc which increased to 488. 00 ± 14. 83 cc post-operatively (p= 0. 039).

40|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{about the safety}} of renal transplantation in patients with an augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> because of the possibility of urinary tract infection in immunosuppressed patients leading to pyelonephritis and graft loss. Nevertheless, it is now well known that in patients with a small volume and poorly compliant bladder, reconstructive bladder surgery (augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> or continent reservoir) creates a low-pressure and compliant reservoir, which protects the upper urinary tract and restores a functional lower urinary tract. Graft survival is not adversely affected when a kidney transplant is drained into a reconstructed bladder.

40|$|ABSTRACT Among the {{different}} materials for bladder augmentation, porcine intestinal submucosa (SIS) {{is the most}} widely investigated and stands out for its ability as a cell scaffold.

40|$|Neuropathic bladder in {{children}} is most commonly secondary to spina bifida. The management starts early in life.

40|$|Objective: In our study, we {{aimed to}} compare the cystometric and clinic results of {{patients}} who underwent augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> {{for the treatment of}} a contracted bladder, according to etiological factors such as chronic tuberculosis cystitis (CTC) and spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 26 patients with a contracted bladder due to CTC and SCI who underwent bladder augmentation in our clinic. The contracted bladder etiologies were SCI in 16 of patients (61. 5 %) and TBC in the remaining 10 patients (38. 4 %). The patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: The mean follow-up periods for patients with SCI and CTC were 98. 5 ± 31. 3 and 83. 2 ± 35. 3 months, respectively (p> 0. 05). Patients with SCI and CTC did not significantly differ with respect to the preoperative and postoperative mean bladder capacities or intravesical pressures. As additional postoperative treatments, Clean Intermittent Self-Catheterization (CISC) was performed in 5 (31. 2 %) SCI patients, and anticholinergic treatment was administered to 3 SCI patients (18. 7 %). Anticholinergic treatment was used postoperatively in only one patient with CTC (10 %). Conclusion: Augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> is a useful treatment for patients with SCI and CTC. The postoperative urodynamic studies in these patients were similar. However, the requirement for additional treatments in patients with SCI, including anticholinergic agents and CISC, is more frequent than in patients with CTC in the postoperative period. Therefore, patients with SCI should be warned about additional postoperative treatments before augmentation <b>cystoplasty,</b> and CISC should be taught to these patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEnterocystoplasty is {{associated}} with serious complications resulting from the chronic interaction between intestinal epithelium and urine. Composite <b>cystoplasty</b> is proposed {{as a means of}} overcoming these complications by substituting intestinal epithelium with tissue-engineered autologous urothelium. ObjectiveTo develop a robust surgical procedure for composite <b>cystoplasty</b> and to determine if outcome is improved by transplantation of a differentiated urothelium. Design, setting, and participantsBladder augmentation with in vitro–generated autologous tissues was performed in 11 female Large-White hybrid pigs in a well-equipped biomedical centre with operating facilities. Participants were a team comprising scientists, urologists, a veterinary surgeon, and a histopathologist. MeasurementsUrothelium harvested by open biopsy was expanded in culture and used to develop sheets of nondifferentiated or differentiated urothelium. The sheets were transplanted onto a vascularised, de-epithelialised, seromuscular colonic segment at the time of bladder augmentation. After removal of catheters and balloon at two weeks, voiding behaviour was monitored and animals were sacrificed at 3 months for immunohistology. Results and limitationsEleven pigs underwent augmentation, but four were lost to complications. Voiding behaviour was normal in the remainder. At autopsy, reconstructed bladders were healthy, lined by confluent urothelium, and showed no fibrosis, mucus, calculi, or colonic regrowth. Urothelial morphology was transitional with variable columnar attributes consistent between native and augmented segments. Bladders reconstructed with differentiated cell sheets had fewer lymphocytes infiltrating the lamina propria, indicating more effective urinary barrier function. ConclusionsThe study endorses the potential for composite <b>cystoplasty</b> by (1) successfully developing reliable techniques for transplanting urothelium onto a prepared, vascularised, smooth muscle segment and (2) creating a functional urothelium-lined augmentation to overcome the complications of conventional enterocystoplasty...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} botulinum toxin type A injections in the detrusor muscle in patients {{with spinal cord injury}} and urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity and refractory to anticholinergic agents. Materials and Methods: We prospectively evaluated 22 patients with spinal cord injuries, whose bladders were emptied by intermittent catheterization. All patients had detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence that proved difficult to treat, despite using high doses of two different anticholinergics. The pre-treatment assessment included a complete urodynamic study and ultrasonography of the kidneys and urinary tract. A one-month follow-up was completed with urodynamic evalu-ation and the clinical response was evaluated through outpatient consultations and telephone contact. Results: After the procedure, the maximum cystometric capacity and the bladder reflex volume increased, whereas the maximum detrusor pressure and compliance decreased. The mean duration of continence was 7 ± 7 months. In 18 patients (81. 8 %), it was necessary to administer anticholinergics to achieve continence. Five patients (22. 7 %) had indication of reinjection, and augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> was indicated in 9 patients (40. 9 %). Conclusion: The use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity refractory to anticholinergics is an option before more invasive treatments, such as augmentation <b>cystoplasty,</b> are attempted. In our study {{as well as in the}} literature, there was improvement in most urodynamic parameters.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the outcomes and effectiveness of clam augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> in the treatment of patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction refractory to pharmacological and other conservative therapy. Material and Methods. A retrospective review of 53 patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction who underwent clam augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> in a period of 11 years was performed. Patients were categorized in four groups. In group A were included 9 patients with hyperreflexic or low compliance bladder with detrusor/sphincter dyssynergia and normal upper urinary tract. In group B were included 11 patients with hyporeflexic low compliance bladder and normal upper urinary tract. In group C 17 patients with hyperreflexic or low compliance with normal sphincteric function and normal upper urinary tract and group D included 16 patients with high pressure bladder and upper urinary tract deterioration. Results. Ileocystoplasty and sigmoidocystoplasty was applied in 47 and 6 patients respectively. Complete continence or an improvement of incontinence was achieved in 44 and in 4 patients respectively. There was a significant improvement in bladder capacity from a mean 114 ml preoperatively to 367 ml postoperatively. Maximum detrusor pressure under 40 H 2 O was achieved in 48 patients. Preoperatively vesico-ureteric reflux resolved or improved in 11 out of 12 patients. Permanent and periodical CIC were applied to 5 and 4 group A patients respectively. Only 2 group B patients required periodical CIC treatment combined with per os use of a-agonists. No group C patient required CIC, who, on the contrary, were applied to all group D patients.

40|$|Management of end-stage bladder {{failure is}} complicated; the low {{capacity}} and non-compliant bladder increases urinary back-pressure to the kidneys, resulting in renal failure, and causes intractable incontinence. Once conservative and medical treatments have failed, bladder reconstructive surgery is offered. The gold standard treatment is enterocystoplasty, which involves augmentation of the bladder with enteric tissue. Although increasing capacity and compliance of the bladder, the procedure {{carries with it}} a number of serious complications attributable to exposure of the bowel mucosa to urine, chief among which is the risk of malignant transformation. The purpose of this thesis was to compare the current treatment with composite <b>cystoplasty,</b> a novel tissue-engineering technique designed to create a neobladder lined by urothelium. Patients who had undergone conventional enterocystoplasty provided biopsies of native and augmented segments of bladder for histological and immunohistochemical analysis, to allow the cellular consequences of the procedure to be assessed. For composite <b>cystoplasty,</b> urothelial cells were retrieved from pigs during open bladder biopsy. The cells were propagated in culture and induced to differentiate, defined by cell stratification, expression of immunohistochemical markers of terminal differentiation, elevated transepithelial resistance and low permeability. The cells were harvested as sheets, implanted onto vascularised, de-epithelialised porcine colon and the complex used to augment the urinary bladder. Assessment of human enterocystoplasty biopsies revealed significant morphological changes in the bowel, reflecting a protective response, with villous atrophy and increased goblet cell population. Areas of inflammation were evident in some patients. In the pigs, all bowel grafts were lined with urothelium, characterised by the expression of urothelium-specific markers. There {{was no evidence of}} scarring, colonic regrowth or metaplasia. It is proposed that composite <b>cystoplasty</b> can lead to the rapid establishment of a urinary barrier in vivo which, by ensuring urothelial continuity throughout the bladder, will not be associated with the serious complications resulting from bowel mucosal exposure to urine.

40|$|Summary: The bladder urothelium {{functions}} as a urine-blood barrier and consists of basal, intermediate, and superficial cell populations. Reconstructive procedures such as augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> and focal mucosal resection involve localized surgical damage to the bladder wall whereby focal segments of the urothelium and underlying submucosa are respectively removed or replaced and regeneration ensues. We demonstrate using lineage-tracing systems that urothelial regeneration following augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> with acellular grafts exclusively depends on host keratin 5 -expressing basal cells to repopulate all lineages of the de novo urothelium at implant sites. Conversely, repair of focal mucosal defects not only employs this mechanism, but in parallel host intermediate cell daughters expressing uroplakin 2 give rise to themselves and are also contributors to superficial cells in neotissues. These results highlight the diversity of urothelial regenerative responses to surgical injury and may lead to advancements in bladder tissue engineering approaches. : In this article, Mauney and colleagues show the source of urothelial progenitors utilized during bladder regeneration {{is dependent on the}} nature of injury. Fate-mapping experiments reveal that host basal and intermediate cell progeny differentially contribute to de novo urothelial formation in bladder augmentation and mucosal resection settings.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{develop a}} robust sterile, fully demucosalized and vascularized seromuscular patch {{for use as}} an adjunct to novel {{bioengineering}} techniques aimed at augmenting, reconstructing, or replacing the bladder because of endstage disease. To eliminate deep colonic epithelial crypts to prevent the possibility of colonocyte regrowth. To maintain sterility by excluding the possibility of contamination from the bowel contents. MethodsPilot studies were performed on euthanized pigs to optimize the technique, with tissue samples examined by immunohistochemistry. In vivo, vascularized seromuscular colonic flaps were created from the bowel exterior in 7 large white hybrid pigs. The dissection was facilitated by placing an inflated Foley catheter within the colonic lumen. The seromuscular ends were approximated with 5 / 0 Vicryl sutures and excess mucosa intussuscepted within the lumen. Demucosalized flaps were used to augment the bladder by composite <b>cystoplasty</b> and were examined immunohistochemically at 3 months. ResultsPilot studies showed that the technique was successful in creating seromuscular segments with no epithelial remnants. When applied surgically, the seromuscular flaps survived and showed no evidence of colonocyte regrowth at 3 months.

Although some important {{progress has been made}} in tissue engineering AC, conventional AC still has an important role in the surgical treatment of refractory neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to ureterosigmoidostomy no reliable clinical data exist for tumor risk in {{different forms of}} urinary diversion using isolated intestinal segments. In 44 German urological departments, operation frequencies, indications, patient age, and operation dates of the different forms of urinary diversion, operated between 1970 and 2007, could be registered. The secondary tumors up to 2009 were registered as well and related to the numbers of the different forms of urinary diversions resulting in tumor prevalences. In 17, 758 urinary diversions 32 secondary tumors occurred. The tumor risk in ureterosigmoidostomy (22 -fold) and <b>cystoplasty</b> (13 -fold) is significantly higher than in other continent forms of urinary diversion such as neobladders or pouches (p< 0. 0001). The difference between ureterosigmoidostomy and <b>cystoplasty</b> is not significant, nor {{is the difference between}} ileocecal pouches (0. 14 %) and ileal neobladders (0. 05 %) (p= 0. 46). The tumor risk in ileocecal (1. 26 %) and colonic neobladders (1. 43 %) is significantly higher (p= 0. 0001) than in ileal neobladders (0. 5 %). Of the 16 tumors that occurred following ureterosigmoidostomy, 16 (94 %) developed directly at the ureterocolonic borderline in {{contrast to}} only 50 % following urinary diversions via isolated intestinal segments. From postoperative year 5 regular endoscopic controls of ureterosigmoidostomies, cystoplasties, and orthotopic (ileo-) colonic neobladders are necessary. In ileocecal pouches, regular endoscopy is necessary at least in the presence of symptoms or should be performed routinely at greater intervals. Following neobladders or conduits, only urethroscopies for urethral recurrence are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Partial/extended partial {{cystectomy}} (EPC) is {{the most}} common surgery done for localized urachal malignancies. However, sometimes, after EPC, patients may be left with small bladder remnant, reconstruction of which will result in very small capacity bladder with resultant severe storage voiding symptoms. We report a case of urachal adenocarcinoma, in which when a small bladder remnant was left post-EPC, instead of proceeding with radical cystectomy (RC) and neobladder (the standard alternative), bladder augmentation was done with good oncological and voiding outcome. Augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> has many advantages over neobladder and we suggest it as an oncologically comparable alternative to RC with neobladder, which has been underutilized in urachal malignancies as we found on literature review...|$|E
40|$|Low {{compliance}} bladder with a posterior urethral valve is {{a common}} association. Augmentation <b>cystoplasty</b> {{is one of the}} management options. We present the case report of a 4 -y-old boy who presented with low compliance blad-der, bladder diverticulum, right obstructive megaureter, and left grade IV reflux, 6 mo following PUV fulguration. He was managed by laparoscopic diverticulocystoplasty with right ureteric reimplantation and left detrusorrhaphy. The patient showed subjective and urodynamic improve-ment at 12 mo follow-up. The use of diverticulum for augmentation is advantageous, as it abides by the princi-ple of bladder augmentation with urothelium. This is the first case report of successful use of diverticulum for lapa-roscopic bladder augmentation in a child...|$|E
