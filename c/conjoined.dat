5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in <b>conjoined</b> twins, and <b>conjoined</b> sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E
5|$|Phips and Increase Mather were odd-fellows, {{without much}} in common, {{but they had}} become {{politically}} <b>conjoined</b> to the new charter, {{and it would be}} their job to sell it to the people of Massachusetts who were expecting their agents to return with nothing less than the old charter restored.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conjoin</b> {{analyses}} of stone artefacts have been employed {{to assess the}} stratigraphic integrity of rockshelter deposits in Australia. Paradoxically, no comparable studies are available for open coastal midden sites despite frequent reference to this site type as stratigraphically problematic. In this paper we present preliminary results of a <b>conjoin</b> (or valve-pairing) analysis of the bivalve Anadara trapezia (mud ark or Sydney cockle) excavated from the Seven Mile Creek Mound in central Queensland. Attributes for identifying probable <b>conjoins</b> were established through a study of 158 articulated A. trapezia specimens recovered from the Seven Mile Creek Mound. We demonstrate that although articulated A. trapezia exhibit considerable valve dimorphism, umbo length and weight reliably reduced the field of probable <b>conjoins</b> which can then be manually refitted for confirmation. A total of 56 <b>conjoining</b> valve-pairs were identified {{out of a total}} of 608 whole A. trapezia valves...|$|R

5|$|Castor and Pollux– An elderly <b>conjoined</b> twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who could see her. When Kratos {{attempted}} {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, the twin made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could not see her. After crushing the Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed the twin and took the amulet. Castor and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E

5|$|In {{downtown}} Jackson, Michigan Avenue continues into downtown while M-50 is routed {{around the}} city center along paired one-way streets. Washington Street carries eastbound traffic and the Louis Glick Highway. On {{the east side of}} downtown, the roads merge near the Jackson Amtrak station and a junction with M-106 on Cooper Street, where M-50 turns south and then southeast as Brooklyn Road. On the south side of Jackson, M-50 and US127 meet up once again just east of Vandercook Lake. M-50 follows the US127 freeway through a pair of <b>conjoined</b> partial interchanges before M-50 heads east away from Vandercook Lake.|$|E

5|$|NY9N and NY22 head {{generally}} northward {{through an}} area of lowlands, which eventually give way to Lake Champlain as the <b>conjoined</b> routes pass into the town of Crown Point. Once again, NY9N serves as the lakeside highway as it follows {{the western edge of}} the lake through the hamlet of Crown Point to the peninsula that gives the town its name. While NY9N and NY22 pass by Crown Point to the west, NY185 directly serves the peninsula and the Crown Point State Historic Site, located at its tip.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route222 (NY222) is an east–west {{state highway}} in central New York in the United States. It runs from an {{intersection}} with NY38 {{in the village}} of Groton in northeastern Tompkins County to a junction with the <b>conjoined</b> routes of U.S. Route11, NY13, and NY41 in the city of Cortland in western Cortland County. NY222 passes through the town of Cortlandville, where it intersects NY281 and serves Cortland County–Chase Field Airport. The road was acquired by the state of New York in the early 20th century and designated NY222 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

5000|$|For non-defective Unicode strings not {{starting}} with a Hangul vowel or trailing <b>conjoining</b> jamo, the normal forms are closed under string concatenation: the concatenation of two well-formed Unicode strings in the same normal form will itself be in that normal form. This is because a non-defective Unicode string never begins with a combining character and the only two kinds of non-combining characters, which may interact with preceding characters during composition, are Korean vowel <b>conjoining</b> jamos and trailing <b>conjoining</b> jamos. Note, however, {{that this is not}} true of arbitrary strings: accents are canonically ordered and may be rearranged around the point where the strings are joined (for example, concatenating [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] will produce [...] "", but the correct normalization is [...] "").|$|R
5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests {{that it should be}} considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons <b>conjoined</b> together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E

The name remains for three blocks before NY812 departs the village. Farther north, NY812 passes by the Ogdensburg International Airport before meeting NY37 at an interchange just south of the Ogdensburg city limits. NY812 joins NY37 here, following the route through the southern reaches of the city. The <b>conjoined</b> routes intersect NY68 before separating near the northeastern city limits.

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine, Pennatomys {{is known}} {{from a number}} of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and postcranial bones are represented. Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known only from fragments. The nasal bones extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the maxillary, frontal, and lacrimal bones meet, and have a blunt back margin. The nasals extend slightly further back than the premaxillaries. The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes Pennatomys from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals). The interorbital region of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper molar (M1). The incisive foramina, openings in the bony palate, extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process—a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower incisor. Below the molars, the upper and lower masseteric ridges (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes <b>conjoined</b> towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1). The <b>conjoined</b> crests are one of the synapomorphic (shared-derived) characters of the Nectomys subclade.|$|E

30|$|Conjoinment {{focuses on}} the {{exchange}} of business information between the domains of the collaborating parties. Consequently, the business processes within the domains contain equal conjoinment constructs. One-directional <b>conjoining</b> implies {{that there is one}} out-, or in-directed information exchange between the domains of a service consumer and provider. Bi-directional <b>conjoining</b> is initiated by an out-directed information exchange to the domain of the collaborating counterpart who returns the communication exchange immediately to the initiating party.|$|R
