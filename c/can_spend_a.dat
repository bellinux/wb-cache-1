He complies and is subsequently suspended from his job. When the ED becomes understaffed, Lofty volunteers to help out and is allowed to return to work permanently. Lofty controversially refuses to buy a remembrance poppy, resulting in disagreements with his colleagues, especially Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), who is a former soldier. However, he is praised when he endangers himself to save a teenage boy, despite the boy dying from an unrelated problem.|$|E

60|$|There {{is nothing}} morbid or narrow in Burns's letters. They are frank and healthy. You <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> day over them, and feel {{at the end}} of it as if you had been {{wandering}} at large through the freedom of nature. They seem to have been written in the open air. The first condition necessary to an appreciative understanding of them is to concern yourself with the sentiment. And, indeed, the strength and sincerity of the sentiment by-and-by draw you away to oblivion of the style, however much it may at first strike you as redundant and affected. They are not the letters of a literary man. They have nothing suggestive of the studious chamber and the midnight lamp. There is often a narrowness of idea in the merely literary man which limits his auditory to men of his peculiar pattern. To this narrowness Burns, with all his faults of style, was a stranger. His letters are the utterances of a man who refused to be imprisoned in any single department of human thought. He was no specialist, pinned to one standpoint, and making the width of the world commensurate with the narrowness of his own horizon. He moved about, he looked abroad; he had no pet subject, no restricted field of study; nature and human nature in their multitudinous phases and many retreats were his range, and he expressed his views as freely and vigorously as he took them.|$|E
60|$|Show me {{anything}} that would make an infant smile, and you shall behold a gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage. I <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> pleasant hour in the sun watching the sports of the village children {{on the edge of}} the surf. Now they chase the retreating wave far down over the wet sand; now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet; now it comes onward with threatening front, and roars after the laughing crew as they scamper beyond its reach. Why should not an old man be merry too, when the great sea is at play with those little children? I delight, also, to follow in the wake of a pleasure-party of young men and girls strolling along the beach after an early supper at the Point. Here, with handkerchiefs at nose, they bend over a heap of eel-grass entangled in which is a dead skate so oddly accoutred with two legs and a long tail that they mistake him for a drowned animal. A few steps farther the ladies scream, and the gentlemen make ready to protect them against a young shark of the dogfish kind rolling with a lifelike motion in the tide that has thrown him up. Next they are smit with wonder at the black shells of a wagon-load of live lobsters packed in rock-weed for the country-market. And when they reach the fleet of dories just hauled ashore after the day's fishing, how do I laugh in my sleeve, and sometimes roar outright, at the simplicity of these young folks and the sly humor of the fishermen! In winter, when our village is thrown into a bustle by the arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers bargaining for frozen fish to be transported hundreds of miles and eaten fresh in Vermont or Canada, I am a pleased but idle spectator in the throng. For I launch my boat no more.|$|E

60|$|There {{is in this}} {{incident}} {{a glimpse of the}} character of our author which endears him to us all.

6000|$|Devoted {{to trade}} {{and become a}} people of brokers, of go-betweens, of middle-men, the Mpongwe have now {{acquired}} an ease and propriety, a polish and urbanity of manner which contrasts strongly with the Kru-men and other tribes, who, despite generations of intercourse with Europeans, are rough and barbarous as their forefathers. The youths used to learn English, which they spoke fluently and with tolerable accent, but always barbarously; they are more successful with the easier neo-Latin tongues. Their one aim in life is not happiness, but [...] "trust," [...] an African practice unwisely encouraged by Europeans; so Old Calabar {{but a few years}} ago was not a trust-river," [...] and consequently the consul and the gunboat had little to do there.

Labourers are hired at the rate of two to three dollars per mensem, and gangs would easily be collected if one of the chiefs were placed in command. No sum of money will buy a free-born Mpongwe, and the sale is forbidden by the laws of the land.

6000|$|The Castle {{itself is}} so vast that I really can't {{describe}} it in [...] detail. So I am waiting till you come; {{and then you}} and I will go [...] over it together and learn all that we can about it. We shall take [...] Rooke with us, and, as {{he is supposed to}} know every part of it, from [...] the keep to the torture-chamber, we <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> few days over it. Of [...] course, I have been over most of it, since I came--that, is, I went [...] at various times to see different portions--the battlements, the [...] bastions, the old guard-room, the hall, the chapel, the walls, the [...] roof. And I have been through some of the network of rock passages. [...] Uncle Roger must have spent a mint of money on it, so far as I can [...] see; and though I am not a soldier, I have been in so many places [...] fortified in different ways that I am not entirely ignorant of the [...] subject. He has restored it in such an up-to-date way that it is [...] practically impregnable to anything under big guns or a siege-train. [...] He has {{gone so far as to}} have certain outworks and the keep covered [...] with armoured plating of what looks like harveyized steel. You will [...] wonder when you see it. But as yet I really know only a few rooms, [...] and am familiar with only one--my own room. The drawing-room--not [...] the great hall, which is a vast place; the library--a magnificent [...] one, but in sad disorder--we must get a librarian some day to put it [...] in trim; and the drawing-room and boudoir and bedroom suite which I [...] have selected for you, are all fine. But my own room is what suits [...] me best, though I do not think you would care for it for yourself. [...] If you do, you shall have it. It was Uncle Roger's own room when he [...] stayed here; living in it for a few days served to give me more [...] insight to his character--or rather to his mind--than I could have [...] otherwise had. It is just the kind of place I like myself; so, [...] naturally, I understand the other chap who liked it too. It is a [...] fine big room, not quite within the Castle, but an outlying part of [...] it. It is not detached, or anything of that sort, but is a sort of [...] garden-room built on to it. There seems to have been always some [...] sort of place where it is, for the passages and openings inside seem [...] to accept or recognize it. It can be shut off if necessary--it would [...] be in case of attack--by a great slab of steel, just like the door of [...] a safe, which slides from inside the wall, and can be operated from [...] either inside or outside--if you know how. That is from my room or [...] from within the keep. The mechanism is a secret, and no one but [...] Rooke and I know it. The room opens out through a great French [...] window--the French window is modern, I take it, and was arranged by [...] or for Uncle Roger; I think there must have been always a large [...] opening there, for centuries at least--which opens on a wide terrace [...] or balcony of white marble, extending right and left. From this a [...] white marble stair lies straight in front of the window, and leads [...] down to the garden. The balcony and staircase are quite ancient--of [...] old Italian work, beautifully carved, and, of course, weather-worn [...] through centuries. There is just that little tinging of green here [...] and there which makes all outdoor marble so charming. It is hard to [...] believe at times that it is a part of a fortified castle, it is so [...] elegant and free and open. The first glance of it would make a [...] burglar's heart glad. He would say to himself: [...] "Here is the sort of [...] crib I like when I'm on the job. You can just walk in and out as you [...] choose." [...] But, Aunt Janet, old Roger was cuter than any burglar. He [...] had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled [...] burglar. There are two steel shields which can slide out from the [...] wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window. [...] One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond-shaped [...] lozenges. Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through; and yet [...] you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view--much the [...] same as you ladies can see through your veils. The other is a great [...] sheet of steel, which slides out in a similar way in different [...] grooves. It is not, of course, so heavy and strong as the safe-door [...] which covers the little opening in the main wall, but Rooke tells me [...] it is proof against the heaviest rifle-hall.|$|E
