5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a <b>catheter</b> to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. <b>Catheter</b> angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz <b>catheter,</b> a flexible, spring-wound <b>catheter</b> {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound <b>catheter</b> to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
40|$|An agar {{subcutaneous}} infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), {{was developed}} to assess the ability of antimicrobial <b>catheters</b> to resist microbial colonization. The <b>catheters</b> were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The <b>catheters</b> implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21.

40|$|To {{determine}} the incidence rate of complications associated with vascular <b>catheters</b> {{in intensive care}} unit patients and to analyze risk factors for a positive vascular culture, we performed a multicenter study of intensive care unit patients at eight French hospitals. During the study period, 865 intravenous <b>catheters</b> were inserted in 566 patients; 362 (41. 8 %) were peripheral <b>catheters,</b> and 503 (58. 2 %) were central <b>catheters.</b> Local complications (i. e., infiltration) occurred significantly more often with peripheral than with central <b>catheters</b> (P less than 0. 001); in contrast, fever and bacteremia were significantly more often associated with central than with peripheral <b>catheters</b> (P less than 0. 01 and P less than 0. 05, respectively). The culture of the vascular-catheter tip was positive for 24 % of central <b>catheters</b> (32 of 1, 000 <b>catheters</b> days) and for 9 % of peripheral <b>catheters</b> (21 of 1, 000 <b>catheters</b> days). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common microorganism isolated from both peripheral and central <b>catheters,</b> followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No significant risk factor associated with positive cultures for peripheral <b>catheters</b> was found by univariate analysis. In contrast, the purpose of the cannula (nutrition and monitoring of central venous pressure), the insertion site (jugular), the dressing type (semipermeable transparent dressing), the antiseptic used to prepare the insertion site (povidone iodine), and routine changing of the intravenous administration set were significantly associated with positive cultures of central <b>catheters.</b> Three factors, duration of catheterization, use of a semipermeable transparent dressing, and the jugular insertion site, were found to be independently associated with positive cultures of central <b>catheters</b> by multivariate analysis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{complication}} rates between umbilical central venous <b>catheters</b> and peripherally inserted central venous <b>catheters</b> in newborns and {{to investigate whether}} other variables might increase complication rates. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: A Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Newborns (gestational age 24 - 42 weeks). METHODS: All central venous catheter-related complications were retrospectively analyzed in newborns. The differences in survival rates between {{the two types of}} central venous <b>catheters</b> were evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with removal because of complications as the event of interest. RESULTS: In total, 140 umbilical venous <b>catheters</b> and 63 peripherally inserted central <b>catheters</b> were included. There {{were no significant differences in}} removals due to complications between the two <b>catheters.</b> The central line-associated bloodstream infections had the highest complication incidence, followed by obstruction, dislocation, leakage, and extravasation. There were no influences of gestational age, birth weight, and the use of subsequent <b>catheters</b> on the complication incidence. CONCLUSION: A high complication incidence resulted in removal of the <b>catheters,</b> but it was not significantly different between the two <b>catheters.</b> The prevention of complications should be an important goal in the daily care of infants in the NICU...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in the treatment of hydrocephalus and is associated with significant medical cost. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic-impregnated (AI) shunt <b>catheters</b> in reducing CSF shunt infection; however, providers remain reluctant to adopt AI <b>catheters</b> into practice because of the increased upfront cost. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if the use of AI <b>catheters</b> provided cost savings in a large nationwide database. MethodsHospital discharge and billing records from the Premier Perspective Database from 2003 – 2009 were retrospectively reviewed to identify all adult and pediatric patients undergoing de novo ventricular shunt placement. The incidence of shunt infection within 1 year of implantation was determined. Shunt infection–related cost was defined as all inpatient billing costs incurred during hospitalization for treatment of shunt infection. ResultsIn 287 U. S. hospitals, 10, 819 adult (AI <b>catheters,</b> 963; standard <b>catheters,</b> 9856) and 1770 pediatric (AI <b>catheters,</b> 229; standard <b>catheters,</b> 1541) patients underwent ventricular shunt placement. AI <b>catheters</b> were associated with significant reduction in infection for both adult (2. 2 % vs. 3. 6 %, P = 0. 02) and pediatric (2. 6 % vs. 7. 1 %, P < 0. 01) patients. Total infection-related costs were $ 17, 371, 320 ($ 45, 714 ± $ 49, 745 per shunt infection) for adult patients and $ 6, 508, 064 ($ 56, 104 ± $ 65, 746 per shunt infection) for pediatric patients. Infection-related cost per 100 de novo shunts placed was $ 120, 534 for AI <b>catheters</b> and $ 162, 659 for standard <b>catheters</b> in adult patients and $ 165, 087 for AI <b>catheters</b> and $ 395, 477 for standard <b>catheters</b> in pediatric patients. ConclusionsIn analysis of this large, nationwide database, AI <b>catheters</b> were found to be associated with a significant reduction in infection incidence, resulting in tremendous cost savings.

5|$|Some {{risk factors}} {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk.

5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections.

The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing.
