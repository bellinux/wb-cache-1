40|$|The {{relationship}} between magnetic properties and magnetic domain structures of Sm(Fe, Cu, Zr, Co) 7. 5 magnet was investigated. The developed Sm-Co magnet, which is conducted homogenization heat treatment at ingot state, {{high temperature short time}} sintering and long time solid {{solution heat treatment}} showed the maximum energy product, [BH]m of 34. 0 MGOe and the <b>coercivity,</b> <b>Hcb</b> of 11. 3 kOe at 20 °C respectively. Moreover, Hcb of 10. 6 kOe at 150 °C was achieved. Heat treated ingot has clear 1 - 7 phase in mother phase from optical microscope observation. Kerr effect microscope with magnetic field applied was used to investigate magnetic domain structure. Reverse magnetic domains were generated evenly but generation of them from inside grain were not observed. Cell structure was observed by scanning transmission electron microscope and composition analysis was conducted by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Cell size was approximately 150 ∼ 300 nm, Fe and Cu were clearly separated and concentrated to 2 - 17 phase and 1 - 5 phase respectively. Moreover, Cu concentration went up to 40 at% in 1 - 5 phase. That means the gap of domain wall energy between 1 - 5 phase and 2 - 17 phase was increased due to microstructure control by conducting heat treatment for compositional homogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The largest {{coercivity}} in the Nd–Fe–B {{system was}} achieved by systematically tailoring the microstructure from strongly interacting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains to magnetically isolated Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains in a Nd-rich matrix. The crystal structure, phase purity and magnetic properties of the Nd–Fe–B samples were extensively measured. In particular energy-filtered images, using spatially resolved measurements of inner-shell ionization edges, was critical in evaluating the particle shapes (platelets with the crystallographic c-axis normal to the plate), size (B 100 40 25 nm) and distribution. For randomly oriented, non-interacting particles, the largest observed <b>coercivity,</b> m 0 <b>HcB</b> 2 : 75 T is B 83 % of the theoretical limit expected for Stoner–Wohlfarth coherent rotation behavior including demagnetization effects. Initial magnetization curves of thermally demagnetized Nd–Fe–B samples show a systematic increase in susceptibility {{with an increase in}} Nd concentration {{as a result of a}} competition between contributions from strongly interacting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with grain sizes smaller or equal to the magnetic domain size and completely isolated multidomain Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains. The possible coercivity mechanisms in such Nd–Fe–B samples are discussed. Crown Copyright...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{finding in}} the early 1980 s, the {{interest}} in NdFeB-based magnets has expanded continuously. NdFeB magnets {{can be found in}} voice coil motors (VCM) for computer hard disc drives or automobiles; for example 2 kg of NdFeB are being used in the Toyota Prius for motors and generators. Currently, sintered NdFeB-based magnets possess the highest energy product (BHmax). Responsible for the high coercivity, high remanence and the large energy product is the microstructure of the magnets, consisting of mainly two different phases: the magnetic phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B and a non-ferromagnetic Nd-rich phase. The ideal NdFeB magnet would contain small, regular shaped grains of Nd 2 Fe 14 B isolated by a thin layer of Nd-rich grain boundary phase. Mostly, NdFeB-magnets are produced either via pressing / cold isostatic pressing (CIP). Here bonded isotropic magnets with limited properties but complicated designs or sintered anisotropic magnets with limited geometries but maximum magnetic properties are being produced. The Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) process would allow a combination of both: high magnetic properties and complicated designs. A production of large numbers at low cost is possible. This study evaluates the possibility of producing isotropic and anisotropic NdFeB-based magnets via MIM process. Here the liquid phase sintering (LPS) plays the most important role in producing a useful microstructure and therefore good magnetic properties. Different sintering parameters were investigated to achieve the highest energy product. Here for anisotropic magnets a (BH) max of about 300 kJ/m 3 along with a remanence of around 1. 2 T and <b>coercivities</b> of <b>HcB</b> > 900 kA/m and HcJ > 2000 kA/m was accomplished; respectively for the isotropic magnets a (BH) max of 55 kJ/m 3 and a iHc of above 1400 kA/m. The influence of the oxygen and carbon content on the magnetic properties caused by MIM was analyzed. The MIM samples were compared to magnets produced via CIP, containing the same initial powder, sintering parameters etc...|$|R
