40|$|This study {{aimed to}} resolve if {{basement}} membrane (BM) collagen alpha chains undergo remodeling during oral. carcinogenesis. Using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy, {{we found that}} BMs in oral epithelial dysplasias (OED: mild, n= 10; moderate, n= 10; severe, n= 10) and carcinoma in situ (CIS) (n= 10) differed from normal mucosa (n= 6) and oral epithelial hyperplasia (n= 5) in showing: (1) excessive lamina densa-like material ultrastructurally, and (2) stronger immunoexpression for alpha 5 (IV) than for alpha 1 (IV), alpha 2 (IV), and alpha 6 (IV) chains-findings that implicate these molecules' role as an adhesive template for the attachment and persistence of basal dysplastic cells. Incipient loss of BM integrity in CIS, where alpha 5 (IV) /alpha 6 (IV) chains were more frequently absent than alpha 1 (IV) /alpha 2 (IV) chains, suggests that alpha(IV) network disruption is crucial for progression of dysplastic cells into the extracellular <b>compartment,</b> <b>marking</b> transition into the invasive phase. In carcinomatous BM, the disappearance of alpha(IV) chains was more severe in poorly differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (n= 10) than in well-differentiated OSCC (n= 10). In all samples examined, alpha 3 (IV) and alpha 4 (IV) chains were absent. These findings taken together suggest that BM collagen-IV alpha chains undergo remodeling where selective increase and loss of these molecules are probably early and late events, respectively, during progression of oral dysplasia to cancer.

40|$|SummaryThe {{reproducible}} {{pattern of}} organismal growth during metazoan {{development is the}} product of genetically controlled signaling pathways. Patterned activation of these pathways shapes developing organs and dictates overall organismal shape and size. Here, we show that patches of tissue that are mutant for the Drosophila Tsg 101 ortholog, erupted, cause dramatic overproliferation of adjacent wild-type tissue. Tsg 101 proteins function in endosomal sorting and are required to incorporate late endosomes into multivesicular bodies. Drosophila cells with impaired Tsg 101 function show accumulation of the Notch receptor in intracellular <b>compartments</b> <b>marked</b> by the endosomal protein Hrs. This causes increased Notch-mediated signaling and ectopic expression of the Notch target gene unpaired (upd), which encodes the secreted ligand of the JAK-STAT pathway.

To address the role of PIKfyve in trafficking processes, we examined {{the functioning of the}} biosynthetic, endocytic, and recycling pathways in stable human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines inducibly expressing the wild-type or kinase-defective dominant-negative form. PIKfyveWT or PIKfyveK 1831 E expression did not affect the processing and lysosomal targeting of newly synthesized procathepsin D. Likewise the rates of transferrin uptake/recycling or epidermal growth factor receptor degradation were not altered upon expression of either protein. In contrast, PIKfyveK 1831 E but not PIKfyveWT expression markedly impaired the late uptake of fluid phase marker horseradish peroxidase. Inspection of the organelle morphology by confocal microscopy with specific markers in COS cells transiently expressing PIKfyveK 1831 E showed the Golgi apparatus, end lysosomes, and the recycling compartment indistinguishable from nontransfected cells, despite the dramatic PIKfyveK 1831 E-induced endomembrane vacuolation.

40|$|Previously we {{have shown}} that PDGF {{receptor}} mutants that do not bind PI- 3 kinase internalize after ligand binding, but fail to downregulate and degrade. To define further the role of PI- 3 kinase in trafficking processes in mammalian cells, we have investigated {{the effects of a}} potent inhibitor of PI- 3 kinase activity, wortmannin. At nanomolar concentrations, wortmannin inhibited both the transfer of PDGF receptors from peripheral compartments to juxtanuclear vesicles, and their subsequent degradation. In contrast, the delivery of soluble phase markers to lysosomes, assessed by the accumulation of Lucifer yellow (LY) in perinuclear vesicles after 120 min of incubation, was not blocked by wortmannin. Furthermore, wortmannin did not affect the rate of transferrin uptake, and caused only a small decrease in its rate of recycling. Thus, the effects of wortmannin on PDGFr trafficking are much more pronounced than its effects on other endocytic events. Unexpectedly, wortmannin also caused a striking effect on the morphology of endosomal <b>compartments,</b> <b>marked</b> by tubulation and enlargement of endosomes containing transferrin or LY. This effect was somewhat similar to that produced by brefeldin A, and was also blocked by pre-treatment of cells with aluminum fluoride (AlF 4 -). These results suggest two sites in the endocytic pathway where PI- 3 kinase activity may be required: (a) to sort PDGF receptors from peripheral compartments to the lysosomal degradative pathway; and (b) to regulate the structure of endosomes containing lysosomally directed and recycling molecules. This latter function could be mediated through the activation of AlFt 4 -) -sensitive GTP-binding proteins downstream of PI- 3 kinase...|$|R

The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species.

As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels.

30|$|Combined photoactivation and {{bleaching}} is {{also used}} to study the transfer of mitochondrial proteins of the IMM, OMM, IMS, and matrix and of nucleoids between mitochondria, the targeted <b>compartment</b> can be <b>marked</b> with red fluorescence in combination with mtPAGFP, or alternatively PAGFP targeted to the sub-compartment of interest can be combined with mtDsRed. In the former case, mitochondrial fusion events can be recognized by the change of PAGFP FI, and the transfer of targeted proteins can be studied by observing the red fluorescence signal among the two mitochondria undergoing mitochondrial fusion. For instance, Tfam-DsRed marking mtDNA and mtPAGFP were combined to show the transfer of mtDNA nucleoids among mitochondria (Yang et al. 2015). Also, TMRM measurements of Δ_m and mtPAGFP were combined to show that mitochondria with lower Δ_m are less likely to undergo fusion (Twig et al. 2008).|$|R
5|$|The {{goods service}} at {{individual}} stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 {{the line between}} Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling <b>Mark</b> I <b>compartment</b> coaches, later <b>Mark</b> II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{proto-oncogene}} SKI {{is highly}} expressed in human myeloid leukemia {{and also in}} murine hematopoietic stem cells. However, its operative relevance in these cells remains elusive. We have over-expressed SKI to define its intrinsic role in hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms, {{which resulted in a}} robust competitive advantage upon transplantation, a complete dominance of the stem and progenitor <b>compartments,</b> and a <b>marked</b> enhancement of myeloid differentiation {{at the expense of other}} lineages. Accordingly, enforced expression of SKI induced gene signatures associated with hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid differentiation. Here we provide detailed experimental methods and analysis for the gene expression profiling described in our recently published study of Singbrant et al. (2014) in Haematologica. Our data sets (available at [URL] provide a resource for exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of the involvement of the proto-oncogene SKI in hematopoietic stem cell function and development of myeloid neoplasms...|$|R
