50|$|On the M1A line, seven {{stations}} are built underground, nine are ground-level stations, and three are elevated. The {{stations are}} so structured that {{six of them}} have island platforms and eleven stations have side platforms. The <b>connection</b> <b>station</b> at Otogar in Esenler has two island platforms, which enable traffic on three tracks by the two different M1 branch lines.|$|E
50|$|Line 1 (orange line) serves {{downtown}} Rio, tourist {{areas in}} the South Zone, and several neighbourhoods in the North Zone. It is a semicircular line, and is fully underground. It runs from Uruguai Station to Ipanema/General Osório Station. Line 2 (green line) serves working-class residential neighborhoods extending toward the north. It is a northwest-to-southeast line, and almost completely above-ground (mostly at grade and partly elevated). This line started as a light rail, but due to increasing numbers of commuters, it gradually changed to rapid transit or metro. Because of its origin as light rail, it is at grade except for Estácio Station (the former <b>connection</b> <b>station</b> between lines 1 and 2), which is underground and Cidade Nova Station, which is elevated, and Line 4 (yellow line), connecting Barra da Tijuca/Jardim Oceânico Station in the West Zone to Ipanema/General Osório Station on Line 1.|$|E

40|$|Medium Voltage {{collector}} cables of Wind Farms have metal shields {{connected to}} the grounding systems of the towers and of the <b>connection</b> <b>station.</b> Thanks to this bonding, when a ground fault occurs, the fault current splits itself among all the grounding systems of the wind farm, this causing a reduction of the ground potential rise at the fault location. Nevertheless, in presence of double ground faults, very high ground potential rises occur at the two fault locations and safety against electric shock is not always assured. In order to study this issue, the paper presents a model for simulating in a simple way the effects of double ground faults occurring in Medium Voltage collectors of extended wind plants {{connected to the}} High Voltage network...|$|E
40|$|Main {{purpose of}} the thesis is the {{creation}} of a concept a fast-charging station associated with accumulation that uses renewable source. The introduction of the thesis describes a standard that specifies the charge of electric vehicles using direct and alternating current as well. It depicts an overview of using charging connectors. The first part also deals with overview of the technology of renewable sources and exploitation energy storage system for charging station. The second part introduces the theoretical basement for mathematical model of the charging station in Matlab/Simulink. The function of model station is verified by a physical laboratory model. For options verification of the <b>connection</b> <b>station</b> to the distribution net is created simulation of voltage losses in Matlab/Simulink. The thesis shows four 24 hours’ scenarios that have been simulated. According to the assumptions of simulation, the technology of station and connecting component is suggested. Next is the designed energy and financial analysis of the project charging station until 2030...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper is}} to {{simulate}} the transient over-voltage phenomena occurred at 345 kV and 161 kV underground cables, while the lightning strike on the cable <b>connection</b> <b>station.</b> The feasibility study of changing cable connection methods and related parameters to reduce {{the damage caused by}} lightning strike will be thoroughly conducted. The study system including lightning surge, transmission line, transmission tower, arrester, and underground cables are all well modeled. Then, the transient voltage at the cables will be analyzed by different connection methods of grounding wire and length to the arrester. Also, the grounding resistance is considered during the simulation for practical situation. The simulation results show that the length of the grounding wire has more sensitive effects to the transient over-voltage occurred when the common grounding topology is adopted. By contrast, using the independent grounding topology, reduction of the grounding resistance value can more effectively decrease the over-voltage, and avoid exceeding the metallic shield voltage caused by ground potential rise.

A {{greedy search}} based {{heuristic}} {{algorithm was proposed}} {{to solve the problem}} of connecting suburban rail line to existing urban mass transit network, aiming to provide efficient trips for passengers from satellite towns within metropolises to urban area. Optimum connection scheme set was sorted out from the perspectives respectively regarding optimization searching process and different transfer coefficients that reveal the predominance of transfer in path length. And at the same time, the searching process can also assure as short rail line and few <b>connection</b> <b>stations</b> be built as possible when adding more <b>connection</b> <b>stations.</b> High quality of connection design schemes can be ensured by these optional designs, which can also cover various connection modes of different station spacing, providing solid basis for evaluation and selection in future stage. Finally, the aforementioned algorithm was implemented in an example, generating an optimized connection scheme set, which proves the applicability of this algorithm in large scale rail network connection problem...|$|R
