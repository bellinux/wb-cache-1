25|$|Coal {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} specific analytical methods {{designed to measure}} the particular {{physical and chemical properties}} of coals. These methods are used primarily to determine the suitability of coal for <b>coking,</b> <b>power</b> generation or for iron ore smelting in the manufacture of steel.|$|E
30|$|Nitrogen {{and oxygen}} have no calorific value, but low amount of {{nitrogen}} {{is required in}} coal because it reduces oxidation. High-oxygen-content coals are characterized by high inherent moisture, low calorific value and low <b>coking</b> <b>power.</b> Moreover, oxygen is found in combination with hydrogen in coal, and thus, hydrogen available for combustion {{is less than the}} actual value. A good-quality coal should have low oxygen content, as observed in these coal samples.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, {{subsidence}} {{is predominantly}} {{seen as a}} problem for urban development in the region. In Zwickau, subsidence affects the districts of Bockwa and Schedewitz, where built-up areas are at permanent risk of flooding by groundwater. However, subsidence can also bring new potentials: The steepening of {{the course of the}} river Mulde enabled its use for canoeing ⑤ (Hoth et al. 2009). As a precaution, the groundwater level has been lowered by pumping stations. Consequently, the subsidence areas are generally viewed as a burden rather than a potential for future development ⑥. Regarding brownfields, which encompass large areas of shaft towers and other surface mining facilities, disused railway tracks and terminals, <b>coking</b> plants, <b>power</b> stations, etc., there are two contrasting trends: Many areas have been reused for reindustrialization projects in the 40  years since the end of mining, while (as will be shown in the next section) others form a basis for GI. These new green spaces include former infrastructural elements such as mining railways, roads, pipelines and conveyor systems. Such elongated areas are preferred links for biotope networking ⑦.|$|R
40|$|We {{decompose}} {{factors affecting}} China’s energy-related air pollutant (NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2) emission changes into different effects using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). We find that, from 2005 to 2012, investment increased NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2 emissions by 14. 04, 7. 82 and 15. 59 Mt respectively, and consumption increased these emissions by 11. 09, 7. 98, and 12. 09 Mt respectively. Export and import slightly increased the emissions on the whole, but {{the rate of}} the increase has slowed down, possibly reflecting the shift in China’s foreign trade structure. Energy intensity largely reduced NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2 emissions by 12. 49, 14. 33 and 23. 06 Mt respectively, followed by emission efficiency that reduces these emissions by 4. 57, 9. 08, and 17. 25 Mt respectively. Input-output efficiency slightly reduces the emissions. At sectoral and sub-sectoral levels, consumption is a great driving factor in agriculture and commerce, whereas investment is a great driving factor in transport, construction, and some industrial subsectors such as iron and steel, nonferrous metals, building materials, <b>coking,</b> and <b>power</b> and heating supply. Energy intensity increases emissions in transport, chemical products and manufacturing, but decreases emissions in all other sectors and subsectors. Some policies arising from our study results are discussed...|$|R
