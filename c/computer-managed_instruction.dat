40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{exploratory}} research study that examined {{the design of}} websites that encourage both learning and enjoyment. This study examines museum websites that offer educational materials. As part of their mission, most museums provide the general public with educational materials for study and enjoyment. Many museums use the Internet in support of their mission. Museum websites offer excellent opportunity to study learning environments designed for enjoyment. Computer-supported learning of various types has been studied over the years, including computer-aided learning, computer-aided <b>instruction,</b> <b>computer-managed</b> learning, and more recently, learning via the Internet. Some relevant work appears {{in the literature on}} pleasure; however, the concept of online learning for enjoyment – specifically when learning is not part of a formal instructional undertaking – has not been well studied and thus is not well understood. This study seeks to redress this gap in the literature, specifically ‘learning for enjoyment,’ by reporting on a number of semi-structured in-depth interviews with museum and educational experts in Taiwan. Our study identified a number of characteristics required of online learning websites, and we conclude some suggested guidelines for developing an online learning website for enjoyment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} item banking within computer-based instructional {{systems from}} both a systems and a measurement perspective. Traditionally, computer-aided instruction involves little testing, {{although there is}} a trend to incorporate posttests in the sessions. However, <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction</b> has incorpo-rated testing since its inception. The tests employed are similar in most respects to teacher-made classroom tests. The test results are used as the basis for diagno-sis, prescription, and management procedures for indi-vidual or small groups of students. At the classroom level, test banking may be more appropriate than item banking. Because of the tight linkage of the tests to instructional procedures, the basic measurement issue appears to be {{the degree to which the}} approache...|$|E

40|$|As Computer Science (CS) educators, we are {{involved}} in teaching a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses such as database management systems, networking, software development and web development courses. In addition to the traditional classroom environment, we use online and blended teaching methods to enhance student participation and improve the achievement of learning objectives. Typical online supplements to classroom instruction include posting homework, links to external resources, lecture notes and exams online. Asynchronous discussions and synchronous chat sessions provide additional forums outside the classroom for strengthening interaction and enriching the learning experience for students. This paper focuses on how asynchronous discussions {{can be used to}} enhance student participation in CS courses; increased participation leads to learning effectiveness, rich involvement with the course content, and student satisfaction.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the computer training of secondary school principals {{and the use of}} computers for administrative and computer-managed instructional purposes. Because there were no known instruments to measure the concepts in the study, the writer constructed two instruments and had them field-tested by a panel of experts whose feedback was used for improving the instruments. Analysis of the data was made by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPsS). Data gathered from the Likert attitudinal scale were utilized to test the null hypotheses in the study. Responses from the attitudinal scale were subjected to the Analysis of Variance Statistical Method. The following significant findings of the study are that: 1. The principals indicated that trainings through the school system, self-taught, and peer taught had proven to be of greatest benefit to them. Training offered by the computer salesperson and the university had proven to be least effective for them. 2. Most principals perceived their level of computer knowledge to be less than average {{in order for them to}} feel comfortable in utilizing the computer. Only five principals perceived their knowledge as being above average or excellent. 3. Most principals believed that commitment from themselves was most important in facilitating computer use within their schools. 4. The data suggest that computers were used for some administrative purposes. The computer was used most for scheduling and least for financial accounting. 5. There was a significant relationship between training offered by the computer salesperson and utilization of the computer for financial accounting. There was also found a significant relationship between training offered through the school system and computer utilization for individualized educational planning. 6. A statistically significant difference was also found to exist between principals’ and teachers’ computer use of computerized student progress and curriculum planning. The major conclusions that resulted from the study are as follows: 1. Although principals viewed themselves as being strongly committed to computer use in their schools, and they felt training offered through their local school system was of greatest benefit, there does, however, appear to be a discrepancy between the level of commitment they indicated and their level of training. 2. Most principals would like more hands-on application in how to utilize the computer for personal use, administrative, <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction,</b> and computer-assisted instruction. 3. Principals felt that greater utilization could and should be made of computers in their schools for administrative and <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction</b> purposes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Application of {{artificial}} intelligence {{to the problems}} of education is a relatively recent endeavor. This article will focus {{on one of the most}} promising aspects {{of artificial}} intelligence- expert systems technology- and some of the characteristics that make expert systems "intelligent". Selected present and poten-tial applications of expert systems to the field of learning disabilities are presented along with examples of specific expert systems. Application of computer technology to the field of learning disabilities has taken a variety of forms, the most common being computer-assisted in-struction (CAI), <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction</b> (CMI), and computer-assisted testing (Hofmeister, 1984 c). To a large extent these applications repre-sent reasonably well-developed procedures that existed before microcomputers, but had to wait for the widespread availability of this technology to achieve their present popularity. More recently, a new computer technology-the expert system-has been developed. A field within artificial intelligence, expert systems technology is concerned with the use of computers to capture and disseminate human ex-pertise. Typically, expert systems have proven ef-fective in medicine, geology, chemistry, engineer-ing, and business. However, educators have re-cently begun to show an interest in this technolo-gy, particularly as it can be applied to the problems associated with learning disabilities. This article reports on present and potential applications of expert systems technology to diagnosis and treat-ment of learning disabilities...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{purposes}} of this study were to identify factors that influence industrial education teachers to use computers in their instruction and to explain the relationships among these factors. For the {{purposes of}} this study, the term "to use computers" meant use of computers in {{one or more of the}} following aspects: computer-assisted instruction, <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction,</b> a utility, and/or as course content. Based on a theory proposed by Fishbein and Ajzen, the subjects' intentions to use computers were regarded as indicators of actual use. This factor was in turn predicted by four other factors: attitude, subjective norm, belief, and normative belief. Two additional factors, computer literacy and accessibility, were suggested as influencing the belief and normative belief toward using computers. A causal model was presented to indicate these relationships. Questionnaires were mailed to 210 randomly selected Oregon secondary industrial education teachers during March of 1986. The response rate was 80. 1 percent. The internal consistency reliability coefficients of factors ranged from. 82 to. 92. Multiple regression and partial correlation were employed to verify the proposed causal model. It was concluded that industrial education teachers' intentions to use computers were influenced by their attitudes and their perceptions of the opinions of others (subjective norms) toward their using computers. Their attitudes were influenced by subjective norms and their beliefs toward using computers; and their subjective norms were influenced by related normative beliefs. Their beliefs and normative beliefs toward using computers were influenced by their knowledge of computers and the perception of accessibility to computer systems. Changing computer literacy, accessibility and opinions of significant others were found to be three means for encouraging industrial education teachers to use computers. In this study, the most influential significant others were educational experts. Computer hardware was perceived accessible only if located in the teachers' office, laboratory or classroom...|$|E
40|$|Computer-assisted {{instruction}} {{is a means}} of teaching a student by interaction with a computer through a remote console. This thesis will discuss teaching BASIC, a simple programming language, through computer-assisted instruction. The methods of instruction have been carefully planned for and tested with high school students, many of whom have had no computer programming experience. The project involves three phases. The first phase introduces the student to BASIC by means of a self-instructional manual containing all the fundamentals one needs to know to program a fairly sophisticated problem in BASIC. Contained in the manual are a series of questions which the student should answer to check his progress. Having finished this manual and studied the illustrative examples in the manual, he is now ready to be examined in this the second phase. A programmed examination is used to test each student; the questions for the exam are chosen at random from a bank of questions. The third phase involves problems stored in the computer which contain errors and deletions that the student must locate and correct. This third phase tests the student 2 ̆ 7 s programming ability, whereas, the programmed examination tests his understanding of various aspects of the language. The last two phases are more specifically classified as <b>computer-managed</b> <b>instruction</b> (CMI). The results, after having implemented this three phase plan, were quite gratifying having used high school students from many different schools in Rhode Island. All the students were able to solve the suggested problems {{at the end of the}} self-instructional manual which clearly indicates that the primary objective had been reached; i. e., to teach a beginner how to program an intelligent problem in BASIC. Students also learned good programming techniques, such as conservation of storage; however, this accomplishment would be most difficult to measure as it varied from student to student. The project was also implemented in a short course for high school teachers with much the same successful results. All who participated enjoyed the CAI method of instruction...|$|E
