50|$|Apart from {{calibrating}} sights, {{there was}} no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> of the gun and used feedback from electro-mechanical devices, such as gyroscopes and electronic clinometers, aligned to the axis of the bore. These devices were subsequently replaced by ring laser gyros.|$|E

50|$|South of Valdosta Lane, US 129/319/SRs 11/90 widens to four lanes with {{a center}} left-turn lane. The routes {{leave the city}} after the Ocilla Bethel Baptist Church. Between West Cargile and East Frank Roads, signs of an {{abandoned}} railroad crossing can be found. North of Aaron Drive, the road gets the name Fitzgerald Highway and serves as the location of sites such as the Ocilla Country Club, and then the Dill's Builder's Supply, but changes its name to Ocilla Highway after crossing a bridge over Willacoochee Creek, and shortly afterwards the Irwin-Ben Hill County Line. At Pine Level Church Road (Ben Hill CR 243), the routes curve from northeast to Northwest, and intersects Ed Ward Road, {{which leads to the}} Fitzgerald Municipal Airport and later the Turkey Creek Golf Course and Country Club. The routes officially enter the City of Fitzgerald at the intersection of Georgia State Route 107 where US 319 leaves the concurrency by turning right. North of there, US 129/SRs 11/90 pass through standard contemporary commercial zoning with fast food restaurants, shopping centers, and similar businesses as it crosses a railroad line and becomes Grant Street as it curves straight north, then splits into a one-way pair, when the northbound lanes shift onto Sherman Street. Between Cypress and Palm Streets, Sherman Street runs along the west side of Blue and Gray Park. Further downtown, both streets approach Central Avenue, a divided boulevard that provides a link between the northern terminus of Georgia State Route 125 and US 319. One block later, they <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> crossings with a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line. North of there, the roads run over flood channels at Chattahoochee Street. Though Grant Street remains straight north of East Ohoopee Street, Sherman Street turns to the northwest where SR 90 leaves the concurrency at West Sultana Drive, and Sherman Street becomes Wilson Avenue. The one-way pair ends as both roads curve to the northeast and becomes Bowens Mill Highway, although a local segment of Wilson Avenue resumes on the Grant Street side of this pair. After passing the Fitzgerald Nursing Home the road curves north again, cutting off a former segment of Bush Road and transforming into a frontage road between Jack Allen Road and Lower Rebecca/Joshlyn Road.|$|E

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{examining}} the dynamic responses of the wheel-rail interface, a three-dimensional wagontrack system dynamics (3 D WTSD) model was developed and presented widely in the literature by the authors in recent times. The 3 D WTSD model consists of three subsystems, namely, a 37 degree-of freedom (DOF) wagon subsystem, a wheel-rail interface subsystem and a four-layer track subsystem. This paper presents {{the application of the}} 3 D WTSD model to the examination of the effect of track geometry irregularities on the lateral and vertical dynamic impact forces. The simulated dynamic responses at the wheel-rail interface due to some geometric irregularities, namely, the ariation of <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> and gauge are presented. The characteristics of the dynamic responses due to these track irregularities are examined. The sensitivity of the dynamic responses to the variation of <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> and gauge are also presented. It is shown that when the wavelength of <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> irregularity was less 2 m, the vertical impact force exhibited higher rates of increase. It is also shown that the derivation of the gauge face of the rail in the plane of track has pronounced effect on the (L/V) ratio...|$|E

40|$|Multi-level {{research}} {{that attempts to}} describe ecological effects in themselves (for example, the effect on individual health from living in deprived communities), while also including individual level effects (for example, the effect of personal socioeconomic disadvantage), is now prominent in research on the socioeconomic determinants of health and disease. Such research often involves the application of advanced statistical multi-level methods. It is hypothesised that such research is at risk of reaching beyond an epidemiological understanding of what constitutes an ecological effect, and what sources of error may be influencing any observed ecological effect. This paper aims to present such an epidemiological understanding. Three basic types of ecological effect are described: a direct <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> effect (for example, living in a deprived community directly affects individual personal health), <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> effect modification (for example, living in a deprived community modifies the effect of individual socioeconomic status on individual health), and an indirect <b>cross</b> <b>level</b> effect (for example, living in a deprived community {{increases the risk of}} smoking, which in turn affects individual health). Sources of error and weaknesses in study design that may affect estimates of ecological effects include: a lack of variation in the ecological exposure (and health outcome) in the available data; not allowing for intraclass correlation; selection bias; confounding at both the ecological and individual level; misclassification of variables; misclassification of units of analysis and assignment of individuals to those units; model mis-specification; and multicollinearity. Identification of ecological effects requires the minimisation of these sources of error, and a study design that captures sufficient variation in the ecological exposure of interest.    Keywords: multi-level methods; ecological research design; socioeconomic factors; confounding; bias; effect modifiers; causalit...|$|E
