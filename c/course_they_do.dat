25|$|Gymnasiums {{have its}} courses (smerovi), {{and the most}} common ones are the Socio-Linguistics Course, Science-Mathematics Course, Information Technology Course, Bilingual Course, and the General Course. Students can only choose one <b>course</b> (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> it when they write their wish list for {{preferred}} schools and courses) and they usually don't change it until they graduate. Every course has the same number and list of classes, but the difference is in their schedules (for example, the Socio-Linguistic Course might have English classes five times a week, while the Science-Mathematics Course offers two English classes a week).|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, walking away--behind {{the trees}} now. No, you can't see him. But we {{are sure to}} run into him," [...] which, of <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{a moment}} he {{was alone in the}} turret-room. As for the shopkeepers, they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed {{something}} odd; but, as it went no further, of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not talk about it, and nobody was any the wiser.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how ridiculous!" [...] responded the dudish student. Nevertheless, {{he looked}} much worried. [...] "Of <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> report a sea serpent now and then." ...|$|E
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean}} the wood of which the actual cross was made. They mean the thing of which the cross was a sign and token.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jordan, {{turning it}} over, adopted {{at last the}} plan of {{treating}} it with a smile. She wished to be liberal. [...] "Well, of <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> lay it out." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{nothing would}} do; for he screamed and cried all {{day for a}} water-baby, to come and drive away the monsters; and of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not try to find one, because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not believe in them, and were {{thinking}} of nothing but Bumpsterhausen's blue follicles; having, as usual, set the cart before the horse, and taken the effect for the cause.|$|R
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} when the burglars would come, nor the {{particular}} point of the mansion where the assault would be delivered; therefore Number 666 laid his plans like a wise general, posted his troops where there was most likelihood of their being required, and kept himself in reserve for contingencies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not--they {{were not}} here--they didn't come till half-an-hour after that. The {{man who made}} {{inquiries}} left no message. I told them when they came that they, or a name something like theirs, had been asked for, but they didn't seem to understand why it should be, and so the matter dropped.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> Colonel Osborne; and why shouldn't they? Think of {{all that}} they have to endure out in those horrible places. How would you like to live in the Mandarins?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not always}} succeed, but they seldom or never {{fail to do}} the very uttermost {{that it is in}} the power of strong and daring men to accomplish. Frequently they can tell of defeat and victory on the same battlefield.|$|E
6000|$|Decidedly {{this was}} bad form, and Mr Evans, pursing up {{his lips and}} raising his eyebrows, was silent. 'That's the worst of these half-educated people,' he said to himself; 'they get some idea in their heads which they don't understand, and, of <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> idiotic things....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two of the pursuers who had outpaced {{the others}} crept up to him--lank, lean men of {{not more than}} thirty years of age. They had {{stabbing}} spears in their hands, such as are used at close quarters, and these of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not throw. One of them gained a little on the other.|$|R

60|$|So {{the king}} told the {{soldiers}} {{that they might}} become his coachmen; but he made the boy his companion, and gave him rooms near his own. The soldiers were dreadfully angry when they heard this, for of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know that the}} boy was really a prince; and they soon began to lay their heads together to plot his ruin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Mrs. Bangster {{takes her}} half-pint of brandy {{every night for}} her health's sake, no doubt. Would you believe it, Mr. Bertram, the doctor {{absolutely}} had to take {{her out of the}} saloon one night in the 'Lahore'? Didn't he, Mrs. Price?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE [shining at her] Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Come! let me {{prove to}} you {{what we think of}} you.

60|$|Of an evening, {{if we have}} a halt, Jack {{sometimes}} dances. The band of the Punjaubees—between whom and {{the sailors}} there is a great friendship, although of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand a word of each other’s language—comes over to the sailors’ camp, and plays dance-music; and half-a-dozen couples of sailors stand up and execute quadrilles, waltzes, and polkas.|$|E
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how often Mrs. Cliff had said to herself {{that it was really}} not a waste of money to keep this horse, for Willy was no longer young; and if she could save her any weary steps, she ought to do it, {{and at the same time}} relieve a little the {{congested}} state of her income.|$|R

60|$|On and on they went, {{and when}} at length the thread stopped the {{brothers}} knew that another day's journey would {{bring them to}} the Stalos' dwelling. Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not dare to approach it openly, for the Stalos had the strength of giants, and besides, there were three of them; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well.|$|R
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> We {{are now in}} {{the great}} valley which runs right across England from {{south-west}} to north-east, from Axminster in Devonshire to Hunstanton in Norfolk, with the chalk always on your right hand, and the oolite hills on your left, till it ends by sinking into the sea, among the fens of Lincolnshire and Norfolk.|$|E

60|$|Business {{had been}} {{as good as they}} could have expected. Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have such a rush as they had been favored with during the first two days that Paul was in {{partnership}} with them, because the news was not so exciting; but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so well that their board was paid for a week before they had been at Mrs. Green's four days, and they had begun to think of adding to the theatrical fund.|$|R
60|$|Crack {{went the}} mighty whips, howl went the dogs, and the sledges were soon {{skimming}} {{over the sea}} {{at the rate of}} ten miles an hour. Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not keep that pace up very long. It became necessary to rest at times, also, to give the dogs a little food. When this latter process had been completed, the teams became so lively that they tried to runaway.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{it not for}} {{the best}} that affairs should have taken the <b>course</b> <b>they</b> have <b>done?</b> But you must blame Kate as well as me; dear Kate!' ...|$|R
6000|$|ACRES. Odds, thunderings and pealings, of [...] <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do!</b> and {{the third}} fiddler, little [...] Tweaks, of the county town, goes into fits.

60|$|His hand {{took his}} hat from the peg over his {{initialled}} heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay lots of officers {{are in the}} swim too. <b>Course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! don't {{be angry}} with me," [...] she said piteously. [...] "If only you understood. You are a {{wonderful}} medium, the most wonderful {{that any of us}} has ever known, and through you we have learned things; holy, marvellous things, which till now have not been heard of in the world.

6000|$|... "I don't want {{my brother}} to do {{anything}} shabby," [...] replied the girl; [...] "but I shouldn't be sorry, of <b>course,</b> if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very. They {{are really}} delicious. But the farmers {{did not like}} to lose their bees and so they tried to destroy me. Of <b>course</b> <b>they</b> couldn't <b>do</b> that." ...|$|R
