5|$|Aubame {{served as}} foreign {{minister}} under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was {{dropped from the}} Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>on</b> 25 February, practically a powerless post. M'ba supporters tried {{to pass a bill}} that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with the functions of the assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>on</b> 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In a fit of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal.|$|E
