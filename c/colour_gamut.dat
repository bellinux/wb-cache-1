Computed-planimetry gauged artefacts, structure differentiation was compared with light microscopy on video, analog and digital photography.

40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} technology became a popular technology for printing digital {{photographs in the}} last decade. There is a big variety of both original and alternative (cheaper) inks and print media for the consumers. But {{there is a question}} if the cheaper material provides also comparable printout quality. For this reason, it is important to test the properties of such inkjet printouts. There are several ways how to test the lightfastness of the printouts: long term storage under environmental conditions, or short, accelerated ageing tests. The stability of printouts is affected by many factors, such as ink-receiving layer, ink composition, UV and visible light intensity and air pollutants concentration in the environment. Some inkjet printouts exposed to light usually undergo surprisingly fast fading, but light is not the only dangerous condition for inkjet printout. The two types of test targets printed with dyebased inkjet inks on various paper types were subjected to both accelerated test in a xenon test chamber and light and environmental pollutants long-term test in a sunny indoor corridor. The values of light intensity were continuously monitored and samples properties were regularly measured with a spectrophotometer. Another type of testing included accelerated ozone ageing of inkjet dyes. The <b>colour</b> <b>gamuts</b> and gamut volumes were calculated from collected spectral data. Total colour difference E*ab was also evaluated, its increase served as a tool for finding the formal printout degradation rate constant. It was found out that the dyes in ink-receiving layers of printouts underwent significant degradation in all tested conditions. The degradation rate depended on the type of used print media. The reciprocity behaviour of printouts was also studied. Recent inkjet printouts testing miss some actual ISO norm which should show the way of effective lightfastness evaluation. One of the main aims of this work was to find some new and alternative ways of inkjet printouts lightfastness evaluation. The method of printed inks concentration determination from the test charts spectrophotometric measurements was also proposed...|$|R

We provide results using both generated data and a carefully calibrated set of 321 images. In the case of the modification for diagonal model failure, we provide synthetic results using two cameras with a distinctly different degree of support for the diagonal model.

If such a gamut mapping algorithm can be used under a wide range of conditions, it can also be incorporated in an automated colour reproduction system and considered to be in some sense universal. In terms of preliminary work, a colour reproduction system was implemented, for which a new printer characterisation model (including grey-scale correction) was developed. Methods were also developed for calculating gamut boundary descriptors and for calculating gamut boundaries along given lines from them. The gamut mapping solution proposed in this thesis is a gamut compression algorithm developed with the aim of being accurate and universally applicable. It was arrived at by way of an evolutionary gamut mapping development strategy for the purposes of which five test images were reproduced between a CRT and printed media obtained using an inkjet printer. Initially, a number of previously published algorithms were chosen and psychophysically evaluated whereby an important characteristic of this evaluation was that it also considered the performance of algorithms for individual colour regions within the test images used. New algorithms were then developed on their basis, subsequently evaluated and this process was repeated once more. In this series of experiments the new GCUSP algorithm, which consists of a chroma-dependent lightness compression followed by a compression towards the lightness of the reproduction cusp on the lightness axis, gave the most accurate and stable performance overall. The results of these experiments were also useful for improving the understanding of some gamut mapping factors - in particular gamut difference. In addition to looking at accuracy, the pleasantness of reproductions obtained using various algorithms was also looked at and a strong and positive correlation was found between these two properties. It was also shown that the reproductions made with GCUSP were pleasant in isolation. which makes it a very good candidate for a standard universal gamut mapping algorithm.

5000|$|A {{side effect}} of {{printing}} with more than four primary inks is that it enables an improvement in [...] <b>colour</b> <b>gamut</b> of the printed image due {{to the use of}} secondary inks, which can be used for CCR (colour-component-replacement) similar to UCR (under-colour-removal) or GCR (gray-component-replacement) for black. The use of these multiple inks inflicts additional constraints in the printing system in the context of its modeling parameters such as ink-media interaction, total-ink-limit, halftoning with multiple-inks and the effect of ink overlay order. In terms of colour management, this multi-channel printing process mandates representation and manipulation of colours in the domain of spectral reflectivity of the scene. One such necessary manipulation includes spectral gamut mapping. Often, the methods used for such spectral colour management can also be employed for spectral reproduction on multi-primary display systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{blending}} of coloured fibre is explored as a sustainable method of colouration when coupled with sustainable fibre and dyeing choices such as spun-dyed Lenzing Viscose Austria. It {{was found that}} a selection of spun-dyed colours (primaries) {{can be used to}} create homogenous 4 -colour blends when mixed in specific groups. The use of 4 -colour blends ensures that the optimal amount of <b>colours</b> within a <b>gamut</b> are produced with the lowest possible number of primaries depending on the acceptable mean colour difference of the 4 -colour blends. The acceptable mean colour difference of a blend (measured by averaging each pair of colour differences between the primaries in a blend) can be derived using example 4 -colour blends and participant observations at a set viewing distance. Using MATLAB, a method of estimating the number of primaries required to fill a given <b>gamut</b> in CIELAB <b>colour</b> space was developed. Primaries can be distributed across CIELAB colour space and grouped into tetrahedral groups of four for blending. The mean colour difference of the tetrahedral 4 -colour blends can be increased or decreased by varying the number of primaries within a gamut.

Comparisons of existing blend prediction models with the prediction possibilities of a standard neural network and novel neural network were undertaken using data gathered from 333 blended samples.
