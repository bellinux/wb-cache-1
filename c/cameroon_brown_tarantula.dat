50|$|Aphonopelma hentzi, the Texas <b>brown</b> <b>{{tarantula}},</b> (also {{known as}} Oklahoma <b>brown</b> <b>tarantula</b> or Missouri tarantula), {{is one of}} the most common species of tarantula thriving in the southern-most United States today. Texas <b>brown</b> <b>tarantulas</b> can grow in excess of a four-inch leg span, and weigh more than 3 ounces as adults. The body is dark brown. Shades may vary between individual tarantulas and are more distinct after a moult.|$|R
50|$|When disturbed, {{like most}} other tarantulas, A. hentzi will {{maneuver}} itself to a stance {{on its hind legs}} and raise its front legs in a threatening manner. Also, Texas <b>brown</b> <b>tarantulas</b> have small coarse brown and/or black urticating hairs on their abdomen that they will kick in the direction of whatever they may feel threatened by. Bites from the Texas <b>brown</b> <b>tarantula</b> are generally not a serious harm to humans. Apply a cold compress to the area, and if swelling or a rash occurs, seek medical attention.|$|R

Represented species include leafcutter ant, flower mantis, Vietnamese walking stick, Atlas beetle, American burying beetle, sunburst diving beetle, water scorpion, brown widow spider, brown recluse spider, yellow garden spiders, Platymeris biguttatus, cobalt blue <b>tarantula,</b> Texas <b>brown</b> <b>tarantula,</b> and Egyptian fattail scorpion.|$|R
50|$|A. hentzi {{lives in}} North America {{throughout}} Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, southern Kansas, Missouri, northwestern Louisiana, and other adjoining {{areas in the}} U.S. and northeast Mexico. The spider {{can also be found}} in Colorado, and has been observed as far north as Denver. They are commonly found in grasslands, burrowed under ground; or using logs, stones, or other small animals' abandoned dens as their home and feeding grounds. Texas <b>brown</b> <b>tarantulas</b> will use their spinnerets to line the entrance of their shelter with webbing so as to detect passing prey. Tarantulas are often restricted to the ground but can climb.|$|R

The region has numerous venomous spiders, such as the black widow, <b>brown</b> recluse, <b>tarantula,</b> and hobo spider. The mountain yellow-legged frog is also living throughout the area. Fish species in the lake include Tahoe sucker, mountain whitefish, brown bullhead catfish, smallmouth bass, mosquitofish, and brown trout.|$|R
6000|$|We {{will now}} {{consider}} {{a few cases}} of special protective colouring in the perfect butterfly or moth. Mr. Mansel Weale states that in South Africa {{there is a great}} prevalence of white and silvery foliage or bark, sometimes of dazzling brilliancy, and that many insects and their larvae have brilliant silvery tints which are protective, among them being three species of butterflies whose undersides are silvery, and which are thus effectually protected when at rest.[73] A common African butterfly (Aterica meleagris) always settles on the ground with closed wings, which so closely resemble the soil of the district that it can with difficulty be seen, and the colour varies with the soil in different localities. Thus specimens from Senegambia were dull brown, the soil being reddish sand and iron-clay; those from Calabar and <b>Cameroons</b> were light <b>brown</b> with numerous small white spots, the soil of those countries being light brown clay with small quartz pebbles; while in other localities where the colours of the soil were more varied the colours of the butterfly varied also. Here we have variation in a single species which has become specialised in certain areas to harmonise with the colour of the soil.[74] ...|$|R
40|$|Physical, {{chemical}} and functional properties of tiger nuts selected from Ghana, Cameroon and UK (market (Spain) Abstract The tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) {{has attracted a}} lot of unsubstantiated health claims, {{yet there is a}} dearth of research investigation within Ghana specifically in the area of food product development. This study addresses the development of ‘functional bread and biscuit’ from tiger nuts obtained from UK market (Spain). The chemical constituents; carbohydrate, lipid, protein, dietary minerals and antioxidants, the functional properties of three varieties of tiger nuts obtained from Ghana (black and <b>brown),</b> <b>Cameroon</b> (yellow) and UK market (Spain) (brown) were investigated using standard analytical methods as well as the blood glucose response of healthy adults who consumed the developed bread. Tiger nuts were found to be good sources of carbohydrate (51 - 82 g/ 100 g) and lipids (21 - 37 g/ 100 g). The dietary fibre components ranged between 18, 1, 19 and 19 g/ 100 g for IDF, SDFP, HMWDF, and ITDF respectively, while the available carbohydrate as sugars were 45, 0. 5 and 5 g/ 100 g for glucose, maltose and xylose respectively. Minerals that were found to be inherent to the crop were; potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc and selenium and do not depend on place of origin. The following ratios for Sodium/Potassium 0. 04, Calcium/Phosphorus 0. 13 and Calcium/Magnesium 0. 28 were obtained. Tiger nuts had TPC ≥ 134 GAE per g, DPPH and stability index of 0. 9 - 8. 7 mmol/litre and 3 - 4 respectively. In conclusion the tiger nuts originating from different geographical locations were good sources of health giving minerals and had diversity of physical properties and chemical constituents which could inform future research in the functional food industry. Tiger nut could be added to the Ghana food basket and the product developed from it could be a potential functional food because of its effect on glucose response and phytochemical contents. It could again be used to replace artificial antioxidants (BHA or BHT) which are used in the food industry to inhibit lipid and protein oxidation especially the black variety.
