By examining the short-term stock performances and the long term accounting performance of public listed and traded companies in US, one can examine the financial performance changes associated with the merge activities in both long and short term. Also, one can argue that post-merged performances might be different {{depending on the size}} of the bidder and method of payment. This clearly shows the importance of understanding what factors that determine a positive post acquisition performance.

40|$|In his thesis, Brand [1] {{includes}} six complete dates {{recorded on}} monuments of Seti I, and Kitchen [2] mentions two more in his book. Following {{the method of}} matching such inscribed Egyptian dates to Julian dates of new or full moon [3], I find that five of the eight can be so matched, to within a day. Two more fit if the regnal year is one year in error, either by ancient miswriting or modern misreading. The eighth date records troop movements, and {{it should not be}} expected that they would conform to phases of the moon. Brand also describes eight more monuments for which he mentions only the regnal year of Seti I, presumably because the month and day are not present or unreadable. For the reign of Ramesses II, Brand includes one <b>complete</b> <b>date</b> that matches, while Kitchen includes two matches, among many that do not match. Each lunar month contains two main ‘marker ’ days: new moon and full moon, which are essentially night-time phenomena. If the day after each is also viewed as significant for ceremonial purposes, then there are four ‘marker ’ days for each synodic month of 29. 53 days. The probability that any randomly selected day be one of these four is 4 / 29. 53 = 0. 135. Of the eight dates found for Seti I, about one should be expected to fall on a ‘marker ’ day; but at least five do so. Thus, it appears that the Egyptians did not date their monuments randomly.

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Launch System (SLS) Program, {{engineers}} at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama are working to design, develop and implement the SLS Core Stage structural testing. The SLS will {{have the capability to}} return humans to the Moon and beyond and its first launch is scheduled for December of 2017. The SLS Core Stage consist of five major elements; Forward Skirt, Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tank, Intertank (IT), Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) tank and the Engine Section (ES). Structural Test Articles (STA) for each of these elements are being designed and produced by Boeing at Michoud Assembly Facility located in New Orleans, La. The structural test for the Core Stage STAs (LH 2, LOX, IT and ES) are to be conducted by the MSFC Test Laboratory. Additionally, the MSFC Test Laboratory manages the Structural Test Equipment (STE) design and development to support the STAs. It was decided early (April 2012) in the project life that the LH 2 and LOX tank STAs would require new test stands and the Engine Section and Intertank would be tested in existing facilities. This decision impacted schedules immediately because the new facilities would require Construction of Facilities (C of F) funds that require congressional approval and long lead times. The Engine Section and Intertank structural test are to be conducted in existing facilities which will limit lead times required to support the first launch of SLS. With a SLS launch date of December, 2017 Boeing had a need date for testing to be complete by September of 2017 to support flight certification requirements. The test facilities were required to be ready by October of 2016 to support test article delivery. The race was on to get the stands ready before Test Article delivery and meet the test <b>complete</b> <b>date</b> of September 2017. This paper documents the past and current design and development phases and the supporting processes, tools, and methodology for supporting the SLS Core Stage STA test stands and related STE. The paper will address key requirements, system development activities and project challenges. Additionally, the interrelationships as well as interdependencies within the SLS project will be discussed...|$|E

Trucks with large single trailers are often unable to travel on forest roads due to their narrowness, tight curves, adverse grades and limited areas to turn around. A shorter trailer must be used but then transportation capacity is limited by the trailer volume due to the low bulk density of the processed biomass, particularly when the biomass is dry. With double trailers, transportation capacity can be limited by allowable legal weight based on axle number and spacing. We developed a simulation model that explores the economic feasibility of using double-trailer configurations to transport forest biomass to a bioenergy facility from the grinder at a landing or from a centralized yard in Washington, Oregon and California. Results show that double trailers can be a cost effective alternative to single trailers under limited conditions in Oregon and Washington, but they are not a competitive option in California due to the state's transportation regulations...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the social research done to date using photographs shows that photography, although used both in anthropology and sociology for data collection, as visual evidence and illustration, in photoelicitation or in time-studies, has not been fully exploited {{as an aid to}} see further and deeper in the social arena. Most social researchers still perceive photography as being simultaneously too complicated as a research aid and too creative and therefore unscientific to use as a research method. This project is exploratory and argumentative and not directed towards the formulation of a model. I propose that the camera is the proper tool to obtain more precise, detailed, and <b>complete</b> <b>date,</b> to uncover and clarify meaning, to investigate and clarify the research question, and to help in the presentation of the results of social investigation. Therefore the camera should become more accepted as a tool for the modern social researcher notwithstanding its creative component and even because of it. Indeed, as any individual in a culture oversaturated with images, although trained to observe precisely and record objectively, the social scientist has learned to see only a few v things while editing and blocking out the rest. The camera, because of its ability to record the world with richness of detail, is the proper tool to obtain a more precise and more complete visual documentation, which is essential for an accurate reconstruction of meaning. Lastly, I propose that the sociologist-anthropologist who accepts the challenge of integrating photography in his work should become also a skilled photographer, cultivating with practice the ability to intuitively perceive potential opportunities that may escape direct observation and developing a visual and emotional acuity that bridges the gap between intuition and the physical limitations of human perception. This new skill seems {{to be the result of}} an inner propensity to visual investigation combined with photographic practice and systematic studying of the history of photography and represents a jump of sophistication in the use of photography in more creative ways in social research, both conceptually and technically. In looking at the body of work produced in visual social research as well as in photographic social analysis, it seems that the most successful and compelling outcomes have been produced by authors who explored the unique opportunities of in depth {{analysis of}}fered by the synergy of images and text to conduct a social, autoethnographic or psychological discourse. This appears to me a most promising area of development for the immediate future of visual social research...|$|E
40|$|Undoubtedly, modern {{sedentary}} lifestyle is a severe threat factor for various health-related concerns. Engagement in {{regular physical activity}} is requisite to achieve physiological and psychological health benefits and to alleviate the risk for many undesirable health outcomes including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Staying physically active is recommended in the deterrence and management of low back pain. Lately, an alternative guideline about physical activity has been introduced, which is more realistic than the 30 minutes/day recommendation. This guideline says that attaining 10, 000 steps/day improves health. Therefore, pedometers have become popular tool to measure ambulatory activities objectively throughout {{the day in the}} form of steps count. Moreover, they provide a valid and accurate measure of activities in free-living condition. Furthermore, pedometers are simple to utilize, relatively inexpensive and good tools to use in large population based studies. The aim of the current study is to find the relation between pedometer-determined physical activity in the form of daily steps count and low back pain in middle aged Finnish population (30 - 45 year old participants). The data has drawn from the latest follow up in 2007 of an extensive interdisciplinary longitudinal research project “The Young Finns Study”. All the same subjects who participated first time in this study in 1980 and had a permanent address in Finland (n= 3596) were {{invited to participate in the}} latest follow up in 2007. Among those, 2204 (65 %) individuals filled out the questionnaire. From 2204 participants, 1874 completed the pedometer study. <b>Complete</b> <b>date</b> was received from 1866 (Female= 1067, Men= 799) participants. Women were more physically active than men. Chi square test revealed that there were no differences in back pain between different physical activity groups either in females or in males. In female, association between back pain and BMI was weak whereas in men, some association was seen between back pain and occupation. Regression analyses showed that physical activity did not increase the risk of having back pain, however, adding factor such as body mass index slightly increased the risk in women. On the other hand, active men were having risk for low back pain twice when it was compared with low active men. Adding factor like body mass index, education, and occupation did not show any risk for low back pain in men. In conclusion, this study did not support the idea of U-shaped relation (i. e. both inactivity and excessive activities) between different levels of physical activity and low back pain in males and females. Active males were at higher risk of having back pain than non-active ones...|$|E
