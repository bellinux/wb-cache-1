40|$|Traditional {{approach}} to optimal reserve determination centres on reserves as adjustments to shocks to {{the balance of}} payments. The demand for reserves varies {{according to the international}} interest rates, volatility of the terms of trade and the exchange rate regimes (Garcia, 1999). While precautionary motive (Aizenman and Lee, 2005; Li and Rajan, 2005) continues to dominate the changing motive of reserve accumulation in East Asia, the literature on optimal reserve allocation has shifted to the strategic issue of reserve pooling (Rajan and Siregar, 2002; Wan, 2005, 2006), to mobilize the vast pool of reserves exceeding the optimal level for regional investment in East Asia. Using cointegration analysis to determine the key macroeconomic variables such as import-reserve ratio, trade openness, short-term indebtedness, volatility of exports, net capital inflow as well as the interest rate spread between US Treasury rates and regional average lending rates, this article attempts to develop a regional framework for reserve <b>currency</b> <b>pooling</b> as liquidity support for the newly established ASEAN Plus Three (APT; China, Korea and Japan) in the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) in May 2000. The benefits and costs of reserve pooling are analysed, taking into consideration its welfare implications with and without including Australia as the potential member of APT in the distant future. ...|$|R
40|$|Donors cannot pre-commit {{to support}} scaled-up public {{spending}} programs on a continuing basis, nor can governments credibly commit to curtail expenditure {{rapidly in the}} event that aid revenues contract. An aid boom may therefore be accompanied by a credibility problem. When this is the case, the absorb-and-spend strategy recommended by the IMF leads to capital flight, higher inflation, and large current account surpluses inclusive of aid.

40|$|Firms {{with higher}} debt {{relative}} to {{its size and}} negative cash flows have lower value in the market. Why not {{the same applies to}} a currency value of a country? This paper investigates this question and shows empirical evidence that indeed a lower degree of government's fiscal solvency, represented by higher debt and lower surpluses, implies an real exchange rate depreciation. Empirical results also contradict the common believed notion that only emerging economies are subject to bad scal results implying <b>currency</b> devaluations. <b>Pooled</b> data regression results show that middle income economies have even lower elasticities of relative debt to real exchange rates. These results are robust to the use of controls for cited effects in the literature like the Balassa-Samuelson effect, the effect of government spending and the Salter effect. The paper also proposes a simple model to explain the empirical evidence found. In the model, the real exchange rate deviates from the PPP parity because at time t agent [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{belonging}} to a monetary union with a common <b>currency</b> and <b>pooled</b> foreign reserves, the countries of Africa's franc zone (CFA) experience substantially different inflation rates, especially in the short run. The authors develop a model of inflation differentials for the franc zone countries based on behavioral differences in fiscal policy responses to fluctuations {{in the price of}} the main export commodity. The model is basedon the fact that for primary exporters in general, and for CFA zone members in particular, the volatility of commodity prices implies a high variance in government revenues. The model identifies two effects: a monetary effect (commodity booms imply a surge in foreign reserves which, if unsterilized, is inflationary) and a fiscal effect (higher government revenues are, to varying degrees, accompanied by a marked increase in the level of spending, which is again inflationary). The fiscal relationship is the key behavioral equation of the model, as the other relationships are essentially derived from accounting identities. The authors empirically test the model for Cote d'Ivoire. It tracks quite well the inflationary cycle that Cote d'Ivoire experienced after the boom in coffee prices in 1975 - 76. Since the countries are in a monetary union, if some countries have expansionary fiscal policy (and thus inflation) the others must take a more contractionary fiscal stance. One issue for future research is what determines whether a member country has the freedom to follow an expansionary fiscal policy or whether it must contract because other members have already expanded. A discussion of potential games played by countries in a monetary union may shed light on these issues.

5000|$|Aggregation of {{different}} monetary pools, e.g. cash {{and credit card}} borrowing and different <b>currencies.</b> Here the <b>pools</b> of various monetary aggregates are treated as a quantities, and the prices are usually taken as fixed, but their weights vary -- for example, the Bank of England has an index of the money stock that is available for transactions. The index weights the various money pools by the likelihood they {{will be used in}} transactions in the near run -- physical cash and checking accounts are ready to be spent, whereas long term bonds which are not ready to be spent. The interest rate received on the various money pools {{is a measure of the}} weight; pounds in cash count more than pounds in bonds. Movement of money from one form to another affects the index whereas it would not affect a simple sum of the money stock; thus the index is more useful to track the money ready-to-transact than a sum would be. The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis computes similar Divisia monetary aggregate indexes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{empirical}} {{investigation into the}} prevalence and impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on opera-tors in the Bitcoin economy. To that end, we gather and analyze posts mentioning “DDoS ” on the popular Bitcoin forum bitcointalk. org. Starting from around 3 000 different posts made between May 2011 and October 2013, we document 142 unique DDoS attacks on 40 Bitcoin services. We find that 7 % of all known operators have been attacked, but that <b>currency</b> exchanges, mining <b>pools,</b> gambling operators, eWal-lets, and financial services {{are much more likely}} to be attacked than other services. Not coincidentally, we find currency exchanges and mining pools {{are much more likely to}} have DDoS protection such as CloudFlare, In-capsula, or Amazon Cloud. We show that those services that have been attacked are more than three times as likely to buy anti-DDoS services than operators who have not been attacked. We find that big mining pools (those with historical hashrate shares of at least 5 %) are much more likely to be DDoSed than small pools. We investigate Mt. Gox as a case study for DDoS attacks on currency exchanges and find a dispropor-tionate amount of DDoS reports made during the large spike in trading volume and exchange rates in spring 2013. We conclude by outlining future opportunities for researching DDoS attacks on Bitcoin. ...|$|R

[...] On 11 October 2013, Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that a decision on creating a $100 billion fund designated to steady currency markets would be taken in early 2014. The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega stated that the fund would be created by March 2014. [...] However, by April 2014, the currency reserve pool and development bank had yet to be set up, and the date was rescheduled to 2015. [...] One driver for the BRICS development bank is that the existing institutions primarily benefit extra-BRICS corporations, and the political significance is notable because it allows BRICS member states [...] "to promote their interests abroad... and can highlight the strengthening positions of countries whose opinion is frequently ignored by their developed American and European colleagues." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the New Development Bank (NDB), the ﬁnancial institution established {{through the}} inter-governmental agreements reached during the sixth Summit of BRICS countries held in Fortaleza, Brazil, on July 15 th 2014, where the ﬁve main emerging economies were represented (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). These countries aim {{to become an}} alternative to the western Group of Seven (G 7); indeed, the reasons underlying the creation of the NDB are strictly linked with the IMF’s reforms and the lack of a strong acknowledgment of the rising importance of these economies in the Bretton Woods institutions. The NDB has the primary goal to ﬁnance infrastructural projects in the BRICS and in the developing countries and it can rely on a strategic fund of reserve capitals in order to cope with possible currency crises and with the short-term liquidity crises (Contingent <b>Currency</b> <b>Pool),</b> and to guarantee a prompt allocation, by BRICS Central Banks, of US denominated liquidity in cases of shortage. The Bank could be in the next years an important tool to foster investments on large development projects and to strengthen the economic and trade ties among the signatory countries. Notwithstanding,thegovernance frameworkofthis new Bankseems toreplicatesomeofthe shortcomings still existing in the IMF and WB: time will tell if the NDB can assert itself as a real alternative to the Bretton Woods institutions, correcting the transparency and democratic deﬁcit, or if it will replicate the same framework, beyond the different composition ratione personarum in the Bank management...|$|E
