5|$|Although most of Jifna's <b>cultivable</b> land {{is covered}} with olive groves as well as fig, walnut and apricot trees and grape vines, {{agriculture}} {{is no longer the}} village's main source of income. Many of the village's former farmers are living off other businesses, including restaurants, other small family-owned industries, and simple commerce.|$|E
5|$|Al-Birwa's total {{land area}} {{consisted}} of 13,542 dunams (13.42 hectares), of which 59 dunams were built-up areas. of which 130 were Christians. <b>Cultivable</b> land accounted for 77% {{of the total}} land area. Orchards were planted on 1,548 dunams of which 1,500 were used for olive groves, while 8,457 were allotted to grains. The residents of the town sold 536 dunams to Jews, {{and most of the}} rest was Arab-owned.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Bani Zeid's {{economy was}} {{dependent}} on the olive crop, which was supplied to soap factories in Nablus. Until the present day, olive trees cover most of the town's <b>cultivable</b> land. However, the residents of Bani Zeid today largely derive their income from employment in the civil service and private business. There {{are a number of}} archaeological sites in Bani Zeid, including the old town of Deir Ghassaneh, the manor of Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti and the maqam ("saintly person's tomb") of Sheikh al-Khawwas.|$|E
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's <b>cultivable</b> land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's <b>cultivable</b> land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} ginger {{growing area}} of India. Kalimpong {{and the state of}} Sikkim {{together}} contribute 15 percent of ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its tea industry. However, most of the tea gardens are on the western side of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so tea gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4percent of total tea production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90percent of land is <b>cultivable</b> but only 10percent is used for tea production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and gladioli.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of Amman {{following}} Sirghitmish's {{death in}} 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants {{sold it to}} Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's <b>cultivable</b> lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale {{of the city and}} lands of Amman to different owners signaled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.|$|E
5|$|The main {{economic}} sector in Tubas is agriculture. There {{is a total}} of 150,000 dunams of arable land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although the land is fertile, {{there is a lack}} of water for irrigation. The only spring used is the nearby Ein Far'a. Field crops account for 49% of the <b>cultivable</b> land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-'Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas' arable lands.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{currently}} has control over 17 gompas in West Kameng district. The monastery has administrative control over two dzongs, each {{headed by a}} monk; the Darana Dzong built in 1831 and the Sanglem Dzong, also known as Talung Gompa, in the south west part of Kameng district. These dzongs not only collect taxes but also preach Buddhism to the Monpas and Sherdukpens of Kameng. The monastery owns <b>cultivable</b> lands in the villages of Soma and Nerguit and a few patches in some other villages which are tilled and cultivated by farmers, who share the produce with the monastery. The present resident head of the monastery is the incarnate Gyalsy Rinpochey.|$|E
5|$|Bani Zeid {{had a total}} {{land area}} of 22,249 dunams in 1945, of which 90 dunams were {{classified}} as built-up areas (Deir Ghassaneh was larger than Beit Rima) and 8,400 dunams were planted with olive or fig groves. Today the Bani Zeid municipality has a jurisdiction of over 21,979 dunams, of which 80.6% is <b>cultivable</b> land. today Beit Rima is the larger village. The built-up areas of the town constitute 918 dunams, 832 of which is geared towards residential areas while the remaining 86 is used for commercial, industrial and transportation purposes. The town is surrounded by olive groves, which Bani Zeid is well known for, and 14,505 dunams are planted with olive trees. The old village center of Deir Ghassaneh consists of three quarters: Harat al-Barghouti (Harat al-Fauqa), Harat al-Shu'aibi and Harat al-Tahtani.|$|E
5|$|Soil types {{mentioned}} in records are black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land {{and to a}} lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner of cows), gosasi (donor of cows), goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector of cows) attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as <b>cultivable</b> land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included {{was the type of}} soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, <b>cultivable</b> land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E
25|$|The {{agricultural}} sector employs 12% {{of the total}} workforce. Agriculture contributed to 5.9% of the country's GDP in 2011. Lebanon's proportion of <b>cultivable</b> land is {{the highest in the}} Arab world, Major produce includes apples, peaches, oranges, and lemons.|$|E
25|$|The land owned privately {{and collectively}} by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews can be {{classified}} as urban, rural built-on, <b>cultivable</b> (farmed), and uncultivable. The following chart shows the ownership by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews {{in each of the}} categories.|$|E
25|$|In partial {{compliance}} with requests of the petition, the Iraqi government {{set up a}} further land-finding committee. It discovered but little land both <b>cultivable</b> and available. In fact, they found malaria-ridden, swampy lands, and recommended expenditure on an irrigation scheme to produce more. Hundreds upon hundreds of Assyrians died with malaria in those lands.|$|E
25|$|The total {{land area}} of the village {{consisted}} of 2,857 dunams, of which 94.5% was Arab-owned, 5.3% was Jewish-owned and the remainder was public property. <b>Cultivable</b> land amounted {{to a total of}} 866 dunams (30%), all of which was grown with grains and owned mostly by Arabs. The built-up {{area of the}} village was 12 dunams.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed, the Lixos {{can be identified}} as the Draa (28°45’N). The Draa is the largest river in the area, and marks the southernmost limit of <b>cultivable</b> land. This well corresponds to Hanno's account. Certainly the area of Herne was known to the Carthaginians because they would hardly have sent a colony to an unknown place.|$|E
25|$|Using current culture technologies, much farmed {{cultivation}} of marine {{plants and animals}} can be applied within the 10 metre isobath in marine environments. There are about 1.33 million hectares of marine <b>cultivable</b> areas in China, including shallow seas, mudflats and bays. Before 1980, less than nine percent of these areas were cultivated, and species were mainly confined to kelp, laver (Porphyra) and mussels.|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{went into}} {{decline in the}} 13th century as the {{continuous}} growth of tax-free religious wealth—by the 1280s, two-thirds of Upper Burma's <b>cultivable</b> land had been alienated to the religion—affected the crown's ability to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen. This ushered in a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges by Mons, Mongols and Shans.|$|E
25|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 800mm but in Iran {{the annual}} rainfall is only 220mm. Overall, Iran's soil {{is not well}} suited for large scale agriculture. About 12 percent of the country's total land area of 1,636,000km² is cultivated. Still, 63% of the <b>cultivable</b> lands have not been used, and 185,000km² of the present farms are being used with 50 to 60% capacity.|$|E
25|$|Some Greek {{land was}} public and/or sacred. Each city possessed such land {{and it is}} {{estimated}} that in Athens during the classical period these lands represented a tenth of <b>cultivable</b> land. This was an administrative division and the property of the city itself (for example in Attica, it was a deme) or a temple. These lands were leased to individuals.|$|E
25|$|When peace {{eventually}} {{came to the}} district, most of the <b>cultivable</b> land had been taken by British settlers and was converted to sheep and cattle (later dairy) farming. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century a generation of both settlers and Māori had grown up together and there was some form of accommodation including intermarriage. The district lost men to the two World Wars, but an even greater blow was the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 which devastated small villages.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{about half}} of the municipality’s {{employed}} population works in industry, with the rest divided between agriculture and commerce. The municipality has 26,000 hectares of <b>cultivable</b> land. Most of this is used for crops only during the rainy season, with only about 5,000 hectares irrigated. Principle crops include corn, wheat, barley, animal feed, peas, potatoes and beans. Crops are grown for both auto consumption and for sale. Livestock includes cows, pigs, sheep and domestic fowl. There are a few major livestock producers such as the Pasteje and Santiago Yeche ranches. There are 2,470 hectares of forest.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} small area of <b>cultivable</b> hinterland and a treacherous harbour entrance, early hopes of Opotiki town becoming a major centre for the Bay of Plenty were dashed. During the twentieth century the town suffered from repeated shifts of businesses and local government to Whakatane, a situation which has only begun to reverse very recently with increasing population. Major floods in the 1950s and 1960s led {{to the protection of}} the town by levees (‘stopbanks’) which have successfully prevented any further inundations. A major boost to prosperity occurred with the kiwifruit boom of the late twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of the oil industry}} had an effect on Kirkuk's demographics. The exploitation of Kirkuk's oil, which began around 1930, attracted both Arabs and Kurds to the city in search of work. Kirkuk, which had been a predominantly Turkmen city, gradually lost its uniquely Turkmen character. At the same time, large numbers of Kurds from the mountains were settling in the uninhabited but <b>cultivable</b> rural parts of the district of Kirkuk. The influx of Kurds into Kirkuk continued through the 1960s. According to the 1957 census, Kirkuk city was 37.63% Iraqi Turkmen, 33.26% Kurdish with Arabs and Assyrians making up less than 23% of its population.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital was}} {{provisioned}} by the indigenous towns and its labor {{was available for}} enterprises that ultimately created a colonial economy. The gradual drying up of the central lake system created more dry land for farming, but the sixteenth-century population declines allowed Spaniards to expand their acquisition of land. One region that retained strong Indian land holding was the southern fresh water area, which important suppliers of fresh produce to the capital. The area was characterized by intensely cultivated chinampas, man-made extensions of <b>cultivable</b> land into the lake system. These chinampa towns retained a strong indigenous character and Indians continued to hold the majority of that land, despite its closeness to the Spanish capital. A key example is Xochimilco.|$|E
25|$|Running from Zonguldak in {{the west}} to Rize in the east, the narrow coastal strip widens at several places into fertile, {{intensely}} cultivated deltas. The Samsun area, close to the midpoint, is a major tobacco-growing region; east of it are numerous citrus groves. East of Samsun, the area around Trabzon is world-renowned for the production of hazelnuts, and farther east the Rize region has numerous tea plantations. All <b>cultivable</b> areas, including mountain slopes wherever they are not too steep, are sown or used as pasture. The mild, damp climate of the Black Sea coast makes commercial farming profitable. The western part of the Black Sea region, especially the Zonguldak area, is a center of coal mining and heavy industry.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aim of the}} 1920 Land Commission was {{to promote}} European {{agriculture}} by curbing growing economic crops by Africans where this competed with Europeans, and by reserving for those Africans living outside the estates only as much land as was sufficient for them, making the remainder available to form small to medium size European plantations. The commission considered that 700,000 acres of Crown land was potentially available to create future estates. This was mainly outside the Shire Highlands, which contained many existing estates. The commission estimated that the African population of Nyasaland would double by 1950 but gave a very low estimate that 3.2 million acres of <b>cultivable</b> land and appropriate pasturage that would be sufficient to feed this anticipated future population.|$|E
25|$|By 1952 the Bolivian {{economy had}} {{deteriorated}} even further. The {{governments of the}} sexenio had been reluctant to increase taxes for the upper class and to reduce social spending, resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of total imports in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the <b>cultivable</b> land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Jagannathan {{started working}} on issues {{concerned}} with prawn farms {{along the coast of}} Tamil Nadu. This time the problems were not from the local landlords, but from large industries from cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkatta, Delhi and Hyderabad which occupied large areas of land for aquaculture along the coast, which not only threw the landless labourers out of employment but also converted fertile and <b>cultivable</b> land into salty deserts after a few years when the prawn companies moved on. The prawn farms also caused heavy seepage of seawater into the groundwater in the neighbourhood, thus the local people were deprived of clean drinking water resources. The result is that even more small farmers sell their meager land-holdings to multinational prawn companies and move to the cities, filling urban slums.|$|E
25|$|Ownership of Amman {{following}} Sirghitmish's {{death in}} 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants {{sold it to}} Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus.

The increasingly frequent division and sale {{of the city and}} lands of Amman to different owners signaled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From the 15th century onward until 1878, Amman became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used for shelter by seasonal farmers from elsewhere who used the arable land of the area, and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.|$|E
25|$|The main {{provisions}} of the Africans on Private Estates Ordinance, 1952 were {{that the presence of}} all resident Africans on estates was to be legalized; a register was to be kept of all resident Africans; every resident was entitled to that extent of <b>cultivable</b> land already under crops {{at the time of the}} implementation of the Ordinance in I952, but the land could be withdrawn if not put to good use; the quinquennial period of evictions was abolished, and in future could only take place if approved by an Arbitration Board consisting of three representatives of estate owners and three Africans, under the chairmanship of the Provincial Commissioner. There were other details which provided for controlled rent, graduated rent for females, the right of unmarried women to permanent residence (a male, however, could only remain on an estate after reaching the age of eighteen with the owner's permission) and the growing by Africans of cash crops by contract only.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} {{was not prepared to}} support Bowring’s proposal or deal with the anomaly noted by Ormsby-Gore. Instead, legislation passed in Nyasaland in 1928, the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, provided that each African resident in an estate was entitled to a hut site and a plot of <b>cultivable</b> land, in return for which they had either to work in lieu of rent or for wages, or to grow economic crops to give the landowner in lieu of rent. This measure failed in practice as it did not provide a permanent solution satisfactory either to estate owners or tenants, particularly during the world-wide economic depression of the early 1930s. The 1938 Bell Report noted that many estate owners had little need of tenants’ labour and could not pay them wages or purchase the crops they produced. Some of these tenants were obliged to find work outside their estate to pay their rents in cash.|$|E
25|$|To address prawn farm {{issue the}} Jagannathans {{organised}} {{the whole of}} LAFTI's village movement to raise awareness among the people to oppose the prawn farms. Since 1993, the villagers have offered Satygraha (non-violent resistance), through rallies, fasts, and demonstrations in protest of establishing the prawn farms. They have been beaten up by hired goons, their houses have been burnt, and LAFTI workers have been imprisoned, because of false accusations of looting and arson. Undeterred by this, Jagannathan filed a 'public interest petition' in the Indian Supreme Court, which in turn asked NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Institute of India) to investigate the matter. NEERI's investigation report highlighted the environmental cost of the prawn farms to the nation and recommended all prawn farms within 500 meters of the coast to be banned. In December 1996 the Supreme Court issued a ruling against intensive shrimp farming in <b>cultivable</b> lands within 500 meters of the coastal area. It is said {{that because of the}} prawn farmers' local political influence, the Supreme Court judgement was not implemented on the ground. The legal battle around the prawn farms is still not resolved and the Jagannathans continue their struggle to establish non-exploitative, eco-friendly communities in the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|In 1819, the Kashmir Valley {{passed from}} {{the control of the}} Durrani Empire of Afghanistan to the conquering armies of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh of the Punjab, thus ending four centuries of Muslim rule under the Mughals and the Afghan regime. As the Kashmiris had {{suffered}} under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers. However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the adhan, the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the <b>cultivable</b> land to be cultivated. Many Kashmiri peasants migrated to the plains of the Punjab. However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh Empire. During this time Kashmiri shawls became known worldwide, attracting many buyers, especially in the West.|$|E
