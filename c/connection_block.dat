40|$|Mobile {{communication}} on the multi-beam {{satellite communication}} has attracted attention, since Digital Video Broadcasting – Return Channel Satellite (DVB-RCS) has been successively implemented. In general, multi beam satellite employs uniform allocation of RF power and bandwidth to multi beams, {{since it is}} hard to predict the distribution of traffic requests and the arrival rate of new connection. This makes it difficult to satisfy the traffic requests in a beam. Thus, when an unpredictable event, such as a disaster, regional warfare and deteriorating weather conditions, occur in a special spot beam, many more terminals will require access to a special beam channel. This causes the special beam channel to be saturated, while adjacent beam channel resources are available. Thus, we propose a novel handover strategy to improve satellite return link resource utilization using load balancing handover. Simulation results shows the proposed handover algorithm outperforms conventional handover algorithms in terms of new <b>connection</b> <b>block</b> probability, handover block probability, return link resource utilization and capacity request block rate...|$|E

This paper examines {{the flexibility of}} the interconnect structure that joins memory and logic.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of multi-bit processing elements such as digital signal processors, multipliers, multi-bit addressable memory cells, and CPU cores has presented new opportunities for Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architects to utilize the regularity of multi-bit signals to increase the area efficiency of FPGAs. In particular, configuration memory sharing has been traditionally used to exploit multi-bit regularity for area. We observe {{that the process of}} creating configuration memory sharing routing resources often leads to the use of much sparser switch patterns for connecting multi-bit elements to their routing tracks. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effect of these sparse switch patterns on the area efficiency of FPGAs. It is shown that the sparse switch patterns alone contribute significantly to the area reduction observed in configuration memory sharing FPGAs. In particular, our experiments show that, without configuration memory sharing, sparse switch patterns can reduce the implementation area of multi-bit routing resources by 10. 4 % while configuration memory sharing contributes to an additional 1. 2 % in area savings. The observation holds over a wide range of <b>connection</b> <b>block</b> flexibility values and demonstrates that efficient switch pattern designs can be effectively used to increase the area efficiency of FPGA routing resources. 1...|$|E

To inherit the merits of both while overcoming their disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a novel single-shot based detector, called RefineDet, that achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods and maintains comparable efficiency of one-stage methods. RefineDet consists of two inter-connected modules, namely, the anchor refinement module and the object detection module. Specifically, the former aims to (1) filter out negative anchors to reduce search space for the classifier, and (2) coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. The latter module takes the refined anchors as the input from the former to further improve the regression and predict multi-class label. Meanwhile, we design a transfer <b>connection</b> <b>block</b> to transfer the features in the anchor refinement module to predict locations, sizes and class labels of objects in the object detection module.

With ever increasing level of device integration and the growth in complexity of electronic circuits, increasing the demand of portable electronics devices and also dependence on the battery operated devices motivating the VLSI designers to reduce the power dissipation, of the VLSI circuits. The reduction of power is the most often used measures of the efficiency of VLSI circuits. Low power circuits have long battery life. Power consumption due to memory accesses in a computing system often constitutes the dominant portion of the total power consumption.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{work of the}} heart is triggered by electrical activity in the muscle fibres. The potentials from individual muscle fibres interfere {{with each other to}} produce an electrical field which can be examined by recording potential differences on the body surface with an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG contains several wave- components, each describing one particular sequence of the heart cycle. The so-called T wave in the ECG contains information about the electrical recovery phase (repolarization). Disturbances in the repolarization phase may increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias. Thus, markers which indicate repolarization disturbances would be of great clinical value. In an earlier study, principal component analysis (PCA) of the T wave in a 12 -channel ECG, showed differences between groups of patients with different degrees of repolarization disturbances. However, the method is not sensitive enough to be used on single individuals. In order to make the method more sensitive, one hypothesis is {{to increase the number of}} ECG channels and the sampling frequency. Testing this hypothesis requires a software tool and unconventional measurement equipment. This master’s thesis considers implementation and simulation tests of a software tool for PCA of the T wave in multi-channel ECGs. The practical aspect of this study consisted of building a <b>connection</b> <b>block</b> which gives extra surface ECG channels to an apparatus for invasive measurements. Before PCA can be performed, the ECG signals must pass a number of preprocessing steps. Much of the effort in this study revolved around defining the time instances when the T wave starts and ends. Three algorithms for defining the T wave onset and four algorithms for defining the T wave end where implemented and evaluated in a simulation study. In addition, a test was performed in which simulated data were reproduced according to an earlier simulation study. The reproduced data were analyzed by the implemented software tool and compared with the previous study. The results from the simulation study suggested that a combination of a T- onset algorithm based on the heart rate interval and an area-based T-end algorithm is the most robust in sense of noise and wave-shape abnormalities. The test with the reproduced data showed similar results as the earlier simulation study. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for optical network operators is related to realizing profitable networks that preserve the overall satisfaction of their end customers. This necessitates ensuring a controlled network resource usage while decreasing <b>connection</b> <b>blocking</b> probability. However, optical networks are witnessing the introduction of {{an increasing number of}} new services, each having different requirements. As such, the evolution towards resource efficient connection setup management strategies that provide differentiated call-blocking probability becomes inevitable. Building on the previous observation, we propose in this paper a novel connection setup management strategy. This latter aims to differentiate the blocking probability among different classes of lightpath requests, while avoiding the starvation of the lower class lightpaths. The main idea behind our proposal is to privilige higher class lightpaths via preemption and to protect the lower class lightpaths through rerouting. In this manner, the proposed strategy serves the double objective of minimizing the overall <b>connection</b> <b>blocking</b> probability and of realizing quality of service (QoS) differentiation. The previous claim is asserted through our simulation results that gauge the main benefits behind our proposed connection setup strategy. The simulation results drawn from the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and the European Optical Network (EON) show that the proposed strategy achieves both differentiated and low blocking probabilities.

40|$|FPGAs (field {{programmable}} gate arrays) {{are attractive}} alternatives compared to ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for significantly lowering amortized manufacturing costs and dramatically improving design productivity. The architecture of an FPGA is very regular. It {{is relatively easy}} to design a highly optimized tile, with consideration of various manufacturing related issues, and then to replicate it many times across the chip. The configurability of FPGAs also enables yield improvement and defect tolerance. However, FPGAs are still facing serious challenges in terms of delay, power consumption, and logic density compared to ASICs. FPGA is estimated to be over twenty times less efficient in logic density, over three times worse in delay, and over ten times higher in power consumption compared to a functionally equivalent ASIC. One promising way to improve FPGA performance is to incorporate three-dimensional (3 D) integration, which increases the number of active layers and optimizes the interconnect network vertically. Another solution is to apply novel nanoelectronic materials (nanomaterials) and devices. This dissertation introduces three novel reconfigurable architectures, named 3 D nFPGA, FPCNA (field programmable carbon nanotube array), and NEM FPGA (nanoelectromechanical FPGA), which utilize 3 D integration techniques and new nanoscale materials synergistically. Customized CAD flows that consider process variation have been developed for different architectures to evaluate their potential performances. Also described is a 3 D variation aware routing flow, which is an essential tool for future 3 D FPGA architecture exploration. 3 D nFPGA is based on CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) and nano hybrid techniques that incorporate nanomaterials such as nanowire crossbars and carbon nanotube bundles into the CMOS fabrication process. Using unique features of FPGAs and a novel 3 D stacking method enabled by the application of nanomaterials, 3 D nFPGA obtains a 4 × footprint reduction comparing to the traditional CMOS-based 2 D FPGAs. The performance and power of 3 D nFPGA driven by the 20 largest MCNC (microelectronics center of North Carolina) benchmarks have been evaluated. Results demonstrate that 3 D nFPGA is able to provide a performance gain of 2. 6 × with a small power overhead compared to the traditional 2 D FPGA. FPCNA includes lookup tables created entirely from continuous carbon nanotube (CNT) ribbons. To determine the performance of the building blocks, variation aware physical design tools are used, with statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) that can handle both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random variables. A 2. 75 × performance improvement is seen over an equivalent CMOS FPGA at a 95 % yield. In addition, FPCNA offers a 5 × footprint reduction compared to a baseline FPGA. 3 D NEM FPGA is the architecture that utilizes nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays and 3 D integration techniques synergistically. This proposed architecture has unique features including a hybrid CMOS-NEM FPGA lookup table (LUT) and configurable logic block (CLB), NEM-based switch block (SB) and <b>connection</b> <b>block</b> (CB), and face-to-face 3 D stacking. This architecture also has a built-in feature called direct link, which takes advantage of the short vertical wire length provided by 3 D stacking to further enhance performance. An overall 46. 3 % critical path delay reduction has been observed compared to its CMOS counterpart. To maximize the potential performance gain of 3 D integrated circuit architectures, an SSTA engine was developed to deal with both uncorrelated and correlated variations in 3 D FPGAs. The effects of intra-die and inter-die variation are considered.
