40|$|The mesocortical pathway {{projecting}} from the {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays {{a critical role in}} a number of cognitive and emotional processes. While this pathway has been traditionally viewed as dopaminergic, recent data indicate that a considerable proportion of rostromedial VTA neurons possess markers for glutamate transmission. However, the relative density of the glutamatergic projection to the PFC from these rostromedial regions is unknown. In the present study, anterograde tracer injections into 4 ventral midbrain subregions were coupled with immunohistochemical analysis of labeled axons in PFC for markers of dopamine (DA; tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) and glutamate (vesi-cular glutamate transporter 2; VGLUT 2). We found that while tracer injections into the interfascicular nucleus <b>produced</b> <b>labeled</b> fibers in the PFC that were mainly TH positive, tracer injections into the rostral linear nucleus, rostral VTA, and parabrachial pigmented nucleus <b>produced</b> <b>labeled</b> fibers in PFC that contained mainly VGLUT 2 -positive rather than TH-positive varicosities. When viewed {{in the light of the}} previously documented strong g-aminobutyric acidergic component, it would seem that the rostromedial mesocortical projection is actually an amino acid pathway that in addition has a DA component...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: 1) to identify and map the experimental area of Meadow Creek watershed by existing vegetation, and 2) to identify and map the experimental area of Meadow Creek watershed by habitat types. The classification system adopted {{for this study was}} based on the habitat type concept of Rexford Daubenmire. Frequency of herbaceous vegetation and cover of shrub species were sampled in riparian <b>communities.</b> In <b>upland</b> <b>communities</b> density and cover estimations were used to quantify herbaceous plants, line intercepts were employed to sample shrub species, and belt transects were used to quantify the overstory component via density and basal area. Forty permanent transects were established in riparian communities and 151 permanent transects were established in <b>upland</b> <b>communities.</b> An association table process was employed for separation of plant communities and habitat types. Transects on the riparian meadows proved to be insufficiently stratified for quantification of plant communities. However, 44 riparian communities were delineated by reconnaissance methods. Seventeen plant communities were detected and mapped on upland areas. Habitat type classifications revealed three grassland, one shrub, and six forest habitat types on the area. Riparian meadows and {{a small portion of the}} upland area could not be classified to habitat types...|$|R
