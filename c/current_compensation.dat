40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a direct current-space-vector control {{of an active}} power filter (APF) based on a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) voltage-source inverter. The pro-posed method indirectly generates the <b>compensation</b> <b>current</b> ref-erence by using an equivalent conductance of the fundamental component using APF’s dc-link voltage control. The proposed con-trol can selectively choose harmonic current components by real-time fast Fourier transform to generate the <b>compensation</b> <b>current.</b> The <b>compensation</b> <b>current</b> is represented in a rotating coordinate system with chosen switching states from a switching table imple-mented in a field-programmable gate array. In addition, a three-phase four-wire APF based on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter is also presented. The proposed APF eliminates harmon-ics in all three phases {{as well as the}} neutral current. A three-phase three-wire NPC inverter system {{can be used as a}} three-phase four-wire system since the split dc capacitors provide a neutral connec-tion. To regulate and balance the split dc-capacitor voltages, a new control method using a sign cubical hysteresis controller is pro-posed. The characteristics of the APF system with an LCL-ripple filter are investigated and compared with traditional current con-trol strategies to evaluate the inherent advantages. The simulation and experimental results validated the feasibility of the proposed APF.

We use data from a survey of 349 farm households and their farm plots in the upper Chaobai watershed within Hebei province. Water reallocation from upstream to downstream areas has reduced agricultural water supply and the area irrigated.
