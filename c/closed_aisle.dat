6000|$|... [Footnote E: See {{our history}} of Mary Queen of Scots, near the <b>close.</b> <b>Aisles</b> in English Cathedral churches are colonnades, or spaces between columns {{on an open}} floor, and not {{passages}} between pews, as with us. In monumental churches like Westminster Abbey there are no pews.] ...|$|R
60|$|The Regent moved <b>closer</b> to the <b>aisle,</b> that {{he might}} meet the impostor {{at the foot of}} the chancel steps. The {{procession}} was moving steadily up the aisle.|$|R
6000|$|Those of {{the goddess}} whose shrine was beneath the pile Of the God with the baldachined altar overhead: [...] "And {{what did you get}} by raising this nave and <b>aisle</b> <b>Close</b> {{on the site of the}} temple I tenanted? ...|$|R
50|$|The Early English Church was {{plastered}} {{inside and}} on this were commonly painted frescoes. A remnant of this treatment {{is to be found}} on the easternmost pillar of the north <b>aisle.</b> <b>Close</b> to this pillar and (behind the priest's stall) on the north side are to be seen traces of a pointed arch which evidently formed the doorway to the rood stairs. This is now blocked up.|$|R
50|$|Later in Quitman's pastorate, in {{the early}} 1820s, the {{congregation}} hired a local builder named Stephen McCarty to do $3,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) worth of renovations to the church. Following the plans of Christopher Wren's churches in London, its original plan was altered {{to make it more}} formal. The original side entrance was <b>closed</b> off, longitudinal <b>aisles</b> were introduced and the pews arranged to focus attention on the pulpit. The tower was added as well.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the game, each player places their ante into a cup or hat. (The money can also be held in a pocket or hand, or the game can be played with mental IOUs or for simple points.) The game begins {{in the top of the}} first inning, with the player <b>closest</b> to the <b>aisle</b> holding the cup for the length of the half inning. Alternately, players may draw numbers or {{otherwise}} randomly determine the order.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the churchyard}} {{is a small}} building, known as the Broun Aisle, which was built by a local family as their {{personal}} burial space in 1864. The Broun family were originally buried inside the church itself, but as a plaque on the building states, this aisle was erected {{in lieu of the}} burial place within the church, which, in deference to the parishioners' feelings, has now <b>closed.</b> [...] The <b>aisle</b> itself is now closed, and is used for storage.|$|R
50|$|The canons built {{very long}} naves to {{accommodate}} large congregations. The choirs were also long. Sometimes, as at Llanthony and Christchurch, Dorset(Twynham), the choir was <b>closed</b> from the <b>aisles.</b> At other abbeys of the order, such as Bolton or Kirkham, {{there were no}} aisles. The nave in the northern houses of the order often had only a north aisle (this is the case at Bolton, Brinkburn and Lanercost). The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary plan. The prior's lodge was usually attached to the southwest angle of the nave.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tryan {{sat in a}} pew {{near the}} pulpit with several other clergymen. He looked pale, and rubbed {{his hand over his}} face and pushed back his hair oftener than usual. Standing in the <b>aisle</b> <b>close</b> to him, and repeating the {{responses}} with edifying loudness, was Mr. Budd, churchwarden and delegate, with a white staff in his hand and a backward bend of his small head and person, such as, I suppose, he considered suitable to a friend of sound religion. Conspicuous in the gallery, too, was the tall figure of Mr. Dempster, whose professional avocations rarely allowed him to occupy his place at church.|$|R
50|$|At {{an altar}} to the south/right {{of the main}} {{entrance}} is St. John Baptist and Saints by Cima da Conegliano, and in the fourth chapel on the North/left facing the main altar, the Contarini Chapel, there is a notable St. Agnes by Tintoretto. The Renaissance Valier Chapel once housed a small Madonna with Child by Giovanni Bellini (1481), stolen in 1993. Other works by Tintoretto in the church include a Presentation in the Temple (South <b>aisle,</b> <b>close</b> to the East end), Adoration of the Golden Calf, Last Judgement (both in the apse, {{either side of the}} main altar) and the Four Cardinal Virtues (in the upper storey of the apse, behind the altar), all from 1562 to 1564.|$|R
5000|$|Behind the rood screen, McCarthy's reredos was {{retained}} intact but {{its lower}} portions were enriched with marble inlays in a diaper pattern with fleur de lis in a vibrant variety of coloured Italian marbles. A new Lady Altar and tabernacle was constructed before the reredos from statuary marble. The antependium contained three bas-relief groups, {{the work of}} the eminent Roman sculptor Michele Trepisciano (1860-1913) showing [...] "The Presentation of the Blessed Virgin in the Temple", [...] "The Assumption" [...] and [...] "The Coronation of the Virgin" [...] recessed in separate panels with cusped heads, and columns of Breccia di Seravezza antica and Breccia Corallina marbles. The tabernacle, inlaid with Corsican Jasper, was {{in the form of a}} cube topped with a roof of fish scale carvings and finished with two large statuary marble standing angels. [...] To the North and South of the Lady Chapel, Side Chapels were erected to St Joseph (North) and St Brigid (South), <b>closing</b> the <b>aisles</b> at the East. [...] In the South transept, a sumptuous altar was erected to the Sacred Heart. Finally, to the West end, McCarthy's wooden gallery was replaced with a three-bay marble screen of white marble supported on quatrefoil pillars of Portasanta marble and inlaid with Brocatello marble. The organ itself was rebuilt to suit the newly enlarged space and a new Austrian oak organ case was designed and built.|$|R
50|$|The cult of St. Leucius spread {{throughout}} the region of Apulia (where many of the rural parishes still bear his name), and he became much venerated in Trani, Lecce, Benevento, Caserta, and Capua. The spread of the cult of Saint Leucius in southern Italy came {{to coincide with the}} official conversion to Christianity of the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, Brindisi, which is believed to be attributed to Saint Barbato, in 680 and to the Duchess Teoderada in 706. Later that century, the remains of Leucius, which had begun {{to attract the attention of}} many pilgrims, were transferred to Trani, placed in a chapel located under the cathedral. Later, they was transferred again to Benevento. The cult of the saint {{spread throughout}} the region, even reaching Rome, where a monastery dedicated to him was constructed as early as the sixth century. In Atessa a legend grew around St. Leucius in which the Bishop of Brindisi killed a dragon that had long terrorized the people, and in witness of his work gave him one of the ribs.In the Basilica Cathedral of Brindisi, which was dedicated in 1771, the altar which <b>closes</b> the left <b>aisle</b> preserves the relic of an arm of Leucius. A depiction of the saint adorns the cathedral, done on canvas by Oronzo Tiso (1726-1800).|$|R
