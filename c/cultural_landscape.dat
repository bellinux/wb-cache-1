40|$|Almost all {{rural areas}} in Europe have been shaped or altered by humans {{and can be}} {{considered}} <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> many of which now are considered to entail valuable cultural heritage. Current dynamics in land management have put <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> under a huge pressure of agricultural intensification and land abandonment. To prevent the loss of <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> knowledge on the location {{of different types of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> is needed. In this paper, we present a characterization of European <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> based on the prevalence of three key dimensions of <b>cultural</b> landscapes: <b>landscape</b> structure, management intensity, and value and meaning. We mapped these dimensions across Europe at a 1 -km resolution by combining proxies on management intensity and landscape structure with new indicators such as social media usage and registered traditional food products. We integrated the three dimensions into a continuous “cultural landscape index” that allows for a characterization of Europe’s rural landscapes. The characterization identifies hotspots of <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> where all three dimensions are present, such as in the Mediterranean. On the other hand, Eastern and Northern European <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> are mostly characterized by only one of the dimensions. Our paper can help to identify pressures to <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> and thus to target measures for the conservation of these landscapes, to link similar landscapes in different regions, and to inform policy design on the most important characteristics of <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> at a regional scale...|$|R
5|$|There is {{also the}} {{possibility}} that tribal differences {{were part of the}} Neolithic <b>cultural</b> <b>landscape.</b> Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar, and stalled tombs such as Midhowe. Grooved Ware pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger 'village' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse, and with Maes Howe style tombs.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and <b>cultural</b> <b>landscape</b> of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{nowadays}} {{sparsely populated}} {{as the result}} of urbanization after World War II. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the <b>cultural</b> <b>landscape.</b> Epirus, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, {{is considered one of the}} most underdeveloped regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E

40|$|Tourism Potential of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Landscapes</b> in the Hârtibaciu Valley Characterized by a {{multitude}} of cultures, Hârtibaciu Valley, lying {{in the center of}} Romania, in the Sibiu county, generated various <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> throughout history. It carries the name after the river that flows through this beautiful hilly region. These carryout the inland cultural heritage and marks in every materialization of the landscape results. The subject presents the series of <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> of the Hârtibaciu Valley that are attractive for tourism purposes. The <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> are not only considered to be a compound effect of the interaction of the natural and anthropic components, but also as an element of the environment, being in a continuous metamorphosis. Using a classification of the <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> from the genetic point of view, the different landscapes found in the field are listed: <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> resulted from productive activities, habitational landscapes, technogenic landscapes, historical landscapes, sacred landscapes, symbolic landscapes, commemorative landscapes, residual landscapes. For each category of landscapes the tourism attractiveness and representativeness will be mentioned. The foreseen evolution of the <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> in the Hârtibaciu Valley is one of falling in decline. The prevention of this situation could be realized by using its tourism potential to its maximum and by a proactive tourism promotion and development. Local identity and specificity is the ground stone that offers attractiveness to these <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This implies a conscious involvement of local actors and stakeholders to improve life quality and to develop a regional functional system...|$|R

5|$|Many of the {{cultural}} practices that were to define Merina social and political life for centuries are credited to Andrianjaka. He designated the twelve sacred hills of Imerina that were to become the spiritual and political heartland of the Merina empire, contributing {{to the establishment of}} the kingdom's traditional boundaries; clans were assigned to specific regions within his kingdom, further defining the <b>cultural</b> <b>landscape.</b> He consolidated power through such measures as appropriating the folk tradition of sampy (community talismans), thereby ensuring all the powers traditionally attributed to these idols were {{under the control of the}} sovereign alone. Merina traditions related to the burial and mourning of sovereigns are also traced back to Andrianjaka's reign.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide natural landscapes {{are being}} {{replaced}} by human-dominated landscapes. A main feature is the human imprint that shapes and re-shapes these landscapes and reflects the socio-economic, political and cultural conditions as well as needs and values of a particular society at a given time. Some of these <b>landscapes</b> are considered <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> in particular those that evolved {{over long periods of}} time and created biologically and culturally diverse landscapes with characteristic <b>landscape</b> elements. These <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> are considered worthy of protection. However, protecting or 'freezing' <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> at a particular point in time seems to be a contradictive goal since they have been continuously evolving based on their use and management. Therefore, maintaining and developing <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> or landscape elements in a way that they can contribute to their unique character whilst protecting internationally and nationally listed habitats and species appears to be a more sensible goal. We present Germany's southwest, the state of Baden-Wurttemberg as a case study. We discuss the wide range of instruments that have been put in place to maintain and develop Baden-Wurttemberg's <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes.</b> We speculate about their future and argue that to maintain and develop these and other <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> around the globe require creative strategies that complement the conventional nature conservation and landscape management approaches. Although no panacea, regional development strategies that are developed from the bottom-up and are embedded in legal planning frameworks are likely to support management and development of <b>cultural</b> <b>landscapes</b> more effectively than any individual applications of the existing conventional approaches...|$|R
