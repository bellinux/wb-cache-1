Les modèles de relation liant ces deux paramètres reposent sur des concepts similaires faisant intervenir la loi de puissance Y=aXb. Bien que la validité d'une telle relation n'est pas à prouver, une analyse qualitative de la constante a et de l'exposant b a été effectuée pour un bassin versant situé en zone semi - aride : l'Oued Wahrane (Algérie). Les différentes échelles temporelles d'analyse utilisées ont permis d'expliquer le comportement des paramètres de l'équation en vue d'une meilleure compréhension de cette relation et de relier ces paramètres aux facteurs qui induisent le débit solide. L'objectif principal à trait aux aspects théoriques et pratiques du phénomène du transport solide en suspension. Les résultats ont permis d'identifier de manière assez concluante les modèles saisonniers. L'échelle saisonnière est très représentative du phénomène de transport solide dans le bassin versant. D'autres part, l'événement averse-crue s'est avéré l'unité hydrologique la plus adéquate pour les analyses en relation avec le transport solide. Fluxes of suspended materials {{collected at}} gauge stations {{are closely related}} to flow discharges. In the absence of continuous recorded suspended sediment concentration data, hydrologists have used rating sediment transport curves to define the water discharge/suspended sediment relationship and to estimate (predict) suspended sediment concentrations for use in flux calculations. Although there are many methods for developing rating curves, the most common is a power function Y=aXb that relates suspended sediment concentration to water discharge. The discharge measurement is composed of independent variables and a and b are the intercept and slope of the rating curve, respectively. These rating curves are usually generated by least squares regression. Although the accuracy of this approach has been questioned, the applicability appears to be adequate for many purposes. In order to better understand the relationship, this paper reports a qualitative analysis of parameters a and b. The average suspended sediment load for a <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> average <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> is the product of the average concentration of the suspended materials and the average flow discharge during the same period. The relation between sediment discharge and water discharge in Algeria rivers is unknown and difficult to assess. Some of these difficulties are related to sampling methods and a continuous record of suspended sediment concentrations is not available. This work will also be used to describe sedimentary dynamics specific to the basin during flood periods. The study was carried out on daily flow discharge data and the concentration of suspended materials collected from the gauging station on the Wahrane River (1972 to 1989). To determine the variation of the parameters a and b of the power relation, a methodology using regression models was used, based on an analysis on various scales of the parameters a and b of the equation of sediment transport in relation to the hydrological characteristics. The analysis reveals the evolution of the parameters a and b. Several temporal scales were used. An examination on an annual scale shows {{that it was possible to}} define a very strong relationship between a and the hydraulicity for the dry years and that indeed the factor a, indicating erodability, was well correlated with the hydraulicity during the dry period. The exponent b was correlated with hydraulicity only during the wet period. The relationship between a and mean rainfall was not significant. The seasonal scale revealed a very distinct effect. The production of sediments was very strong in autumn and winter when sediment transport approached the very typical power model. The seasonal rainfall strongly explained the variations of a while the exponent b was related to peak discharge. The analysis carried out on a monthly scale essentially produced the same conclusions as the analysis on a seasonal scale. It was found that the variation of a was more significant in winter and autumn than in the other seasons, presumably because of the hydrologic and sedimentology activity during this period, and the nature and surface quality of the soil. The relation between parameter a and the monthly average rainfall was very good. Given that the storm is the temporal unit most adequate for hydrological analyses in relation to sediment transport, analysis of single hydrologic events in the Wahrane River yields more details on the variation of a and b. The study was extended to the decomposition of the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograms. The floods of March and October showed the evolution of the parameters a and b. First, the range of variation of a and b, which was narrow during the preceding analyses, was broader for the analysis of the rising limb of the hydrograms. Secondly, the values of a and b showed opposite temporal trends. The high values of b were particularly characteristic of the risings associated with the autumn, during which flow discharges are strongest. The risings of winter floods were marked by low values of a. February and December were characterized by lower values of a in the falling limb than in the rising limb and stronger values of b in falling limb. Lastly, analysis of the values of a with respect to the antecedent precipitations index, IPA, suggested that the highest values of a were related to a weak IPA and a strong soil erodability in the catchment, whereas low values of a would reflect soil saturation (i. e. a strong IPA). The study showed that the power relationship between sediment load and stream flow was influenced by precipitation, runoff amount and soil moisture, and illustrated the complexity of solid transport...|$|R

So an analytical assessment of the connection existing between the stream and the spring was required. Moreover, a geological survey of the spring area was carried out, with the aim to reconstruct the geological and hydrogeological context. The large amount of groundwater in the basin is linked to a high permeability of the shallow rock mass.

5000|$|The {{catchment}} {{of a river}} above {{a certain}} location {{is determined by the}} surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the <b>stream's</b> <b>discharge</b> hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event.

The decline in trout habitat condition appeared to be more a function <b>of</b> <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> and channel aggradation than grazing management.

Investigating {{storm runoff}} {{generation}} in watersheds {{is an area}} of ongoing hydrologic research. Geochemical tracer studies, such as static end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and hysteresis loop analysis, have been used to evaluate these processes. While EMMA can assess the relative input of flow pathways for individual stream water quality samples collected during a storm, it cannot quantify their contributions continuously. Hysteresis loops <b>of</b> <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> versus geochemical tracer concentration can be used to estimate relative inputs of basic end-member pathways, but this approach only suggests the timing and dominance of flow pathways and these patterns alone cannot quantify their contributions. We propose a new method that incorporates both hysteresis loops and geochemical tracer studies to quantify runoff contributions from watershed flow pathways during a storm. The approach involves estimating relative tracer concentrations of four end-members, along with estimating the percentage <b>of</b> total <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> from each end-member. The method has been applied to a 22 year dataset from Panola Mountain Research Watershed, Georgia and has identified two distinct watershed responses to rain events.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{assessment}} method for discharge of produced water from coal seam gas (CSG) projects to streams in Australia. Management of produced {{water is a}} key issue for the sustainability of the CSG industry. The industry {{is likely to continue}} expanding in the future creating pressure to find beneficial uses for produced water. It has been suggested that some produced water, treated to an appropriate level, could be used to augment environmental flows in catchments experiencing water stress. The flow assessment method proposed includes six main stages, from determining discharge requirements of the operator and existing environmental values, to predicting changes in <b>stream</b> condition under <b>discharge</b> scenarios and selecting key indicators for monitoring. The main changes that will be brought about to <b>stream</b> ecosystems from <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> produced water relate to geomorphology, water quality and hydrology. The extent of these changes and the sensitivity of the environmental values within the system to these changes should be assessed prior to approval <b>of</b> <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> produced water, while operational requirements, such as timing, volumes and release points also need to be considered in a whole-of catchment context. The assessment method is applied to the Glenelg River as a case study to illustrate use of the method; this location was selected as a hypothetical case, purely due to data availability...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{onset of}} springtime weather has been {{documented}} in the western United States over at least the last 50 years. Because the majority (> 70 %) of the water supply in the western U. S. comes from snowmelt, analysis of the declining spring snowpack {{has important implications for}} the management of water resources. We studied ten years of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products, 40 years <b>of</b> <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> and meteorological station data and 30 years of snow-water equivalent (SWE) SNOw Telemetry (SNOTEL) data in the Wind River Range (WRR), Wyoming. Results show increasing air temperatures for. the 40 -year study period. <b>Discharge</b> from <b>streams</b> in WRR drainage basins show lower annual discharge and earlier snowmelt in the decade of the 2000 s than in the previous three decades. Changes in streamflow may be related to increasing air temperatures which are probably contributing to a reduction in snow cover, although no trend of either increasingly lower streamflow or earlier snowmelt was observed within the decade of the 2000 s. And SWE on 1 April does not show an expected downward trend from 1980 to 2009. The extent of snow cover derived from the lowest-elevation zone of the WRR study area is strongly correlated (r= 0. 91) with <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> on 1 May during the decade of the 2000 s. The strong relationship between snow cover and streamflow indicates that MODIS snow-cover maps can be used to improve management of water resources in the drought-prone western U. S...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} juvenile coho, spring Chinook, and steelhead salmon migration {{data collected}} at a 1. 5 m diameter cone rotary fish trap on Nason Creek during 2008; providing abundance and freshwater productivity estimates. We used species enumeration at the trap and efficiency trials to describe emigration timing and {{to estimate the}} number of emigrants. Trapping began on March 2, 2008 and was suspended on December 11, 2008 when snow and ice accumulation prevented operation. During 2008, 0 brood year (BY) 2006 coho, 1 BY 2007 coho, 906 BY 2006 spring Chinook, 323 BY 2007 fry Chinook, 2, 077 BY 2007 subyearling Chinook, 169 steelhead smolts, 414 steelhead fry and 2, 390 steelhead parr were trapped. Mark-recapture trap efficiency trials were performed over a range <b>of</b> <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> stages. A total of 2, 639 spring Chinook, 2, 154 steelhead and 12 bull trout were implanted with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. Most PIT tagged fish were used for trap efficiency trials. We were unable to identify a statistically significant relationship between <b>stream</b> <b>discharge</b> and trap efficiency, thus, pooled efficiency estimates specific to species and trap size/position were used to estimate the number of fish emigrating past the trap. We estimate that 5, 259 ({+-} 359; 95 % CI) BY 2006 Chinook, 16, 816 ({+-} 731; 95 % CI) BY 2007 Chinook, and 47, 868 ({+-} 3, 780; 95 % CI) steelhead parr and smolts emigrated from Nason Creek in 2008...|$|R
