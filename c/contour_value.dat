This report focuses on optimization of a contoured FPV array which operates under Non Uniform Illumination (NUI) conditions. NUI conditions can occur at low solar angle for contoured layouts and also due to unexpected partial shading events. The output Power Voltage (P-V) characteristics under contouring and partial shading demonstrate severe oscillatory behavior around the maximum power region, which results in inefficient implementation of established tracking algorithms that seek to detect a dominant global maxima. An algorithm for MPP tracking has been proposed {{that takes into account}} both static and dynamic parameters. An integrated test system has been developed which can accurately monitor solar irradiance (range 100 - 1000 Watts/m(2)) and solar angle and load dependent instantaneous output voltage and current. The system has been designed for maximum current and voltage rating of 3 A and 25 V respectively.

40|$|This program prepares {{contour plots}} of {{three-dimensional}} randomly spaced data. The contouring techniques use a triangulation procedure developed by Dr. C. L. Lawson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{which allows the}} contouring of randomly spaced input data without first fitting the data into a rectangular grid. The program also allows contour points to be fitted with a smooth curve using an interpolating spline under tension. The input data points to be contoured are read from a magnetic tape or disk file with one record for each data point. Each record contains the X and Y coordinates, value to be contoured, and an alternate <b>contour</b> <b>value</b> (if applicable). The contour data is then partitioned by the program to reduce core storage requirements. Output consists of the contour plots and user messages. Several output options are available to the user such as: controlling which value in the data record is to be contoured, whether contours are drawn by polygonal lines or by a spline under tension (smooth curves), and controlling the contour level labels which may be suppressed if desired. The program can handle up to 56, 000 data points and provide for up to 20 contour intervals for a multiple number of parameters.

40|$|The EM-ANIMATE {{program is}} a {{specialized}} visualization program that displays and animates the near-field and surface-current solutions obtained from an electromagnetics program, in particular, that from MOM 3 D (LAR- 15074). The EM-ANIMATE program is windows based and contains a user-friendly, graphical interface for setting viewing options, case selection, file manipulation, etc. EM-ANIMATE displays the field and surface-current magnitude as smooth shaded color fields (color contours) ranging from a minimum <b>contour</b> <b>value</b> to a maximum <b>contour</b> <b>value</b> for the fields and surface currents. The program can display either the total electric field or the scattered electric field in either time-harmonic animation mode or in the root mean square (RMS) average mode. The default setting is initially set to the minimum and maximum values within the field and surface current data and can be optionally set by the user. The field and surface-current value are animated by calculating and viewing the solution at user selectable radian time increments between 0 and 2 pi. The surface currents can also be displayed in either time-harmonic animation mode or in RMS average mode. In RMS mode, the color contours do not vary with time, but show the constant time averaged field and surface-current magnitude solution. The electric field and surface-current directions can be displayed as scaled vector arrows which have a length proportional to the magnitude at each field grid point or surface node point. These vector properties can be viewed separately or concurrently with the field or surface-current magnitudes. Animation speed is improved by turning off the display of the vector arrows. In RMS modes, the direction vectors are still displayed as varying with time since the time averaged direction vectors would be zero length vectors. Other surface properties can optionally be viewed. These include the surface grid, the resistance value assigned to each element of the grid, and the power dissipation of each element which has an assigned resistance value. The EM-ANIMATE program will accept up to 10 different surface current cases each consisting of up to 20, 000 node points and 10, 000 triangle definitions and will animate one of these cases. The capability is used to compare surface-current distribution due to various initial excitation directions or electric field orientations. The program can accept up to 50 planes of field data consisting of a grid of 100 by 100 field points. These planes of data are user selectable and can be viewed individually or concurrently. With these preset limits, the program requires 55 megabytes of core memory to run. These limits can be changed in the header files to accommodate the available core memory of an individual workstation. An estimate of memory required can be made as follows: approximate memory in bytes equals (number of nodes times number of surfaces times 14 variables times bytes per word, typically 4 bytes per floating point) plus (number of field planes times number of nodes per plane times 21 variables times bytes per word). This gives the approximate memory size required to store the field and surface-current data. The total memory size is approximately 400, 000 bytes plus the data memory size. The animation calculations are performed in real time at any user set time step. For Silicon Graphics Workstations that have multiple processors, {{this program has been}} optimized to perform these calculations on multiple processors to increase animation rates. The optimized program uses the SGI PFA (Power FORTRAN Accelerator) library. On single processor machines, the parallelization directives are seen as comments to the program and will have no effect on compilation or execution. EM-ANIMATE is written in FORTRAN 77 for implementation on SGI IRIS workstations running IRIX 3. 0 or later. A minimum of 55 Mb of RAM is required for execution of this program; however, the code may be modified to accommodate the available memory of an individual workstation. For program execution, twenty-four bit, double-buffered color capability is suggested, but not required. Sample input and output files and a sample executable are provided on the distribution medium.

The Electric Field Integral Equation form of Maxwell's equations is solved using local triangle couple basis and testing functions with a resultant system impedance matrix. The analysis emphasis is not only for routine RCS pattern predictions, but also for phenomenological diagnostics: bistatic imaging, currents, and near scattered/total electric fields. The images, currents, and near fields are output in form suitable for animation. MOM 3 D computes the full backscatter and bistatic radar cross section polarization scattering matrix (amplitude and phase), body currents and near scattered and total fields for plane wave illumination. MOM 3 D also incorporates a new bistatic k space imaging algorithm for computing down range and down/cross range diagnostic images using only one matrix inversion. MOM 3 D has been made memory and cpu time efficient by using symmetric matrices, symmetric geometry, and partitioned fixed and variable geometries suitable for design iteration studies.

By using the commercially available Origin Software two types of SPT <b>value</b> <b>contour</b> map have been plotted at each depth (3 ft, 6 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft, 20 ft, 30 ft, 40 ft, 50 ft and 60 ft). Line type contour maps shows the same SPT value line, from these people can understand the SPT value and direction of the SPT value line at Rajshahi City. Fill color maps shows different types of color area, each color contains same SPT value and people can understand from which area what the SPT value is. SPT values correlate empirically with the foundation design parameters such as soil density, friction angles, settlement of shallow and deep foundations, bearing capacity values, etc. By using SPT value a typical example have been done. At a glance to observe the prepared SPT <b>value</b> <b>contour</b> map any engineer can understand the soil condition at different depth of Rajshahi City...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton is important to cell function. In red blood cells, defects in this association can lead to various forms of hemolytic anemia. Although proteins involved in this association have been well characterized biochemically, the physical strength of this association is only beginning to be studied. Formation of a small cylindrical strand of membrane material (tether) from the membrane involves separation of the lipid bilayer from the membrane skeleton. By measuring the force required to form a tether, and knowing the contribution to the force due to the deformation of a lipid bilayer, {{it is possible to}} calculate the additional contribution to the work of tether formation due to the separation of membrane skeleton from the lipid bilayer. In the present study, we measured the tethering force during tether formation using a microcantilever (a thin, flexible glass fiber) as a force transducer. Numerical calculations of the red cell contour were performed to examine how the shape of the contour affects the calculation of tether radius, and subsequently separation work per unit area W(sk) and bending stiffness k(c). At high aspiration pressure and small external force, the red cell contour can be accurately modeled as a sphere, but at low aspiration pressure and large external force, the contour deviates from a sphere and may affect the calculation. Based on an energy balance and numerical calculations of the cell <b>contour,</b> <b>values</b> of the membrane bending stiffness k(c) = 2. 0 x 10 (- 19) Nm and the separation work per unit area W(sk) = 0. 06 mJ/m 2 were obtained...|$|R
