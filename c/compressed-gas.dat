50|$|Both compression-driven and blast-driven shock {{tubes are}} {{currently}} used for scientific {{as well as}} military applications. <b>Compressed-gas</b> driven shock tubes are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, {{the shape of the}} pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven shock tubes generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale shock tubes driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for <b>compressed-gas</b> driven shock tubes. To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these shock tubes make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.|$|E

50|$|Blast {{waves are}} {{generated}} in research environments using explosive or <b>compressed-gas</b> driven shock tubes {{in an effort}} to replicate the environment of a military conflict to better understand the physics of blasts and injuries that may result, and to develop better protection against blast exposure. Blast waves are directed against structures (such as vehicles), materials, and biological specimens or surrogates. High-speed pressure sensors and/or high speed cameras are often used to quantify the response to blast exposure. Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs or test dummies) initially developed for the automotive industry are being used, sometimes with added instrumentation, to estimate the human response to blast events. For examples, personnel in vehicles and personnel on demining teams have been simulated using these ATDs.|$|E
50|$|In an oil-{{injected}} rotary-screw compressor, oil {{is injected}} into the compression cavities to aid sealing and provide cooling sink for the gas charge. The oil is separated from the discharge stream, then cooled, filtered and recycled. The oil captures non-polar particulates from the incoming air, effectively reducing the particle loading of compressed-air particulate filtration. It is usual for some entrained compressor oil to carry over into the <b>compressed-gas</b> stream downstream of the compressor. In many applications, this is rectified by coalescer/filter vessels. In other applications, this is rectified {{by the use of}} receiver tanks that reduce the local velocity of compressed air, allowing oil to condense and drop out of the air stream to be removed from the compressed-air system by condensate-management equipment.|$|E

40|$|A nitrous oxide-based oxygen-supply system (NOBOSS) is an {{apparatus}} {{in which a}} breathable mixture comprising 2 / 3 volume parts of N 2 and 1 / 3 volume part of O 2 is generated through dissociation of N 2 O. The NOBOSS concept {{can be adapted to}} a variety of applications in which there are requirements for relatively compact, lightweight systems to supply breathable air. These could include air-supply systems for firefighters, divers, astronauts, and workers who must be protected against biological and chemical hazards. A NOBOSS stands in contrast to <b>compressed-gas</b> and cryogenic air-supply systems. <b>Compressed-gas</b> systems necessarily include massive tanks that can hold only relatively small amounts of gases. Alternatively, gases can be stored compactly in greater quantities and at low pressures when they are liquefied, but then cryogenic equipment is needed to maintain them in liquid form. Overcoming the disadvantages of both <b>compressed-gas</b> and cryogenic systems, the NOBOSS exploits the fact that N 2 O can be stored in liquid form at room temperature and moderate pressure. The mass of N 2 O that can be stored in a tank of a given mass is about 20 times the mass of compressed air that can be stored in a tank of equal mass. In a NOBOSS, N 2 O is exothermically dissociated to N 2 and O 2 in a main catalytic reactor. In order to ensure the dissociation of N 2 O to the maximum possible extent, the temperature of the reactor must be kept above 400 C. At the same time, to minimize concentrations of nitrogen oxides (which are toxic), it is necessary to keep the reactor temperature at or below 540 C. To keep the temperature within the required range throughout the reactor and, in particular, to prevent the formation of hot spots that would be generated by local concentrations of the exothermic dissociation reaction, the N 2 O is introduced into the reactor through an injector tube that features carefully spaced holes to distribute the input flow of N 2 O widely throughout the reactor. A NOBOSS includes one or more "destroyer" subsystems for removing any nitrogen oxides that remain downstream of the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. A destroyer includes a carbon bed in series with a catalytic reactor, and is in thermal contact with the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. The gas mixture that leaves the main reactor first goes through a carbon bed, which adsorbs all of the trace NO and most of the trace NO 2. The gas mixture then goes through the destroyer catalytic reactor, wherein most or all of the remaining NO 2 is dissociated. A NOBOSS can be designed to regulate its reactor temperature across a range of flow rates. One such system includes three destroyer loops; these loops act, in combination with a heat sink, to remove heat from the main N 2 O-dissociation reactor. In this system, the N 2 O and product gases play an additional role as coolants; thus, as needed, the coolant flow increases in proportion to the rate of generation of heat, helping to keep the main-reactor temperature below 540 C...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} causative factors, {{root cause analysis}} (RCA) was applied to 351 Australian <b>compressed-gas</b> diving fatalities from 1972 - 2005. Each case was described by four sequential events (trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury, cause of death) that were assessed for frequency, trends, and dive and diver characteristics. The average age increased by 16 years, with women three years younger than men annually. For the entire 34 -year period, the principal disabling injuries were asphyxia (49 %), cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE; 25 %), and cardiac (19 %). There was evidence of a long-term decline {{in the rate of}} asphyxia and a long-term increase in CAGE and cardiac disabling injuries. Asphyxia was associated with rough water, buoyancy trouble, equipment trouble, and gas supply trouble. CAGE was associated with gas supply trouble and ascent trouble, while cardiac cases were associated with exertion, cardiovascular disease, and greater age. Exertion was more common in younger cardiac deaths than in older deaths. Asphyxia became less common with increasing age. Equipment-related problems were most common during the late 1980 s and less so in 2005. Buoyancy-related deaths usually involved loss of buoyancy on the surface but decreased when buoyancy control devices were used.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) signals {{generated from}} projectile impacts on reinforced and advanced carbon/carbon (RCC and ACC) panels, {{fired from a}} <b>compressed-gas</b> gun, identify the type and severity of damage sustained by the target. This type of testing is vital in providing the required "return to flight" (RTF) data needed to ensure continued and safe operation of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet. The gas gun at Kennedy Space Center is capable of propelling 12 -inch by 3 -inch cylinders of external tank (ET) foam at exit velocities exceeding 1, 000 feet per second. Conventional AE analysis techniques require time domain processing of impulse data, along with amplitude distribution analysis. It {{is well known that}} identical source excitations can produce a wide range of AE signals amplitudes. In order to satisfy RTF goals, it is necessary to identify impact energy levels above and below damage thresholds. Spectral analysis techniques involving joint time frequency analysis (JTFA) are used to reinforce time domain AE analysis. JTFA analysis of the AE signals consists of short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) and the Huang-Hilbert transform (HHT). The HHT provides a very good measure of the instantaneous frequency of impulse events dominated by a single component. Identifying failure modes and cracking of fibers from flexural and/or extensional mode acoustic signals will help support in-flight as well as postflight impact analysis...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, several {{thousand}} kilograms of compressed gases were stored at the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, because these cylinders {{could not be}} taken off-site in their state of configuration for disposal. Restrictions on the storage of old <b>compressed-gas</b> cylinders compelled the Waste Management Organization of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. (LMES) to dispose of these materials. Furthermore, a milestone in the ORR Site Treatment Plan required repackaging and shipment off-site of 21 cylinders by September 30, 1997. A pilot project, coordinated by the Chemical Technology Division (CTD) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), was undertaken to evaluate and recontainerize or neutralize these cylinders, which are mixed waste, to meet that milestone. Because the radiological component {{was considered to be}} confined to the exterior of the cylinder, the contents (once removed from the cylinder) could be handled as hazardous waste, and the cylinder could be handled as low-level waste (LLW).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To compare 13 commercially available, new-generation, intensive-care-unit (ICU) {{ventilators}} {{in terms}} of trigger function, pressurization capacity during pressure-support ventilation (PSV), accuracy of pressure measurements, and expiratory resistance. DESIGN AND SETTING: Bench study at a research laboratory in a university hospital. METHODS: Four turbine-based ventilators and nine conventional servo-valve <b>compressed-gas</b> ventilators were tested using a two-compartment lung model. Three levels of effort were simulated. Each ventilator was evaluated at four PSV levels (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H 2 O), with and without positive end-expiratory pressure (5 cm H 2 O). Trigger function was assessed as the time from effort onset to detectable pressurization. Pressurization capacity was evaluated using the airway pressure-time product computed as the net area under the pressure-time curve over the first 0. 3 s after inspiratory effort onset. Expiratory resistance was evaluated by measuring trapped volume in controlled ventilation. RESULTS: Significant differences were found across the ventilators, {{with a range of}} triggering delays from 42 to 88 ms for all conditions averaged (P < 0. 001). Under difficult conditions, the triggering delay was longer than 100 ms and the pressurization was poor for five ventilators at PSV 5 and three at PSV 10, suggesting an inability to unload patient's effort. On average, turbine-based ventilators performed better than conventional ventilators, which showed no improvement compared to a bench comparison in 2000. CONCLUSION: Technical performance of trigger function, pressurization capacity, and expiratory resistance differs considerably across new-generation ICU ventilators. ICU ventilators seem to have reached a technical ceiling in recent years, and some ventilators still perform inadequately...|$|E
40|$|The loading {{conditions}} {{used in some}} current in vivo and in vitro blast-induced neurotrauma models may not be representative of real-world blast conditions. To address these limitations, we developed a <b>compressed-gas</b> driven shock tube with different driven lengths that can generate Friedlander-type blasts. The shock tube can generate overpressures up to 650 [*]kPa with durations between 0. 3 and 1. 1 [*]ms using compressed helium driver gas, and peak overpressures up to 450 [*]kPa with durations between 0. 6 and 3 [*]ms using compressed nitrogen. This device is used for short-duration blast overpressure loading for small animal in vivo injury models, and contrasts the more frequently used long duration/high impulse blast overpressures in the literature. We also developed a new apparatus that is used with the shock tube to recreate the in vivo intracranial overpressure response for loading in vitro culture preparations. The receiver device surrounds the culture with materials of similar impedance to facilitate the propagation of a single overpressure pulse through the tissue. This method prevents pressure waves reflecting off the tissue that can cause unrealistic deformation and injury. The receiver performance was characterized using the longest helium-driven shock tube, and produced in-fluid overpressures up to 1500 [*]kPa at the location where a culture would be placed. This response was well correlated with the overpressure conditions from the shock tube (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 97). Finite element models of the shock tube and receiver were developed and validated to better elucidate the mechanics of this methodology. A demonstration exposing a culture to the {{loading conditions}} created by this system suggest tissue strains less than 5 % for all pressure levels simulated, which was well below functional deficit thresholds for strain rates less than 50 [*]s− 1. This novel system {{is not limited to}} a specific type of culture model and can be modified to reproduce more complex pressure pulses...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{prominent}} role of {{improvised explosive devices}} (IEDs) in wounding patterns of U. S. war-fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan, blast injury has risen {{to a new level}} of importance and is recognized to be a major cause of injuries to the brain. However, an injury risk-function for microscopic, macroscopic, behavioral, and neurological deficits has yet to be defined. While operational blast injuries can be very complex and thus difficult to analyze, a simplified blast injury model would facilitate studies correlating biological outcomes with blast biomechanics to define tolerance criteria. Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) results from the translation of a shock wave in air, such as that produced by an IED, into a pressure wave within the skull-brain complex. Our blast injury methodology recapitulates this phenomenon in vitro, allowing for control of the injury biomechanics via a <b>compressed-gas</b> shock tube used in conjunction with a custom-designed, fluid-filled receiver that contains the living culture. The receiver converts the air shock wave into a fast-rising pressure transient with minimal reflections, mimicking the intracranial pressure history in blast. We have developed an organotypic hippocampal slice culture model that exhibits cell death when exposed to a 530  17. 7 kPa peak overpressure with a 1. 026 &# 177; 0. 017 ms duration and 190 &# 177; 10. 7 kPa-ms impulse in-air.

To better prevent and treat bTBI, both the initiating biomechanics and the ensuing pathobiology must be understood in greater detail. A well-characterized, in vitro model of bTBI, in conjunction with animal models, will be a powerful tool for developing strategies to mitigate the risks of bTBI...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in the frequency of traumatic brain injuries related to blast exposure. However, the mechanisms that cause blast neurotrauma are unknown. Blast neurotrauma research using computational models has been one method to elucidate that response of the brain in blast, and to identify possible mechanical correlates of injury. However, model validation against experimental data is required to ensure that the model output is representative of in vivo biomechanical response. This study exposed porcine subjects to primary blast overpressures generated using a <b>compressed-gas</b> shock tube. Shock tube blasts were directed to the unprotected head of each animal while the lungs and thorax were protected using ballistic protective vests similar to those employed in theater. The test conditions ranged from 110 - 740 kPa peak incident overpressure with scaled durations from 1. 3 - 6. 9 ms and correspond approximately with a 50 % injury risk for brain bleeding and apnea in a ferret model scaled to porcine exposure. The bulk head acceleration and the pressure at the surface of the head and in the cranial cavity were measured. Immediately after the blast, 5 of the 20 animals tested were apneic. Three subjects recovered without intervention within thirty seconds and the remaining two recovered within 8 minutes following bagging and administration of the respiratory stimulant doxapram. Gross examination of the brain revealed no indication of bleeding. Intracranial pressures ranged from 80 - 685 kPa {{as a result of the}} blast and were notably lower than the shock tube reflected pressures of 300 - 2830 kPa, indicating pressure attenuation by the skull up to a factor of 8. 4. Peak head accelerations were measured from 385 - 3845 G’s and were well correlated with peak incident overpressure (R 2 = 0. 90).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} model fuel combustion processes {{is essential to}} the development of transportation, power generation, and manufacturing technology. Models describing the kinetics of chemical oxidation are readily available and highly refined {{for a wide range of}} test fuels. However, these models still suffer from high levels of uncertainty under engine-relevant conditions, largely due to a lack of consistency between published validation data. An experimental testing apparatus, known as the Rapid Compression Controlled-Expansion Machine (RCCEM) has been designed and fabricated to conduct chemical kinetic studies. The RCCEM features a pneumatically-driven, custom-designed cam, which governs the volumetric compression and expansion of the combustion chamber. This machine has been designed to test various compression ratios, compressed pressures, and compressed temperatures. Central to the operation of the RCCEM, the cam assembly is modular with the ability to incorporate different cams with unique compression and expansion profiles. This capability is intended to control heat loss rates in experiments via volumetric expansion, and as a result, increase understanding of its influence on the interpretation of validation data. Performance characterization of the RCCEM, using iso-octane and hexane, has shown that the machine is capable of testing a wide range of conditions with exceptional repeatability. Ignition delay times for iso-octane are reported for compressed temperatures of 630 - 700 K. Additionally, two computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have been conducted to investigate the role of non-uniform boundary temperatures as a potential cause of discrepancies among data in the literature. The effect of these boundary conditions on ignition delay time predictions and <b>compressed-gas</b> temperature field development has been investigated for heated RCM experiments that use either creviced or flat pistons. Three unique boundary temperature cases for non-reactive simulations showed that a large temperature gradient forms over the crown of the piston due to heterogeneities present in the initial temperature fields. Subsequently, five boundary temperature cases were investigated for reactive simulations and demonstrated the effect of these non-uniformities on ignition delay time predictions. Through this work, it was determined that the flat piston is susceptible to these non-uniform conditions causing discrepancies in ignition delay times, whereas the creviced piston data was only minimally influenced...|$|E
