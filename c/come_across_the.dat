5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{lion and}} sun {{with a sword}} in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E

Paulo suspects they are the only reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while looking in the jungle, they <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E
5|$|While on foot patrol, Police Constable Don Ross (Anthony Oliver) chances upon {{a gang of}} lorry hijackers {{operating}} {{from the back of}} a transport café. After seeing Diamond (George Murcell) and Johnny (David Graham) drive off in a car with the manageress, Connie Williams (Miriam Karlin), apparently being held hostage in the back seat, Ross jumps onto and clings to the vehicle's side; however, he is quickly thrown into the road, suffering a head injury. Pretending to have <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E

5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Baxter is a {{self-employed}} lawyer, Quinn runs a bar, Rick is a {{drug dealer}} who is haunted by a Tikoloshe, and Woody buys black market medicine for local hospitals. Baxter learns that Mackenzie was shot to death, indicating that the CIA operation is shut down. Baxter finds Quinn, who is secretly in contact with Woody. After helping Rick escape after his arrest, the four reunite and enter a British Consulate, only to learn the kill order is still active. They later <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> home of Lazaro (Stanley Townsend), a retired CIA agent. He removes their names from the CIA hit list, but later attempts to kill them as revenge for María, who was a CIA agent herself. Mercedes (Jaime Winstone), who they previously met at the black site prison, kills Lazaro, saving them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E

Daryl gets into a {{confrontation}} with Len (Marcus Hester) over a claim on who shot, and thus owns, a rabbit, and Joe informs Daryl of the rules, then splits the rabbit's meat between then. That night, when they rest, Len sneaks his half of the rabbit into Daryl's bag, and feigns the next morning that Daryl took it. Joe, however, reports he saw Len frame Daryl, and drags him away to beat him up. Joe returns alone and instructs the others to pack up and move out. As they walk away, Daryl's sees Len's dead body, an arrow struck through his head. They <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> train tracks and discover the candy wrapped left behind by Rick.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in April 1943, Mussolini had begged Hitler {{to make a}} {{separate}} peace with Stalin and send German troops to the west to guard against an expected Allied invasion of Italy. Mussolini feared that with the losses in Tunisia and North Africa, {{the next logical step}} for Dwight Eisenhower's armies would be to <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean and attack the Italian peninsula. Within a few days of the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in Feltre on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. His mood darkened further when that same day, the Allies bombed Rome—the first time that city had ever been the target of enemy bombing.|$|E

500|$|Concurrently {{with his}} work at The Spectator, Levin was the drama critic of The Daily Express from 1959, {{offending}} many in theatrical circles by his outspoken verdicts. He modelled his reviewing style on that of Bernard Shaw's musical reviews of the late 19th century. He gave a fellow-critic an edition of Shaw's collected criticism, writing inside the cover, [...] "'In the hope that when you <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> phrases I have already stolen you will keep quiet about it".|$|E

Hamburg was their first such opportunity. Ninety-four white men, including Tillman, were indicted by a coroner's jury, but none was prosecuted for the killings. Butler blamed the deaths on intoxicated factory workers and Irish-Americans who had <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge from Augusta, and over whom he had no control.|$|E
