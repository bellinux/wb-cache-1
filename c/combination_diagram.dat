We analyze 495 papers containing 1899 figures in a systems conference proceedings. Diagrams can be classified according to hard and soft genres. Most diagrams were found to be in soft genres.

The work has implications for automated document searching. The practical implication for authors is that more explicit consideration of diagram types might both clarify thinking and make later searching by other researchers easier.

40|$|Several {{types of}} Decision Diagrams (DDs) have been {{proposed}} for the verification of Integrated Circuits. Recently, word-level DDs like bmds, *bmds, hdds, k*bmds and *phdds have been attracting more and more interest, e. g., by using *bmds and *phdds {{it was for the}} first time possible to formally verify integer multipliers and floating point multipliers of "significant" bitlengths, respectively. On the other hand, it has been unknown, whether division, the operation inverse to multiplication, can be efficiently represented by some type of word-level DDs. In this paper we show that the representational power of any word-level DD is too weak to efficiently represent integer division. Thus, neither a clever choice of the variable ordering, the decomposition type or the edge weights, can lead to a polynomial DD size for division. For the proof we introduce Word-Level Linear <b>Combination</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (wlcds), a DD, which may be viewed as a "generic" word-level DD. We derive an exponential lower b [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of {{wall thickness measurement}} and monitoring of corrosion and deposits by means of film-based tangential projection radiography is known since decades. Nevertheless, there are no international standards and guidelines available. The International Atomic Energy Agency has organized a co-ordinated research programme bringing together participants from twelve member states to study {{the state of the}} art. The general scope of the project covered radiographic inspection of corrosion and deposits in steel pipes (diameter> 150 mm) corroded on the outer or inner surfaces with or without insulation. Two inspection methods have been investigated: 1. tangential radiographic projection technique (TRT) and 2. double wall inspection technique (DWT). The application ranges of both methods were studied depending on pipe diameter, wall thickness, radiation source (X-ray, Ir- 192 and Co- 60 were used) and screen/film <b>combination.</b> <b>Diagrams</b> for application limits using TRT have been designed and verified by the participating countries. All measurements have been performed on special designed test pieces and also industrial pipes. Corrosion measurements based on DWT are more sophisticated and use effective attenuation coefficients to calculate wall thickness changes from density differences shown on the film. The values of effective attenuation coefficients, established for Ir- 192 and Co- 60, are stable and independent in a wide range on pipe diameter and insulation. Guidelines were developed and tested in the twelve different countries to determine the reliability of this technology. A testing procedure approved by the project partners has been released and shall be submitted as standard proposal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{define a}} {{filtration}} on the vector {{space spanned by}} Seifert matrices of knots related to Vassiliev’s filtration on the space of knots. Further we show that the invariants of knots derived from the filtration can be expressed by coefficients of the Alexander polynomial. The theory of finite type invariants (Vassiliev invariants) for knots was first introduced by V. Vassiliev [12] and reformulated by J. S. Birman and X. S. Lin [4]. M. Kontsevich defined the universal Vassiliev invariant [8, 1] by using iterated integral. The invariant takes values in the linear <b>combinations</b> of chord <b>diagrams</b> and one {{can use it to}} construct an isomorphism from the space of all the Vassiliev invariants of degree d to the chord diagrams with d chords modulo diagrams with more chords. D. Bar-Natan [1] extended the notion of chord diagrams allowing trivalent vertices, which we call web diagrams in this paper.

Rozansky conjectured that the Kontsevich integral could be organised {{into a series of}} “lines” which could be represented by finite Q-linear <b>combinations</b> of <b>diagrams</b> whose edges were labelled, in an appropriate sense, with rational functions.
