40|$|Abstract. The era {{of modern}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screens,</b> {{so-called}} advertising columns, {{began in the}} middle of the 19 th century. Even nowadays they are still a popular advertising medium, which integrates well with urban environments. With advances in display technologies (LEDs, projectors) digital forms of such columns emerge and enable novel forms of visualization and interaction, which significantly differ from flat, rectangular screens due to the round shape. In this paper we present the design space for large <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screens</b> and outline design principles based on observations and experiments with a prototype of a digital column. We especially focus on the differences with flat, rectangular displays and report on challenges related to the deployment and development of applications for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screens...</b>|$|R

Scientists at Cenicafé discovered that a coffee fruit with mucilage (immature and dry fruits have no mucilage) has enough water inside for the skin and seeds to be separated in conventional pulping machines without water, that the liquid was only required as a conveying means and that pulping without water avoids 72% of the potential contamination.|$|E
50|$|The grid in {{the first}} triode valve {{consisted}} of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode. This quickly evolved into a helix or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screen</b> of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself. Molybdenum alloy with a gold plating is frequently used. It is wound on soft copper sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place. A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).|$|E

Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice.

50|$|The modern coal breaker can {{be traced}} to 1844. Joseph Battin, a {{supervisor}} at a coal gas manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, invented the first coal breaker—two cast iron rollers (one with teeth, one with holes to accept the teeth) through which the coal was crushed before it rolled down a chute and then through an inclined <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screen.</b> The screen had a mesh which was fine toward the front and became progressively less so toward the end. Larger chunks of coal, falling inside the cylinder as it rotated, broke up and eventually passed through the screen. Impurities, which were heavier, tended to exit the breaker {{at the end of the}} screen. The sorted coal would then be collected in bins below the screen, and transported to market. A fellow Pennsylvanian, Gideon Bast, licensed the technology from Battin, and erected the first commercial coal breaker in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, on February 28, 1844. A number of coal processing machines—such as rollers, crushers, washers, and screens—were developed in Europe and later utilized in the United States. By 1866, the coal breaker in the United States had taken the form most recognized today, with multiple stories and numerous screening processes and mechanical sorting devices. The first steam-powered shaking screens were used in the U.S. 1890, and the first steam-powered coal washers installed in 1892.|$|E
50|$|From {{a general}} public point of view, {{one of the}} first glimpses of the CAREN was seen in Peter Berg's sci-fi alien thriller Battleship. In the action-packed film based on the legendary board game, a scene {{depicting}} a real life ex-soldier who has lost both his legs walking in a virtual reality simulator hints at the incredible possibilities for this technology. The promise of a new dawn in technologies for the medical markets {{is at the core of}} what makes the CAREN platform so intriguing, yet it also goes further to encompass early diagnostics, rehabilitation, motor training and research. The CAREN system is the brainchild of Motek Medical, and remains the company’s flagship product as an immersive virtual reality entity that uses motion capture elements for clinical and research settings. The system consists of a motion base, the aforementioned motion capture element, a projection screen and Motek’s D-flow software, with three default models available - all of which can be tailored for specific needs. In its most basic form, CAREN is fully tailored for posture and balance-related applications, containing components including a hydraulic six-DOF motion base, two-millimeter diameter platform top with integrated dual force plates, eight-camera real-time motion capture system, large flat-screen projection system, surround sound system and the D-flow software package. The CAREN Extended system represents a significant upgrade from the CAREN Base, with the major differences being the additions of a dual-belt instrumented treadmill mounted on the motion base and a wider peripheral vision scope. Bespoke for both balance and all gait applications, the CAREN Extended contains a cylindrical projection system that allows for peripheral vision up to 180 degrees. The system’s components are a six-DOF motion base, three meter diameter platform top with aforementioned dual-belt instrumented treadmill, 10-camera real-time motion capture system, the aforementioned projection system with 120 to 180-degree <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screen,</b> surround sound system and the D-flow software. The range-topping CAREN High-End model represents the most advanced setup, boasting a 360-degree dome for a “full-immersion virtual reality experience.” Additional components of this product include a six-DOF motion base with 1,000-kg payload, three-millimeter diameter platform top with dual-belt instrumented treadmill, 18-camera real-time motion capture system, spherical dome projection, surround sound system and, of course, the D-flow software architecture. Amongst the facilities utilizing this advanced CAREN system are the Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas and the SHEBA Medical Center in Tel Aviv, Israel. Supplementing all CAREN configurations are Motek Medical-provided integrated components designed to further enhance the use of the systems. These consist of EMG (Electro-Myography), video capture, tailored motion capture suits, data gloves, haptic systems, energy consumption system, pressure measurement systems, heart rate measurement systems and head mount displays.|$|E

Such a rod {{presented}} to experienced European seabass, Dicentrurchus Zubran, may lead to feed wastage, probably as a result of unintentional fish contacts with the trigger. Trigger protection screens have been designed to prevent fish contacting the trigger by chance, and the efficacy of such screens was tested. Nocturnal and diurnal feed delivery and feed wasted were compared under conditions where the rod was unprotected or protected by semi-cylindrical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screens.</b> Tests were conducted using an unrestricted self-feeding regime (reward: 0. 2 g pellet per kg of body weight and per fish contact) in juvenile seabass (57 g body weight) fed for 28 days at 21. 3 “C. Fish were subjected to a 4 -h L: 20 -h D (1 ight:dark) photoperiod. The daily feed demand pattern and the nocturnal and diurnal feed wastage were recorded. Fish activated the trigger predominantly at night, except in the case of one group exposed to a trigger protected by a semi-cylindrical screen. In the latter, triggering activity was progressively distributed throughouthe 1 ight:dark cycle.
