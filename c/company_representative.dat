5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments <b>company</b> <b>representative.</b> Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E

500|$|No Doubt {{released}} five studio albums {{throughout its}} career {{before going into}} hiatus. Their debut album, No Doubt, was released on March 17, 1992. It sold only 30,000 copies on its initial release, and the band's record company, Interscope Records, refused to fund {{the release of a}} single from it. No Doubt therefore financed the production of a music video for the song [...] "Trapped in a Box", which was received local airplay in Orange County, California but did not attract mainstream attention. No Doubt recorded their second album, The Beacon Street Collection, in March 1995. It was released independently, because No Doubt had recorded many songs that they knew would not make it onto Tragic Kingdom and were frustrated by a lack of attention from their label. They released two singles from it: [...] "Squeal" [...] and [...] "Doghouse". The Beacon Street Collection sold 100,000 copies. No Doubt's independence shocked their <b>company</b> <b>representative</b> and ensured that the label would finance a third album.|$|E

It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. <b>Company</b> <b>representative</b> Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E
