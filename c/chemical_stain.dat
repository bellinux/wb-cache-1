A final evaluation of the activation parameters on teeth treated with commercially used gel peroxides revealed positive catalytic activity for heat alone.

40|$|The P 6 protein of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is {{responsible}} for the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs), which are the site for viral gene expression, replication and virion assembly. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that ectopically expressed P 6 IBs move in association with actin microfilaments. Since CaMV virions accumulate preferentially in P 6 IBs, we hypothesized that P 6 IBs have a role in delivering CaMV virions to the plasmodesmata. We recently discovered that the P 6 protein interacted with a C 2 calcium-dependent membrane targeting protein (designated AtSRC 2 - 2) in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed this interaction through co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays in the CaMV host, Nicotiana benthamiana. An AtSRC 2 - 2 protein fused to RFP was localized to the plasma membrane and specifically associated with plasmodesmata. The AtSRC 2 - 2 -RFP fusion also co-localized with two proteins previously shown to associate with plasmodesmata: the host protein PDLP 1 and the CaMV movement protein (MP). Since P 6 IBs were found to co-localize with AtSCR 2 - 2 and had previously been shown to interact with CaMV MP, we investigated whether a portion of the P 6 IBs might also be associated with plasmodesmata. We examined the co-localization of P 6 -GFP IBs with PDLP 1, the CaMV MP, and with aniline blue, a <b>chemical</b> <b>stain</b> for callose, and found that P 6 -GFP IBs were associated with each of these markers. Furthermore, a P 6 -RFP protein was co-immunoprecipitated with PDLP 1 -GFP.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to establish design rules for nanoparticle properties that enable their in vivo transport to target destinations. Gold nanoparticles containing surface-engrafted polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains are prepared with controlled physicochemical properties (hydrodynamic size, surface charge, targeting ligand density). Upon systemic injection into mice, the transport of nanoparticles is monitored by blood pharmacokinetics as well as distribution at the organ, tissue, and subcellular levels from the same injection in an individual animal. At a constant, slightly negative surface charge (ca. - 10 mV), most PEGylated gold nanoparticles (PEG-AuNPs) deposit in the liver, spleen, and kidney of normal mice 24 hours after injection. Increasing retention in the liver (Kupffer cells) and spleen correlate positively with increasing nanoparticle diameter over the range of 25 - 165 nm, largely due to phagocytic uptake. Accumulation in the kidney is size-dependent, but shows a maximum uptake at ca. 75 ± 25 nm that also gives the highest deposition in the mesangium (uptake by mesangial cells). Tumor-bearing mice received injections of PEG-AuNPs of near-constant size (ca. 75 nm) and surface charge (ca. - 10 mV) but with variable amounts of ligands that target cancer cells (0 - 144 ligands per nanoparticle). Independent of ligand content, nanoparticles accumulate in the tumor by the {{enhanced permeation and retention}} effect to the same magnitude, and adjacent to leukocytes. Nanoparticles only enter cancer cells in significant amounts when they contain targeting ligands above a threshold amount (between 18 and 144 ligands per nanoparticle). Mechanistic studies from model nanoparticles provide insights for the delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles. Systemic administrations of targeted, cyclodextrin-based, siRNA-containing nanoparticles are investigated in animals and humans (Phase I clinical trial). A fluorescent <b>chemical</b> <b>stain</b> with exposed adamantane molecules for binding into the cyclodextrin cups of the targeted nanoparticles is created, allowing for the examination of tumor tissue sections from animals and patient biopsies.

40|$|Targeted and {{controlled}} delivery of therapeutic agents on demand is pivotal in realising {{the efficacy of}} many pharmaceuticals. The design and fabrication of a novel, electrically-addressable, porous structure-based drug delivery device for the controlled release of therapeutic proteins and peptides, are described in this thesis. The initial prototype microdevice design incorporates a porous polysilicon (PPSi) structure as a drug reservoir. Two alternative methods were investigated to fabricate the PPSi structure: i) the <b>chemical</b> <b>stain</b> etching method; ii) a reactive ion etching (RIE) method through a masking template. Random pores, with irregular pore shape and size in the micro- to mesoporous regime (< 50 nm), were obtained using the stain etching method but this method suffered from poor reproducibility and non-uniformity. Two novel RIE approaches were investigated to fabricate ordered PPSi structures; two different masking templates were investigated – a porous anodic alumina (PAA) and a metal mask with hexagonally arranged holes produced by a novel nanosphere lithography (NSL) technique. A quasi-ordered PAA template with pore diameters {{in the region of}} 50 nm was fabricated but was not suitable for the subsequent proposed RIE process. By using the NSL technique, quasi-ordered PPSi structures with tapered pore profiles, were obtained. This is the first demonstration of the fabrication of PPSi with ordered pores of sizes in the macropore range of ~ 370 nm. A revised silicon-based prototype microdevice was designed and fabricated. The microdevice incorporates a nanostructured, quasi-ordered porous silicon (PSi) as a drug reservoir and an integrated heater and temperature sensor as an active control mechanism. The PSi structure was fabricated using a modified NSL technique and a Bosch-based RIE process. Hexagonally arranged cylindrical pores with diameters between ~ 75 nm and ~ 120 nm, and depths in the range of ~ 330 nm and 500 nm, were obtained. The novel fabrication techniques investigated here are simple and versatile; both p-type and n-type PSi structures have been successfully fabricated. Proof-of-concept studies, using the revised prototype drug delivery microdevices, suggested that the nanostructured PSi would be suitable for the passive release of an intermediate-sized (~ 23, 000 Dalton) model protein. It is envisaged that the microdevice has the potential to deliver osteoinductive growth factors, on demand, to the site of fracture, in a controlled and sustainable manner, as a first step to an intelligent therapeutic system for skeletal regeneration...|$|E
