40|$|What are {{compliance}} {{checks and}} how do they work? A compliance check is a tool to identify alcohol establishments that sell alcohol to underage youth. The practice of conducting compliance checks can be: • Mandated by a local ordinance that outlines standards for conducting the checks, persons or agencies responsible for conducting the compliance <b>checks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for establishments, servers and sellers who illegally sell or serve alcohol to underage youth. • Voluntarily implemented by law enforcement or licensing authorities. Compliance checks can be used for two purposes: • Enforcement: To enforce state criminal statutes, local administrative ordinances, or both. • Educational: To identify, warn, and educate alcohol establishments that serve or sell alcohol to underage youth.

In this context, GAO was asked to (1) provide an overview of federal and state laws related to the employment of sex offenders at child care facilities and (2) examine cases where individuals who were convicted of serious sexual offenses were subsequently employed or present at child care facilities. To provide an overview of selected laws, GAO searched for prohibitions against offenders being present at child care facilities, requirements for conducting criminal-history <b>checks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for violating these requirements. The cases GAO examined focus only on individuals who were convicted of serious sexual offenses and cannot be generalized to all child care facilities. To identify the cases, GAO reviewed open-source information from 2000 to 2010. GAO also compared the years 2007 to 2009 in employment databases from 20 states and the District of Columbia to data in the National Sex Offender Registry. GAO ultimately selected 10 cases from eight states and the District of Columbia for review. For each case, GAO reviewed court documents and interviewed law enforcement personnel. Our methodology was not designed to assess the prevalence of sex offenders working at child care facilities. This product contains no recommendations. Where applicable, GAO referred its cases for further investigation. ...|$|E
40|$|As in {{all periods}} of swift {{economic}} development and political upheaval, our era of globalization has brought corruption and conflicts of interest into the spotlight. This comprehensive study highlights the difficulties of devising global legislative and judicial responses to these issues. The papers gathered in this volume demonstrate how global regulations tend to meet strong cultural resistance, in particular when dealing with the more subtle patterns of conflicts of interest. It is a notion that is far from successfully regulated in every country or addressed in compatible ways. In fact, the comparisons offered demonstrate that even international {{organizations such as the}} European Union have failed to fully consolidate their systems for mitigating their own risks of corruption and conflicts of interest. Providing a comprehensive study of the phenomenon of corruption and conflicts of interest from a comparative perspective, this book will prove vital for academics, NGOs and practitioners.

He was then immediately sent by Chicago to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for a fourth round draft pick. Shortly after the trades, Chicago's general manager, Bob Murry, admitted he regretted trading McInnis so quickly, particularly after McInnis found early success on Anaheim's top scoring line as a replacement for the injured Teemu Selänne. He finished the season with 54 points, and two seasons later, scored 20 goals and 42 points for the Mighty Ducks.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{develop a}} {{simulation}} model {{to predict the}} effects of youth access policies on retail compliance, smoking rates, and smoking attributable deaths.  METHODS—A model of youth access policies is developed based on empirical research and a theory of perceived risk. The model incorporates substitution into other sources as retail sales are restricted, and is used to project the number of smokers and smoking related deaths. Various policies to limit youth access to cigarettes are evaluated, and we explore how efficient policies may be developed.  RESULTS—The model predicts that a well designed and comprehensive policy that includes sufficient compliance <b>checks,</b> <b>penalties,</b> <b>and</b> community involvement {{has the potential to}} reduce the number of young smokers. Because smoking related deaths occur later in life, the effects on health are largely delayed.  CONCLUSIONS—A well designed youth access policy has the ability to affect youth smoking rates in the short term, and will lead to savings in lives in future years. The ability of retail oriented policies to reduce youth smoking, however, is limited. Other tobacco control policies, including those directed at non-retail sources of cigarettes, are also needed.    Keywords: control policy; youth access policy; simulation mode...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Empirical {{studies have}} found that {{policies}} aimed at reducing youth access to tobacco have been successful at increasing retail compliance, but their effects on actual tobacco use are mixed. This article presents a model of youth access poli-cies that helps explain the apparently conflicting results in the extant literature, pro-vides a framework for future empirical studies, and suggests implications for public policy. Our model highlights the interaction of components in a well-designed policy, including sufficient compliance <b>checks,</b> <b>penalties,</b> <b>and</b> community involvement. It also illustrates why {{it will be difficult to}} eliminate all of youth supply. Nonretail sources, such as borrowing or stealing from parents and siblings and purchasing from older peers through black markets, are an important component of youth supply and become more important as retail access is reduced. The analysis is limited to policies that affect the retail supply of cigarettes but suggests the need for other policies that affect the demand for cigarettes, such as taxes and cessation policies, in order to further reduce youth smoking rates. Most smokers begin to smoke at an early age and are smoking on a reg-ular basis by age eighteen (HHS 1994). Furthermore, although youth smoking rates have declined in the past two years, the proportion of youth that smoke has increased over the past decade (CDC 2000; John-ston, O’Malley, and Bachman 1996; NIDA 1999).
