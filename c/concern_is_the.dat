5|$|Another {{community}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proposed high-rise re-development of the Mungo Scott flour mill.|$|E
5|$|Another {{clinical}} {{and public health}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging. A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid {{harm to the}} workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
50|$|One {{ergonomic}} <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> considerable {{effort required}} {{to mount the}} Maicoletta on its centre stand. This {{made it difficult for}} small riders or riders of slight build to park <b>the</b> scooter. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cold-start lever, which <b>was</b> positioned below <b>the</b> glove box and was not readily visible.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} above, {{some of the}} species of least <b>concern</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> following.|$|R
50|$|Of {{particular}} <b>concern</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{production of}} alkaloids in the grain {{as with the}} Claviceps spp. causing ergot.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, {{such as the}} Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} the events of , Agent Peggy Carter is {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her {{compiling}} data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's main <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mysterious Zodiac, which they have been unable to recover for some time.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.|$|E
50|$|His {{political}} <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment, {{the defense}} of press freedom and public education, in particular by free availability of statistical data.|$|R
50|$|The less obvious, and {{therefore}} more <b>concerning,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> influence of heavy or intense rainfall causing spuriously high daily evaporation totals without obvious overflow.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> architects’ main <b>concerns</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} {{surrounding the}} new building, {{adjacent to a}} courtyard where the entrances to the cultural buildings lie.|$|R
5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{current rate}} of ocean {{chemistry}} change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems {{will be able to}} adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.|$|E
50|$|When {{economic}} <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> predominant, <b>the</b> recipient {{will likely}} employ heuristic processing when formulating argumentation judgment. Reliability <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> influenced by <b>the</b> {{level of the}} recipient's issue-involvement or response-involvement.|$|R
50|$|Safety <b>concerns</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{official}} reason {{cited for}} {{the cancellation of}} the 1974 edition of the Grand Prix that heralded the end of Singapore Prix until 2008.|$|R
50|$|Also {{of great}} <b>concern</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> dangers to staff working {{in areas of}} {{conflict}} and other non-secure locations. Many UN staff <b>are</b> killed in <b>the</b> line of duty.|$|R
5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; of particular <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{damage done to}} honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, {{the time of day}} when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E
50|$|Also of <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{long-term}} {{prospect for}} Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{issue of what}} would happen when people born during the post-World War II baby boom retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue. Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, a previously enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees <b>were</b> added to <b>the</b> system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half {{of the value of the}} Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.|$|R
50|$|Current {{issues of}} {{particular}} <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> forcible repatriation of Vietnamese Montagnard asylum seekers by the Cambodian government and an alarming number of land issues throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on Crisis Text Line's data about prom-related crises, noting that financial <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> most prevalent cause of prom-related {{conversations with the}} service.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} to cause interplanetary contamination on planets that may harbor hypothetical extraterrestrial life.|$|E
25|$|One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{release to}} the {{environment}} of underground {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} through the drilling fluids and equipment.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{health of}} the humans who may participate in a colonization venture, including a range of physical, mental and emotional health risks.|$|E
50|$|Several ancient {{inscriptions}} about {{a college}} of nautes (Boatmen) in associated rivers have <b>been</b> discovered in <b>the</b> Gard. It <b>is</b> possible that <b>the</b> two rivers <b>concerned</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Ardèche and the Ouvèze.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> {{secondary}} <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> important <b>the</b> primary <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> {{more critical}} to success.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> more {{pressing}} <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mechanical {{layout of the}} grid. Getting the fine wires to stay aligned with the strips of color on the screen proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> design's Achilles heel.|$|R
25|$|Cognitive {{automation}} is {{an emerging}} genus of automation enabled by cognitive computing. Its primary <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring unstructured data.|$|E
25|$|The {{veterinary}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{same as the}} medical. The flies {{cause the}} same kind of myiasis in animals as it does in humans. It mainly only affects domesticated companion animals who are paralyzed or helpless.|$|E
25|$|Another {{relevant}} area of <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> promotion of volleyball in a worldwide scale. Part of the FIVB's activities {{in this area}} consists in attracting media partners and sponsors through negotiation of commercial rights for broadcasting and coverage of major events.|$|E
25|$|In those days, <b>the</b> primary <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} planning of St. Louis Park, updating zoning and construction codes, expanding sewer and water systems, paving streets, acquiring park land and building schools.|$|R
50|$|The {{sum of all}} core <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{business}} logic of a program, while all other aspects of <b>the</b> program <b>are</b> needed for proper execution, but {{not part of the}} actual {{business logic}}.|$|R
50|$|Bonnetty's {{presiding}} <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> with <b>the</b> {{philosophy of}} history.|$|R
