40|$|In {{this paper}} a physically-based snow {{transport}} model (SnowTran- 3 D) {{was used to}} simulate snow drifting over a 30 m grid, and was compared to detailed snow water equivalence (SWE) surveys on three dates within a small 0. 25 km 2 subwatershed, Upper Sheep Creek. Two precipitation scenarios and two vegetation scenarios were used to carry out four snow transport model runs in order to: (1) evaluate the blowing snow model, (2) evaluate {{the sensitivity of the}} snow transport model to precipitation and vegetation inputs, and (3) evaluate the linearity of snow accumulation patterns and the utility of the drift factor concept in distributed snow modeling. Spatial <b>comparison</b> methods consisted <b>of</b> (1) pointwise <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> measured and modeled SWE, (2) visual <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> the spatial maps, (3) <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> the basinwide average SWE, (4) <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> zonal average SWE in accumulation and scour zones, and (5) <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> distribution functions.

50|$|If a {{class of}} utility {{functions}} is cardinal, intrapersonal <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> utility differences are allowed. If, in addition, some <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> utility are meaningful interpersonally, the linear transformations used to produce the class of utility functions must be restricted across people. An example is cardinal unit comparability. In that information environment, admissible transformations are increasing affine functions and, in addition, the scaling factor must {{be the same for}} everyone. This information assumption allows for interpersonal <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> utility differences, but utility levels cannot be compared interpersonally because the intercept of the affine transformations may differ across people.|$|R
