5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1914, Oskar Ursinus, {{the founder}} {{and editor of the}} German flying {{magazine}} Flugsport, began designing a large twin-engine seaplane of unconventional configuration. While most biplane designs have the fuselage attached to the lower wing, Ursinus had a snub-nosed fuselage attached to the upper wing, and twin engine nacelles mounted on the lower one. The purpose of this arrangement was to allow the engines to be kept close together thereby minimizing asymmetrical thrust {{in the event of an}} engine failure, although Ursinus later also claimed that this design balanced out the lowering of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> as speed increased, and minimised the drag on the upper wing caused by turbulence from the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Low-speed {{testing of}} the concept was already being {{provided}} by the Handley Page HP.115. Although high-speed performance appeared to be predictable, a dedicated testbed aircraft was desired, especially for drag measurements. As early as 1958, the RAE and Fairey began discussions about converting one of the Delta 2 prototypes to support the ogee wing. Fairey proposed stretching the fuselage a further three feet to better match the long planform, with the wing extending out onto the drooping nose. However, calculations showed that this extension was not great enough to counter the forward moving <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> (CoP) that resulted from the extended planform, and there were also concerns that the over-wing engine intakes would swallow the vortex above the wing.|$|E

25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Generally {{one wants}} to have the wing's <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> (CP, or [...] "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or [...] "balance point") {{to reduce the amount}} of control force {{required}} to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.|$|E
50|$|The {{wing of the}} Wanderlust {{was built}} around a single spar, which with plywood skin around the leading edge formed a torsion box. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. There was 4° of {{dihedral}} and 2° of washout. The trailing edge was spanned with aerofoil section flaps, split into two equal sections. Inboard, these acted as simple flaps; outboard, additionally, as drooping ailerons. The two NACA airfoil sections used in the wing were chosen because they have <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> that vary little with the angle of incidence, which increases when the flaps are deployed. The Wanderlust also had upper surface spoilers hinged on the wing spar at about quarter span.|$|R

500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements. The wing needed to be thin, to avoid creating too much drag, while still able to house a retractable undercarriage, plus armament and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel. In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{partnership}} with Alfa Romeo ended during the 1979 season, the team's first with young Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet.

Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during the season, prompting Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines, a move Murray described as being [...] "like having a holiday".

40|$|Evaluation of trunk movements, trunk muscle activation, intra-abdominal <b>pressure</b> and {{displacement}} <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and mass}} was undertaken {{to determine whether}} trunk orientation is a controlled variable prior to and during rapid bilateral movement of the upper limbs. Standing subjects performed rapid bilateral symmetrical upper limb movements in three directions (flexion, abduction and extension). The results indicated a small (0. 4 - 3. 3 degrees) but consistent initial angular displacement between the segments of the trunk in a direction opposite to that produced by the reactive moments resulting from limb movement. Phasic activation of superficial trunk muscles was consistent with this pattern of preparatory motion and with the direction of motion <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> mass. In contrast, activation of the deep abdominal muscles was independent of the direction of limb motion, suggesting a non-direction specific contribution to spinal stability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate whether, with vision, the magnitude of the effect of calf muscles fatigue on postural control during bipedal quiet standing depends on the eye-visual target distance. Twelve young university students were asked to stand upright as immobile as possible in three visual conditions (No vision, Vision 1 m and Vision 4 m) executed in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the calf muscles. <b>Centre</b> <b>of</b> foot <b>pressure</b> displacements were recorded using a force platform. Similar increased variances <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> foot <b>pressure</b> displacements were observed in the fatigue relative to the No fatigue condition for both the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions. Interestingly, in the vision 1 m condition, fatigue yielded: (1) a similar increased variance <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> foot <b>pressure</b> displacements to those observed in the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the medio-lateral axis and (2) a weaker destabilising effect relative to the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the antero-posterior axis. These results evidence that the ability to use visual information for postural control during bipedal quiet standing following calf muscles fatigue is dependent on the eye-visual target distance. More largely, {{in the context of the}} multisensory control of balance, the present findings suggest that the efficiency of the sensory reweighting of visual sensory cues as the neuro-muscular constraints acting on the subject change is critically linked with the quality of the information the visual system obtains...|$|R

2500|$|Dieudonné, the {{designer}} of the NiD 37, paid {{particular attention to the}} pilot's field of view, and the open cockpit, with screen and faired headrest, was placed well forward, immediately behind the engine.

[...] He could thus look vertically down between this edge and the trailing edge of the foreplane, aligned with {{the leading edge of the}} outer sections of the mainplane and mounted well below on the undercarriage struts. Apart from long, curved tips, this foreplane had straight edges and constant chord; it had a span of about 40% that of the mainplane and less than 20% of its area. [...] Its function was largely to bring the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> forward. [...] The main wing was slightly tapered away from its roots and with square tips.

2500|$|The Feiro Dongó was {{the second}} design of Lajos Rotter in his {{collaboration}} with the brothers Gyula and László Feigl. Rotter aimed to produce a training aircraft of high aerodynamic refinement with a high lift to drag ratio (L/D) which was also stable but responsive to the controls, structurally strong, easy to land and with a good all-round view from the cockpit. An innovative wing design was a key feature. [...] The Dongó was a biplane with wings of very high aspect ratio and modified elliptical plan, thus minimising induced drag. The upper wing had an aspect ratio of 16.9, very high at the time, and both wings had a root chord of only , though the lower was [...] shorter. Both had thick airfoils. [...] The very narrow wings were claimed to provide longitudinal stability, as the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> could not move far, and further pitch stability was provided by heavy stagger, with the lower wing [...] behind the upper. The two wings were set at different angles of attack, 0° on the lower and 2° on the upper, again {{with the intention of}} improving longitudinal stability [...] To provide roll stability the upper wing had dihedral beyond a short centre section. The latter was supported by a steel tube cabane which had pairs of vertical, kinked struts, faired in the upper part, and a forward, transverse inverted-V, all joined to the upper fuselage.

50|$|Overall, {{the effect}} of the Magnus force on a bullet's flight path itself is usually {{insignificant}} compared to other forces such as aerodynamic drag. However, it greatly affects the bullet's stability, which in turn affects the amount of drag, how the bullet behaves upon impact, and many other factors. The stability of the bullet is affected because the Magnus effect acts on the bullet's <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> instead of its centre of gravity. This means that it affects the yaw angle of the bullet: it tends to twist the bullet along its flight path, either towards the axis of flight (decreasing the yaw thus stabilising the bullet) or away from the axis of flight (increasing the yaw thus destabilising the bullet). The critical factor is the location of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> which depends on the flowfield structure, which in turn depends mainly on the bullet's speed (supersonic or subsonic), but also the shape, air density and surface features. If the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is ahead of the centre of gravity, the effect is destabilizing; if the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is behind the centre of gravity, the effect is stabilising.|$|E

The aim of the research was to analyze selected deviations <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> feet <b>pressure</b> (COP) in girls with scoliosis and scoliotic posture. Material and methods. 28 girls aged 7 - 18 years old were involved in the study. Spine research was made by Exhibeon digital radiography. Based on the size of the angle of spinal curvature there were identified scoliotic posture: 1 - 9 ° and scoliosis: ≥ 10 °. The deviations <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> feet <b>pressure</b> were examined by static-dynamic Tecnobody’s ST 310 Plus Stability System platform. Results. Forward-Backward Standard Deviation Y was from 6, 57 with opened eyes (OE) to 7, 32 with closed eyes (CE). The difference in Romberg’s Test was 0, 75. Medium-Lateral Standard Deviation X was from 3, 89 with opened eyes (OE) to 5, 54 with closed eyes (CE). The difference in Romberg’s Test was 1, 65. Average Forward-Backward Speed Y was from 11, 96 with opened eyes (OE) to 17, 29 with closed eyes (CE). The difference in Romberg’s Test was 5, 33. Average Medium-Lateral Speed X was from 9, 96 with opened eyes (OE) to 13, 89 with closed eyes (CE). The difference in Romberg’s Test was 3, 93. Conclusion. In a study with closed eyes (CE) it has been observed a significant increase <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> feet <b>pressure</b> deviations for: Medium-Lateral Standard Deviation X (p= 0, 022162), Average Forward-Backward Speed Y (p= 0, 000071) and Average Medium-Lateral Speed X (p= 0, 000916). Correlation analysis <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> feet <b>pressure</b> deviations with age demonstrated an important connections only in case of Medium-Lateral Standard Deviation X (r= - 0, 38, p= 0, 043).

W badaniu z oczami zamkniętymi (CE) zaobserwowano istotny wzrost wychyleń środka nacisku stóp dla: Medium-Lateral Standard Deviation X (p= 0, 022162), Average Forward-Backward Speed Y (p= 0, 000071) i Average Medium-Lateral Speed X (p= 0, 000916). Analiza korelacji wychyleń środka nacisku stóp z wiekiem wykazała istotne związki w jedynie w przypadku Medium-Lateral Standard Deviation X (r= - 0, 38, p= 0, 043). Zależność ta była odwrotnie proporcjonalna. Słowa kluczowe: średnie odchylenie Y, średnie odchylenie X, postawa skoliotyczna, skolioza idiopatyczn...|$|R
