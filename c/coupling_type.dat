Because some marriages are defined by a traditional ideology that anchors commitment in a value system rather than inherent rewards of the relationship, the association between satisfaction and commitment was expected to vary by <b>couple</b> <b>type.</b> Participants completed self-report measures of relational ideology, autonomy, communication, sat-isfaction, and several types of commitment. Results indicated that separate couples reported the lowest marital satisfaction and personal commitment of all the <b>couple</b> <b>types.</b> Separate <b>couples</b> also reported the lowest dedication commitment of all the <b>couple</b> <b>types,</b> whereas traditional <b>couples</b> reported the highest. The opposite pattern emerged for constraint commitment; separate couples reported the highest and tradi-tional couples reported the lowest.

50|$|This type of {{coupling}} normally exists {{when the}} service contract is developed by keeping {{a particular kind}} of consumer in mind e.g. services built to enable communication with a business partner or a service that executes a part of the business process logic or is itself the parent controller service in a service composition that executes the business process logic. This is also a negative form of coupling and needs to be avoided. Although in case of agnostic services there is a clear need to reduce this <b>coupling</b> <b>type,</b> however, in case of non-agnostic services e.g. the task services, existence of such coupling is intentional because the service is not required to be particularly reusable and hence could be tightly coupled to a particular consumer for better efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Anti-phase {{oscillation}} {{has been}} widely observed in cortical neural network. Elucidating the mechanism underlying the organization of anti-phase pattern is of significance for better understanding more complicated pattern formations in brain networks. In dynamical systems theory, the organization of anti-phase oscillation pattern has usually been considered to relate to time delay in coupling. This is consistent to conduction delays in real neural networks in the brain due to finite propagation velocity of action potentials. However, other structural factors in cortical neural network, such as modular organization (connection density) and the <b>coupling</b> <b>types</b> (excitatory or inhibitory), could also play an important role. In this work, we investigate the anti-phase oscillation pattern organized on a two-module network of either neuronal cell model or neural mass model, and analyze {{the impact of the}} conduction delay times, the connection densities, and <b>coupling</b> <b>types.</b> Our results show that delay times and <b>coupling</b> <b>types</b> can play key roles in this organization. The connection densities may have an influence on the stability if an anti-phase pattern exists due to the other factors. Furthermore, we show that anti-phase synchronization of slow oscillations can be achieved with small delay times if there is interaction between slow and fast oscillations. These results are significant for further understanding more realistic spatiotemporal dynamics of cortico-cortical communications...|$|R

Especially, land use intensity is an important attrition of recessive land use morphology, which presents human intervention toward land and regional socio-economic development. Based on the quantitative measure of land use intensity of farmland and rural construction land, this paper described the changes of recessive land use morphology. Furthermore, the coupling relationship between land use transitions and grain yield(GY) was established. The results showed:(1) From 1990 to 2010, the pattern of land use intensity showed prominently difference in Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, with farmland intensity(LUI F) increased while rural construction land intensity(LUI R) decreased; (2) The spatio-temporal patterns of the <b>coupling</b> <b>types</b> of LUI F, LUI R and GY changed obviously, in which the <b>coupling</b> <b>types</b> of "low-low-low" mainly distributed in the Bohai Bay region, and the <b>coupling</b> <b>types</b> of "high-high-high" concentrated in border area of Hebei, Shangdong and Henan provinces; and(3) Land use transitions promoted the evolution of grain production with a coupling relationship from antagonism to coordination between two of them.

The driver can also allow the viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>type</b> center differential to automatically tailor its basic 33:67 F-R torque split to suit different surfaces and conditions.In 2H mode, the road friction losses are minimized to allow maximum fuel economy and is also the ideal mode for urban driving in fine weather. The standard operating mode for SS4 II is the 4H mode which caters {{to a wide range}} of conditions: driving around town, on expressways or country roads; and driving over packed snow, icy surfaces, flat dirt and other off-road conditions. Selecting 4HLc mode locks the center differential so that drive is transmitted through all four wheels to enable driving in soft snow, sand, dirt or other high-resistance conditions. The 4LLc mode locks the center differential and by keeping the transmission in a low gear it enables driving on rocky terrains or swampy conditions where extra drive is required.|$|E

The 4 gear electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic transfer clutch and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs 3085 lb.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral Couple Therapy (BCT) has {{garnered}} considerable {{empirical support}} for its efficacy in resolving marital conflict. BCT also has documented success in treating individual health problems, including alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Consistent with the larger BCT framework, Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT) theory considers social interactions and exchanges in response to alcohol as critical antecedents and reinforcers of alcohol use. Thus, the purported mechanisms behind such components (e. g. positive reciprocity, leveling & editing) {{are based on the}} implicit assumption that the relationships of individuals where one partner has a problem with alcohol work similarly to those in distressed couples which neither partner has an alcohol problem. However, this assumption has yet to be tested directly; thus, the aim of the current study was to test whether classification of the presentation of couples in which one partner has an alcohol problem provides similarly meaningful information to what has been documented in the general couples literature. Specifically, typologies of couples seeking ABCT (N = 169) were examined and compared to couple typologies found in previous research on community samples of couples. Additionally, this study aimed to build on the couple typology findings by examining whether typology at the start of treatment predicted alcohol treatment response and outcome. Results suggest that four <b>types</b> of <b>couples</b> can be reliably established in couples seeking ABCT and these <b>couple</b> <b>types</b> resemble <b>couples</b> <b>types</b> found in previous research. <b>Couple</b> <b>type</b> was associated with baseline relationship satisfaction; however, no evidence was found that <b>couple</b> <b>type</b> is associated with alcohol use outcome.

The hypotheses predicted that 1) individuals who perceive that they are in a traditional marriage will have a lower demand-withdraw pattern and lower levels of perceptions of inequality in their division of household labor than individuals in independent marriages; 2) that individuals who perceive that they are in an independent marriage will have a higher demand-withdraw pattern and higher levels of perceptions of inequality in their division of household labor than individuals in traditional and separate couples; and 3) that individuals who perceive that they are in a separate marriage will have a lower demand-withdraw pattern and lower levels of perceptions of inequality in their division of household labor than individuals in independent marriages. The participants completed a questionnaire regarding their experiences in their marriage. The results of this particular study failed to support the three hypotheses. These findings may indicate that unknown third variables may influence the relationship between <b>couple</b> <b>types,</b> the demand-withdraw pattern, and perceptions of inequality in household labor.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the Arp 2 / 3 complex activated by N-WASP (VCA) branches actin filaments at the side (side branching), or at the barbed (B-) end (end branching) of the mother filaments, we have directly observed the branching process of actin filaments and examined single-molecule unbinding under optical microscope. We found that side branching was predominant, though not exclusive. At the initial stage of polymerization, the branching at the B-end occurred and subsequently the side branching started to occur. In either type of branching, the mother and daughter filaments elongated at nearly the same rate (growing type). Inde-pendently of the stage of polymerization, branching due to the direct coupling of filaments with an acute angle to the mother fil-aments (a <b>coupling</b> <b>type)</b> occurred.

40|$|Migration {{rates of}} dual-earner couples {{are lower than}} those of male-breadwinner couples. We revisit this issue using a cross-national {{comparative}} perspective and argue that national levels of support towards female employment and normative expectations about gender roles moderate the relationships between <b>couple</b> <b>type</b> and family migration. To test this, we use harmonised longitudinal data from four large-scale datasets from Australia, Britain, Germany and Sweden covering the 1992 2011 period. Consistent with prior research, we find that male-breadwinner couples migrate more often than dual-earner couples in all countries, suggesting that traditional gender structures affecting family migration operate across very different contexts. After adjusting for theory-based confounders, we find no difference in the prevalence of family migration across <b>couple</b> <b>types</b> in Sweden, where institutions most actively promote female labour force participation and gender egalitarian practice and attitudes are dominant.

Using {{a sample of}} 7, 567 Chinese premarital couples (living in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia) who completed the PREPARE inventory before marriage, the current study indicated that Chinese premarital couples exhibit four relational patterns: Vitalized, Harmonious, Traditional, and Conflicted. These four <b>couple</b> <b>types,</b> which were developed through phases including an exploratory analysis of 500 couples, a further analysis of a primary sample (3, 567 couples), and a confirmed validation analysis using 3, 500 couples, were almost identical to the four premarital types found in a U.
