This will prevent gelatinous-type solids from plugging the filter medium and also give a clearer filtrate. They can also be added to the slurry before filtration. This increases the porosity of the cake and reduces resistance of the <b>cake</b> during <b>filtration.</b> In a rotary filter, the filter aid may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this layer are sliced off with the cake.|$|R
5000|$|Beer is {{mechanically}} filtered by flowing {{the beer}} through layers of filter material; {{the two main}} techniques are surface filtration and <b>cake</b> <b>filtration.</b> Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g. hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters fine enough to strain colour and body from the beer. The normal filtration ratings are defined as rough, fine or sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration yields a beer which is nearly transparent and not cloudy, although observation of the scattering of light through the beer will reveal the presence of some small particles. Finally, as its name implies, sterile filtration is fine enough that almost all microorganisms in the beer have been removed. Beer which has been filtered is usually held in [...] "bright tanks" [...] at the brewery before bottling or additional treatment.|$|E

First we revised the theoretical models for the rheology of the drilling fluid, the flow behavior of drilling fluids in the drill pipe and annulus, and filtration mechanisms. Then systematic static leak-off experiments were carried out using an innovative method where CT scans taken at time intervals were used to visualize and accurately quantify infiltration of fluids in a sandstone core. Different compositions of oil based drilling fluids were investigated, to examine the influence of various particles on the external filter <b>cake</b> and internal <b>filtration.</b> Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the external filter <b>cake</b> and internal <b>filtration.</b> The results give accurate measurements of the filtration volume of the drilling fluids. Depending on {{the composition of the}} drilling fluid, the formation of external filter cake could be visualized on CT images. The core flow experiments are matched to the theory for linear static filtration. The results lead to new insights concerning the build of external filter <b>cake</b> and internal <b>filtration.</b> The experiments use real sandstone cores giving more realistic data than using an API press test and filter paper.

Coagulation with alum and (poly) aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) altered the MF fouling mechanism to follow the <b>cake</b> <b>filtration</b> model from the beginning of filtration. The MF and UF flux improvement by coagulation was due to the removal of some of the foulants in the raw AS effluent by the coagulants. The MF flux improvement was greater for alum than for ACH whereas the two coagulants performed equally well in UF. Coagulation also reduced hydraulically irreversible fouling on the membranes and this effect was more prominent in MF than in UF.

40|$|The {{pressure}} drop evolution incurred in diesel particulate filters during the soot loading cycle {{is an important}} quantity of interest for the automotive industry. It {{is influenced by the}} shape of the filter, the pore geometry in the filter walls and even the precise soot deposition patterns inside these pores. We simulate and try to understand these processes by considering three different scales. On the scale of soot particles, simulations help determining packing densities of soot cake in the pores and on top of the ceramic filter media. On the scale of the filter media, simulations help determine depth and <b>cake</b> <b>filtration</b> parameters as function of deposited dust or time. Figure 1 illustrates the connection of rather free flow in the earliest stages of the filtration, the onset of clogged channels throughout the material and finally, <b>cake</b> <b>filtration,</b> with the typical S-curves observed in many measurements.

40|$|Current media-scale {{multipass}} simulations in GeoDict/FilterDict {{work with}} a fixed amount of test dust per particle batch. This does not account properly for the transition from depth filtration to <b>cake</b> <b>filtration.</b> During depth filtration, the amount of test dust may be larger because a three-dimensional volume is available for deposition. When the surface filtration regime is entered, only a two-dimensional surface is available for deposition. With a fixed amount of test dust per particle batch, either the simulation is inefficient because the amount is chosen appropriately for the surface filtration, and many more flow fields are computed than necessary during the depth filtration, or the simulation has to be stopped after the depth filtration because too high particle concentrations would yield unrealistic overlapping particles and too high pressure drop in the <b>cake</b> <b>filtration</b> regime. The current work concerns the automatic detection of the transition from depth filtr ation to <b>cake</b> <b>filtration</b> in multipass filtration simulations and the automatic control of the simulation to account for {{this in terms of}} numbers of particles/amount of test dust deposited in a single particle batch of the multipass filter life time simulations.

This study investigates local filtration properties, i. e. the hydrostatic pressure and solidosity, in the dead-end filtration of microcrystalline cellulose, using slurries of varying pH levels and concentrations and two different filter media. The local measurements indicated that a dense skin was formed.

The PrekotAC {{is a combination of}} PrekotTM and activated carbon mixed in different weight composition. The result showed that the pressure drop across the fabric media decreases with the addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture due to its wide range of non-uniform particle size ditribution that gives higher porosity of filter <b>cake</b> during <b>filtration</b> process. The study also showed that the total particle penetration through the fabric media was proportionally related to addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture under a constant material loading.
