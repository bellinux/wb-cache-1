50|$|A <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> {{also called}} a pilot balloon or pibal, {{is used by}} meteorologists to {{determine}} {{the height of the}} base of clouds above ground level during daylight hours. In the past, and sometimes today, a theodolite was used to track the balloon {{in order to determine the}} speed and direction of winds aloft.The principle behind the <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> is that timing of a balloon with a known ascent rate (how fast it climbs) from its release until it disappears into the clouds can be used to calculate the height of the bottom of the clouds.|$|E
50|$|A {{pyranometer}} {{is a type}} of actinometer used {{to measure}} broadband solar irradiance on a planar surface and is a sensor that is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density (in watts per metre square) from a field of view of 180 degrees. A ceilometer is a device that uses a laser or other light source to determine the height of a cloud base. Ceilometers {{can also be used to}} measure the aerosol concentration within the atmosphere. A <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the base of clouds above ground level during daylight hours. The principle behind the <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> is a balloon with a known ascent rate (how fast it climbs) and determining how long the balloon rises until it disappears into the cloud. Ascent rate times ascent time yields the ceiling height. A disdrometer is an instrument used to measure the drop size distribution and velocity of falling hydrometeors. Rain gauges are used to measure the precipitation which falls at any point on the Earth's landmass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> is a reliable, {{safe and}} {{simple way to}} get an {{indication}} of the height of clouds. However, it does suffer from some disadvantages that the observer must be aware of. Rain and wet snow may slow the ascent of the balloon, giving a falsely high ceiling and high winds and poor visibility may cause the balloon to appear to enter the cloud before it actually does. As the balloon rises at a rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min) it will take over five minutes for the balloon to reach 700 m (2300 ft). Beyond this height the ability to follow the balloon, even with binoculars, is poor, as even the slightest movement of the eye off the balloon will almost certainly ensure that it vanishes.|$|E
50|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the cabinet is space to store balloons, string and pibal lights. The gas used to fill the balloon is helium or hydrogen. Because of its low cost <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloons</b> are often filled with hydrogen gas, but sometimes helium is used.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{theodolite}} use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather <b>balloons</b> called <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloons,</b> or pilot balloons or pibal. Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward.|$|R
50|$|Meteorologists {{also use}} total {{stations}} to track weather balloons for determining upper-level winds. With the average ascent {{rate of the}} weather balloon known or assumed, the change in azimuth and elevation readings provided by the total station as it tracks the weather balloon over time are used to compute the wind speed and direction at different altitudes. Additionally, the total station is used to track <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloons</b> to determine the height of cloud layers. Such upper-level wind data is often used for aviation weather forecasting and rocket launches.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ceiling</b> <b>balloon</b> is a small, usually red, (fluted) rubber balloon {{commonly}} measuring 76 mm (3 in) across {{prior to}} inflation, inflated to ~40 cm diameter. After inflation the balloon is taken outside and released. By timing the balloon from release until {{it enters the}} cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated the balloon will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and solid, so the ceiling height is not when the balloon disappears but when the colour begins to fade. The balloon {{can also be used}} to measure the vertical visibility into a layer of fog or blowing snow. In this case the balloon will begin to fade as soon as it is released, so the vertical visibility is when the balloon disappears. If the balloon is visible for a considerable distance into the cloud layer the observer should make note of it as it is of importance to aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{filming of}} the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, used the caves for villain Doctor Kananga's {{underground}} base beneath a cemetery on the fictional island of San Monique. It is most memorable {{for being the}} location where Bond (played {{for the first time}} by Roger Moore) kills Kananga (played by Yaphet Kotto) by forcing him to swallow a bullet of compressed air, causing him to float up to the <b>ceiling</b> like a <b>balloon</b> and explode.|$|R
40|$|Dutch cartoon {{forecasts}} aeronautic {{events for}} the year 1804 by showing people in hysterics, possibly over an imminent balloon ascension by "Wille van de Heeren Hopman & Loude. " From the <b>ceiling</b> hangs a <b>balloon</b> gondola {{in the style of}} Charli√©re equipped with Dutch flags, a cannon, umbrella (or parachute), and a barometer. On the background wall hang pictures of balloon ascents and accidents. Outside, a bill poster pastes up a notice "Lust tot Onderzo[ek] [...] . " and people purchase tickets. Title from item.

40|$|A rocket {{carrying}} an optical ozonesonde was launched at 1822 GMT on Sept. 29, 1977 {{in support of}} the STRATCOM 8 balloon. The integral ozone amount above the <b>balloon</b> <b>ceiling</b> altitude of 40 km was measured as. 0117 atm-cm with an uncertainty less than + or - 7 %. The ozone density at 40 km was 6. 77 x 10 to the 17 th power mol/cu m. Ozone densities in molecules/cu m at higher altitudes were 2. 28 x 10 to the 17 th power at 45 km, 6. 72 x 10 to the 16 th power at 50 km, 2. 20 x 10 to the 16 th power at 55 km, and 7. 26 x 10 to the 15 th power at 60 km. In addition, the ozone distribution was measured at lower altitudes from the tropopause at 17 km to 40 km...|$|R
40|$|Vertical ozone {{profiles}} {{taken with}} four collocated differential-absorption lidar systems {{were compared with}} in-situ measurements from a UV absorption and a chemiluminescence ozone analyzer on board an airplane and a tether balloon. Spatial overlap between the airplane and the balloon data, although limited by the minimum flight height required for the airplane and the <b>ceiling</b> of the <b>balloon,</b> showed that ozone in the lower troposphere exhibits considerable natural variation. Lidar data agree well with the in-situ data if the lidars are operated {{in compliance with the}} recommendations by the Commission of Air Pollution Prevention (KRdL) of VDI and DIN. On average there seems to be, though, a small negative bias that has so far not been explained. Best results are obtained if, by an experienced operator or via a special algorithm, data are cut out that are contaminated by large backscatter gradients at the edges of patches of fog or clouds...|$|R
