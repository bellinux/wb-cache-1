50|$|An {{inverter}} circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main {{function is to}} invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor coupled with a resistor. Since this 'resistive-drain' approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at low cost. However, because current flows through the resistor {{in one of the}} two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing speed. Alternatively, inverters can be constructed using two <b>complementary</b> <b>transistors</b> in a CMOS configuration. This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states. Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices. Inverters can also be constructed with bipolar junction transistors (BJT) in either a resistor-transistor logic (RTL) or a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) configuration.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in further advancement of III−V electronics is to integrate high mobility <b>complementary</b> <b>transistors</b> on the same substrate. The difficulty {{is due to the}} large lattice mismatch of the optimal p- and n-type III−V semiconductors.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop smart sensor network, the {{electronic}} sensors must be low-cost and flexible to enable widespread distribution. To meet those criteria, we have developed organic integrated circuits fabricated by all-additive solution processes. One of the prototypes we have demonstrated is a temperature sensor tag (Fig. 1) consisted of a printed thermistor bridge, a threshold control circuit, and non-volatile memories. The threshold control circuit is based on inkjet printed <b>complementary</b> <b>transistors,</b> and the non-volatile memories are capacitors with ferroelectric polymer dielectric. When the thermistor temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold (above 35 C or below 4 C), the control circuit is triggered to generate a pulse to write into the memory. This temperature sensor tag is self-contained and will be applicable to packaging or environmental monitoring applications. In addition to demonstrating the tag performance, we will discuss our approach to tackle the challenges of device variations and stability in printed devices. 1, 2 We will show some design rules for printed sensor platforms (Fig. 2), {{in order to improve}} the reliability of the fabrication processes and accelerate the development of printed electronics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A popular {{form for}} a voltage-follower (VF) with global {{feedback}} is a voltage operational amplifier (Op-Amp) with 100 % negative feedback. Nevertheless, with currently available Op-Amps it {{is unable to}} meet high frequency specifications. This paper presents a high frequency voltage-follower based on an overall feedback technique. Despite the global feedback loop, the design presented small-signal bandwidth higher than 3 GHz and gain flatness to within 0. 1 dB up to 170 MHz. Due to this feedback loop, the circuits exhibits very high input and very low output impedance. In addition, the output voltage swing achieved is some ± 3 V, with an input offset current of around 130 nA and an offset voltage {{in the range of}} 200 uV. The proposed circuit is very stable, due to the stability technique used, maintaining low distortion. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the circuit is better than- 65 dB and the intermodulation distortion (IMD) is some- 70 dB, for capacitive loads up to 10 pF.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} clock gating {{technique}} {{along with a}} comparator circuit is presented for low power VLSI (very large scale integration) circuit design. The rapid {{increase in the number}} of transistors on chips enabled a dramatic increase in the performance of computing systems. However, the performance improvement has been accompanied by an increase in power dissipation; thus requiring more expensive packaging and cooling technology. Reducing power dissipation is one of the most principle subjects in VLSI design today. Clock gating is a technique to reduce clock power with the help of transmission gate. In this paper 3 bit JK flip flop is designed using transmission gate. 3 bit JK flip-flop is constructed by connecting three JK flip-flops in series i. e. output of first JK flip-flop is fed as input of second JK flip-flop and the output of second JK flip-flop is fed as input of third JK flip-flop. Transmission gate has three input, called source, n-gate, and p-gate; and it has one output called drain. The transmission gate is simply the combination of two <b>complementary</b> <b>transistors.</b> Also a comparator circuit is added between input and output of JK flip flop.

40|$|A novel {{high-voltage}} analog {{power amplifier}} {{derived from a}} well-known complementary class B amplifier is presented in this paper. The amplifier offers improved efficiency when driving capacitive loads such as piezoelectric multilayer actuators, while maintaining {{a high level of}} signal quality, peak power and low electromagnetic radiation. The main drawback of a class B amplifier in comparison to other power amplifiers is low efficiency, resulting in extensive power-loss in the two <b>complementary</b> <b>transistors</b> of the amplifier stage. Power-loss can be reduced by minimizing the voltage drop across the collector-emitter path of the transistors when a high collector current occurs. The proposed circuit uses an additional capacitor to recover up to one half of the charge stored in the actuator whenever the actuator is being discharged. The capacitor offers an additional power supply rail next to the positive and negative supply voltage of the amplifier stage. Switching the power supply net of the power transistors between the different supply rails, {{in order to reduce the}} voltage drop across the transistors, minimizes power-loss. The development of the amplifier was triggered by the introduction of a new piezoelectric motor and the requirements concerning signal quality and electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, in this paper, the circuit is analyzed using application-specific sinusoidal control signals which are used to drive the motor. Following the analytical investigation of the circuit, the amplifier is tested in an experiment measuring power consumption with a pure reactive load, and the level of distortion caused by the amplifier. In the experiment, a power-loss reduction of 47 % was achieved in comparison with a class B stage. The amplifier processed a peak power of 160 W.
