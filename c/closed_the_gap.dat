5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's {{retirement}} saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points.

40|$|This {{report shows}} that {{although}} there has been some improvement in education and health outcomes for Indigenous Australians, most <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets are not on track to be met. Abstract This is <b>the</b> seventh <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> Report produced since targets were set by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 2008. The report shows that {{although there has}} been some improvement in education and health outcomes for Indigenous Australians, most <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets are not on track to be met. The Government is continuing to focus on reform of Indigenous affairs and the positive impact that this will have on <b>the</b> <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets. There is a strong emphasis on practical actions to get kids to school, adults into work, make communities safer and advancing constitutional recognition...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{retained}} his lead in the Drivers' Championship, although Hamilton <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to eleven points. The two Ferrari drivers of Vettel and Räikkönen followed in third and fourth, both on 96 points, followed by Ricciardo in fifth with 88. In the constructors' standings, Mercedes increased their lead over Ferrari now on 295 to 192 points. Red Bull were third, with 168 points, 76 points ahead of Williams.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E
5|$|Bräck <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> with de Ferran {{over the}} next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half, however, {{things began to}} fall apart for Virginia Tech. Hokie quarterback Sean Glennon threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once, giving Georgia {{excellent}} field position and many chances to score. Tech clung to a 21–13 lead {{at the end of}} the third quarter, but halfway through the fourth quarter, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech.

5|$|In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Shōji {{to abandon}} his {{positions}} at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Although American forces had almost completely encircled Shōji's troops along Gavaga Creek at Koli, a gap existed {{by way of a}} swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape.

5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating {{to close the gap}} between herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E

40|$|When {{government}} leaders {{from across the}} country met in 2008 to agree to a framework for tackling Indigenous disadvantage, they set ambitious targets to address priority areas for change. <b>The</b> <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> framework and <b>the</b> six targets set by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) is a national approach to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between Indigenous and non- Indigenous people. It involves unprecedented levels of investment by governments across seven inter-linked areas, known as ‘building blocks’, which have been underpinned by a series of Indigenous-specific and mainstream National Partnership Agreements between the Australian, State and Territory Governments. <b>The</b> six <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets relate to life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment. Governments have agreed to work in partnership—and <b>the</b> approach to <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> extends beyond governments to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities, the private sector and nongovernment organisations. The timeframes for <b>the</b> <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets are ambitious and varied. Recognising the significant challenge posed by these targets, all governments have shown the determination—and the will—to meet them. Much progress has been made to address Indigenous disadvantage in the years since <b>the</b> <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> framework was agreed to. This year is a significant year for <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap.</b> It is <b>the</b> year in which the first of the targets set back in 2008 will be achieved— ensuring all Indigenous four-yearolds living in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years, or by 2013. It is also the fifth anniversary of the National Apology to Australia’s Indigenous Peoples, in particular the Stolen Generations, and the Parliament will be asked to show its commitment and leadership in progressing constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as it considers the Bill for an Act of Recognition. This year will also mark the 20 th anniversary of the Native Title Act being passed. Both anniversaries are significant milestones to reflect on as Australia continues to move towards reconciliation and <b>the</b> goal of <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> in Indigenous disadvantage...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} seasons were comparatively barren. Arsenal again {{exited the}} Champions League {{at the group}} stage, but dropped down to the UEFA Cup. Wenger guided his team to the final, where they lost to Galatasaray on penalties. In the league, Arsenal finished 18 points behind Manchester United as runners-up, and though they <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to eight points in 2000–01, they never posed a serious title challenge. The trophy drought continued past 2001, when Michael Owen scored two late goals for Liverpool to beat Arsenal in the FA Cup Final. Wenger rued his team's inability to make possession count, but refused to blame individuals, namely Henry, for missing chances.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{maintained}} his leading {{heading into the}} first corner and resisted Hamilton's attempts at passing him. The safety car was deployed following a large accident involving Vettel's teammate Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen on the ninth lap. Hamilton passed the safety car and was later issued with a drive-through penalty for which he served on lap 27. Vettel remained the leader at the restart despite running deep in the track's final corner. Hamilton <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between himself and Vettel {{but was unable to}} get close and Vettel maintained the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to secure the victory.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{was able}} to climb from 16th on the grid to take 12th behind Glock, and passed the Toyota on the second lap. Kubica, further up the field, {{improved}} on his grid position, moving from 11th to take eighth behind Vettel. However, Hamilton was the quickest on track, as he set new fastest laps on laps three, six and eight, to extend his lead over Räikkönen to more than four seconds. This trend continued until lap10 when Räikkönen fought back and <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> However, Hamilton extended his lead when he set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:36.325 on lap13. In the other McLaren, Kovalainen was struggling, running two seconds a lap slower than Hamilton, and dropping back from Alonso to Heidfeld.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the game, the 2009 ACC {{championship}} had a large amount of offense. Throughout the contest, neither team punted: Every offensive drive ended in a score or a turnover. Clemson scored first, a touchdown on its opening drive, and held a 7–3 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter. In the second quarter, Georgia Tech scored 13 points to Clemson's six, and the Yellow Jackets entered halftime with a 16–13 lead. They extended that lead in the third quarter, scoring 17 points to Clemson's lone touchdown and extra point. In the fourth quarter, Clemson <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and took a 34–33 lead with 6:11 remaining, but Georgia Tech drove down the field and scored a touchdown with 1:20 remaining, giving the Yellow Jackets a 39–34 lead that was the game's final margin. In recognition of his significant performance despite the loss, Clemson running back C. J. Spiller was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E
