5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading.

5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of <b>conditions,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> embrittlement, which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital <b>conditions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired <b>conditions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of {{red blood cells}} (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope), {{as well as the}} changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated <b>conditions,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory.

Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.|$|E
