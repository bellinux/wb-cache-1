25|$|The larvae feed on {{species of}} plants {{belonging}} to the Papaveraceae and <b>Crassulaceae</b> families, and like the other swallowtail butterfly larvae, possess an osmeterium. Unlike most butterflies that have exposed pupae, they pupate inside a loose silken cocoon.|$|E
25|$|The larval host {{plants are}} Kalanchoe laciniata and K. pinnata {{of the family}} <b>Crassulaceae</b> (stonecrop family); the latter host being a common garden plant. Adult {{butterflies}} have sometimes been seen to visit lichens. Studies suggest that they collect phenolic substances by scraping lichens.|$|E
2500|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study from}} 2008 suggests firstly that Baronia brevicornis Salvin 1893, rather than belonging to an outgroup Baroniinae belongs to Parnassiini, together with Hypermnestra and Parnassius. Secondly that the earliest split within the genus Parnassius is between subgenus Parnassius (the 'apollo' group, whose caterpillars feed on <b>Crassulaceae,</b> exceptionally Saxifragaceae) and the ancestor {{of the remaining}} seven subgenera. The existence of the subgenera is confirmed by molecular phylogenies. Six of the other subgenera have Fumariaceae as the larval food plant, while the larvae of the remaining genus Kreizbergia feed on Scrophulariaceae ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} mostly desert plants called [...] "CAM" [...] plants (Crassulacean acid metabolism, after the family <b>Crassulaceae,</b> which {{includes}} the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, they close their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of RuBisCO. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal photorespiration. This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store fixed carbon in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{the absence}} or rarity at this {{elevation}} of several very large natural families,* [Ranunculaceae, Fumariae, Cruciferae, Alsineae, Geranicae, Leguminosae, Potentilla, Epilobium, <b>Crassulaceae,</b> Saxifrageae, Umbelliferae, Lonicera, Valerianeae, Dipsaceae, various genera of Compositae, Campanulaceae, Lobeliaceae, Gentianeae, Boragineae, Scrophularineae, Primulaceae, Gramineae.] which have numerous representatives at and much below {{the same level}} in the inner ranges, and on the outer of the Western Himalaya, indicate a certain peculiarity in Sikkim. On the other hand, certain tropical genera are more abundant in the temperate zone of the Sikkim mountains, and ascend much higher there than in the Western Himalaya: of this fact I have cited conspicuous examples in the palms, plantains, and tree-ferns. This ascent and prevalence of tropical species {{is due to the}} humidity and equability of the climate in this temperate zone, and is, perhaps, the direct consequence of these conditions. An application of the same laws accounts for the extension of similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the Southern Ocean, where various natural orders, which do not cross the 30th and 40th parallels of N. latitude, are extended to the 55th of S. latitude, and found in Tasmania, New Zealand, the so-called Antarctic Islands south of that group, and at Cape Horn itself.|$|E
