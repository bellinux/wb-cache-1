40|$|Background: Several {{different}} factors {{point to}} {{the significance of the}} role of non-genetic causes in the etiology of type 1 diabetes. Some studies have suggested a positive correlation between early exposure to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in infancy and increased later risk of developing the disease, while other studies have not found such a correlation. The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review. A total of 19 studies were included, most of them being retrospective case-control designed studies. Results: The included studies were categorized in terms of whether they showed a positive, negative or no correlation between infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure and risk of type 1 diabetes, and with regard {{to the quality of the}} studies. Six of the studies results were considered to be positive and convincing for increased risk of type 1 diabetes with early infant exposure, four were positive and plausible or positive and lacking, and 12 showed no effect. Conclusions: Divergent results could be seen between the different studies included in this review with regards to whether early infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes or not. On the basis of the findings in this review, one can therefore not conclude with a positive, negative or a non-existing relationship between the respective exposure and the disease...|$|E
40|$|People talk {{of having}} an allergy to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> but such allergies are in fact quite rare. People are {{normally}} referring to an intolerance of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> through the body s reaction to lactose, the natural sugar of milk. It is a double sugar {{that has to be}} divided into two separate sugars for the body {{to be able to use}} them. This division usually takes place in the small intestine, mediated by an enzyme known as lactase. After birth and during infancy, most people produce enough lactase to digest the milk s lactose. It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose. An alternative to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> is soya milk, which is also a complementary foodstuff.

40|$|Introduction: Allergy to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> {{protein is}} the most common food allergy in {{children}} under the age of three years. A diet without milk or dairy products is potentially low in many nutrients and could put the child at risk of malnutrition and compromised growth. Dairy products are a major source of iodine in the Norwegian diet, and excluding dairy products may negatively affect iodine status. Insufficient iodine status during childhood could potentially be detrimental and put the child at risk for delays in mental development and poor growth. Objectives: The main objectives of this study was to investigate iodine intake and status along with growth in infants and young children under two years of age who were on a <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein free diet and to identify factors affecting iodine status and growth in these children. Methods: Fifty-seven infants and children under two years of age where included in a larger cross-sectional study on the nutritional status of children on <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein free diets (MILKID study). Two spot urine samples from were collected and analysed for iodine, together with a three day food record and a food frequency questionnaire on dietary sources of iodine. Urine iodine concentrations were compared to the WHO cut-off values for iodine deficiency. Weight, length and head circumference were recorded at birth and at inclusion in the study and compared to the Norwegian growth standard. Sub-group analyses were done on different feeding patterns, according to weaning status. Results: One third of the children had iodine deficiency according to urine iodine concentration (UIC). Children who were mainly breastfed were at highest risk and 58 % was classified as deficient. Dietary factors associated with iodine were intake of enriched baby cereals (r = 0. 230, p = 0. 02) and reaching RDI for iodine through diet (r= 0. 313, p = 0. 03). Children of mothers who took supplement with iodine had higher urinary iodine concentrations, though this was not significant. Growth in length was compromised in boys, 11 % of the infants had weight for age z-score (WAZ) and BMI for age z-score (BMIZ) of ≤ - 2 and 5 % length for age z-scores (LAZ) of ≤ - 2 at inclusion and this was associated with food refusal and low appetite, but not associated with iodine deficiency. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the exclusion of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein puts the child at risk of deficiency of iodine and poor growth, however the two conditions were not related. Infants reliant on breast milk as their main iodine source are at increased risk of iodine deficiency. Boys with feeding problems were at highest risk of growth failure...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{contains}} {{different types}} of colloidal or coarsely dispersed particles, such as casein micelles, membrane fragments, fat globules and cells. The fat globules are composed of subpopulations of differently sized particles. In contrast to <b>COW</b> 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk,</b> the overall average diameter (dys), increases with advancing lactation from about 1. 8 ~min colostrum to 4. 0 ~min mature milk. Membrane materials originating from the milk fat globule membrane, plasma membrane, secretory vesicles and other sources {{can be found in}} milk serum. These particles have also been called lipoprotein particles. Their size ranges from about 10 - 400 nm. New results concerning the structure of human milk casein particles show that their average size is considerably smaller than in cows milk and that their average diameter tends t~ increase with advancing lactation. dvs in human milk ranges from about 11 - 55 nm, in <b>COW</b> 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk</b> from approximately 90 - 100 nm.

Several dairy products such as raw milk, traditionally fermented cheese (produced without the use of commercial starter cultures), and kefir which are produced in country are good sources of novel lactic acid bacterial strains. These lactic acid bacterial strains may have potential for the production of new fermented dairy products with characteristic aroma and flavour. Therefore, the isolation of lactic acid bacteria from natural products and their identification are important. For many years, several phenotypic methods have been used to identify lactic acid bacteria, but they are not often capable of effectively differentiating subspecies and strains within a genus. New methods based on the genotypic properties have been developed and used for the proper classification of bacteria The aim of this research was the isolation of lactic acid bacteria from raw milk and the identification of the lactic acid bacterial isolates by biochemical tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from <b>cow.</b> <b>s</b> raw <b>milk</b> and identified by biochemical reactions. Two PCR based methods, ITS-PCR (Internal Transcribed Spacer-PCR) and PCR-RFLP (PCR- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) were then used for the differentiation of reference strains of lactic acid bacteria. PCR-RFLP method, based on the amplification and restriction digestion of 16 S rRNA gene, was found to be useful for the identification. Thirteen raw milk isolates were identified as Lactococcus lactis, 24 as Enterococcus spp., and 2 as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris by PCR-RFLP method. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was also optimized for the identification of reference strains. Restriction profiles obtained by digesting the genomic DNA with Sma I enabled differentiation of the reference strains of Lactococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococus thermophilus...|$|R

We can able determine whether residue of antibiotics making any difference on these selected properties. Thermo-physical properties were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), (TA Instruments, USA) and chemical properties were determined by using Lactostar (Funke Gerber Inc., Berlin, Germany). Antibiotic residues were detected by Copan Milk Test, Penzyme Test and ROSA Test and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for confirmation of screening tests. Due to some drawbacks of screening tests, liquid chromatography was required for confirmation of antibiotic residues in milk. HPLC method showed that average recoveries of spiked Penicillin G at 2, 4, 8 ppb, spiked Ampicillin at 2, 4, 8 ppb and spiked Tetracycline at 100, 250, 500 ppb were ranged from 44. 67 % to 66. 00 %, from 62. 50 % to 87. 52 % and from 92. 86 % to 94. 35 %, respectively.

40|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> allergy (CMA) affects about 2 - 6 % {{of infants}} and young children. Environmental factors during early life are {{suggested}} {{to play a}} role in the development of allergic diseases. One of these factors is likely to be maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation. The association between maternal diet and development of CMA in offspring is not well known, but diet could contain factors that facilitate development of tolerance. After an established food allergy, another issue is gaining tolerance towards an antigen that causes symptoms. The strictness of the elimination depends on the individual level of tolerance. This study aimed at validating a questionnaire used to inquire about food allergies in children, at researching associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and subsequent development of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> allergy in the offspring, and at evaluating the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet of children with CMA and factors associated with the adherence and age of recovery. These research questions were addressed in a prospective birth cohort born between 1997 and 2004 at the Tampere and Oulu University Hospitals. Altogether 6753 children of the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Nutrition cohort were investigated. Questionnaires regarding allergic diseases are often used in studies without validation. High-quality valid tools are therefore needed. Two validation studies were conducted here: one by comparing parentally reported food allergies with information gathered from patient records of 1122 children, and the other one by comparing parentally reported CMA with information in the reimbursement records of special infant formulae in the registers of the Social Insurance Institution for 6753 children. Both of these studies showed that the questionnaire works well and is a valid tool for measuring food allergies in children. In the first validation study, Cohen s kappa values were within 0. 71 - 0. 88 for CMA, 0. 74 - 0. 82 for cereal allergy, and 0. 66 - 0. 86 for any reported food allergy. In the second validation study, the kappa value was 0. 79, sensitivity 0. 958, and specificity 0. 965 for reported and diagnosed CMA. To investigate the associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and CMA in offspring, 6288 children were studied. Maternal diet during pregnancy (8 th month) and lactation (3 rd month) was assessed by a validated, 181 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and as an endpoint register-based information on diagnosed CMA was obtained from the Social Insurance Institution and complemented with parental reports of CMA in their children. The associations between maternal food consumption and CMA in offspring were analyzed by logistic regression comparing the highest and lowest quarters with two middle quarters of consumption and adjusted for several potential confounding factors. High maternal intake of milk products (OR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 86 p = 0. 002) was associated with a lower risk of CMA in offspring. When stratified according to maternal allergic rhinitis or asthma, a protective association of high use of milk products with CMA was seen in children of allergy-free mothers (OR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 69, p < 0. 001), but not in children of allergic mothers. Moreover, low maternal consumption of fish during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of CMA in children of mothers with allergic rhinitis or asthma (OR 1. 47, 95 % CI 0. 96 - 2. 27 for the lowest quarter, p = 0. 043). In children of nonallergic mothers, this association was not seen. Maternal diet during lactation was not associated with CMA in offspring, apart from an inverse association between citrus and kiwi fruit consumption and CMA. These results imply that maternal diet during pregnancy may contain factors protective against CMA in offspring, more so than maternal diet during lactation. These results need to be confirmed in other studies before giving recommendations to the public. To evaluate the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA, food records of 267 children were studied. Subsequent food records were examined to assess the age at reintroduction of milk products to the child s diet. Nine of ten families adhered to the elimination diet of the child with extreme accuracy. Older and monosensitized children had more often small amounts of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein in their diet (p < 0. 001 for both). Adherence to the diet was not related to any other sociodemographic factor studied or to the age at reintroduction of milk products to the diet. Low intakes of vitamin D, calcium, and riboflavin are of concern in children following a cow s milk-free diet. In summary, we found that the questionnaires used in the DIPP study are valid in investigating CMA in young children; that there are associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and the development of CMA in offspring; and that the therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA is rigorously adhered to. Maitoallergia koskettaa n. 2 - 6 % lapsista. Varhaisilla ympäristötekijöillä voi olla vaikutuksia allergisten sairauksien kehittymiseen. Tässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin kyselykaavakkeen luotettavuutta ruoka-allergioiden tutkimisessa, äidin raskauden ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion yhteyttä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin sekä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuutta ja sen yhteyttä taustatekijöihin ja ruokavalion päättymisikään. Näitä tutkimuskysymyksiä selvitettiin vuosien 1997 ja 2004 välisenä aikana Tampereen ja Oulun yliopistollisissa sairaaloissa tehdyssä tutkimuksessa (Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Ravintotutkimus). Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuutta selvitettiin vertaamalla vanhempien ilmoittamia ruoka-allergioita sairaalan potilaskertomustietoihin sekä KELA:n rekisteritietoon imeväisten erityisvalmisteiden erityiskorvattavuuspäätöksistä. Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuus todettiin hyväksi: vanhemmat raportoivat lastensa ruoka-allergiat yhdenmukaisesti lääkärin tekemän diagnoosin kanssa. Äidin raskauden- ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion ja lapsen maitoallergian riskin välisten yhteyksien selvittämiseksi äitien ruokavaliota kartoitettiin ruoankäytön frekvenssikyselyllä kahdeksannella raskauskuulla sekä imetyksen aikana lapsen ollessa kolmen kuukauden ikäinen. Tieto lapsen maitoallergiasta perustui KELA:n rekisteritietoihin sekä vanhempien raportoimaan. Äidin runsas maitovalmisteiden käyttö oli yhteydessä matalaan maitoallergian riskiin. Tutkittaessa allergisia ja ei-allergisia äitejä ja heidän lapsiaan erikseen, suojaava yhteys näkyi ainoastaan ei-allergisten äitien ja heidän lastensa kohdalla. Toisaalta allergisten äitien vähäinen kalan käyttö oli yhteydessä suurempaan maitoallergian riskiin. Äidin imetyksen aikainen ruokavalio ei ollut yhteydessä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin. Maitoallergisten lasten ruokapäiväkirjoja tutkittiin välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuuden ja päättymisen selvittämiseksi. Yhdeksän kymmenestä perheestä noudatti ruokavaliota hyvin tarkasti. Pieniä määriä maitoproteiinia oli useammin yksinomaan maidolle allergisten ja vanhempien lasten ruokavaliossa. Ruokavalion noudattamistarkkuus ja maitotuotteiden palautus ruokavalioon ei riippunut muista taustatekijöistä, kuten vanhempien iästä tai koulutustasosta. Maitoallergisten lasten D-vitamiinin, kalsiumin ja B 2 vitamiinin (riboflaviini) saanti ei aina ole riittävää välttämisruokavalion aikana, eikä sen jälkeen. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että DIPP-ravintotutkimuksessa ruoka-allergian tutkimiseen käytettävät lomakkeet toimivat luotettavasti; että äidin raskauden aikaisella ruokavaliolla on yhteys lapsen maitoallergian kehittymiseen; ja että suomalaisperheissä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalio toteutuu tarkasti...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of production types together with other factors, such as season, geographical regions and fat content, on <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> composition, nutritional and potential sensory quality of the milk. The study included two phases of experiment. In Phase 1, organic and conventional semi-skimmed milk (1. 2 1. 8 % fat) was collected during 5 periods from December 2012 to October 2013 from Norway, Germany, Sweden and Denmark. In Phase 2, organic and conventional whole milk (3. 5 4 % fat) and low fat milk (1. 2 1. 5 % fat) were collected from June to October 2014 in Middle Norway. Lipid compounds and multi-elements were investigated in Phase 1 using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. In Phase 2, antioxidant activity and metabolites were detected and measured based on ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP assay) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The results indicated that production types had no significant influence on lipid compounds distribution, major metabolites, minerals as well as antioxidant activity. Concentration of a few metabolites (xylose, tryptophan, gluconic acid, capric acid and lauric acid) and copper (Cu) were found significantly different between organic and conventional milk. Besides, season had strong effect on distribution of lipid compounds as shown by principal component analysis (PCA). Level of major elements, except Selenium (Se), were significantly changed within a year with a remarkable drop in August. In addition, selenium level in milk was strongly affected by geographical regions. Whole milk had significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to low fat milk. Concentration of capric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid and cholesterol were significantly different between the whole and the low fat milk. Overall, the findings of this study provide a better understanding about potential factors which significantly affect milk composition and nutritional quality...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 60 th European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Congress, celebrado en Viena (Austria) del 11 al 15 de junio de 2016. [...] et al. [Background]: Lactobacilli {{are members}} of the lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB), commonly used in the food industry and associated to dairy products. Some species are naturally present in the human microbiota while others (for which health benefits have been demonstrated) are known as probiotics. We have previously demonstrated that oral administration of a recombinant strain of Lactobacillus casei BL 23 (L. casei) producing the bovine b-lactoglobulin (BLG) a major <b>cow</b> 0 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> allergen (CMA), modifies the Th 2 -oriented immune response in a mouse model of CMA. As cytokines are potent regulators of immune response, we then wondered if oral administration of recombinant L. casei BL 23 expressing either IL- 10 or TGF-b 1 (two mmunosuppressive cytokines) could offset the adverse reaction induced in a mouse model of peanut allergy. [Method]: Mice were intragastrically administered with either: (i) L. casei wild type, (ii) L. casei expressing (IL- 10 or TGF-b 1) or untreated. Basal Immune response triggered after oral administration of bacteria was measure before sensitization protocol. Peanut-sensitization and anaphylaxis induction were then carried out to evaluate the effects of IL- 10 or TGF-b 1 delivered by L. casei BL 23. Spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer’s patch and intestine were recovered and cells were obtained to phenotyping by flow cytometry. Peanut specific antibodies and Mast cell protease- 1 (mMCP- 1) were assayed by ELISA. Impact of bacteria treatment on intestinal permeability was measured using dextran-FITC. [Results]: Oral administration of recombinant L. casei strains expressing either IL- 10 or TGF-b 1 led to signiﬁcant decrease in peanut-speciﬁc IgE production when compared to control mice. The allergic reaction induced after the oral challenge was also signiﬁcantly reduced as evidenced by the modulation of intestinal permeability and the lower levels of mMCP- 1. We also observed that treatment with recombinant bacteria induce FoxP 3 +regulatory T cells and impact on the prevalence of non-inﬂammatory macrophages and pro-tolerogenic dendritic cells. [Conclusion]: Altogether, our results show the potential of L. casei expressing IL- 10 or TGF-b 1 to prevent allergic sensitization and resultant allergic reaction, probably by inducing a local pro-tolerogenic environment, but also by reinforcing intestinal barrier and promoting intestinal homeostasis.

40|$|Differences in {{clotting}} {{between human}} and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in the stomachs of infants are discussed. Gastric pH, after ingesting milk, {{of an infant}} up to 6 months of age stays at a pH range of 4 - 5, near the isoelectric point of casein, and never reaches the value of 2, which is found in adults. Pepsin C (or gastricsin) can hydrolyze proteins at this pH range. Gastric emptying time is shorter with human milk than with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> {{which appears to be}} correlated to the smaller size of human milk clots. Elimination of a readily coagulable fraction of casein from cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> by restricted rennet action produced B-casein rich milk with similar coagulating properties to that of human milk. Although pepsin digestibility at pH 2 was greater for bovine whole casein than bovine B-casein-rich fraction or human casein, this difference was minimized or even reversed at pH 4. This was ascribred to the difference in clotting behavior of s 1 -casein and B-casein, namely a harder clot of the former. Therefore, the difference in clotting and proteolytic properties between human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in an infant 2 ̆ 7 s stomach can be explained from the difference in chemical properties of their major caseins, i. e., B-caseins and s 1 -case-ins in human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> respectively...|$|R

Objective: To determine the nutritional adequacy of two groups of 12 – 24 -month-old Irish children by type of milk consumption (consumers or non-consumers of GUM). Design: Using data from a cross-sectional study of Irish children, the National Pre-School Nutrition Survey (2010 – 2011), two groups of children were defined. The groups included children aged 12 – 24 months with an average daily total milk intake of at least 300 g and consuming GUM (≥ 100 g/day) together with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> (n= 29) or cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> only (n= 56). Results: While average total daily energy intakes were similar in both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of protein, saturated fat, and vitamin B 12 were lower and intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, iron, zinc, vitamins C and D were higher in consumers of GUM. These differences in nutrient intakes are largely attributable to the differences in composition between GUM and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> For both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of carbohydrate and fat were generally in line with recommendations while intakes of protein, dietary fibre and most micronutrients were adequate.

40|$|For {{dairy cattle}} on pasture in {{temperate}} regions, {{it is largely}} unknown to what degree hot summer conditions impact energy metabolism, milk yield and milk composition and how effective shade is in reducing these negative effects. During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80 % reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for <b>S</b> <b>cows</b> than for NS cows (by 0. 02 degrees C and 0. 03 degrees C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl-), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for <b>S</b> <b>cows.</b> The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between <b>S</b> and NS <b>cows.</b> For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For <b>S</b> <b>cows,</b> the <b>milk</b> yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on milk protein content was remediated by shade.

The changes of immune responses found in <b>cows</b> with <b>S.</b> aureus mastitis appear to be influenced by the severity and duration of inflammation in infected quarters. The down-regulation of the leukocyte functions found in <b>cows</b> with <b>S.</b> aureus mastitis appears {{to be associated with the}} progress of the chronic stage of S. aureus mastitis...|$|R
40|$|Marsupial {{neonates}} {{are born}} without a fully functioning immune system, and {{are known to}} be protected in part by natural antimicrobial peptides present in their mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> Monotreme neonates hatch at a similar stage in development, and it has been hypothesised that their survival in a non-sterile burrow also relies on the presence of natural antibiotics in their mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> Here we review the field of monotreme lactation and the antimicrobial peptide complement of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Using reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction of milk cell RNA from a sample of platypus milk, we found no evidence for the expression of cathelicidins or defensins in the milk. This was unexpected. We hypothesise that these natural antibiotics may instead be produced by the young platypuses themselves. <br /...|$|R
