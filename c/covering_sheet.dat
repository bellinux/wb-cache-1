60|$|It {{was only}} a few months since Ernest had, with vast toil and forethought, spun slowly out his maiden {{newspaper}} article on the Italian organ-boy, and now he found himself, to his own immense surprise, <b>covering</b> <b>sheet</b> after sheet of paper in feverish haste with a long account of Max Schurz's splendid life and labours, and with a really fervid and eloquent appeal to the English people not to suffer such a man as he to go helplessly and hopelessly to an English prison, at the bare bidding of a foreign despot. He never stopped for one moment to take thought, or to correct what he had written; in the excitement of the moment his pen travelled along over the paper as if inspired, and he found the words and thoughts thronging his brain almost faster than his lagging hand could suffice to give them visible embodiment. As each page was thrown off hurriedly, he sent it down, still pale and wet, to the printers in the office; and before two o'clock in the morning, he had full proofs of all he had written sent up to him for final correction. It was a stirring and vigorous leader, he felt quite certain himself as he read it over; and he thought with a swelling breast that it would appear next day, with all the impersonal authority of the 'Morning Intelligence' stamped upon its face, at ten thousand English breakfast tables, where it might rouse the people in their millions to protest sternly before it was too late against this horrid violation of our cherished and boasted national hospitality.|$|E

40|$|Greenhouse plastic {{films are}} {{subjected}} to degradation due to their exposure to solar radiation and to chemical products used during cultivation. For polyolephinic materials, mainly low density polyethylene, ethylene–butyl acrylate copolymers and ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers, {{this results in a}} service life which ranges from some months up to 3 – 4 years relative to the thickness of the film and to the degree of stabilisation. Ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymer films show much longer service life, because of the intrinsic UV stability of the polymer without the need of any UV stabilizer and because of the low chemical reactivity vs. the commonly used agrochemicals. A simple model was developed in order to compare ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymer and polyolephinic films in terms of waste generation {{at the end of their}} service life. The quantity of waste generated during a period of 15 years by the replacement of the <b>covering</b> <b>sheets</b> for 1 ha of greenhouses was estimated according to the class of duration of the plastic films, in a climatic situation corresponding to Southern Italy. Field and laboratory tests were carried out on ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymers and ethylene–vinyl acetate films in order to assess the film lifetime in real conditions, evaluating the effects of solar radiation and of the agrochemicals in terms of loss of tensile properties and of quantity of contaminants accumulated by the films. The results suggested that the use of ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymer films as <b>covering</b> <b>sheets</b> of greenhouses can reduce the waste of plastic materials in a range from 5 to 10 times, with the further advantage of a significant recovery value for the used sheets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{represents}} {{the first public}} exhibition of Thermadapt™ building coverings which were invented more than eight years ago. The paper starts with {{a brief overview of}} the field of adaptive materials and their applications in various industries. Thermally adaptive building <b>covering</b> <b>sheet</b> fundamentals are explained by laying out the basic structural mechanics of thermally induced gross shape changes in lamina. As a truncated paper, the driving theory, coupon, test chamber and subscale building data could not be included due to length constraints, but will be delivered during oral presentation. Nonetheless, data from outdoor range testing on three independent buildings is presented. These three buildings measuring 1. 8 m (6 ft) deep x 2. 4 m (8 ft) wide x 2. 1 m (7 ft) high showed excellent results. The first was outfitted with Thermadapt™ siding and roofing. The second was outfitted with a variety of different amounts of insulation. The third was used as a control. The configuration of the full-scale test range buildings is shown along with performance data in all midwestern seasons. The data demonstrated that thin thermally adaptive building coverings are as effective as 27 cm (10. 5 ”) of fiberglass insulation, indicating an equivalent R-value of more than 40 /cm (100 /in). The paper concludes with an overview of the economics of Thermadapt™ building coverings and the intellectual property landscape...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{characteristics}} of a patient support interface can influence the susceptibility of subjects, particularly there who are immobilised and insensate, to pressure ulcer development. Accordingly, externally powered alternating pressure air mattresses (APAM) are utilised to produce intermittent pressure relief {{and control of the}} interface microclimate. These conditions will permit adequate blood and lymph flow within the soft tissues and favourable conditions at the loaded skin surface and thus minimise the risk of ulcer formation. Two sets of measurements were performed. Tissue viability was estimated, from a measure of transcutaneous gas tensions and sweat content, from healthy volunteers subjected to various alternating pressure regimens. The latter was achieved by two different strategies a) a customâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 made controller which imposes the pressure profile on the subject and b) a prototype APAMs incorporating a novel sensor, which adjusts the profile according to individual subject characteristics. The latter prototype was placed on an articulated hospital bed, with an adjustable Head of Bed (HOB) angle. The second set of measurements involved monitoring the microclimate, namely temperature and humidity, at the interface loaded with a human analogue model supported on an APAM system. The interface was saturated with moisture to simulate sweating. The human studies, involving healthy subjects with BMI values ranging from 18. 9 to 42. 5 kg/m 2, revealed significant differences in soft tissue response under various support surface profile by both strategies. In many cases, the TcPO 2 levels either remained fairly stable during the loaded period or fluctuated at a periodicity equivalent to the cycle period of the APAM system, with the corresponding TcPCO 2 levels remaining within the normal basal range. These findings were associated with II maximum interface pressures generally not exceeding 50 mmHg (6. 67 kPa). By contrast in some cases, there was a significant compromise to the TcPO 2 levels during the loaded period, which was often associated with an increase in TcPCO 2 levels. These cases generally corresponded with the internal pressures in the mattress prescribed at a maximum amplitude of 100 / 0 mmHg or when the Head of Bed angle was raised to 45 Âº or above. Changes in prototype <b>covering</b> <b>sheet</b> and air flow rates of the APAM system were found to influence both interface temperature and humidity. These results revealed enhanced levels of humidity often reaching 100...|$|E

40|$|We link {{covering}} spaces {{with the}} theory of functions of bounded variation, in order to study minimal networks in the plane and Plateau's problem without fixing a priori the topology of solutions. We solve the minimization problem {{in the class of}} (possibly vector-valued) BV functions defined on a covering space of the complement of an (n - 2) -dimensional compact embedded Lipschitz manifold S without boundary. This approach has several similarities with Brakke's "soap films" covering construction. The main novelty of our method stands {{in the presence of a}} suitable constraint on the fibers, which couples together the <b>covering</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the case of networks, the constraint is defined using a suitable subset of transpositions of m elements, m being the number of points of S.

40|$|Superhydrophobicity, superfluidity, superlubricity, and supersolidity (4 S) at the nanometer-sized liquid-solid or solid-solid {{contacting}} interfaces {{have long}} been issues of puzzling with the common characteristics of nonsticky and frictionless motion. Although the 4 S occurrences have been extensively investigated, the mechanism behind the common characteristics remains unclear. From the perspectives of broken-bond-induced local strain and the skin-depth charge and energy quantum trapping and the associated nonbonding electron polarization, we proposed herewith that the Coulomb repulsion between the “electric monopoles or dipoles locked in the elastic solid skins or the solidlike <b>covering</b> <b>sheets</b> of liquid droplets ” forms {{the key to the}} 4 S. The localized energy densification makes the skin stiffer and the densely and tightly trapped bonding charges polarize nonbonding electrons, if exist, to form locked skin monopoles. In addition, the sp-orbit hybridization of F, O, N, or C upon reacting with solid atoms generates nonbonding lone pairs or unpaired edge electrons that induce dipoles directing into the open end of a surface. The monopoles and dipoles can be, however, demolished by UV radiation, thermal excitation, or excessively applied compression due to ionization or s...|$|R

30|$|The {{original}} field soil showed the most diversified population, while BSD- or CP-treatment reduced the diversity possibly {{due to the}} proliferation, elimination or dormancy of some restricted bacterial groups. However, bacterial communities had almost recovered to the {{original field}} condition after cultivation of spinach in the control and BSD-treated soils but not the CP-treated soil. As the BSD-treated soil was exposed to aerobic conditions by removing the <b>covering</b> <b>sheets</b> and plowing well in preparation for crop cultivation, the diverse aerobic bacteria might start to grow again. Also, the recovered bacterial groups might have special physiology to become re-activated in nature even after the treatment. For example, P. taiwanensis, designated as an aerobic bacterium {{closely related to the}} Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Methylobacterium species (the class Alphaproteobacteria) and closely related to major clone groups in the Pre-treatment soil library, might have universal distribution in soil and be able to survive the extreme treatment conditions (Kämpfer et al. 2006) and be able to recover after the treatment. Furthermore, the Bacteroidetes groups especially those related to the Flavisolibacter and Chitinophaga species are widely distributed in aerobic and anaerobic environments (Reichenbach and Dworkin 1991) and therefore could survive in BSD and recover again during crop cultivation.|$|R
