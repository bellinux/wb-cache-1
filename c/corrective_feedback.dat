25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence is all the more impressive when one considers that most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of empirical support for a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of virtual}} {{feedback}} {{has been seen}} scattered throughout history for quite some time. However, though the feedback was virtual, the performances were not widely virtual until the 1990s. With the early-stage experimentation, not many positive results were found causing some doubt of the systems. Some even found that too much virtual feedback increased poor performance outside of the controlled environment. As virtual reality systems and virtual environments became more accessible and affordable, though, so too did the implementations of and research on them. The use of these systems in positive motor skill development began somewhere in the late 1990s as more researchers realized the benefit of internal, <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in such environments. Additionally, at the same time, researchers across the world began experimenting with the effect of virtual reality in therapeutic measures for anxiety disorder and phobias. With positive results, such as better motor control and lower anxiety in relation to phobias, coming from these experiments, researchers began looking into virtual reality systems {{as a form of}} rehabilitation in the early 2000s, and the research has expanded since. Now, common gaming consoles such as the Wii and Kinect allow researchers to use cheaper, more readily available systems in their labs, as well, opening up new possibilities for games and rehabilitation options. Case studies and use of systems in actual therapy offices have suggested that this field has the potential to impact therapy outside the lab setting, as well, making it a rapidly growing field of interest. Currently, several reviews of the findings have also suggested positive effects of this form of rehabilitation, garnering support for this field as well.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of the Written <b>Corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>Feedback</b> in Improving Students’ Writing. The research was conducted to see if the Metalinguistic feedback is more effective for the High English Proficiency students or the Low English Proficiency students. The study was on controlled marking. Therefore, the study only focused on correcting students’ usage of the Simple Past Tense. The research problems were 1) How effective was the written <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>Feedback</b> among Low English Proficiency students? 2) How effective was the written <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> among the High English Proficiency students? 3) The correlation between students opinion of the metalinguistic feedback and their improvement in writing. Pre-Test, Post Test 1 and Post Test 2 were carried out among 30 High English proficiency students and 30 Low English Proficiency students. T-Test was carried out to see effectiveness in the metalinguistic feedback. For the third research objective, Pearson Correlation test was carried out to see the correlation between students’ opinion of the written <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> and their improvement in writing. The result of the study seem to show that the Low English Proficiency students seem to benefit more from the written <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> and they are more keen to see metalinguistic feedback as compared to the High English proficiency group. It is hoped that with teachers support more students would appreciate this technique of marking. Besides, more students can benefit from this technique of marking with integration of grammar and vocabulary lessons...|$|R

2500|$|Research has {{indicated}} that many traditional language-teaching techniques are extremely inefficient. One issue is the effectiveness of explicit teaching: can language teaching have a constructive effect beyond providing learners with enhanced input? [...] Research on this {{at different levels of}} language has produced quite different results. [...] Traditional areas of explicit teaching, such as phonology, grammar and vocabulary, have had decidedly mixed results. It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency. [...] Rather, to become proficient in the L2, the learner must be given opportunities to use the L2 for communicative purposes, learning (as for example, through a teacher's <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback)</b> to attend to both meaning and formal accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Organizational dissent is the [...] "expression of {{disagreement}} or contradictory opinions about organizational practices and policies". Since dissent involves disagreement {{it can lead}} to conflict, which if not resolved, can lead to violence and struggle. As a result, many organizations send the message – verbally or nonverbally – that dissent is discouraged. However, recent studies have shown that dissent serves as an important monitoring force within organizations. Dissent can be a warning sign for employee dissatisfaction or organizational decline. Redding (1985) found that receptiveness to dissent allows for <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> to monitor unethical and immoral behavior, impractical and ineffectual organizational practices and polices, poor and unfavorable decision making, and insensitivity to employees' [...] needs and desires. Furthermore, Eilerman argues that the hidden costs of silencing dissent include: wasted and lost time, reduced decision quality, emotional and relationship costs, and decreased job motivation. Perlow (2003) found that employee resentment can lead to a decrease in productivity and creativity which can result in the organization losing money, time, and resources.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine both students’ and teachers’ perception pertaining to the various methods which are used by the teachers when dealing with students’ written errors. Hence, it was found that the three common methods of error correcting preferred by teachers are underlining, giving comments and using symbols or marking codes which are mostly “indirect feedback”. In contrast, the students tend to favor “direct feedback” especially personal consultation for their error treatment. Thus, there exists a gap and mismatch pertaining to both teachers’ and students’ preferences and needs of error correcting. This gap and mismatch in perceptions and needs should be addressed by all the relevant parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the method(s) used. Therefore, it is important to note that, teachers play an important role in selecting and providing appropriate <b>corrective</b> <b>feedbacks</b> as this indirectly will influence students’ written performance.

Within a simulated robot motion control domain, we validate that a policy for an undemonstrated task is successfully built from motion primitives learned from demonstration under our approach. We show feedback to both aid and enable policy development, improving policy performance in success, speed and efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Computationally {{efficient}} task execution is {{very important}} for autonomous mobile robots endowed with limited on-board computational resources. Most robot control approaches assume a fixed state and action representation, and use a single algorithm to map states to actions. However, not all situations in a given task require equally complex algorithms and equally detailed state and action representations. The main motivation for this work is a desire to reduce the computational footprint of performing a task by allowing the robot to run simpler algorithms whenever possible, and resort to a more complex algorithm only when needed. We contribute the Multi-Resolution Task Execution (MRTE) algorithm that utilizes human feedback to learn a mapping from a given state to an appropriate detail resolution consisting of a state and action representation, and an algorithm providing a mapping from states to actions at that resolution. The robot learns a policy from human demonstration to switch between different detail resolutions as needed while favoring lower detail resolutions to reduce computational cost of task execution. We then present the Model Plus Correction (M+C) algorithm to improve the performance of an algorithm using <b>corrective</b> human <b>feedback</b> without modifying the algorithm itself.
