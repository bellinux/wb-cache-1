5|$|Cray {{had always}} {{attacked}} {{the problem of}} increased speed with three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components {{to allow for a}} higher <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b> Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components that were already in widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, Qualcomm {{announced}} a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 instruction set, but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named Asynchronous Symmetrical Multi-Processing (aSMP), meaning each processor core adjusted its <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Titan used Jaguar's 10 PB of Lustre storage with a {{transfer}} speed of 240 GB/s, but in April 2013, the storage was upgraded to 40 PB with {{a transfer}} rate of 1.4 TB/s. GPUs {{were selected for}} their vastly higher parallel processing efficiency over CPUs. Although the GPUs have a slower <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> than the CPUs, each GPU contains 2,688 CUDA cores at 732 MHz, resulting in a faster overall system. Consequently, the CPUs' cores are used to allocate tasks to the GPUs rather than directly processing the data as in conventional supercomputers.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} resonator can be {{used with}} the X1 parts for from 4 MHz to 20 MHz <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> and with the X2 parts for 16 MHz to 64 MHz <b>clock</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|CPUs using CMOS were {{released}} from 1986 (e.g. 12 MHz Intel 80386). As CMOS transistor dimensions were shrunk the <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> also increased. Since about 2004 CMOS CPU <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> have leveled off at about 3.5 GHz.|$|R
25|$|Future rollouts under Rubinstein's {{management}} {{included all}} subsequent upgrades (the G4 and G5) of the Power Mac series. While they were technically powerful computers, the Power Mac series {{suffered from the}} perception that they were slower than their Intel-based counterparts because their PowerPC CPUs listed slower <b>clock</b> <b>speeds.</b> Rubinstein and Apple popularised a term known as the Megahertz myth, to describe how the PowerPC architecture could not {{be compared to the}} Intel architecture simply on their <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> (the PowerPC CPUs, despite their lower <b>clock</b> <b>speeds,</b> were generally comparable to Intel CPUs of the era).|$|R
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E

25|$|The 6809 had an {{internal}} two-phase clock generator (needing only an external crystal) whereas the 6809E needed an external clock generator. There were also variants {{such as the}} 68A09(E) and 68B09(E); the internal letter indicates the processor's rated <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the highest}} (turbo) preset the SDRAM clock was {{originally}} 500MHz, {{but this was}} later changed to 600MHz because 500MHz sometimes causes SD card corruption. Simultaneously in high mode the core <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> was lowered from 450 to 250MHz, and in medium mode from 333 to 250MHz.|$|E
25|$|The {{announcement}} of Apple's intention {{to switch to}} Intel-based Macs caused concern because Rosetta, the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a G3 at only 60-80% of a similarly powered CPU's <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b> Apart from this, Classic, the Mac OS 9 virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.|$|E

25|$|The chips {{were also}} liked for their undervolting ability. Undervolting {{is a process}} of {{determining}} the lowest voltage at which a CPU can remain stable at a given <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b> As Athlon XP-M CPUs were already rated running lower voltages than their desktop siblings, it was a better starting point for lowering voltage even further. A popular application was use in home theater PC systems due to high performance and low heat output resultant from low Vcore settings.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, Jobs had {{introduced}} Macs {{based on the}} PowerPC G5 processor and promised that within a year, the <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> of the part {{would be up to}} 3 GHz. Two years later, 3GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the POWER4-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a laptop computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the personal computer industry.|$|E
25|$|The higher speed {{rates are}} {{achieved}} {{by using a}} two-lane low voltage (0.4V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156MB/s. In full duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b> In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI).|$|E
50|$|The replay system {{came about}} {{as a result of}} Intel's quest for {{ever-increasing}} <b>clock</b> <b>speeds.</b> These higher <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> necessitated very lengthy pipelines (up to 31 stages in the Prescott core). Because of this, there are six stages between the scheduler and the execution units in the Prescott core. In an attempt to maintain acceptable performance, Intel engineers had to design the scheduler to be very optimistic.|$|R
50|$|Pentium 4 {{is a line}} of {{single-core}} {{central processing}} units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since {{the introduction of the}} P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high <b>clock</b> <b>speeds.</b> Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU <b>clock</b> <b>speeds</b> to a much lower 3.8 GHz.|$|R

25|$|That {{distinction}} {{goes to the}} Harwell CADET of 1955, {{built by}} the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The design featured a 64-kilobyte magnetic drum memory store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. By 1953 this team had transistor circuits operating {{to read and write}} on a smaller magnetic drum from the Royal Radar Establishment. The machine used a low <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> of only 58kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms.|$|E
25|$|The 68HC000, {{the first}} CMOS {{version of the}} 68000, was {{designed}} by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985. Motorola's version was called the MC68HC000, while Hitachi's was the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 was eventually offered at speeds of 8–20MHz. Except for using CMOS circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS MC68000, but the change to CMOS greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS MC68000 consumed around 1.35watts at an ambient temperature of 25°C, regardless of <b>clock</b> <b>speed,</b> while the MC68HC000 consumed only 0.13watts at 8MHz and 0.38watts at 20MHz. (Unlike CMOS circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with clock rate.) Apple selected the 68HC000 {{for use in the}} Macintosh Portable.|$|E
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature it is unrealistic to simply scale this number by processor <b>clock</b> <b>speed.</b> The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E

25|$|Palomino was {{the first}} K7 core to include the full SSE {{instruction}} set from the Intel Pentium III, as well as AMD's 3DNow! Professional. It is roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird at the same <b>clock</b> <b>speed,</b> {{thanks in part to}} the new SIMD functionality and to several additional improvements. The core has enhancements to the K7's TLB architecture and added a hardware data prefetch mechanism to take better advantage of available memory bandwidth. Palomino was also the first socketed Athlon officially supporting dual processing, with chips certified for that purpose branded as the Athlon MP. According to articles posted on HardwareZone, it was possible to mod the Athlon XP to function as an MP by connecting some fuses on the OPGA, although results varied with the motherboard used.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{increase of}} the 80286 over the 8086 (or 8088) could be more than 100% per clock cycle in many programs (i.e. a doubled performance at the same <b>clock</b> <b>speed).</b> This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements around a decade later when the i486 (1989) or the original Pentium (1993) were introduced. This was {{partly due to the}} non-multiplexed address and data buses, but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as base+index) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do effective address computation using its general ALU, consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex microcoded numerical operations such as MUL/DIV than its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory <b>clock</b> <b>speed</b> (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E
