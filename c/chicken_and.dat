40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown that the H 7 N 9 avian {{influenza}} virus cannot be transmitted efficiently between ferrets via respiratory droplets. Here, we studied the infectivity of the H 7 N 9 avian influenza virus in <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> its transmissibility from infected to naïve <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ferrets. The H 7 N 9 virus (A/Anhui/ 1 / 2013) replicated poorly in <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> could not be transmitted efficiently from infected chickens to naïve <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ferrets. H 7 N 9 virus was shed from chicken tracheae for only 2 days after infection <b>and</b> from <b>chicken</b> cloacae for only 1 day after infection, while the H 9 N 2 avian influenza virus, which is endemic in chickens in many Asian countries, was shed from tracheae and cloacae for 8 days after infection. Taken together, our results suggest that chickens may be a poor agent of transmission for the H 7 N 9 virus to other <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> to mammals, including humans...|$|R

The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake.

5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried food that {{generally}} consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
40|$|AbstractChickens are {{susceptible}} to the highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 strain of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), whereas ducks are not. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyse the microRNA expression in the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of H 5 N 1 -HPAIV-infected <b>and</b> non-infected <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ducks. We annotated the genomic positions of duck microRNAs and we compared the microRNA repertoires of <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ducks. Our {{results showed that the}} microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ducks diverge substantially. Moreover, there was larger divergence between the microRNA expression patterns in immune organs of HPAIV-infected chickens than HPAIV-infected ducks. Together, our results might help to elucidate the roles of microRNAs in the divergent immunity of <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> ducks against H 5 N 1 HPAIV...|$|R

5|$|The dish {{has created}} {{a large number of}} {{spin-off}} recipes which are commonly used around the world. For example, Korean fried chicken, a dish which is commonly served as fast food in Korea and is known for being crispier than normal fried chicken. There is also a racial stereotype surrounding fried <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> African-American people, mostly because it was popular among slaves in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E

5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK <b>Chicken</b> <b>and</b> Chicken Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.|$|E

5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> chitlins.|$|E
5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised <b>chicken</b> <b>and</b> pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials were used to construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E
