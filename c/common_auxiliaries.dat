We discuss the requirements of runtime models to enable the use of model-driven tools, and present our tool to help provide such runtime models on the target systems. We apply this tool {{on a wide range of}} target systems, modeling the Android mobile system, the Eclipse GUI, the Java class structure, and the JOnAS inner structure. With the help of these runtime models, we perform the runtime management on these systems using classical MDE tools including OCL, QVT, and GMF. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{new methods}} are {{proposed}} for the simple and sensitive spectrophotometric determination of chloramphenicol in pure form and in related pharmaceutical preparations. Two methods {{are based on the}} diazotization of reduced chloramphenicol, followed by coupling either with iminodibenzyl to give a violet colored product (λmax = 590 nm) or with 3 -aminophenol to produce an orange-red colored product (λmax = 470 nm). The third method makes use of sodium molybdate and pyrocatechol as coupling agents to give a pale red colored product (λmax = 490 nm). The proposed procedures are highly reproducible and the maximum relative standard deviation is 0. 3 % for five determinations. The new methods have been applied to the determination of chloramphenicol in capsules and injection solutions, and the results compare favorably with the official method. <b>Common</b> <b>auxiliary</b> substances used as components of pharmaceutical preparations do not interfere with the proposed methods.

5000|$|<b>Common</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> are aspect-free {{concepts}} {{that can be}} used in combination with any other UDC code from the main classes or with other <b>common</b> <b>auxiliaries.</b> They have unique notational representations that makes them stand out in complex expressions. Common auxiliary numbers always begin with a certain symbol known as a facet indicator, e.g. [...] (equal sign) always introduces concepts representing the language of a document; (0...) numbers enclosed in parentheses starting with zero always represent a concept designating document form. Thus (075) Textbook and =111 English can be combined to express, e.g.(075)=111 Textbooks in English, and when combined with numbers from the main UDC tables they can be used as follows: 2(075)=111 Religion textbooks in English, 51(075)=111 Mathematics textbooks in English etc.|$|E

5000|$|Longtime {{classical}} music practice has expected the non-principal {{player in a}} section to double the <b>common</b> <b>auxiliary</b> instrument (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including Hollywood film scores and—most notably—Broadway musicals, the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double—but hiring four or five proficient [...] "reed doublers" [...] is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; {{one of the most}} notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for West Side Story (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor & baritone saxophones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} that {{simultaneous}} nonunique decoding is rate-optimal {{for the general}} K-sender, L-receiver discrete memoryless interference channel when encoding is restricted to randomly generated codebooks, superposition coding, and time sharing. This result implies that the Han–Kobayashi inner bound for the two-user-pair interference channel cannot be improved simply by using a better decoder such as the maximum likelihood decoder. It also generalizes and extends previous results by Baccelli, El Gamal, and Tse on Gaussian interference channels with point-to-point Gaussian random codebooks and shows that the Cover–van der Meulen inner bound with no <b>common</b> <b>auxiliary</b> random variable on the capacity region of the broadcast channel can be improved to include the superposition coding inner bound simply by using simultaneous nonunique decoding.
