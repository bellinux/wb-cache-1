5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find <b>credible</b> <b>evidence</b> of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter. Wagner {{died of a}} heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend that the attack was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without <b>credible</b> <b>evidence.</b> After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any <b>credible</b> <b>evidence.</b> A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. <b>Credible,</b> <b>evidence</b> based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E
5|$|In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer, {{having read}} that young women were now disappearing in towns {{surrounding}} Salt Lake City, called King County police a second time. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify {{him from a}} photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, {{but at that time}} no <b>credible</b> <b>evidence</b> linked him to the Utah crimes. In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.|$|E
5|$|S. Paranavitana {{offered a}} novel surmise {{explaining}} {{the origins of}} the Ariyacakravarti. According to him the Aryacakravarti are descendants of Chandrabhanu a Malay chieftain, who invaded the island from Tambralinga in 1247. According to him refugees and immigrants from the Indian kingdom of Kalinga founded similarly named Kingdoms in South East Asia, and some of them came due to various reasons to north Sri Lanka and founded the Jaffna Kingdom. This view has been refuted by noted Indian historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastry as having no <b>credible</b> <b>evidence,</b> and other historians such as Louis Charles Damais (1911–66), an expert on Indonesian studies, Yutaka Iwamoto (1910–88), a Buddhist scholar, and S. Pathmanathan. They assert that there were no kingdoms in South East Asia called Kalinga and such assertions are based on erroneous readings of the Chinese name for a locality called Ho-ling which actually stood for Walain not Kalinga. Further S. Pathmanathan asserts that Chandrabhanu had categorically claimed Padmavamsa lineage whereas S. Paranavitana had adduced a Gangavamsa lineage to the Aryacakravarti. Further he notes that the inscriptions that S. Paranavitana used to make his theory have not been deciphered by any other scholar to imply a Javaka connection to the Aryacakravartis.|$|E
