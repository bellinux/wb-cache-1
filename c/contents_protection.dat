Among these problems, multimedia data tend to increase in the distributed network environment. Hence, most image information has been transmitted {{in the form of}} digitalization. Therefore, the need for multimedia <b>contents</b> <b>protection</b> must be addressed. This paper is focused on possible solutions for multimedia contents security in the public network in order to prevent data modification by non-owners and to ensure safe communication in the distributed network environment. Accordingly, the Orthogonal Forward Wavelet Transform-based Scalable Digital Watermarking technique is proposed in this paper...|$|E

A <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> network is {{claimed to be a}} technology that protects websites from unwanted web scraping, web harvesting, blog scraping, data harvesting, and other forms of access to data published through the world wide web. A good <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> network will use various algorithms, checks, and validations to distinguish between desirable search engine web crawlers and human beings on the one hand, and Internet bots and automated agents that perform unwanted access on the other hand.|$|R

5000|$|The {{second and}} third {{questions}} are empirical matters. An earlier draft of the BPDG Compliance and Robustness Rules divided Table A into Authorized Digital Outputs and Authorized Digital Removable Media Recording Methods. The two Authorized Outputs mentioned were Digital Transmission <b>Content</b> <b>Protection</b> (DTCP) and High-bandwidth Digital <b>Content</b> <b>Protection</b> (HDCP); the two Recording Methods mentioned were <b>Content</b> <b>Protection</b> for Recordable Media (CPRM) and D-VHS.|$|R

40|$|In a {{model that}} allows smooth {{substitution}} between domestic and imported inputs, <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> distorts inout choice but does not force a divergence between price and unit production cost. <b>Content</b> <b>protection</b> biases gains intechnical efficiency away from those saving domestic input and toward those saving imported input. By increasing derived demand for the domestic input,a marginally effective content requirement benefits suppliers of this input. Increases in the content requirement above the marginally effective level increase such benefits to suppliers of the domestic input provided that the price elasticity of demand for the final product {{is less than a}} critical value. The consequences of <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> are not materially affected by monopoly in the domestic final product market or monopsony in the domestic input market unless such monopoly or monopsony are created by <b>content</b> <b>protection.</b> The situation of a monopolistic supplier of the domestic input is enhanced by <b>content</b> <b>protection.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest, by content creators and owners, in <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> systems {{that provide the}} ability to control or restrict the content that can be shared on peer-to-peer file sharing systems. At the same time, there is much debate that argues that <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> in peer-to-peer systems will unfairly restrict the users' ability to share content. We explore the issue of <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> in peer-to-peer systems. We examine the benefits that it would provide to many parties including peer-to-peer network operators, individual and institutional content providers, and ultimately end-users. We then examine the challenges involved [...] the often conflicting goals of content providers and users. We explore how a <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> system can maintain the features that interest end-users such as an open peer-to-peer sharing experience, privacy, and flexible business models. We outline the design objectives of such a protection system. We discuss how previous attempts at <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> in peer-topeer systems only supported basic business models and show how protection systems can provide the flexibility necessary to support common content distribution business models. We explain the design space and examine proposed systems for centralized and decentralized <b>content</b> <b>protection</b> systems...|$|R
