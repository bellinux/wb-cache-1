5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E

Most mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> endowed with humanistic mentalities, ability to converse with humans and also supernatural powers.During the 20th century, the role and diversity of Burmese mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>were</b> diversified by Shwe Thway comics which depicted {{the life of the}} Buddha, the Jataka tales and Burmese history.|$|R
50|$|Fierce <b>Creatures</b> <b>is</b> a 1997 farcical comedy film. While not {{literally}} a sequel, Fierce <b>Creatures</b> <b>is</b> a spiritual {{successor to the}} 1988 film A Fish Called Wanda.

50|$|The enemy creatures {{appear in}} one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> longer in length than the player, and as such a {{collision}} with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player's creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments <b>are</b> removed, the <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate.|$|R
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in {{what appears to be}} a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of someone who has been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> feeding off their fear.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the mammoth as an {{underground}} <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> known to the Chinese, who received some mammoth ivory from the Siberian natives; accordingly, the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> known in China as yǐn shǔ 隐鼠, [...] "the hidden rodent".|$|R
50|$|Nightmare <b>Creatures</b> <b>is</b> a {{survival}} horror video game released for the PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo 64.

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> never {{mentioned}} in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} the creature based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the creature was then loaded, and interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the <b>creature</b> <b>is.</b> As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} the animal control team deaths, Charlie is {{attacked by the}} creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{catch up}} with the truck, and while {{pursuing}} it encounter strange weather. The truck stalls, but when they head inside it they find both Druce and the E.B.E. have vanished. When they investigate the truck and the area, Mulder concludes that the encounter was a constructed hoax, intended to convince the duo to cease further pursuit. With help from MUFON and NICAP, Mulder tracks Druce and the E.B.E. to a power plant in Mattawa, Washington. With assistance from the Lone Gunmen, the agents are able to enter the plant with fake identification. Their unfamiliarity soon gives them away, but Mulder flees from the guards through a restricted area and is about to approach the room where the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> held when armed guards stop him.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E
5|$|Partway {{through the}} series, the show's unseen camera {{operator}} and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where {{his body is}} left partially preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> startled by light and escapes the lab, running into the woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are trying to locate the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her {{to make him a}} friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her. The creature returns to her makeshift lab and kills Lavenza in anger after he tries to stop it from hurting Frankenstein.|$|E

5|$|The Chocobo {{series is}} a {{collection}} of video games published by Square, and later by Square Enix, featuring a recurring creature from the Final Fantasy series, the Chocobo, as the protagonist. The <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> a large and normally flightless bird which first appeared in Final Fantasy II and has been featured in almost all subsequent Final Fantasy games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. The Chocobo series of video games contains over 20 titles for video game consoles, mobile phones, and online platforms. These games include installments of the Mystery Dungeon series of roguelike video games, racing games, adventure games, and minigame collections. Although the various games of the series have different game styles and are generally unrelated except by their inclusion of a Chocobo as the main character, Square Enix considers them to be a distinct series.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins on}} an island as a new god, created from a family's prayers. After saving their {{drowning}} son, the god follows the grateful family to their village. A large <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> later discovered who tells of its former master, a god named Nemesis, who desires to reign supreme as the one true god by destroying all others. The player is told of the Creed; an energy source {{with the ability to}} destroy gods. Nemesis destroys his former creature and attacks the village. A mysterious vortex opens that the player enters to escape Nemesis. The player is transported to a second island and greeted by another god, Khazar. Khazar reveals that it was he who sent the vortex and requests assistance against another god, Lethys, Nemesis' underling, in exchange for resources to rebuild the village.|$|E
5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the initial}} {{clusters}} of sightings during the 1970s, {{there have been}} sporadic reports of the creature. In 1991 the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> reportedly seen jumping from a bridge.

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been trying to sell off Sevastopol for years, has finally found a buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E
5|$|The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The {{first game}} follows {{the journey of}} the {{teenager}} Tidus who is transported {{to the world of}} Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the <b>creature</b> <b>is</b> linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers. Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve. The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus. It reintroduces the series' classic job system {{in the form of the}} Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle. X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.|$|E
50|$|Dream <b>Creatures</b> <b>are</b> <b>creatures</b> that {{inhabit the}} Moonlands and {{originate}} from the Dream Plane. A Magi who gains {{the trust of}} a Dream Creature or defeats it in battle gains an Animite crystal. This Animite {{can be used to}} summon that Dream Creature back from the Dream Plane when needed by using some of a Magi's energy. A Dream <b>Creature</b> that <b>is</b> defeated simply returns to the Dream Plane and can be summoned again if the Magi has sufficient energy. Within the Dream Plane, even corrupted Core <b>Creatures</b> <b>are</b> temporarily purified to their natural states.|$|R
5000|$|The cactus cat was {{generally}} described being a bobcat-like creature, covered in hair-like thorns, with particularly long spines {{extending from the}} legs and its armored, branching tail. The <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> said to use its spines to slash cacti at night, allowing juice to run from the plants. On later nights, the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> said to return to drink the now fermented juice. The then-drunken <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> said to shriek throughout the night. The cactus cat was a very hostile creature towards any animal invading their territory. Animals that crossed them often ended up with large puncture wounds, and sometimes fatal injuries.|$|R
