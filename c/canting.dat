5|$|Rouffaer {{reported}} that the gringsing pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri, East Java. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the <b>canting,</b> an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax, and proposed that the <b>canting</b> was invented in Java around that time. The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese Prajnaparamita statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese jlamprang or ceplok batik motif. The motif is thought to represent the lotus, a sacred flower in Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the <b>canting</b> existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.|$|E
5|$|The most {{traditional}} type of batik, called batik tulis (written batik), is drawn using only the <b>canting.</b> The cloth {{needs to be}} drawn on both sides, and dipped in a dye bath three to four times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.|$|E
5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a <b>canting</b> symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{trains are}} not running on {{equilibrium}} <b>cants</b> at curves. The situation is called unbalance, {{which can be}} {{in one of the}} two following ways. For a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> is less than the equilibrium <b>cant,</b> the amount of <b>cant</b> difference is called <b>cant</b> deficiency. In the other word, it is the amount of missing <b>cant</b> to achieve the balance. On the contrary, for a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> is higher than the equilibrium <b>cant,</b> the amount of over <b>cant</b> from the balance is called <b>cant</b> excess.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cant</b> {{gradient}} is {{the amount}} by which <b>cant</b> is increased or decreased in a given length of track. The change in <b>cant</b> is {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no <b>cant)</b> to a curved track (with <b>cant)</b> through a transition curve. The rate of change of <b>cant</b> is used to determine the suitable <b>cant</b> gradient for a given design speed. Track twist may also be used to describe <b>cant</b> gradient which may be expressed in percentage of <b>cant</b> change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context of <b>cant</b> gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the <b>canting</b> to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} {{the arms of the}} Stewarts. The basic Stewart coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The buckles used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the <b>canting</b> arms of Alexander Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three buckles Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John Stewart (d. 1298), younger son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. Together the couple founded the 'Bonkyl' Stewart branch of the clan, and their descendants tended to use the 'Bonkyl' buckles as their heraldic differencing. One of the couple's sons, Sir Allan Stewart of Dreghorn (d. 1333), founded the Stewart of Darnley branch of the clan, which in time became the earls and dukes of Lennox.|$|E

40|$|The interannual to decadal {{variability}} in the transport of anthropogenic CO 2 (<b>Cant)</b> across the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is investigated, using summer data of the FOUREX and OVIDE high-resolution transoceanic sections, from Greenland to Portugal, occupied six times from 1997 to 2010. The transport of <b>Cant</b> across this section, T <b>cant</b> hereafter, is northward, with a mean value of 254 ± 29 kmol s − 1 over the 1997 – 2010 period. We find that T <b>cant</b> undergoes interannual variability, masking any trend different from 0 for this period. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms controlling the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA, we propose a new method that quantifies the transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the diapycnal and isopycnal circulation. The diapycnal component yields a large northward transport of <b>Cant</b> (400 ± 29 kmol s − 1) that is partially compensated by a southward transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the isopycnal component (− 171 ± 11 kmol s − 1), mainly localized in the Irminger Sea. Most importantly, the diapycnal component is found to be the main driver of the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA. Both the Meridional Overturning Circulation (computed in density coordinates, MOC σ) and the <b>Cant</b> increase in the water column have an important effect on the variability of the diapycnal component and of T <b>cant</b> itself. Based on this analysis, we propose a simplified estimator for the variability of T <b>cant</b> based on the intensity of the MOC σ and on the difference of <b>Cant</b> between the upper and lower limb of the MOC σ (ΔCant). This estimator shows a good consistency with the diapycnal component of T <b>cant,</b> and help to disentangle the effect of the variability of both the circulation and the <b>Cant</b> increase on the T <b>cant</b> variability. We find that ΔCant keeps increasing over the past decade, and it is very likely that the continuous <b>Cant</b> increase in the water masses will cause an increase in T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA at long timescale. Nevertheless, at the timescale analyzed here (1997 – 2010), the MOC σ controls the T <b>cant</b> variability, blurring any T <b>cant</b> trend. Extrapolating the observed ΔCant increase rate and considering the predicted slow-down of 25 % of the MOC σ, T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA is expected to increase by 430 kmol s − 1 during the 21 st century. Consequently, an increase in the storage rate of <b>Cant</b> in the SPNA could be envisaged...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} the calcium-activated nucleotidase 1 (<b>CANT</b> 1) transcript as up-regulated in prostate cancer. Now, we studied <b>CANT</b> 1 protein expression {{in a large}} cohort of nearly 1000 prostatic tissue samples including normal tissue, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), primary carcinomas, metastases, and castrate-resistant carcinomas, and further investigated its functional relevance. <b>CANT</b> 1 displayed predominantly a Golgi-type immunoreactivity with additional and variable cytoplasmic staining. In comparison to normal tissues, the staining intensity was significantly increased in PIN lesions and cancer. In cancer, high <b>CANT</b> 1 levels were associated with a better prognosis, and castrate-resistant carcinomas commonly showed lower <b>CANT</b> 1 levels than primary carcinomas. The functional role of <b>CANT</b> 1 was investigated using RNA interference in two prostate cancer cell lines with abundant endogenous <b>CANT</b> 1 protein. On <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown, a significantly diminished cell number and DNA synthesis rate, a cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase, and a strong decrease of cell transmigration rate and wound healing capacity of <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown cells was found. However, on forced <b>CANT</b> 1 overexpression, cell proliferation and migration remained unchanged. In summary, <b>CANT</b> 1 is commonly overexpressed {{in the vast majority}} of primary prostate carcinomas and in the precursor lesion PIN and may represent a novel prognostic biomarker. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate a functional involvement of <b>CANT</b> 1 in tumor biology...|$|R

In the case of Galicia, antiquity and the prominence which the Kingdom had had during centuries saw its inclusion in the early European armorials, however the absence of an exclusive symbol for Galician kings, who were also kings of León since the 12th century, forced to the medieval heraldists to use <b>Canting</b> arms, which was a symbol derived from the phonetics of the name.|$|E
25|$|A {{joint report}} by the Underground and its {{maintenance}} contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause, and that, because of this, extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause <b>canting</b> of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin <b>canting</b> does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E
