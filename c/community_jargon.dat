40|$|As {{semantic}} markup becomes ubiquitous, it {{will become}} important {{to be able to}} ask queries and obtain answers, using natural language (NL) expressions, rather than the keyword-based retrieval mechanisms used by the current search engines. AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input and returns answers drawn from the available semantic markup. We say that AquaLog is portable, because the configuration time required to customize the system for a particular ontology is negligible. AquaLog combines several powerful techniques in a novel way to make sense of NL queries and to map them to semantic markup. Moreover it also includes a learning component, which ensures that the performance of the system improves over time, in response to the particular <b>community</b> <b>jargon</b> used by the end users. In this paper we describe the current version of the system, in particular discussing its portability, its reasoning capabilities, and its learning mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} web vision {{is one in}} which rich, ontology-based semantic markup will become widely available. The availability of semantic markup on the web opens the way to novel, sophisticated forms of question answering. AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input, and returns answers drawn from one or more knowledge bases (KBs). We say that AquaLog is portable because the configuration time required to customize the system for a particular ontology is negligible. AquaLog presents an elegant solution in which different strategies are combined together in a novel way. It makes use of the GATE NLP platform, string metric algorithms, WordNet and a novel ontology-based relation similarity service to make sense of user queries with respect to the target KB. Moreover it also includes a learning component, which ensures that the performance of the system improves over the time, in response to the particular <b>community</b> <b>jargon</b> used by end users.

Moreover, language is thereby {{considered to be a}} concurrent part of spiritual culture of nation and assures its survival and identity. The overall culture of high school is influenced by various lingual communication of teachers and students, settled culture of public dialogue, etiquette of speech and by the peculiarities of speech in academic <b>community</b> (<b>jargon,</b> lexis of certain social professional groups etc.). The durability and quality of speech may lie with academic youth.

In the article the usage and evaluation of swear-words by the students of technical universities is analysed by means of sociolinguistic method. The variation of obscene lexis over a period of ten years is presented. Ques-tionnaires were used to estimate the differences of attitude towards swear-words. The students claim that the use of obscene lexis in public space affects the communication culture of society members. Therefore it may be concluded that the evaluation of swear-words depends not only on the views and psichological factors of a speaker but also on the attitude of society...|$|E

With the recent trends of new media development, the sources available have reached a critical mass resulting in an unprecedented information overload. The urgent challenge to all information professionals, in this case law librarians, is no longer availability and direct provision of resources, but rather the filtering and highlighting. As an example of the utilization of Web 2. 0 values, the Cornell Law Library (CLL) recently re-launched its website.

40|$|In many domains, {{a latent}} {{competition}} among different conventions determines which one {{will come to}} dominate. One sees such effects {{in the success of}} <b>community</b> <b>jargon,</b> of competing frames in political rhetoric, or of terminology in technical contexts. These effects have become widespread in the online domain, where the data offers the potential to study competition among conventions at a fine-grained level. In analyzing the dynamics of conventions over time, however, even with detailed on-line data, one encounters two significant challenges. First, as conventions evolve, the underlying substance of their meaning tends to change as well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of social effects. Second, the selection of a convention takes place through the complex interactions of individuals within a community, and contention between the users of competing conventions {{plays a key role in}} the convention's evolution. Any analysis must take place in the presence of these two issues. In this work we study a setting in which we can cleanly track the competition among conventions. Our analysis is based on the spread of low-level authoring conventions in the eprint arXiv over 24 years: by tracking the spread of macros and other author-defined conventions, we are able to study conventions that vary even as the underlying meaning remains constant. We find that the interaction among co-authors over time plays a crucial role in the selection of them; the distinction between more and less experienced members of the community, and the distinction between conventions with visible versus invisible effects, are both central to the underlying processes. Through our analysis we make predictions at the population level about the ultimate success of different synonymous conventions over time [...] and at the individual level about the outcome of "fights" between people over convention choices.

40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been addressed {{in recent years by}} governments and institutions. Many large scale projects have been funded with the aim to allow healthcare professionals to consult patients data in different organizations. Concepts like interoperability, security and confidentiality are the key for the suc-cess for these projects. The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative promotes the coordinated use of established standards for au-thenticated and secure EHR exchange amongst clinics and hospitals or even regions. For these scenarios, the problem of having authenticated transactions is crucial, in order to provide a form of authorization while accessing patient healthcare information. The IHE initiative addresses the problem by mean of SAML assertions, i. e. XML documents contain-ing authentication statements. In this paper, we focus on the problem of propagating the authentication information of healthcare profession-als amongst hospitals or regions (in the IHE <b>jargon,</b> <b>communities)</b> by relying on the delegation mechanism introduced by SAML...|$|R
