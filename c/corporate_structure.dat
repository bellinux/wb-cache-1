In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatised, {{and the other two}} airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Air System (JAS), were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline's <b>corporate</b> <b>structure,</b> and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a <b>corporate</b> <b>structure</b> that {{included}} The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil's assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the hope of finding him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil's <b>corporate</b> <b>structure</b> or assets.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>structures</b> has high {{importance for the}} financial sector. <b>Corporate</b> <b>structures</b> consist of companies holding shares in other companies. For analyzing <b>corporate</b> <b>structures</b> a graphical visualization of these networks is an effective instrument. An efficient analysis needs adequate interaction techniques, which for example allow restrict the amount of visualized data. This {{can be achieved by}} filtering the data or highlighting of structural motifs in the graphs representing the <b>corporate</b> <b>structures.</b> It is significant for the user's work to visualize her sequence of interactions with software systems and analyze them. This enables the user to understand, reproduce and optimize her work process, resulting in an optimization in usage of the software and optimization of the software itself. This bachelor thesis extends RelaNet, a program for visualizing graphs with specialized functions for analyzing <b>corporate</b> <b>structures,</b> by implementing interaction techniques, like filtering, highlighting and aggregation, based on a search for vertex and edge attributes. The user achieves a more tightly focused and easier analysis, because of a more focused visualization of data. Furthermore a tracking will be implemented, which saves user actions, beyond one session, visualize them, allows navigation between program states and thus enables an {{analysis of}} the user's analytical process. With the help of a case study the functionality and advantages of the presented implementation are shown. The case study uses a database containing 12 000 German corporations. The case study shows how a better analysis is possible by using the new interaction techniques in combination with the tracking system. The usage in other information visualization software such as for biology or supply chain management is also possible...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} the cross-sectional determinants of <b>corporate</b> capital <b>structure</b> using a {{general equilibrium model}} with endogenous firm dynamics, a realistic tax environment, and financial frictions. I find that the equilibrium firm distribution in the model replicates fairly well the distribution of <b>corporate</b> capital <b>structure</b> {{as well as the}} relationship between capital structure, profitability, and firm size in the data. The key mechanisms here are economies of scale and two types of productivity shocks: persistent and transitory. The counterfactual experiment using the model implies, among other things, that tax benefits have relatively small effects on <b>corporate</b> capital <b>structure</b> choice compared with default costs and the costs of outside equity, including the dividend tax. It also reveals that the effects of those frictions on <b>corporate</b> capital <b>structure</b> choice are highly interrelated with each other. <b>Corporate</b> Capital <b>Structure,</b> Dynamic Trade-off Theory, Heterogeneous Firm Model...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the stock}} of the Catasauqua & Fogelsville was bought by the Reading in 1890, as iron ore from the Mesabi Range began to put {{pressure}} on local iron mining operations. It was leased to the Reading on December 8, 1893. Between 1916 and 1919, furnace slag was dumped under the Jordan Creek high bridge so that it could be replaced by a fill and culvert. Iron ore traffic continued to decline, and the local mines had all been shut down by the end of World War I. The mine branches remained in place, derelict, until the 1940s, when the three spurs and the main line south of Lock Ridge were abandoned. The Catasauqua and Fogelsville was formally merged into the Reading on August 10, 1944, probably to simplify the <b>corporate</b> <b>structure</b> of that railroad and to save on taxes, as with a series of other mergers the next year.|$|E
