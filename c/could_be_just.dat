25|$|Workers {{also had}} {{good reasons for}} discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours at work (on {{the eve of the}} war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.|$|E

For this reason, {{a number of other}} Lower East Side congregations also purchased or built new buildings around this time. They also hired increasingly expensive cantors until, in 1886, Kahal Adath Jeshurun hired P. Minkowsy for the [...] "then-staggering sum of five thousand dollars per annum" [...] (today $). Beth Hamedrash Hagodol responded by recruiting from Europe the famous and highly paid cantor Israel Michaelowsky (or Michalovsky).

The plays for which Dorset Garden was built, the [...] "machine plays" [...] of the 1670s and 1680s and the operas of the 1690s, were a category to themselves, different from ordinary serious drama: more static, more mythological, much more gorgeous, infinitely more expensive. So elaborate was the scale of these productions, and so long each preparation time, that only five [...] "machine plays" [...] were produced during the 1670s; yet they were hugely important for the finances of the Duke's Company, mostly in a positive sense. They were Davenant's version of Macbeth (1672–73), Settle's Empress of Morocco (probably 1673), Shadwell/Dryden/Davenant's Tempest (1673–74), Thomas Shadwell's long-awaited Psyche (1674–75), and Charles Davenant's Circe (1676–77).|$|E

500|$|The Doctor {{hanging out}} of the TARDIS was filmed with Smith {{in front of a}} greenscreen, while the aerial footage of London was {{achieved}} with a helicopter. Smith stated that the scene was hard to visualise as it relied heavily on computer-generated images. Nearly every scene in the sequence is a visual effects shot, including a 3-D TARDIS flying over London and a CG Doctor {{hanging out of}} the TARDIS in the aerial shots. Moffat realised that the Millennium Dome was visible in the final footage, and so the scene could not be set in 1996 before it had been built. Instead of a reshoot, Moffat explained that the TARDIS <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> about to go back in time and materialise in Amelia's garden. In post-production, 30 tracks of sound effects, music composed by Murray Gold specifically for the sequence, and Smith's [...] "grunting and groaning" [...] were added.

500|$|Following Brauman's {{release from}} prison, Gay set out {{preparing}} for the Beijing Olympics, training with both Brauman and Jon Drummond in the off-season. Returning to competition in May, he continued as he had left off in 2007: winning the 200m in Kingston, taking gold in both sprints at the Adidas Track Classic, and finishing second in the 100m at the Reebok Grand Prix with a 9.85s run. However, Gay now faced a new, emerging challenger in Usain Bolt; at the latter event Bolt had beaten Gay with a world-record-setting 9.72s. Taking this into consideration, he realized that a world record time {{would be needed to}} beat both Bolt and Powell at the Olympics; Gay aimed to run below 9.70s. With athletes running such quick times, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) sought to counter claims of performance-enhancing drugs use through [...] "Project Believe", a regular, extensive drugs testing program. The BALCO scandal and the banning of high-profile athletes, including Gatlin and Marion Jones, had damaged the public's perception of sprinting and the USADA recruited Gay to prove clean athletes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as successful.|$|E

Below the letter T, there is another cross placed within a cloud or flower with twelve petals. On the chamfered edge around this design runs a circular Latin inscription in two rings which reads: Rec figura talet ad amorem regum / et principum iras iudicum ("This sign rouses the love of kings and princes, the wrath of judges").

Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} a mixed reception from television critics. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News commented that [...] "like all hourlong episodes of comedies, this one becomes a little bloated in the middle.

[...] Whitney Matheson of USA Today said she [...] "was bored to tears" [...] by the episode, while Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk thought it was a [...] "fun episode". Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: [...] "Whoever {{came up with the idea}} to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired." [...] A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo [...] "fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: [...] "Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so." [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall commented that Will & Grace [...] "has already been infected with a sense of cattiness and despair, as the writers try to top each other's nasty one-liners. A happy, healthy relationship <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> the cure for what's ailing the one-time Emmy winner." ...|$|E

I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo".
