5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

25|$|The phenomenal {{growth in}} trade slowed {{somewhat}} {{in the years}} after the recommencement of the Eighty Years' War with Spain in 1621 (the end of the Twelve Years' Truce). That recommencement offered the possibility of extending trade to the Western Hemisphere (indeed, the Dutch West India Company was founded in 1621), but elsewhere the Dutch were increasingly pushing up against European rivals in a struggle for market share. The <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> of the more efficient Dutch shippers invited protectionist countermeasures, like the English Navigation Acts in the mid-17th century, the French tariff system, instituted under Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and similar protectionist measures instituted by Sweden at the same time. These protectionist measures caused a number of trade wars and military conflicts, like the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century, the Dutch-Swedish War, and the Franco-Dutch War (though the latter had a more general politico-military character, like the later conflicts between the Republic and France; these wars had an important economic component too, though).|$|E
25|$|Thus the re-organized ND {{was in a}} {{situation}} where it sold PCs, Sintran systems and Unix systems. In January 1990, the business units started negotiating the internal prices. Although top management had originally proposed that the partners could buy services from outside the company and the teams sell outside the company, such transactions were stopped by top management. ServiceTeam achieved high internal prices through the negotiations as they held all the cards. With the introduction of standard hardware platforms, computer manufacturers had to deliver unique software portfolios to avoid a pure price competition. With the spin-off of Notis, ND allowed one of their few <b>competitive</b> <b>advantages</b> to be available for all platforms. The three partner divisions were pure sales divisions and secured all the revenue for the team-divisions and DataShop. However, the partner divisions had very low margins so the profits were being made in the other business units, and thus receiving the praise of top management.|$|E

Research focusing on corporations and leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability" [...] – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium." [...] Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value and competitive advantage creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.

Design/methodology/approach ¿ The paper undertakes a synthesis of classic and contemporary insights into <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> in the literature to assist the development of several research propositions. Findings ¿ By introducing the perceived environmental uncertainty construct to discussion on the relationship between firm resources, <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> and organization performance, understanding of sustained <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> and temporary <b>competitive</b> <b>advantage</b> is enhanced. Research limitations/implications ¿ Through the development of the research propositions the paper helps to clarify terminology and provide several suggestions for future research.
