40|$|Tympanic {{temperature}} (Tty) {{is considered}} a valid index of brain temperature (1). However, several researchers have questioned its validity {{as a measure of}} brain temperature because it may be significantly influenced by ambient temperature (2, 3). In spite of this controversy, use of a portable, noninvasive, infrared thermometer to assess tympanic temperature has become wide-spread. Although infrared thermometry has been validated against other indices of core temperature during hypothermic conditions in humans (4), comparison of infrared thermometry to direct assessment of brain temperature has not been made. Furthermore, whether infrared Tty may provide a better index of elevated brain temperature when ambient temperature is held constant is unknown. Therefore, {{the purpose of the present}} investigation was to compare Tty using infrared thermometry with brain temperature (fbr) during exercise and passive heating in ewes.

The thickness of the amorphous films is measured by quartz crystal thickness monitor (Edward model FTM 7), and it is ≈ 4000 A 0.

This is done to allow sufficient annealing at room temperature so that a metastable thermodynamic equilibrium may be attained in the samples as suggested by Abkowitz [29] for chalcogenide glasses. The deposition parameters are kept almost the same for all the samples so that a comparison of results could be made for various glassy samples. The prepared thin films are then mounted in a specially designed metallic sample holder, where a vacuum of about 10 − 3 Torr is maintained throughout the measurements.

The {{aim of this study}} was to record the temperature close to the structures of the skull base and in the intradural space during the procedures performed using extended endoscopic transnasal approaches. Methods The temperature of the skull base was continuously recorded during six transnasal endoscopic procedures. Im-plantable <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouples were inserted: one into the esophagus and another through the nostril to reach the operative field at the skull base. Results At the beginning of the procedure, the temperature of the operative field was on average 36. 8 °C± 0. 80 °C, i. e. only 1 °C higher than the esophageal temperature.

It is especially conceived to ensure short time consuming and economic measurement of the thermal conductivity of mortar and lateritic bricks for building application. Thermal conductivity is measured by tracking the thermal pulse propagation induced in the sample by a heating source consisting of a Nickel alloy wire. The temperature is measured on the wire by means of two T type (<b>Copper–Constantan)</b> thermocouples.

The duty cycle of ultrasonic irradiation was set at 80 %, representing 8  s on– 2  s off. The ultrasound processing began while the sample temperature cooled to 0  °C and finished as soon as ice nucleation occurred in the liquid sample. The ultrasound processing time was very short, less than 2  min. The change in the cooling rate of the liquid sample due to the heat generated by ultrasound was negligible {{in such a short}} time. Figure  2 b shows a typical temperature profile in solidification. The solidification process can be divided into three subsequent stages, namely, liquid cooling, phase transition, and solid freezing. In the liquid cooling stage, sensible heat is removed from the liquid-state sample and its temperature is lowered.

The excess power levels of> 60 W/cm 3 palladium and excess energies of 74 kJ cannot be understood in terms of recombination of D 2 and O 2 within the calorimeter, other chemical reactions, or a storage-and-relaxation mechanism. The claim by Fleischmann and Pons 1 of heat generation over and above the power put into the electrolysis of heavy water, D 2 O, and its attribution to nuclear fusion have met with much justified skepticism.

Thin metal oxide coatings on the inner jacket of the vessel enabled the simultaneous heating and visualisation of the liquid in the vessel. Mixtures of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen were successfully used to form two differing density layers. An oxygen analysing system with an accuracy of 0. 01 % by volume oxygen, and a fifteen junction <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouple array were used for primary measurements of mass concentration and temperature. For a number of initial density differences between layers, various liquid layer heating configurations were used to obtain the variations in evaporation flowrate, and detailed temperature and concentration profiles during experiments. Convective flow patterns in single and two-component liquid mixtures were obtained, using the Schlieren method. Results show that the mixing of layers is primarily due to entrainment of fluid from the intermediate layer separating the two convective layers. The intermediate layer can be described by Double-Diffusive convection theory, and controls the transport of heat and mass between layers. The measured peak flowrate {{is a function of}} the initial density difference between layers. The peak to equilibrium flowrate values are much lower than those reported in rollover incidents, due to the enhanced mixing processes occurring in the simulation mixture.

Liquid-liquid-vapor equilibrium data of the ternary system were also obtained at the same temperature. Two methods were proposed for computing vapor phase compositions from total pressure and liquid composition data. One was for low and medium pressure conditions, in which a hypothetical component concept was employed and thus extended the method for binary systems to ternary systems at isothermal condition. The proposed method was successfully applied to the ternary system nitrogen-argon-oxygen. The other was proposed for high pressure systems in which an adjusted activity coefficient was introduced in conjunction with the appropriate symmetric and unsymmetric conventions.

Four types of base metal erodable surface thermocouples have been examined in this study, included type-K (alumel-chromel), type-E (chromel-constantan), type-T (<b>copper-constantan),</b> and type-J (iron-constantan) with 50 mm thick- ness for each. The practical importance {{of these types of}} thermocouples is to be used in internal combustion engine studies and aerodynamics experiments. The step heat flux was applied at the surface of the thermocouple model. The heat flux from the measurements of the surface temperature can be commonly identified by assuming that the heat transfer within these devices is one-dimensional. The surface temperature histories at different positions along the thermocouple are presented. The normalized surface temperature histories {{at the center of the}} thermocouple for different types at different response time are also depicted. The thermocouple response to different heat flux variations were considered by using a square heat flux with 2 ms width, a sinusoidal surface heat flux variation width 10 ms period and repeated heat flux variation with 2 ms width. The present results demonstrate that the two dimensional transient heat conduction effects have a significant influence on the surface temperature history measurements made with these devices. It was observed that the surface temperature history and the {{transient response}} for thermocouple type-E are higher than that for other types due to the thermal properties of this thermocouple. It was concluded that the thermal properties of the surrounding material do have an impact, but the properties of the thermocouple and the insulation materials also make an important contribution to the net response...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is a March 1949 Ad Interim Report {{on the development}} of a high-speed, low-sensitivity calorimeter at the Mound Laboratory. This calorimeter is a zero-compensating, thermocouple, twin type. The outside diameter of the aluminum tubing was machined for a slip fit into the glass test tube. Prior to assembling in the test tube, an aluminum plug was pressed in it midway from the ends. A groove was also milled on the outside down to the plug, and a <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouple was secured in the groove after assembly. A single layer of aluminum foil was used to reduce radiation effects, and stray air currents were excluded with a cotton plug. The two arms of the calorimeter were placed in a three-liter beaker filled with water. The constantan leads of the two thermocouples were soldered together to make them compensating. The copper leads were connected to a L & N potentiometer, and a L & N galvanometer was also used. The potentiometer-galvanometer circuit was so connected that before each reading of the EMF of the thermocouples, the thermal EMF in the circuit could be accounted for. The galvanometer was then mounted on a heavy brass plate. The data show that when the galvanometer is suitably mounted, {{it can be used to}} measure samples of from 50 to 75 curies with a precision of plus or minus one percent. The calorimeter also comes into equilibrium within 20 minutes. It is planned to study the apparatus to see whether the potentiometer can be dispensed with. It is possible that a direct measurement can be made with a suitable galvanometer, scale, and focusing lamp...|$|E
40|$|It {{would not}} be {{possible}} to confidently qualify weapon systems performance or validate computer codes without knowing the uncertainty of the experimental data used. This report provides uncertainty estimates associated with thermocouple data for temperature measurements from two of Sandia's large-scale thermal facilities. These two facilities (the Radiant Heat Facility (RHF) and the Lurance Canyon Burn Site (LCBS)) routinely gather data from normal and abnormal thermal environment experiments. They are managed by Fire Science & Technology Department 09132. Uncertainty analyses were performed for several thermocouple (TC) data acquisition systems (DASs) used at the RHF and LCBS. These analyses apply to Type K, chromel-alumel thermocouples of various types: fiberglass sheathed TC wire, mineral-insulated, metal-sheathed (MIMS) TC assemblies, and are easily extended to other TC materials (e. g., <b>copper-constantan).</b> Several DASs were analyzed: (1) A Hewlett-Packard (HP) 3852 A system, and (2) several National Instrument (NI) systems. The uncertainty analyses were performed on the entire system from the TC to the DAS output file. Uncertainty sources include TC mounting errors, ANSI standard calibration uncertainty for Type K TC wire, potential errors due to temperature gradients inside connectors, extension wire uncertainty, DAS hardware uncertainties including noise, common mode rejection ratio, digital voltmeter accuracy, mV to temperature conversion, analog to digital conversion, and other possible sources. Typical results for 'normal' environments (e. g., maximum of 300 - 400 K) showed the total uncertainty to be about {+-} 1 % of the reading in absolute temperature. In high temperature or high heat flux ('abnormal') thermal environments, total uncertainties range up to {+-} 2 - 3 % of the reading (maximum of 1300 K). The higher uncertainties in abnormal thermal environments are caused by increased errors due to the effects of imperfect TC attachment to the test item. 'Best practices' are provided in Section 9 to help the user to obtain the best measurements possible...|$|E
40|$|Guy et al. (1974) {{reported}} that when skin {{was exposed to}} infra-red radiation or when hot packs were applied, the surface temperatures attained fell progressively throughout treatment. Gibbs (1983), using microwave heating, also demonstrated a decrease in temperature with time which appeared to extend several centimetres into the tissue. These changes were attributed {{to an increase in}} the local blood flow in response to the heat stimulus. In this centre local hyperthermia treatment has been used to palliate advanced cancer in axillary nodes. RF (13. 56 MHz) energy was applied using capacitive coupling via flexible pillows perfused with cooled 6 % saline (Griffiths et al., 1983 a). Temperatures in tumour and normal tissue were monitored with multi-junction, <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouples inserted into nylon catheters implanted in the tissue by the standard technique for iridium implants (Paine, 1972). Temperature measurements were intrinsically accurate to + 0. 1 °C. Twelve patients were treated on a total of 29 occasions, and during treatment similar decreases in temperature were observed. These observations are summarised in Table I. On eighl occasions the temperature indicated by at least one thermocouple sensor fell whilst the RF power was maintained at a constant value or when it was slightly increased. For each treatment the data from the thermocouple junction which indicated the largest fall in temperature are shown, although higher absolute values of temperature were measured elsewhere in the tissue. The data for Patient 1 are given in more detail in Figure 1. Signals are shown from three thermocouple junctions A, B and C, situated- 10, 30 and 60 mm from the anterior skin surface, and all located under the treatment area. During a planned h treatment the RF power is briefly switched off several times to make small adjustments for patient comfort and cooling pillow alignment. The tota...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe natural convection heat transfer {{characteristics of a}} 3 X 3 array of vertical oriented heated protrusions, immersed in a dielectric liquid, were investigated. Aluminum blocks, 24 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm, were used to simulate 20 dual in-line packages. Surface temperature measurements of the components were made by embedding <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouples {{below the surface of}} each component face. A constant heat flux was provided to each component using an Inconel foil heating element. Power supplied to each component varied from 0. 115 W to 2. 90 W. The aluminum blocks were mounted on a plexiglass enclosure with inner dimensions:I = 203. 2 mm II= 152. 0 mm W = 82. 6 mm, and a wall thickness of 24. 5 mm. The upper boundary was maintained at 10 (o) C, while all other exterior surfaces were insulated. The chamber width, measured {{from the surface of the}} circuit board to the opposite, inner wall of the enclosure, was varied from 42 mm to 7 mm by inserting plexiglass spacers into the enclosure. Two dielectric liquids, FC- 75 and FC- 43, were used as working fluids. Non-dimensional data from this study was combined with the data obtained by Aytar (1991) for a horizontal component orientation, to develop an empirical correlation which predicts the Nusselt number as a function of Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, component orientation and chamber width. This correlation was found to be accurate to within 11 % of the original curve fit data. Heat transfer in FC- 75 was found to occur mainly by convection arising from buoyancy forces, regardless of chamber width. Heat transfer in FC- 43 was found to occur mainly by molecular diffusion for chamber widths of 11 mm or greater, and by convection at a chamber width of 7 mm. The maximum uncertainty in the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers was 2. 5 %, based on a zeroth order uncertainty analysis, and occurred at the lowest power level, where the maximum uncertainty in the temperature measurement resided.

40|$|In {{order to}} study heat {{dissipation}} ability of spontaneously hypertensive rats, threshold core temperatures for {{occurrence of the}} tail vasodilation were compared among adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Mean age of month (M.) and mean systolic blood pressure were 8. 4 ± 0. 5 M; 205 ± 5 mmHg for SHR, 7. 2 ± 0. 6 M; 240 ± 8 mmHg for SHRSP and 7. 6 ± 1. 1 M; 140 ± 6 mmHg for WKY. For the measurement, each rat was placed into a small wire-mesh cage for a loose restraint. Rectal temperature, tail skin temperature and air temperature were simultaneously recorded by means of thermistor probes or <b>copper-constantan</b> thermocouples. Air temperature was gradually raised at a constant rate of 0. 17 ℃/min. Stepwise changes in the tail skin temperature were observed during the gradual elavation of the air temperature. The beginning of the tail vasodilation was detected by the 1 st increase in tail skin temperature. Mean threshold core temperature for the 1 st vasodilation in SHR, SHRSP and WKY were, 38. 9 ± 0. 1 ℃, 38. 4 ± 0. 1 ℃ and 38. 0 ± 0. 1 ℃, respectively. Threshold core temperatures for the 1 st vasodilation in SHR and SHRSP were significantly high compared to that in WKY, while the threshold in SHRSP was significantly lower than SHR. Mean values of threshold Ta for the 1 st tail vasodilation in SHR, SHRSP and WKY were 30. 1 ± 0. 5 ℃, 29. 9 ± 0 ･ 6 ℃ and 29. 7 ± 0. 5 ℃, respectively. There was no statistical significance among these values. These {{results are consistent with}} the fact that the core temperature in adult SHRSP is not always high as SHR, even though blood pressure of SHRSP is higher than SHR. And these facts also suggest that high systemic blood pressure itself may not cause developing high core temperature in these genetically hypertensive rats...|$|E
