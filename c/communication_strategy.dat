2500|$|The {{question}} for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes {{could have made}} the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he {{emphasizes the importance of}} distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of H. sapiens began with ancestors who did not yet have [...] "culture," [...] what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)? [...] Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different <b>communication</b> <b>strategy,</b> but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to H. sapiens to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species: ...|$|E

The writer uses theory of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> by Dörney (1995). There are two problems of the study which were proposed: (1) What are the types of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> used by students with high and low anxiety level when telling the comic strips (2) How is the frequency of types of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> used by students with low and high anxiety level when telling the comic strips. This study used qualitative approach {{in relation to the}} use of clear and systematic description about the phenomena being studied. There were 16 subjects in this study.

The data wereutterances containing <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> in telling comic strips.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of English as a foreign {{language}} (EFL) teachers’ perceptions of the teaching of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> in some universities in the United Kingdom. This is an exploration to understand how EFL teachers perceive the idea of teaching <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> in their classrooms. The relevant literature {{suggests that there are}} contrasting points of view among researchers about the pedagogical effectiveness of the teaching of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> Consequently, the focus of this research {{is to look at the}} current EFL teachers’ perceptions and experiences of teaching <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> The participants of this study were thirteen EFL teachers from two universities in the United Kingdom. Semi-structured interviews and classroom observations were the main methods used to elicit teachers’ views and experiences on teaching <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) with the assistance of the NVIVO computer software. The findings of this study revealed that EFL teachers in some universities in the United Kingdom recommend and support the teaching of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> I also found out that students are becoming more dependent on their electronic devices and especially the translation applications installed on their mobile phones to help them search for the meaning of the vocabulary which they do not know. This issue intensified the teachers’ concerns about their students learning. This study also revealed that culture has an important role in the teaching and learning of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> This thesis argues that the teaching of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> can be pedagogically effective to learners. It also suggests further research into the impact of the use of technology on learners’ <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> in the classroom. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims {{to explore}} <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> for {{relationship}} building across cultures from a linguistic {{as well as}} a culture-specific perspective. Specifically, it sees business relationships as part of social capital and compares <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> used to build relationships in sales firms. The research method is based on a discourse analysis of interviews with business managers, which also incorporates their success stories. In the analysis, relationship building is divided into two stages: the initiating stage and the maintaining stage. It has been found that more interpersonal strategies have been employed by Chinese and Indian business managers when initiating a business relationship. In contrast, the New Zealand and South African managers tend to use more impersonal <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> to promote public relations. Similar interpersonal <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> are employed in all the target cultures for maintaining relationships. However, a stronger orientation for long-term relationships in the Chinese and Indian cultures has been identified. Furthermore, the <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> are dynamic in all the countries investigated since they {{are becoming more and more}} multicultural and increasingly globalized in international business and management.
