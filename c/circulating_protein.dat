Carbonyl content in tissue and <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins</b> is a stable marker of this attack. In 29 apparently healthy subjects (25 - 89 years old) carbonyl content of plasma proteins and retinol and tocopherols (α- and γ-) were studied. Carbonyls level did not show an increase with age. A good correlation between carbonyls content and γ-tocopherol (r = 0. 44, P < 0. 05) and a trend with retinol (r = 0. 34, P = 0. 07) was found, but not with a-tocopherol. An inverse correlation was observed between carbonyls and plasma proteins (r = - 0. 63, P < 0. 01) and the natural antioxidant studied showed an increase with age and a good relationship with lipids.

40|$|Lowered {{plasma protein}} {{concentration}} following single injections of gum acacia {{in the dog}} is due in some part to dilution, and in greater part to actual decrease in total <b>circulating</b> <b>protein.</b> The maximum decrease in the total <b>circulating</b> <b>protein</b> does not {{take place at the}} same time as the maximum decrease in concentration. Fluctuations in fibrinogen concentration are marked, and are not necessarily proportional to changes in plasma protein concentration. Plasma protein concentration returns to normal limits within 10 to 21 days after the injection, at which time total <b>circulating</b> <b>protein</b> and plasma volume are lower than normal. Loss of protein cannot be accounted for by increase in urinary nitrogen. It is possible to maintain dogs at low levels of plasma protein concentration for several weeks by repeated injections of gum acacia solution. Anatomical changes following such a procedure in a normal dog are most conspicuous in the liver (Fig. A). These observations further implicate the liver as a source of plasma protein. Two mechanisms for the diminution of plasma protein following gum injection are suggested. One of these is based on the possibility that the liver cells being engorged with gum acacia are not able to produce the necessary amount of plasma protein to supply the normal demand. The other possibility is that with the injection of the gum, since there is obviously a greatly increased amount of colloid in the blood, the more readily removable colloid, i. e. plasma protein, is taken out of the blood stream, in an attempt to return plasma volume and colloid osmotic pressure to the normal limits. It is probable that both of these mechanisms are involved. Injection of gum acacia is suggested as a technique for further study of disturbed liver function. It must be obvious that clinical use of gum acacia for intravenous injection is not without danger...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{is associated}} with enhanced lipid oxidation and persistent platelet activation. We investigated whether oxidant stress (OS) also affects <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins</b> and {{is associated with}} an abnormal coagulative pattern. In 72 type 2 DM (T 2 DM) patients, urinary 8 -iso-prostaglandin (PG) F 2 alpha and 11 -dehydro-thromboxane B 2 (TXM) were measured as markers of lipid peroxidation and platelet activation, respectively. The carbonyl content of plasma proteins (PCARB) was measured as global index of protein oxidation. 8 -Iso-PGF 2 alpha and PCARB levels were higher in DM patients than in controls (P < 0. 05). Likewise, both TXM and prothrombin F 1 + 2 levels were higher in diabetics (P < 0. 05). By contrast, anticoagulant markers, such as activated protein C, protein C activation peptide, and soluble thrombomodulin (TM) were depressed in T 2 DM (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, OS in T 2 DM involves <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins</b> and is associated with an unbalanced promotion of procoagulant reactions.

40|$|Although many {{predictors}} {{have been}} evaluated, {{a set of}} strong independent prognostic mortality indicators has not been established in children with pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The {{aim of this study}} was to identify a combination of clinical and molecular predictors of survival in PAH. This single-center, retrospective cohort study was performed from children with PAH between 2001 and 2008 at Children's Hospital Colorado. Blood samples from 83 patients (median age of 8. 3 years-old) were obtained. We retrospectively analyzed 46 variables, which included 27 <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins,</b> 7 demographic variables and 12 hemodynamic and echocardiographic variables for establishing the best predictors of mortality. A data mining approach was utilized to evaluate predictor variables and to uncover complex data structures while performing variable selection in high dimensional problems. Thirteen children (16 %) died during follow-up (median; 3. 1 years) and survival rates from time of sample collection at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years were 95 %, 85 % and 79 %, respectively. A subset of potentially informative predictors were identified, the top four are listed here in order of importance: Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1), apolipoprotein-AI, RV/LV diastolic dimension ratio and age at diagnosis. In univariate analysis, TIMP- 1 and apolipoprotein-AI had significant association with survival time (hazard ratio [95 % confidence interval]: 1. 25 [1. 03, 1. 51] and 0. 70 [0. 54 - 0. 90], respectively). Patients grouped by TIMP- 1 and apolipoprotein-AI values had significantly different survival risks (p< 0. 01). Important predictors of mortality were identified from a large number of <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins</b> and clinical markers in this cohort.

Amino acid growth mixtures given intravenously in distilled water cause weight loss, elevation of <b>circulating</b> plasma <b>proteins,</b> a slightly negative nitrogen balance, but no ascitic fluid production. Amino acid growth mixtures given intravenously in normal saline cause depression of the <b>circulating</b> plasma <b>proteins,</b> negative nitrogen balance, and significant ascitic fluid production. Ascitic fluid given intravenously to the test animals causes a marked depression of <b>circulating</b> plasma <b>proteins,</b> a marked increase in ascitic fluid production containing the equivalent of 116 and 98 per cent of the injected protein, and a negative nitrogen balance.

Twelve cytokines and growth factors putatively associated with lung or vascular disease were examined in plasma specimens from 70 children with PH using multiplex protein array technology. Associations between hemodynamics, adverse events, and protein markers were evaluated. Results. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and IL- 6 were associated with important hemodynamics. Of the twelve proteins, VEGF and IL- 6 were significantly, univariately associated with the occurrence of an adverse event, with odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of 0. 56 (0. 33 – 0. 98) and 1. 69 (1. 03 – 2. 77), respectively. When hemodynamic predictors were combined with protein markers, the ability to predict adverse outcomes within the following year significantly increased. Conclusions. Specific <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins</b> are associated with hemodynamic variables in pediatric PH.

The aim of our {{study was to identify}} the effect of repeated freezing and thawing on the plasma and serum concentrations of eight proteins [interferon-γ, interleukin (IL) - 8, IL- 15, IL- 17 A, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 7, tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R 2) ]. MethodsWe assessed the concentration changes of these proteins in 30 plasma and serum samples subjected to three, four, or five freeze–thaw cycles, and compared these with the concentration changes in the samples that were subjected to two freeze–thaw cycles before analysis. ResultsRepeated freezing and thawing by up to five cycles did not modify the plasma and serum concentrations of interferon-γ, IL- 8, and VEGF-R 2, while levels of MMP- 7, tumor necrosis factor-α, and VEGF were significantly changed in both plasma and serum samples. Moreover, MMP- 7 and VEGF concentrations tended to increase with freeze–thaw cycles. They were more elevated in plasma samples (up to about 15 %) than in serum samples (up to about 7 %), suggesting that serum is the preferred sample type for the analysis of <b>circulating</b> <b>proteins.</b> ConclusionThis is the first report on the effect of repeated freezing and thawing on plasma concentrations of MMP- 7 and VEGF-R 2.

Four independent loci from 3 regions were identified with genome-wide significance: 2 p 23 (GCKR, best SNP rs 1260326, P = 2. 04 × 10 − 17), 2 q 13 -q 14 (PROC, rs 1158867, P = 3. 77 × 10 − 36), 20 q 11 (near and within PROCR, rs 8119351, P = 2. 68 × 10 − 203), and 20 q 11. 22 (EDEM 2, rs 6120849, P = 7. 19 × 10 − 37 and 5. 23 × 10 − 17 before and after conditional analysis, respectively). All 4 loci replicated in the independent sample. Furthermore, pooling the discovery and replication sets yielded an additional locus at chromosome 7 q 11. 23 (BAZ 1 B, rs 17145713, P = 2. 83 × 10 − 8).
