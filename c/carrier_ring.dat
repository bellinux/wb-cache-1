5000|$|Since the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring,</b> any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{constant}} seating stress gasket {{consists of}} two components; a solid <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> of a suitable material, such as stainless steel, and two sealing elements of some compressible material installed within two opposing channels, one channel {{on either side of}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring.</b> The sealing elements are typically made from a material (expanded graphite, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), vermiculite, etc.) suitable to the process fluid and application.|$|E
50|$|Constant seating stress gaskets {{derive their}} {{name from the}} fact that the <b>carrier</b> <b>ring</b> profile takes flange {{rotation}} (deflection under bolt preload) into consideration. With all other conventional gaskets, as the flange fasteners are tightened, the flange deflects radially under load, resulting in the greatest gasket compression, and highest gasket stress, at the outer gasket edge.|$|E

40|$|The {{multiple}} mesh/single stage dynamics {{program is}} a gear tooth analysis program which determines detailed geometry, dynamic loads, stresses, and surface damage factors. The program can analyze a variety of both epicyclic and single mesh systems with spur or helical gear teeth including internal, external, and buttress tooth forms. The modifications refine the options for the flexible <b>carrier</b> and flexible <b>ring</b> gear rim and adds three options: a floating Sun gear option; a natural frequency option; and a finite element compliance formulation for helical gear teeth. The option for a floating Sun incorporates two additional degrees of freedom at the Sun center. The natural frequency option evaluates the frequencies of planetary, star, or differential systems {{as well as the}} effect of additional springs at the Sun center and those due to a flexible <b>carrier</b> and/or <b>ring</b> gear rim. The helical tooth pair finite element calculated compliance is obtained from an automated element breakup of the helical teeth and then is used with the basic gear dynamic solution and stress postprocessing routines. The flexible <b>carrier</b> or <b>ring</b> gear rim option for planetary and star spur gear systems allows the output torque per <b>carrier</b> and <b>ring</b> gear rim segment to vary based on the dynamic response of the entire system, while the total output torque remains constant...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating mandrel while a guide holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} braider while 144 strands of material traverse around a <b>carrier</b> <b>ring.</b> As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 carriers holding the fibers travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to interlock fibers. An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the braider introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the braider is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the interlocking of fibers. The fabrication of bore evacuator chambers for a tank cannon system is investigated by utilizing a 144 carrier braiding machine, an industrial robot, and a resin applicator system...|$|E

To achieve this goal, additional upgrade measures will be accomplished in several UNILAC sections: LEBT [1], HSI-RFQ [2] and Alvarez main linac (power supplies for the 168 focusing quadrupoles) [3], and high current beam diagnostics [4]. Status of Components In 2008 planning and fabrication for the HSI-RFQ upgrade and commissioning for the Alvarez power supply upgrade have taken place. HSI-RFQ Upgrade The HSI-RFQ will be upgraded with new electrodes, based on a new particle dynamics design [2]. This design, with larger aperture and higher voltage (155 kV instead of 125 kV at Uranium level), provides for a larger acceptance, keeping the max. surface peak field lower than the old design (< 320 kV/cm). The new input radial matcher (IRM) design allows radial beam matching without emittance growth in the matching section. Assuming an input beam current of 25 mA U 4 + (assuming 280 mm mrad transversal emittance), a transmission of 80. 6 % can be expected.
