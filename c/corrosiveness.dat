5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and <b>corrosiveness</b> of the solution.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the <b>corrosiveness</b> of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the large}} market of antique and replica black-powder {{firearms}} in the US, modern gunpowder substitutes like Pyrodex, Triple Seven and Black Mag3 pellets have been developed since the 1970s. These products, which {{should not be confused}} with smokeless powders, aim to produce less fouling (solid residue), while maintaining the traditional volumetric measurement system for charges. Claims of less <b>corrosiveness</b> of these products have been controversial however. New cleaning products for black-powder guns have also been developed for this market.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating. Gasoline is produced in several grades of octane rating. Tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating, but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability, control <b>corrosiveness</b> and provide fuel system 'cleaning,' and determine performance characteristics under intended use. Sometimes, gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel, for economic, political or environmental reasons.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid is a diprotic {{acid and}} shows {{different}} properties depending upon its concentration. Its <b>corrosiveness</b> on other materials, like metals, living tissues or even stones, can be mainly ascribed to its strong acidic nature and, if concentrated, strong dehydrating and oxidizing properties. It is also hygroscopic, readily absorbing water vapour from the air. Sulfuric acid {{at a high}} concentration can cause very serious damage upon contact, since {{not only does it}} cause chemical burns via hydrolysis, but also secondary thermal burns through dehydration. It can lead to permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes and irreversible damage if swallowed.|$|E
25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its <b>corrosiveness.</b> The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{studies on}} {{fluorine}} were so dangerous that several 19th-century experimenters were deemed [...] "fluorine martyrs" [...] after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid. Isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme <b>corrosiveness</b> of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride, {{as well as}} the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte. Edmond Frémy postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified potassium bifluoride; instead, he discovered that the resulting (dry) hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity. Frémy's former student Henri Moissan persevered, and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium bifluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor, enabling electrolysis. To prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his electrochemical cells, he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium, and used fluorite stoppers. In 1886, after 74 years of effort by many chemists, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{attempts}} {{to isolate the}} element were also hindered by material difficulties: [...] the extreme <b>corrosiveness</b> and reactivity of hydrogen fluoride (and of fluorine gas) as well as problems getting a suitable conducting liquid for electrolysis.

2500|$|Flux is a {{reducing}} agent {{designed to help}} reduce (return oxidized metals to their metallic state) metal oxides at the points of contact to improve the electrical connection and mechanical strength. The two principal types of flux are acid flux (sometimes called [...] "active flux"), containing strong acids, used for metal mending and plumbing, and rosin flux (sometimes called [...] "passive flux"), used in electronics. Rosin flux comes {{in a variety of}} [...] "activities", corresponding roughly to the speed and effectiveness of the organic acid components of the rosin in dissolving metallic surface oxides, and consequently the <b>corrosiveness</b> of the flux residue.|$|E
2500|$|At an {{oversight}} {{hearing before the}} House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine {{was the cause of}} the elevated lead levels. [...] He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. [...] Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as [...] "lead free" [...] under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. [...] Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. [...] He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine {{in a way that would}} increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional <b>corrosiveness.</b> He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.|$|E
2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the <b>corrosiveness</b> of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E
2500|$|Alien {{blood is}} an {{extremely}} potent acid and is capable of corroding almost any substance on contact with alarming speed. It is dull yellowish-green in color, {{and appears to be}} pressurized inside the body so that it spurts out with great force when the creature is wounded. Ron Cobb suggested the idea of the Alien having acid blood as a plausible means to make the creature [...] "unkillable"; if one were to use traditional firearms or explosives to attack it, its blood would eat through the hull of the ship. The Alien novelization suggests that, at least at the [...] "facehugger" [...] stage, the acid is not blood but a fluid maintained under pressure between a double layer of skin. In the Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem documentary: [...] "Science of the Alien", it is hypothesized that the Aliens' acid blood could be some type of [...] "hydrosulphuric acid" [...] compound due to its <b>corrosiveness</b> and the conspicuously toxic effects on living human tissue. The documentary also speculates that Aliens are immune to their own acidic and toxic liquids due to an endobiological build-up, similar to the human stomach's ability to protect itself from its own digestive fluids. The documentary takes this hypothesis one step further and speculates that the Alien organisms' protection system against its own toxic hydrosulphuric acid is basically a bio-organically produced Teflon insulation. In the original Alien, the facehugger is shown to be able to [...] "spit" [...] acid, dissolving the faceplate of Kane's helmet and allowing the creature immediate access inside. This ability is also exhibited by adult Aliens in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection; much like a spitting cobra, they use it to blind and immobilize their victims.|$|E

Dorothea accused herself of some meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any small fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she was seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the <b>corrosiveness</b> of Celia's pretty carnally minded prose.

50|$|There are six {{groups of}} tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose.

50|$|Frequently, steam, air, inert gases, and {{hydrocarbon}} gases {{are used}} as stripping agents. This is based on solubility, stability, degree of <b>corrosiveness,</b> and availability.
