40|$|Similar to most {{if not all}} pro-apoptotic {{members of}} the Bcl- 2 family, Bid (and its {{truncated}} product t-Bid) triggers cell death via mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP). This effect can be monitored in intact cells, upon microinjection of recombinant Bid protein into the cytoplasm, as well as in purified mitochondria, upon addition of Bid protein. Here we show that Bid-induced MMP can be inhibited, both in cells and in the cell-free system, by three pharmacological inhibitors of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), namely cyclosporin A, N-methyl- 4 -Val-cyclosporin A, and bongkrekic acid (a ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocase, ANT, one of the PTPC <b>components).</b> <b>Bid</b> effects on synthetic membranes were studied either in proteoliposomes or in synthetic bilayers subjected to electrophysiological measurements. Full length Bid preferentially permeabilizes membranes and induces the formation of large conductance channels at neutral pH, when added to liposomes or bilayers containing both purified ANT and Bax, yet has no or little effect combined with ANT or Bax alone. t-Bid acts on membranes containing ANT alone with the same efficiency as on those containing both ANT and Bax. These results suggest that the proapoptotic effects of Bid are mediated, at least in part, by its functional interaction with ANT, one of the major components of PTPC...|$|R

A comparison of BID in patients with AN, CF and controls serves to clarify the specificity of BID for AN. Method: 22 patients with AN, 10 patients with CF, and 23 controls were tested with regard to perceptual and cognitive-affective <b>components</b> of <b>BID.</b> Further data concerning eating-disorder-related psychopathology were assessed. Results: BID occurred in all patients with AN. Patients with CF perceived themselves as thinner than the controls did, and three of them exhibited BID. Patients with AN and CF did not differ regarding body satisfaction, and only controls showed higher satisfaction than patients with CF. Patients with AN and CF differed on desire for thinness, dissatisfaction with their body, and interoceptive awareness, with higher scores occurring in patients with AN. Conclusions: Our pilot study reveals no severe psychopathology concerning body image in patients with CF. However, we did observe a general body dissatisfaction among these patients, probably associated with their being underweight. BID {{still seems to be}} a central diagnostic criterion for AN and should be carefully considered during therapeutic interventions...|$|R

30|$|Compared with {{developed}} countries, {{the proportion}} of government procurement in China's GDP is comparatively low, {{and the structure of}} government procurement is fairly irrational, with {{the proportion of}} service products being still lower. Government procurement in Western developed countries usually accounts for 10 % of the GDP and 30 % of the government spending. In China, government procurement in 2011 surpassed 1 trillion yuan, which amounted to only 2.13 % of the GDP and 9.65 % of government spending. The gap is obvious (Xia et al. 2012). Moreover, the structure of government procurement in China is quite irrational. Its major <b>component</b> is <b>bidding</b> for public works and the purchase of office supplies, and the proportion of service products is abnormally low. The government should enlarge the scale of procurement to a proper extent and expand to and favor engineering projects and especially service projects. Only by enlarging the scale of government procurement and setting restrictions to the procurement activities of government can the goals of implementing the government procurement system be achieved. Gradual improvement of the public finance system and budget system requires the continuous expansion of the scope of government procurement. We must change the previous pattern of emphasizing procurement of material products and downplaying that of service products, and include more service areas into the scope of government procurement, introducing the market competition mechanism, and making open, just and equitable bid invitations to service industries, so as to increase market demand for producer services.|$|R

We obtain qualitatively consistent model results for different stocks and across different time periods. We find that an unusual excess of buyers (sellers) relative to sellers (buyers) tends to increase the ask (bid) price. Hence, the ask and <b>bid</b> <b>components</b> of spread change asymmetrically about the efficient price. For a fixed order imbalance surprise these effects are muted when unanticipated total volume is high. Unexpected high volatility in the transaction price process tends to widen the spread symmetrically about the efficient price. Our {{findings are consistent with}} predications from market microstructure theory that the cost of market making should depend on both the risk of trading with better-informed traders and inventory risk. We also find that order flow surprises {{have a significant impact on}} the efficient price and can also explain a substantial amount of persistence in the volatility of the efficient price. This dependence does not violate the efficient market hypothesis since the surprises, by definition, are not predictable. ...|$|R

40|$|Reasoning about {{uncertainty}} is {{an increasingly important}} aspect of automated decision making in domains such as airline crew scheduling, vehicle routing, and supply chain management. In this thesis, I {{examine the impact of}} various types of uncertainty on automated reasoning in such domains, as well as effective methods for addressing the uncertainty. The specific problem facing agents in the Trading Agent Competition in Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) provides a rich setting for the discussion of uncertainty, and is the application domain of primary focus. The production scheduling component of TAC SCM is examined, which concerns the optimization of a single finite capacity machine to satisfy pending contracts, and possible future ones. This problem is formulated as a stochastic program and is solved using the sample average approximation (SAA) [1] in an online setting to find today’s optimal schedule, given probabilistic models of the future. In addition, the architecture of Brown University’s agent, Botticelli, (a finalist in the 2003 TAC SCM) is discussed, and the <b>bidding</b> <b>component</b> of TAC SCM is formulated as an extension of production scheduling. Mathematical programming approaches are applied in attempt to solve the problems optimally, and greedy methods that yield useful approximations are described. Test results compare the performance and computational efficiency of these alternative techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Coexistence of identity-specific and {{financial}} externalities among bidders is a salient feature of auctions with buyers who are cross shareholders or competing firms in an oligopoly. This paper unifies {{these two types}} of externalities in revenue-maximizing auction design. Our main findings are the following. First, {{these two types of}} externalities can be unified through the framework of Myerson (1981). Both affect the winning probabilities through their impact on players' externality-augmented virtual values, while their impact on buyers' payments is reflected by an externality-correcting component for each type of externalities, which equals the respective externalities. These <b>components</b> eliminate strategic <b>bidding</b> that would arise from the existence of externalities. Second, the two types of externalities interact fundamentally through shaping players' virtual values. At the optimum, the player with the highest externality-augmented virtual value wins given that it is positive, otherwise seller physically destroys the item. Financial externalities amplify the impact of the identity-specific externalities on winning probabilities. Third, our approach is applicable to revenue-maximizing auction design with cross shareholding. Fourth, our finding renders an approach for revenue-maximizing auction design with asymmetric financial externalities. Particularly, when seller does not value the object, a revenue-maximizing auction can be obtained from any revenue-maximizing auction for a regular setting without externalities by solely transforming the payments. ...|$|R
40|$|Events {{legacies}} {{have become}} a common feature in the public policy rhetoric surrounding sport events of all sizes. Public policy planners and event organizers are increasingly promoting the legacies of sport events to justify significant investments required to host them. Within the context of special events, legacy is most often recognized as the long-term or permanent outcomes for a host city from staging an event. These outcomes include potential economic, tourism, social, physical, and/or environmental factors. However, the justification of legacies from events remains complicated due to inconsistent conceptualizations of legacy across academic and industry practice. While legacy is an increasing <b>component</b> of event <b>bids</b> as well as funding justifications and postevent reports, the concept itself has attracted limited critical analysis. This article puts forth {{a comprehensive review of}} literature that has sought to define legacy, from 1991 – 2008, drawing on event management, sport management, and urban planning contexts. An inductive interpretive analysis of definitions was undertaken, in which key considerations were identified and definitions assessed against these. The analysis revealed five key considerations of legacy in application to the sport event management context. In doing so, this article contributes to both theoretical debate and improved strategic practice surrounding the emergence of “legacy” as justification for staging sport events. Full Tex...|$|R

Numerous {{studies have shown that}} WT gearbox and generator failure rates are unacceptably high, particularly given the long downtime incurred per failure. There is evidence that bearing failures of the gearbox high-speed stage (HSS) and generator account for a significant proportion of these failures. However, the root causes of these failure data are not known, and there is therefore a need for fundamental computational studies to support the valuable ‘top down’ reliability analyses. In this paper, a real (proprietary) 2 [*]MW geared WT was modelled to compute the gearbox–generator misalignment and predict the impact of this misalignment upon the gearbox HSS and generator bearings. At rated torque, misalignment between the gearbox and generator of 8500 [*]µm was seen. For the 2 [*]MW WT analysed, the computational data show that the L 10 fatigue lives of the gearbox HSS bearings were not significantly affected by this misalignment but that the L 10 fatigue lives of the generator bearings, particularly the drive-end bearing, could be significantly reduced. It is proposed to apply a nominal offset to the generator to reduce the misalignment under operation, thereby reducing the loading on the gearbox HSS and generator bearings. The value of performing integrated system analyses has been demonstrated, and a robust methodology has been outlined...|$|R

However, if the liquidity of instruments is not sufficient, the hedge would not succeed. This study {{focuses on the}} theoretical issues on the liquidity of volatility instruments, in particular during the 2008 financial crisis period.

This study proposes a theoretical framework of liquidity <b>component</b> in the <b>bid</b> ask spread. To realize the impact of replication cost on liquidity, four strategies are advised to replicate four volatility derivatives.

40|$|We empirically {{measure the}} effects {{increasing}} competition on equilibrium bidding in procurement auctions. In common value auctions, the winner's curse counsels more conservative bidding {{as the number}} of competitors increases. First, we estimate the structural parameters of an equilibrium bidding model and test for the importance of common value components in bidders' preferences. Second, we use these estimates to measure the effects on increasing competition on both individual bids as well as winning bids (ie. procurement costs). Methodologically, we have estimated a model which allows bidders' latent valuations for a contract to have both common and private value <b>components.</b> We analyze <b>bid</b> data from construction procurement auctions run by the New Jersey department of transportation in the years 1989 - 1997. Our results show that different types of contracts differ significantly in the degree that private and/or common value components are important, and these have contrasting implications on the effects of increasing competition on equilibrium bids and expected government procurement outlays. Auctions for highway work contracts are very close to a pure common value auction, while both common value and private value are important in auctions of bridge repair contracts. Furthermore, our results indicate that the winner's curse is particularly strong in these highway contract auctions. Simulated bid functions show that for the median bidder, the percentage markup increases from 50 % with 2 bidders to above 70 % with 10 bidders. Furthermore, winning bid simulations indicate that the average procurement cost is strictly increasing in the number of bidders as competition intensifies: for example, the median costs rise about 30 %, {{as the number of}} bidders is increases from 3 to 6. These results emphasize how asymmetric information can overturn the common economic wisdom that more competition is always desirable, and have potentially important policy implications. ...|$|R
40|$|Applying {{statistical}} {{tools to}} help understand business processes and make informed business decisions has attracted {{enormous amount of}} research interests in recent years. In this dissertation, we develop and apply data mining techniques to two sources of data, online bidding data for eBay and offline sales transaction data from a grocery product distributor. We mine online auction data to develop forecasting models and bidding strategies and mine offline sales transaction data to investigate sales people's price formation process. We start with discussing bidders' bidding strategies in online auctions. Conventional bidding strategies do not help bidders select an auction to bid on. We propose an automated and data-driven strategy which consists of a dynamic forecasting model for auction closing price and a bidding framework built around this model {{to determine the best}} auction to bid on and the best bid amount. One important <b>component</b> of our <b>bidding</b> strategy is a good forecasting model. We investigate forecasting alternatives in three ways. Firstly, we develop model selection strategies for online auctions (Chapter 3). Secondly, we propose a novel functional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) forecaster for real time forecasting of online auctions (Chapter 4). The forecaster uses information from other auctions and weighs their contribution by their relevance in terms of auction features. It improves the predictive performance compared to several competing models across various levels of data heterogeneity. Thirdly, we develop a Beta model (Chapter 5) for capturing auction price paths and find this model has advantageous forecasting capability. Apart from online transactions, we also employ data mining techniques to understand offline transactions where sales representatives (salesreps) serve as media to interact with customers and quote prices. We investigate the mental models for salesreps' decision making, and find that price recommendation makes salesreps concentrate on cost related information. In summary, the dissertation develops various data mining techniques for business data. Our study is of great importance for understanding auction price formation processes, forecasting auction outcomes, optimizing bidding strategies, and identifying key factors in sales people's decision making. Those techniques not only advance our understanding of business processes, but also help design business infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} three novel solar cells is presented, {{all of which}} {{incorporate}} a low-dimensional quantum confined <b>component</b> in a <b>bid</b> to enhance device performance. Firstly, intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) based on InAs quantum dots (QDs) in a GaAs p-i-n structure are studied. The aim is to isolate the InAs QDs from the GaAs conduction band by surrounding them with wider band gap aluminium arsenide. An increase in open circuit voltage (V OC) and decrease in short circuit current (J sc) is observed, causing no overall change in power conversion efficiency. Dark current - voltage measurements show {{that the increase in}} V OC is due to reduced recombination. Electroreflectance and external quantum efficiency measurements attribute the decrease in J sc primarily to a reduction in InGaAs states between the InAs QD and GaAs which act as an extraction pathway for charges in the control device. A colloidal quantum dot (CQD) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell composed of a blend of PbS CQDs and ZnO nanoparticles is examined next. The aim of the BHJ is to increase charge separation by increasing the heterojunction interface. Different concentration ratios of each phase are tested and show no change in J sc, due primarily to poor overall charge transport in the blend. V OC increases for a 30 wt% ZnO blend, and this is attributed largely to a reduction in shunt resistance in the BHJ devices. Finally, graphene is compared to indium tin oxide (ITO) as an alternative transparent electrode in squaraine/ C 70 solar cells. Due to graphene’s high transparency, graphene devices have enhanced J sc, however, its poor sheet resistance increases the series resistance through the device, leading to a poorer fill factor. V OC is raised by using MoO 3 as a hole blocking layer. Absorption in the squaraine layer is found to be more conducive to current extraction than in the C 70 layer. This is due to better matching of exciton diffusion length and layer thickness in the squaraine and to the minority carrier blocking layer adjacent to the squaraine being more effective than the one adjacent to the C 70.

Since the concept of self necessarily suggests its opposite and this in turn involves awareness of existential futility, {{the purpose of the}} story, generated by the narrative-consciousness, is seen to be, in the first instance, the hiding of this unavoidable and potentially damaging awareness. This thesis suggests that to achieve this goal the story must be based on the process of self-deception. The thesis shows that, in general, self-deception involves three significant <b>components</b> in its <b>bid</b> to separate any two paradoxical ideas: unease, process and hiding and that each of these maps onto a particular component in the final narrative of the self. The narrative created by a consciousness hiding, in particular, the awareness of existential angst is given the specific name existentially-selfdeceptive- story, with an acronym ESDeS. The thesis goes on to suggest that such a narrative-consciousness could produce written stories that follow the same pattern, in which case the stories are called existentially-self-deceptive-novels, with an acronym ESDeN. Such a story or genre is then shown {{to be part of a}} continuum consisting of up to three distinct ways of dealing with existential futility. The thesis labels these Story- 1, Story- 2 and Story- 3 respectively but reserves the name ESDeN for a subset of Story- 2. Analyses of three of these stories, Heart of Darkness, Chance and Thinks concludes that the genre necessarily includes genre-markers, bracketing deaths and repetition, can also include other optional components such as the self-deceptive process or the parent-child mechanism but that its defining characteristic is its division between an overt plot and a covert plot which contains a collusive death of a character identified with existential angst. A covert plot is necessarily available but it is, by definition, not easily discovered. Its successful hiding is made possible, primarily, by foregrounding the overt content of the novel at the expense of the covert. In this sense, the only necessary requirement of the overt content is it should distract and it does this best when the reader cooperates by investing time in interpretation: that is, in order to disguise the ultimate the reader concentrates on the proximal. Finally, the thesis mirrors the endings of each ESDeN by drawing attention to the fact that this collusion will not work for long: just as self-deception cannot withstand too much contrary evidence, the covert plot will not stand too many rereadings. Inevitably, for the true ESDeS, another point of recognition will occur and this will necessitate the renewal or replacement of the ESDeS.
