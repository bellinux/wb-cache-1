50|$|After {{races at}} Clermont-Ferrand, Reims {{and the short}} Le Mans <b>circuit</b> (<b>s)</b> in 1965, 1966 and 1967 {{respectively}} the French GP returned to the spectacular and dangerous 4-mile (6.4 km) Rouen-Les-Essarts rural road circuit in a forested and hilly area of northern France. This circuit was very fast, narrow and was littered with high-speed sweepers, including a section of fast, anti-banked downhill curves; and two brick-surfaced hairpins {{at the ends of}} the track. The entry was little changed from the field which had raced in the wet at Zandvoort two weeks earlier with the one exception being the new Honda RA302 car with an air-cooled V8 engine- this new Honda was an experimental research and development car. This had been tested by John Surtees who declined to race it, as he felt it was not suitable for racing. The company founder Soichiro Honda was visiting France to try to boost European sales and so it was decided that the car should be entered by Honda France for the popular 40-year-old French racer Jo Schlesser, who had competed in two previous GPs in F2 Matras. Cooper fielded Briton Vic Elford and Matra's Johnny Servoz-Gavin to replace the late Ludovico Scarfiotti and the injured Brian Redman while Dan Gurney was missing {{because of a lack of}} engines for his Eagle. Qualifying saw Jackie Oliver walk away from a 125 mph accident which heavily damaged his Lotus. The car could not be repaired in time and so Oliver was forced to miss the rest of the meeting. Jochen Rindt set the fastest time in qualifying in his Brabham with Jackie Stewart's Matra-Ford and Jacky Ickx's Ferrari sharing the front row of the grid. Hulme and Amon shared the second row while Bruce McLaren (McLaren), Surtees (Honda) and Jean-Pierre Beltoise (Matra) made up row three. Championship leader Graham Hill was ninth. Light rain was falling when the race began but most of the drivers decided to start on intermediate tires. The exception was Ickx who chose full wets. As a result, the Belgian was in the lead at the end of the first lap. Stewart and Rindt were battling over second place with Surtees fourth. On the third lap at the notorious Six-Frere's corner, which was one of the anti-banked sweepers after the start Schlesser lost control of the R&D Honda and crashed. The car went up the embankment there, overturned and caught fire. The full fuel tank and magnesium chassis burned so intensely that nothing could be done to save Schlesser. The fire burned all over the track, and the drivers were forced to take evasive action at such a high speed part of the circuit. He became the fourth F1 driver to die that season (after Jim Clark, Mike Spence and Lodovico Scarfiotti). But the race went on anyway. Rindt suffered a puncture from wreckage at the scene of the crash and had to pit, dropping to the back of the field. Surtees has moved ahead of Stewart and so ran second until he was overtaken by Rodriguez on lap seven. Further back Hill overtook Stewart for fourth place but then retired with a driveshaft failure. Ickx went off on lap 19 and dropped behind Rodriguez and Surtees but he caught and repassed both men within two laps and stayed ahead for the rest of the afternoon to score his first ever victory, in only his ninth Grand Prix. Rodriguez had to pit with gearbox problems and he dropped away, leaving Surtees second (although the Honda driver also stopped to replace broken goggles). Third place went to Stewart with Cooper-BRM driver Vic Elford fourth on his Grand Prix debut.|$|E

As a result, the test generation problem for all single stuck-at faults in internally balanced circuits is reduced into the test generation problem for single stuck-at faults in combinational circuits.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} bipartitioning a circuit into two balanced components that minimizes the number of crossing nets. Previously, Kernighan and Lin type (K&L) heuristics, simulated annealing approach, and analytical methods were given to solve the problem. However, network flow (maxflow min-cut) techniques were overlooked as viable heuristics to min-cut balanced bipartition due to their high complexity. In this {{paper we propose a}} balanced bipartition heuristic based on repeated max-flow min-cut techniques, and give an efficient implementation that has the same asymptotic time complexity as that of one max-flow computation. We implemented our heuristic algorithm in a package called FBB.

The statistics are computed by collecting samples obtained from fast RTL simulation of the circuit under input sequences that are either randomly generated or independently selected from user specified pattern sets. An important advantage of this approach is that the desired accuracy can be specified up-front by the user; with some approximation, the algorithm iterates until the specified accuracy is achieved.
