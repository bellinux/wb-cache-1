50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of <b>center</b> <b>distance,</b> and gears designed for a different <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular pitch, diametral pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} {{population}} growth of cities, {{one of its}} major problems is the solid waste disposal. A landfill is the best solution to final disposal of solid waste; however, the selection of areas to implement the project is a difficult work. This paper {{presents the results of}} a preliminary selection of areas {{for the construction of a}} landfill at the city of Oliveira, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Three areas were evaluated through the area size, nearest population <b>center's</b> <b>distance,</b> urban <b>center's</b> <b>distance,</b> watercourse's distance, federal or state road's distance, vegetation type and land situation, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each area for the implementation of a landfill.

40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, cost distance to major water area and cost distance to minor water area, which presented physical factors; cost <b>distance</b> to district <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to town <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to city expansion <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to major roads, cost distance to city roads, cost distance to county roads and cost distance to rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, cost <b>distance</b> to district <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to town <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to city expansion <b>center</b> and cost <b>distance</b> to city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, cost <b>distance</b> to town <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to county roads and cost distance to rural roads. Slope, cost distance to minor water area, cost <b>distance</b> to town <b>center,</b> cost <b>distance</b> to county roads and cost distance to rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land. Elevation, slope, cost distance to major water area and cost distance to minor water area are the main explanatory variables on the transition of cultivated land into other land uses...|$|R
