50|$|Red <b>Cargo</b> <b>rice</b> {{is a type}} of non-glutinous {{long grain}} rice, similar to brown rice, in that it is unpolished. The color of the bran is red, purple or maroon. The husks of the rice grains are removed during the milling process, {{retaining}} all the nutrients, vitamins and minerals intact in the bran layer and in the germ.|$|E
50|$|Red rice is a {{good source}} of thiamin (vitamin B1), {{riboflavin}} (vitamin B2), fibre, iron and calcium. The flavor of cooked red <b>cargo</b> <b>rice</b> is generally more sweet and nutty, and the texture is more chewy than standard white polished rice. Red rice takes longer to cook than white rice, but not as long as brown rice. Soaking the rice in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking produces a softer texture.|$|E
50|$|Other {{varieties}} of rice eaten in Thailand include: sticky rice (khao niao), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual {{balance of the}} starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Sticky rice, not jasmine rice, is a staple food in the local cuisines of northern Thailand and of Isan (northeastern Thailand), both regions of Thailand directly adjacent to Laos with which they share many cultural traits. Thai Red <b>Cargo</b> <b>rice,</b> an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice {{is a type of}} sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the nuclear}} test, Rice made {{numerous}} calls to foreign leaders to consolidate support for taking punitive action against North Korea. Rice {{was able to}} draw condemnations from even some of North Korea's closest defenders, including China, who admitted the test was [...] "flagrant" [...] and [...] "brazen." [...] On {{the same day as}} the nuclear detonation, the United Nations Security Council convened another emergency meeting, where a clear consensus was apparent in favor of sanctions against the regime, with even China saying that it supported punishing the regime, changing its position from July, 2006, when it vetoed any sanctions on North Korea following its missile tests. On October 14, 2006, Rice worked with allies to pass a UN Security Council resolution against North Korea that demanded North Korea destroy all of its nuclear weapons, imposed a ban on tanks, warships, combat aircraft and missiles in the country, imposed an embargo on some luxury items that government officials enjoy while the general populace starves, froze some of the country's weapons-related financial assets, and allows for inspections of North Korean <b>cargo.</b> <b>Rice</b> called the resolution [...] "the toughest sanctions on North Korea that have ever been imposed" [...] and hailed the unanimous passage of the sanctions, which even North Korean-friendly China supported.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in the five rice-growing regions in Guyana to determine the presence of aflatoxins in multiple fractions of rice in June/October 2015 growing season. The fractions were paddy, steamed paddy, <b>cargo</b> <b>rice,</b> white rice and parboiled rice. Samples were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. A subset of the samples was further analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for concurrence. All analyses were conducted at the University of Missouri, USA. Of the 186 samples tested, 16 had aflatoxin concentrations greater than 20 ppb the recommended limit for aflatoxins in food according to the United States Food and Drug Administration. An additional three samples had aflatoxin B 1 concentrations greater than the European Union Commission maximum levels for aflatoxin B 1 in rice at 5 µg/kg and total aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) at 10 µg/kg. The survey indicates {{that there is no}} widespread aflatoxin problem in rice in Guyana. The incidence of aflatoxins appears to be localized...|$|E
