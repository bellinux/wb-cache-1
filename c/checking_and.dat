5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, then lifted the puck over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|E

30|$|Theoretical {{opinions}} differ {{regarding the}} evaluation of the relationship between <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms and trust. On the one hand, it is assumed that <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms are interlaced with trust and thus are not mutually exclusive. Möllering [48], however, believes in the duality rather than the dualism of <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms and trust. According to him, the <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanism of a system may be the prerequisite of trust and, in turn, the trust in the system may encourage the trust in its <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control. Indeed, a system is trusted because it provides mechanisms of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control. By extension, the control mechanisms are also trusted [see also 49, 50]. Nooteboom [36] arranges trust <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control in a time sequence by assuming that trust becomes necessary when <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control end [ibid.: 4]. Luhmann [1], in contrast, expresses a more radical view by saying that the transparency created through <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control does not require trust at all. If, on the other hand, <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control are taken as statements of mistrust, they gain, according to Luhmann [ibid.: 113], a system-stabilising function: “Whether systems are trusted … may … decisively depend on whether trust is suspended at critical points and mistrust is applied”. 3 With regard to trust towards institutions, Shapiro [50] argues that the <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control of these institutions might set off a spiral of mistrust [ibid.: 652]. On the other hand, trust <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control are regarded as compatible with each other. Hartmann [37], for example, assumes that those who have trust do not need monitoring and control and will do without. Luhmann [1 : 26] says that it is contradictory “to the function and style of trust to demand or offer detailed factual information and expert proof” [see also 4].|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances and democracy, focusing on Turkey in comparative perspective. In a large-N setting, the effects of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{on the quality of}} democracy are examined. The findings reinforce the essential relationship between democracy <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. The article then discusses the implications of the the findings for Turkey. It stresses the need for horizontal accountability via <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances vested in different state agencies. In addition to state-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, the importance of societal actors as sources of accountability is also elaborated. The study identifies the need for vertical accountability, not only through free elections but also by creating a political setting in which pluralistic media and civil society can thrive. In light of findings, the article stresses the need for a new constitutional framework that can embrace both state- <b>and</b> societal-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Voters often {{dismantle}} constitutional <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances on the executive. If such <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances limit presidential {{abuses of}} power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances also make it cheaper to bribe or in‡uence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly-institutionalized polities where such non-electoral in‡uences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{as a way of}} insulating politicians from these in‡uences. When they do so, they are e¤ectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances are less likely to emerge when (equilibrium) politician rents are low; when the elite are better organized {{and are more likely to}} be able to in‡uence or bribe politicians; and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority). We show that the main intuition, that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, by making politicians “cheaper to bribe, ” are potentially costly to the majority, is valid under di¤erent ways of modeling the form of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances...|$|R
