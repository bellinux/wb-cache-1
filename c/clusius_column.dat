40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} which accounts approximately for the apparently anomalous {{difference between the}} thermal diffusion coefficients of an ion in the presence {{and in the absence}} of other electrolytes; the theory is based on the existence of an electric field parallel to the thermal gradient in the electrolyte as a consequence of the variation in mobility among the various ions present. It is pointed out also that some data on the behavior of electrolytes in a <b>Clusius</b> <b>column</b> are at variance with the Debye exponential law concerning the steady‐state distribution of solute...|$|E
40|$|Equine and {{bovine serum}} {{proteins}} {{have recently been}} fractionated {{by means of a}} physical method utilizing an electrophoretic adaptation of the principles of the <b>Clusius</b> <b>column</b> (l- 4), first described and tested by Kirkwood (5) and Nielsen (6). The method of electrophoresis-convection has now been applied to the fractionation of human γ-globulin. The γ-globulin was prepared by ethanol fractionation (7) from the plasma of individuals hyperimmunized to Hemophilus pertussis organisms. The resulting fractions of γ-globulin have been characterized electrophoretically, and the protective antibody activity and agglutinin titer have been measured...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{fractionation}} of proteins in solution {{in which an}} electrophoretic adaptation {{of the principles of}} the <b>Clusius</b> <b>column</b> is utilized was suggested by Kirkwood in 1941 (1) and tested experimentally by Nielsen and Kirkwood (2) several years later. Recently an electrophoresis-convection apparatus of improved design has been described and successfully used in the fractionation of the pseudoglobulin of horse diphtheria antitoxin (3) and bovine serum proteins (4). Fractionation occurs in a narrow vertical channel between two semipermeable membranes, connecting an upper and lower reservoir. Separation depends upon the superposition of diflerential horizontal electrophoretic transport of the components on vertical convective transport of the solution as a whole. The vertical convective transport is controlled by the horizontal density gradient produced by the electrophoretic migration of the proteins across the channel. The result of the superposition of horizontal electrophoretic transport and vertical convective transport is movement of the mobile components from the top reservoir to the bottom reservoir at rates depending on their mobilities, with a relative enrichment of the top reservoir with respect to the slow components and the bottom reservoir with respect to the fast components. The separation of a protein mixture possessing discrete mobility and isoelectric point spectra, e. g. serum, into its constituent proteins is accomplished by successive immobilization of the components at their respective isoelectric points and transport of the mobile components from the top reservoir of the apparatus...|$|E
