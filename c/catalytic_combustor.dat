40|$|Recently {{developed}} small-scale hydrocarbon-fueled {{fuel cell}} systems for portable power under 1 kW have overall system efficiencies typically {{no higher than}} 30 - 35 %. This study explores {{the possibility of using}} of thermoelectric waste heat recovery in anode exhaust combustors to improve the fuel cell system efficiencies by as much as 4 - 5 % points and further to reduce required battery power during system start-up. An integrated SOFC system with simplified <b>catalytic</b> <b>combustor</b> model and integrated TEs between the air preheating channels as well as a transient model of a TE-integrated <b>catalytic</b> <b>combustor</b> were developed to explore the additional amount of power generation during SOFC operation, and to investigate the performance of the TEs during transient start-up of the combustor respectively. Results for the SOFC system indicate that while the TEs may recover as much as 4 % of the total fuel energy into the system, their benefit is reduced in part because they reduce the waste heat transferred back to the incoming air stream and thereby lower the SOFC operating temperatures and operating efficiencies.

The model also shows the need to minimize heat loss in the air flow passages in order to maintain stable SOFC operation at 700 °C or higher.

40|$|A quasi-steady {{gas phase}} and {{thermally}} thin substrate model {{is used to}} analyze the transient behavior of catalytic monolith combustors in fuel lean operation. The combustor response delay is due to the substrate thermal inertia. Fast response is favored by thin substrate, short catalytic bed length, high combustor inlet and final temperatures, and small gas channel diameters. The calculated gas and substrate temperature time history at different axial positions provides an understanding of how the <b>catalytic</b> <b>combustor</b> responds to an upstream condition change. The computed results also suggest that the gas residence times in the catalytic bed in the after bed space are correlatable with the nondimensional combustor response time. The model also performs steady state combustion calculations; and the computed steady state emission characteristics show agreement with available experimental data in the range of parameters covered.

40|$|When miniaturizing <b>catalytic</b> <b>combustors</b> {{from the}} macro- and meso-scale {{down to the}} micro-scale, some {{phenomena}} start playing a relevant role, such as heat losses toward the external environment and transverse diffusion {{with respect to the}} residence time. These phenomena may significantly affect the thermal behavior of catalytic micro-reactors. In this work, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are run for studying the effect of the cross-sectional geometry on the ignition/extinction behavior of catalytic micro-combustors. Two different shapes of the cross-section are investigated, circular and square. Stability maps are built and compared for lean propane/air combustion at different inlet gas velocities. Results demonstrate that, at low inlet velocities, the square cross-section channel is more resistant to extinction than the cylindrical channel. Furthermore, it is shown that, close to the ignition point, a strong coupling between fluid flow and superficial reaction rate is established. For both geometries, this coupling does not allow blowout to occur when increasing the inlet velocity up to the value limiting the laminar regime for the incoming flow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

In {{parallel to}} the ongoing development andcommercialization of <b>catalytic</b> <b>combustors</b> fired by naturalgas,an increasing interest is aimed towards renewables, such asgasified biomass. Gasified biomass is a low-heating value (LHV) fuel, rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with apotentiallyhigh level of ammonia.

Finally, recentdevelopments incatalytic combustion in gas turbines arereviewed in Paper I in the present thesis. The second part of the present thesis, Papers II-VIII,concerns preparation and testing ofpotential combustioncatalysts. The objectives of this work have been focused onpreparationmethods and development of thermally stable andactive hexaaluminate-based catalysts (Papers II, IV-VII),ignition of the LHV-gas (Papers III-VII), conversion offuel-bound nitrogen(Papers III, V-VI) and deactivation bythermal treatment and sulphur poisoning (PapersVI-VII). Moreover, enhancing catalytic activity for totaloxidation of methane through doping ofceria has been studied(Paper VIII). The experimental investigation included activitytesting inbench-scale monolithic, single-channel annular andfixed bed reactors, and characterisationsuch as BET, XRD, SEM,EDX, XPS and SIMS. In conclusion, lanthanum hexaaluminate impregnated with lowloading of palladiumignites the LHV-fuel at temperaturesbetween 200 - 250 °C. At even lower palladium loading highconversion rates of carbon monoxide and hydrogen were stillobtained, while methaneconversion decreased substantially. Thermal stability and sulphur resistance of thepalladiumcatalyst exceeds those of similar platinum andtransition metal catalysts, with respect toignition of carbonmonoxide and hydrogen. Modification of the hexaaluminate phase,i. e. byion-substitution with manganese or iron, increasescatalytic activity and stability of the crystalphase, althoughsurface areas were equal to or smaller than those forunsubstituted samples. The conversion of ammonia to nitrogenoxides or molecular nitrogen (N 2) was influenced by the inlettemperature and the catalyst composition.
