30|$|The {{wide range}} of unique {{properties}} of semiconductor GaN nanowires (NWs), along with various techniques of NW's growth, makes them promising candidates for nano-sized optoelectronics [1]. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} effort has been devoted to explore their optical, electrical, and structural properties. The main sources of deterioration of NW's properties are their <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfection</b> and residual strain. Generally, NWs are considered almost strain-free crystalline-objects without extended defects that propagate into their structure [2 - 5]. In comparison with thick planar epilayers, where the mechanism of lattice accommodation is preferably plastic and where the formation of misfit dislocation networks takes place, NWs are considered to be predominantly free of dislocations [6, 7]. At the same time, the process of deformation relaxation in NWs is not completely studied.|$|R

40|$|Summary. A {{hypothesis}} for {{the mechanism}} of oxidation in titanomagnetites is first put forward {{on the basis of}} new oxidation data for pure magnetite and the new model for cation distribution i titanomagnetites. Contrary to previous claims by other workers, it is shown that single-phase pinel oxidation products of titano-magnetites can only be produced under very exacting circumstances. Low-temperature magnetic measurements on such synthetic, oxidized materials were made to show the formation of magnetite by the decomposition ofthe metastable oxidation products of titanomagnetites on prolonged heating at moderate (~ 390 ~ C) temperatures. This magnetic method of detection is more sensitive than that of normal X-ray diffraction. It is concluded that previous claims of an increase in magnetization due to the formation of synthetic single-phase, highly oxidized titanomagnetites must be due to the formation of undetected magnetite. LTHOUGH very little work has been done on the stabil ity of titanomagnetites, F%_xTixO 4 (0 < x < 1), to oxidation, and on the possible oxidation mechanisms, a great deal has been done on the oxidation of magnetite, F% 04, particularly to maghemite, ~-F% 0 ~, because of its commercial interest. Colombo, Fagherazzi, Gazzarini, Lanzavecchia, and Sironi (1964) studied mechanisms for the first stage of oxidation of magnetite using natural and synthetic samples made both by a high-temperature technique and by precipitation from a solu-tion. The fine-grained precipitated material produces cubic ~-F% 03, but the natural samples and those synthesized at high temperature, both of which have small specific surface and low degree of <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfection,</b> were found to produce mainly rhombohedral haematite, a-F% 03, as a surface layer, and a solid solution of FeaO 4 and ~-F% 0 a in the interior of the grains. The effect of hydration is also important, and water may be incorporated in the material in the course of precipita-tion or be absorbed ue to the large specific surface area of fine grain powders.

40|$|In {{continuation}} {{of the study of}} the thermoelectric effect, previously described by Goetz and Hasler, existing between the two halves of the same bismuth single crystal, of which one has been crystallized within, and the other outside of a strong magnetic field (21, 000 gauss), the density and the specific resistance of different sections of these crystals, grown by the discontinuous method, have now been measured. The change of density of "magnetic" crystals. The density of perfect crystals grown under normal conditions was found to be between 9. 82 and 9. 83 i. e., 0. 2 percent higher than the values of other authors. Furthermore, it was found that any <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfection</b> such as twinning, etc., decreases the density; that, further there exists a difference of density between the "normal" and the "magnetic" half of the same crystal, the sign of which depends on the orientation with which the crystal entered the field: In case the trigonal axis is normal to the axis of the rod and normal to the lines of force, the "magnetic" half shows an increase of density, whereas the opposite is true in case the principal axis is parallel to the rod (and therefore parallel to the direction of growth and to the heat-flow). The difference of density is ca. 0. 3 percent but can be several percent in imperfect crystals. The purity of the metal affects the change of the density. The results indicate that the ideally pure metal would not be affected by the magnetic treatment. The specific resistance of "magnetic" crystals. The values of the specific resistance obtained on "normal" single crystals agree approximately with the results obtained by Bridgman and Kapitza and also with those obtained by spectroscopic analysis. The value of ρ∥/ρ⊥ was found to be much larger for bismuth, being sensitive to the "magnetic" treatment. There is a small change of resistance between the normal and the magnetic half, depending on the orientation of the crystal to the field. In case the orientation is such as to decrease the density the resistance increases and vice versa. The accuracy necessary for the satisfactory quantitative determination of the change could not yet be reached, since the change is of the magnitude of 0. 5 percent. An attempt is made to combine the phenomena of the magnetic effect thus far known. It seems probable that the influence of the magnetic field upon the formation of a crystal consists of a change within the mosaic structure of the lattice. The investigation is being continued...|$|R

As the sintering temperature becomes lower, the structural imperfections of the MgB 2 material are increased, as reflected by detailed X-ray refinement and the normal state resistivity. The <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfections,</b> caused by lattice disorder, directly affect the impurity scattering between the π and σ bands of MgB 2, resulting in a larger upper critical field. In addition, low sintering temperature keeps the grain size small, which leads to a strong enhancement of pinning, and thereby, enhanced critical current density. Owing to both the impurity scattering and the grain boundary pinning, the critical current density, irreversibility field, and upper critical field are enhanced.

Specimens taken from these wafers were previously subjected to specific thermal treatment and silicon epitaxial growth. The results of this investigation show that homogeneous, stoichiometric buried SiO₂ layers were formed beneath the silicon wafer surfaces after high-dose oxygen ion implantation (2. 0 x 10 ¹⁸ O⁺/cm², 180 keV/O⁺). No buried SiO₂ layers were observed in the low-dose wafers (1. 0 x 10 ¹⁷ O⁺/cm², 180 keV/O⁺). Solid-phase epitaxial regrowth (SPE) is strongly temperature dependent. The transition from amorphous (caused by ion impact) to crystalline through the SPE process is completed in the high-dose-rate wafers (∼ 33 μA/cm²), {{but not in the}} low-dose-rate wafers (∼ 17 μA/cm²).

The surfaces of the MoS 2 specimens were generally flat and smooth. However, the Raman data showed that the crystalline qualities of CVD-grown single-layer MoS 2 at 800 °C and 850 °C were relatively {{similar to those of}} mechanically exfoliated MoS 2 whereas the crystalline quality of the CVD-grown single-layer MoS 2 at 900 °C was lower.

The a-lattice parameter of the sample treated with malic acid was drastically reduced, to 3. 0745, as compared to those for the undoped samples. Reduction in the a-lattice parameter is related to <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfections</b> arising from carbon substitution - as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectra - which {{play a vital role}} in enhancing Jc, Bc 2 and Birr. We have also analyzed the pinning mechanisms, and concluded that flux pinning is dominated by point and correlated pinning at lower and higher magnetic fields, respectively, for the carbon-doped samples sintered at both 700 and 900 degrees celcius. The degree of flux pinning enhancement and the ratio RHH (Bc 2 /Birr) have been estimated to guide us towards further enhancement of Jc. We argue that oe and otc pinning mechanisms, based on variation of the mean free path (e) and the critical temperature, respectively, coexist in the MgB 2 wires treated with malic acid, regardless of the sintering temperature. The oe pinning is predominant at lower operating temperatures, and otc pinning starts close to Tc, which means that spatial variation in the charge carrier mean free path is the main mechanism responsible for the flux pinning in the MgB 2 wires treated with malic acid that were sintered at 700 and 900 degrees celcius...|$|E

The particle systems investigated comprised three audio y-Fe 203 tapes, three audio Cr 02 tapes and a video metal particle tape. An absolute measure of the interaction effects within particulate tapes has been investigated by comparing the measured properties of isolated particles taken from the medium with the measured bulk properties of the medium. The results indicated negative interactions for all the samples investigated except the video metal particle tape, which indicated positive interactions. However, Al plots for all the samples however, indicated negative interactions. This {{is contrary to the}} absolute interactions measured in the video metal particle tape. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was the presence of highly localised alignment of particles, "a chaining effect", within the metal particle system. This effect allows for increased system coercivity without removing the general negative interactions characteristic of all acicular particulate media. A micromagnetic model was developed to study typical y-Fe 203 and Cr 02 particles measured experimentally in this study.

Gamma-ray anisotropy measurements of 166 m HoVO 4 showed that in low applied fields (B ≮ 0. 5 x 10 - 2 T) and temperatures of about 1 mK the antiferromagnetic domains were uniformly distributed in the a-a' plane of the tetragonal zircon crystal structure. This was interpreted in terms of pinning of the nuclei due to <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfections.</b> The spin 'flop' phase was identified in an applied field of 1. 2 x 10 - 2 T which is in good agreement with the susceptibility measurements. Demagnetisation experiments down to the relatively high residual fields of 4. 2 x 10 - 2 T and 7. 4 x 10 - 2 T and temperatures of about 2 mK showed that the effective field at the nucleus was much smaller than the applied field thus indicating that there was some antiferromagnetic ordering even at these relatively high fields. The magnetic dipole moment of 166 m Ho was estimated to be 3. 60 (6) μ N from gamma-ray anisotropy measurements of some gamma transitions of known NO parameters. This value is in good agreement with the value of 3. 69 μ N calculated for the Nilsson configuration [6337. / 2] n [5237 / 2] p for the extra-core neutron and proton respectively. Mixing ratio (δ) measurements for gamma-ray transitions between the (K π = 2 +) γ-vibrational and (K π = 0 +) ground state rotational bands of the daughter nucleus 166 Er showed that Ml transition probabilities are predominantly via ΔK = 1 band mixing which is in good agreement with systematics for deformed nuclei in this mass region. Nuclear refrigeration experiments on a powdered compressed HoVO 4 - copper pill allowed a lattice temperature of 3. 9 (3) mK to be reached. Thermal contact measurements on a similar pill showed that the effective area of contact between the salt particles and copper was only about 30 cm 2 which was {{a small fraction of the}} total surface area available. Preliminary work on a HoVO 4 - gold pill enabled a 60 Co ̲C̲o thermometer to be cooled to 6. 0 (l) mK. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the developments of novel semiconductor devices based on epitaxial wide bandgap semiconductors GaN and ZnS. The number of interesting and exciting results in physics, electronics and materials science {{of these systems}} were found in studies motivated by these devices. This thesis consists of three major topics, structural characterization and kinetic growth modeling of the GaNAs/GaAs superlattices, structural and optical characterization and solid phase recrystallization of ZnS thin films grown on GaN and sapphire substrates, and design and fabrication of GaN high power devices as well as measurement of fundamental electronic properties of GaN, such as minority carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes and critical field for electric breakdown. The set of GaNAs/GaAs superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy was analyzed by high resolution X-ray diffraction and cross—sectional transmission electron microscopy. The nitrogen incorporation and GaNAs/GaAs interface sharpness were experimentally found to strongly depend on growth temperature. The activation energies for nitrogen desorption and nitrogen to arsenic segregation were found through simple kinetic model, which is in fine agreement with experimentally obtained results. These fundamental studies provide important insights into growth of GaN on GaAs substrates, which is of significant practical importance for all electronic GaN devices. Zinc sulfide/Gallium nitride heterostructures are potentially interesting system for light emitters in blue and green part of visible spectrum, with DC low power consumption electroluminescent displays being one attractive application of these diodes. Zinc sulfide thin films grown on GaN (0001), GaAs (001) and sapphire (0001) substrates by MBE were characterized by variable temperature photoluminescence and high resolution X-ray diffraction. The structural properties of the films suffered from the large lattice mismatch between ZnS and various substrates which were used. The optical properties of the ZnS films {{were found to be}} in direct correlation with structural properties of the films. The ZnS films doped with Al and Ag grown on n and p-type GaN, and sapphire were characterized by low temperature photoluminescence and displayed bright blue luminescence. Fabricated N-ZnS/p-GaN heterostructures were characterized by current-voltage and electroluminescence. Electroluminescence was found to be centered around 390 nm, corresponding to high energy silver band, and it shifted to higher energies with increase in device voltage. Since as grown films suffered from <b>crystalline</b> <b>imperfections,</b> the ZnS thin films on sapphire were recrystallized, by annealing at temperatures above 900 °C at sulfur overpressure of 10 atm. The structural properties of samples significantly improved, indicating more than 10 -fold reduction in tilting and excellent crystallinity. The role of sulfur was discussed, and it was found that sulfur is important in preventing film evaporation, increasing boundary migration and providing compliancy to sapphire substrate. The minority carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes were measured for electrons and holes in unintentionally doped, n and p-type GaN samples grown by several different growth techniques. The experimentally observed diffusion lengths were in the 0. 2 — 0. 3 µm range for Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown samples, and 1 — 2 µm in the case of Halide Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) grown sample. In the case of MOCVD grown samples, the hole lifetime was estimated to approximately 7 ns, and electron lifetime to approximately 0. 1 ns. The same samples were structurally characterized by AFM, {{and the size of the}} defect-free regions surrounded by linear dislocations is found to be of the order of measured diffusion length, in qualitative agreement with minority carrier recombination at linear dislocations. A simple model is presented which explains an increase in minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length with a decrease in the dislocation density or increase in the size of defect-free grains. A model which explains why linear dislocations might act as recombination sites is also presented. The important advantage of nitrides and other wide band gap materials for high power devices is a smaller standoff layer thickness for the same standoff voltage, giving smaller ON-state voltage and resistance, smaller power dissipation and larger maximum current density, allowing physically smaller devices for the same power rating. The design rules for nitride based Schottky rectifiers and thyristors are presented. The critical field for electric breakdown and minority carrier recombination lifetimes are found to be important design parameters. Using modeling parameters which are well in the range currently available with GaN, and measured from fabricated devices, design results indicate the possibility of 18 µm thick GaN Schottky rectifiers and 12 µm thick A 1 GaN thyristors supporting 5 kV standoff voltage. The critical field for electric breakdown was found to be 5 MV/cm from the theoretical studies. The maximum current density for 5 kV thyristors is in the 200 — 400 A/cm^ 2 range depending on the hole lifetime, and is limited by thermal breakdown. The maximum operating frequency of 5 kV thyristors is in the 1 - 2 MHz range and also depends on the hole lifetime. Two-terminal GaN Schottky rectifiers were fabricated. The Schottky rectifiers were fabricated on thick GaN layers grown by HVPE and had a standoff voltages in the 450 V to 750 V range, depending on the thickness of the GaN film and contact geometry. Best devices were characterized with reverse current density of 10 ^(- 5) A/cm^ 2 at reverse bias of 100 V, and 4. 2 V ON-state voltage at a forward current density of 100 A/cm^ 2. Various contact geometries were investigated. It was found that mesa geometry improves ON-state voltage, but causes increase in reverse current density, while that metal field plate geometry significantly reduces reverse current density. The measured critical field for electric breakdown in GaN was found to be (2. 5 ± 0. 5) MV/cm and it approaches the theoretical estimate of 5 MV/cm. The measured values of critical field are only a lower limit since the reverse breakdown voltage was limited by premature corner and edge breakdown...|$|E
