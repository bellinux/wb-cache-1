5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were {{few and far between}} {{and by the end of}} the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of 1980 s, Indonesian arts show {{striking}} growth, due to the dynamic appearance of painting market which was often referred as the boom of paintings. This phenomenon is triggered by the change of social-political-economical conditions of Asia, which are also influencing the infrastructure and suprastructure changes of the social-politics-and economy of Indonesia. It leads to the dialectical rise {{of the class of}} economical elite in Indonesia, which is dominated by the Chinese ethnic group. This group, which was politically pressurized during New Order regime, has built a tantalous room in economy. Their involvement in the arts market can bee seen as the starting point to comprehend the economical-capitalism of Indonesian Arts. It is expected that by constructing the role of Chinese ethnic group in art market, we will obtain a <b>complete</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> the social history of arts in Indonesia...|$|R
25|$|About {{halfway through}} the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to {{consider}} two different {{ways of looking at}} the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions.

Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E

Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infra-red light.

Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the image formation process.

25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} have deteriorated significantly {{since they were}} rediscovered, {{and a number of}} 19th-century copies and drawings are important for a <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the works. A number of attempts to copy the Ajanta paintings began in the 19th-century for European and Japanese museums. Some of these works have later been lost in natural and fire disasters. In 1846 for example, Major Robert Gill, an Army officer from Madras Presidency and a painter, was appointed by the Royal Asiatic Society to make copies of the frescoes on the cave walls. Gill worked on his painting at the site from 1844 to 1863. He made 27 copies of large sections of murals, but all but four were destroyed in a fire at the Crystal Palace in London in 1866, where they were on display. Gill returned to the site, and recommenced his labours, replicating the murals until his death in 1875.|$|E
25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more <b>complete</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.|$|E
40|$|Proper {{cholesterol}} transport {{is essential}} to healthy cellular activity and any abnormality can lead to several fatal diseases. However, <b>complete</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> cholesterol homeostasis in the cell remains elusive, {{partly due to the}} wide variability in reported values for intra- and intermembrane cholesterol transport rates. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering to measure cholesterol intermembrane exchange and intramembrane flipping rates, in situ, without recourse to any external fields or compounds. We found significantly slower transport kinetics than reported by previous studies, particularly for intramembrane flipping where our measured rates are several orders of magnitude slower. We unambiguously demonstrate that the presence of chemical tags and extraneous compounds employed in traditional kinetic measurements dramatically affect the system thermodynamics, accelerating cholesterol transport rates by an order of magnitude. To our knowledge, this work provides new insights into cholesterol transport process disorders, and challenges many of the underlying assumptions used in most cholesterol transport studies to date...|$|R
