The next day, 24 March 1879, Te Whiti ordered his men to remove all the surveyors from the Waimate Plains. Though the surveyors would not leave of their own accord, the Māori quietly packed up each survey camp, loaded horses and drays and carted everything back across the Waingongoro River, between Manaia and Hawera.|$|E

500|$|In Longacre's {{first years}} as chief engraver, no {{original}} designs were required for coins. [...] Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, {{and his successor}} had time to learn arts necessary for coin production {{that he had not}} needed as a maker of print engravings. [...] These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre [...] "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. [...] Indeed I do not know that he has ever made an attempt in this art." [...] By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had [...] "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. [...] He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings." [...] Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.|$|E
40|$|Purpose]Curved peri-acetabular {{osteotomy}} (CPO) produces excellent clinical results, but {{the surgical}} procedure is technically demanding, and severe complications {{related to the}} osteotomy have been reported. To provide a safe, accurate surgical procedure, we have developed a novel method for setting the <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> and direction. We have designed and made a custom cutting guide for individual patients. The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of this new method and cutting guide. [Methods]The <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> was designed on a full-scale three-dimensional plaster model made from computed tomography (CT) data for each case. The surface of each plaster model was colour-coded according to the distance from the centre of the femoral head. A custom cutting guide was designed based on this <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> on the workstation. A titanium custom cutting guide was fabricated using rapid prototyping technology. The cutting guide directed the cutting direction of the osteotome. We evaluated the outcomes for seven consecutive hips in seven patients who underwent CPO using the system between April and December 2011. All peri-operative complications were recorded. The accuracy of the <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> was evaluated using CT data obtained two weeks after the operation. [Results]There were no major complications related to the osteotomy such as posterior column fracture or intra-articular osteotomy. The actual <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> corresponded almost exactly to the planned <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> in all cases. [Conclusions]The colour-coded plaster model and the custom cutting guide were effective for avoiding severe complications associated with a CPO...|$|R

The cutting of brittle bodies, in particular hollow bodies or plates, for example made of glass or ceramics, is a widely used technology. During the cutting process with laser radiation, it is desirable to input the largest possible heating power without exceeding the maximum permissible local power density along the <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> In the process described here, {{the surface of the}} body to be cut is heated along the <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> by the effect of the laser beam {{in such a way that}} a thermo-mechanical stress builds up leading to rupture of the body along this <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> According to the invention, the laser beam is shaped so that the beam cross-section acting on the surface of the body to be cut has a longitudinal shape along the <b>cutting</b> <b>line,</b> whereby the ratio between length and width is adjustable. The process and the device can be used, for example, to cut off the press edge of dr inking glasses, whereby the glass turns in relation to the fixed laser bea...|$|R

40|$|MasterIn {{hot rolling}} process, camber {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} defects where camber is flatness asymmetries produced by non-uniform distribution of rolling pressure. This kind of defect may cause not only the clogging of finishing mill, but also visible defects such as strip edge folds, edge cracks, holes, and scrapes in the process. In order to reduce camber for hot rolled steel strips, it is important to measure the exact camber value with information of the overall shape. This paper describes a computer vision system with new algorithm for obtaining the optimal <b>cutting</b> <b>line,</b> overall strip shape, and camber value from two area scan Charge Coupled Cameras (CCD) in hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts: <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> detection, image stitching, and camber detection. The <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> detection part determines the optimal <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> of the head and tail part of strip for endless hot rolling process. The image stitching part obtains the overall shape of a hot rolled steel strip with continuous image sequence obtained by two area scan cameras. The camber detection part measures head camber, tail camber, and whole camber of the steel strip. Through the proposed algorithm, the system satisfies time constraints for detecting the camber of the steel strip...|$|R

The starting score can also be set by focusing the laser beams (39, 40) in the area between the voltage zones (35, 36).

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for cutting a brittle body using laser radiation. The cutting of brittle bodies, in particular hollow bodies or plates, for example made of glass or ceramics, is widespread in technology.

Of these, 68 horses were from the <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> and 120 from the racing line. On the basis of 36 genomic regions classified as selection signatures by the two statistical methods, functional annotation of genes was performed in order to identify those that might have been important during formation of the <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> Forty-five genes were found to be involved in biological processes related to the muscle, skeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems, neurotransmission, muscle energy metabolism, motor activity, vision, hearing, and cognitive function.

5000|$|Multipatterning for {{advanced}} nodes is already underway. There are two styles being used. Pitch splitting such as LELELE triple patterning is preferred for bidirectional layouts, but {{is harder to}} scale. Spacer-based patterning makes use of 1D-type layouts, but requires additional masks for cutting. <b>Cutting</b> <b>lines</b> to form irregular patterns uses {{the maximum number of}} masks. However, minimum pitch lines with dense cut locations contribute to higher capacitance by adding more locations and more area of minimum spacing. 2D patterning is generally preferred, but requires sufficient exposed feature pitch, followed by sufficient splitting or division of the pitch. On the other hand, LELE, LELELE, and SADP (SID) can avoid line cuts, while SATP or SAQP with grid routing can minimize line cuts.|$|E
