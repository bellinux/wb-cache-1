40|$|A draw pin was {{replaced}} ad hoc {{with a highly}} durable piezoactuator integrated in a force control cycle. The force progression during the sheet draw-in could be accurately adjusted according to a predetermined master curve. The master curve was taken up in the unregulated process and represents the quality criteria of a formed useable part. The real-time MATLAB Simulink XPC-Target simulation tool was used to develop an adjustment strategy that connects the specific signals of the press control (such as the tappet path, the die <b>cushion</b> <b>position</b> and the die cushion force) with the reference force (i. e., the master curve) and the actual force of the piezoactuator...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{vertebrate}} evolution, {{the cardiac}} outflow vasculature {{has changed from}} a branchial arch system to a systemic and pulmonary circulatory system. However, all vertebrate hearts and outflow tracts still develop from a single heart tube. In the chick and mouse, cardiac neural crest cells divide the single outflow tract into the aorta and pulmonary arteries. Additionally, cardiac neural crest cells provide the smooth muscle of the aortic arch arteries, help to remodel the aortic arch arteries into asymmetrical structures, and contribute cardiac ganglia. I review the major contributions of cardiac neural crest cells to the outflow vasculature of the chick and mouse and apply this information to study cardiac neural crest cell contributions to vertebrates that lack a divided circulatory system. I re-evaluate the role of cardiac neural crest cells in zebrafish vasculature and find that these cells do contribute to the gill arch arteries, the ventral aorta and cardiac ganglia, {{but they do not}} contribute to myocardium. I also study the outflow tract development of the turtle Trachemys scripta to understand the process of outflow septation in a vertebrate that has a divided outflow tract but an incomplete division of the ventricle. I compare the chick outflow tract to the turtle. The formation of the proximal versus distal cushions and the appearance of smooth muscle cells within the distal cushions of the turtle are very similar to the <b>cushion</b> <b>position</b> and cell types within the cushions of the chick. In the chick, the smooth muscle positive cells in the distal cushions are derived from cardiac neural crest cells. I hypothesize that cardiac neural crest cells are also responsible for the outflow tract septation of reptiles. These results demonstrate that the pattern of cardiac neural crest cell contribution to vertebrate vasculature remains predictable and consistent, enabling future studies to focus on changes in vascular patterning caused by cardiac neural crest cells among different vertebrate lineages.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on firm performance does not adequately {{account for the}} interrelatedness of a firm's professional connections, political ties, and family business-group affiliation. Many widely-cited findings may therefore be subject to confounding bias. To address this problem, we adopt a holistic approach by assembling a new dataset covering professional, political, and family networks for 1, 290 large East Asian firms. We find that professional networks buoyed performance during the 2008 financial crisis; political and family networks did not. We provide evidence that information access is a key mechanism underlying the effect of professional networks. A one standard deviation improvement to a firm's professional network <b>position</b> <b>cushioned</b> the fall in quarterly ROA by approximately 35 % during the crisis...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{unconfirmed}} Soviet aircraft flown were MiG-25 Foxbat (YF-116); MiG-29 Fulcrum (YF-118) and Sukhoi Su-22 Fitter (YF-112). Crashes {{associated with}} the foreign aircraft included the 1979 Tonopah MiG-17 crash during training versus an F-5 and the 1984 Little Skull Mountain MiG-23 crash which killed a USAF general, Robert M. Bond. Aerial dogfights were staged between the various MiG models against virtually every fighter in US service, and against SAC’s B-52 Stratofortress and B-58 Hustlers to judge {{the ability of the}} bombers countermeasures systems, they performed radar cross-section and propulsion tests that contributed greatly to improvements in US aerial performance.All the models had quirks. The MiG-17 did not have an electric seat, so pilots had to use <b>cushions</b> to <b>position</b> themselves properly inside the cockpit. Both it and the MiG-21 had pneumatic brakes applied by squeezing a lever {{on the front of the}} stick. Many of the MiG-21s did not have steerable nose gears, making them difficult to taxi; the sign of a novice Fishbed pilot was the zigzag track he made while moving on the ground. If a pilot put the throttle back on a MiG-21, it would take a long time to spool up again when trying to accelerate. Thus many of those who flew it stayed on afterburners as much as possible. The MiG-23 did not have that problem, as it was designed for speed—but it was unstable and difficult to fly.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible influences of saddle type on {{the incidence of}} "lower back pain" in {{a cross section of}} equestrian riders. METHODS: 108 equestrian riders completed a questionnaire concerning their riding habits and whether they suffered from lower back pain. In particular they were asked whether they used a traditional style/general purpose saddle (GP) or a deep seated/Western style saddle (W). RESULTS: 48 % of the riders reported suffering from lower back pain, the incidence being higher in the GP saddle users (66 %) than in W saddle users (23 %) (P < 0. 001). Female riders had a higher incidence of lower back pain than males, 58 % v 27 % (P < 0. 005). When the genders were analysed separately for the effect of saddle type, males using the GP and W saddles had a 33 % and 6 % incidence of lower back pain respectively, while females using the GP and W saddles had a 72 % and 33 % incidence. The highest incidence of lower back pain occurred in the GP saddle users who had been riding for more than 15 years (P < 0. 07). The data also indicated a possible tendency for there to be more low back pain among riders using a short stirrup length. No other factors were found to affect the incidence of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the incidence of lower back pain between the users of the two saddle types {{may be due to the}} additional comfort, <b>cushioning,</b> postural <b>positioning,</b> and stability offered by the design of the deep seated saddle. The results suggest that, while a deep seated saddle is not suited to all equestrian activities, where possible its use should be considered because of its effect in reducing the risk of lower back pain...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of pressure ulcers and prevention before and after a quality improvement program; determine whether patient characteristics differed {{for those who did}} and did not develop pressure ulcers; identify pressure ulcer prevention implemented at admission and whether prevention and risk factors varied by pressure ulcer severity. Design. Descriptive comparative study based on two cross-sectional pressure ulcer surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006, complemented with a retrospective audit of the electronic health record and administrative system for patients identified with pressure ulcers. Setting. 1100 -bed Swedish university hospital. Participants. 612 hospitalized patients in 2002 and 632 in 2006. Main outcome measures. Prevalence of pressure ulcers and prevention (pressure-reducing mattresses; planned repositioning; chair, heel and 308 lateral <b>positioning</b> <b>cushions).</b> Results. Pressure ulcer prevalence was 23. 9 % in 2002 and 22. 9 % in 2006. When non-blanchable erythema was excluded, the prevalence was 8. 0 and 12. 0 %, respectively. The use of pressure-reducing mattresses increased while planned repositioning decreased. Those who developed ulcers were older, at-risk for ulcers, incontinent and had longer length of stay. Little preven-tion was documented at admission. Some prevention strategies and risk factors were related to severity of ulcers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere, {{we report}} {{a case of}} right radial nerve {{dysfunction}} following laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy under general anesthesia. A 75 -year-old man was intubated without excessive retroflexion, and his upper body was {{held in place by}} lateral body positioners with protective cushions over the chest and acromioclavicular joints. The patient’s head was maintained at the center and held on the operation table with a memory-foam pillow to prevent hyperextension of the neck. The arms, abducted 80 ° with the forearms supinated, were held in place on the armrests with protective <b>cushions.</b> The surgical <b>position</b> was a 20 ° head-down lithotomy position with {{the right side of the}} body lowered by 15 °. Surgery was completed successfully with no complications, and anesthesia time was 7 h and 37 min. After surgery, however, the patient complained of numbness and hypoesthesia on the radial and ulnar side, respectively, of the right arm from the elbow to the fingertips, with the boundary running between fingers 3 and 4. Dysesthesia was observed in the right fingertips of fingers 1 – 3. After 3 months of silver spike point low-frequency electrotherapy, hypoesthesia improved, while dysesthesia partially improved, in the dorsal area between right fingers 1 and 2...|$|R
40|$|The working {{environment}} {{has a major}} role in thedevelopment of many musculoskeletal problems,although most of these disorders can be avoided or at least reduced with more attention to ergonomics. 1 – 6 In particular, dental professionals often assume positions that are uncomfortable and asymmetric, keeping the head forward and rotated to the side with the arms held out from the body. This attitude, if held for prolonged periods each day, tends to overstress muscles and joints, especially those of the neck, back and shoulder, causing symptoms such as headache, neck and shoulder pain, and backache. 1 – 12 Seventy-two percent of the dentists examined by Rundcrantz and others 1 reported some pain and discomfort of the neck, shoulders or head. In support of an occupa-tional cause of the symptoms, pain and discomfort were less in subjects who had adopted ergonomic techniques, such as working in a standing position; altering the working posi-tion in relation to the patient, according to the specific area of the mouth to be worked on; using a mirror for a better view of tooth surfaces difficult to access directly; using a wedge <b>cushion</b> to better <b>position</b> the head of the patient; and interrupting work with short pauses. 1, 2 Similar results were reported by Kerosuo and others, 12 who discovered that 70 % of general dental practitioners and 72 % of orthodon-tists surveyed suffered from musculoskeletal symptoms. The sites most frequently involved were the neck (53 % o...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates issues {{central to}} {{population}} ageing in Australia. A principal policy concern is financing the retirement incomes of {{an increasing number}} of aged retirees from a shrinking working age population. The investigation has two primary aims. The first is to measure the budgetary savings that alternative social security reforms may yield, and the implications of these reforms for the economic wellbeing of the elderly. The second is to examine how the aged can become more self sufficient through an exploration of the potential role of home equity conversion, an understanding of why the labour force participation of mature age Australians is low, and how labour force participation may be promoted as retirement approaches. A microsimulation model is employed to conduct empirical analyses {{in the context of the}} new tax system introduced in July 2000. The main microsimulation exercises include measurement of the impacts of potential social security reforms and home equity conversion on the economic well-being of the elderly, and estimation of work disincentive measures, that is, effective marginal tax rates and replacement rates. The Replacement rate estimates are then used in econometric models of labour force participation. Innovative approaches are developed to overcome methodological problems that have prevented the inclusion of replacement rates in previous models. The major findings are that reforms motivated by budgetary savings can have sizeable adverse impacts on the economic well-being of the elderly. Home equity conversion can promote financial independence, but significant risks are borne by elderly homeowners in those states and regions with less buoyant house prices. Blunt work incentives are experienced by specific mature age socio-economic groups, in particular persons whose partners' incomes help to <b>cushion</b> their economic <b>position</b> on quitting employment. The replacement rate is found to have a significant impact on the participation decision of mature age persons...|$|R
