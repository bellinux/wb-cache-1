5|$|The top 100 <b>constrained</b> {{autopilot}} dynamics candidate paths {{were selected}} {{on the basis}} of their match with the satellite data from Flight 370 and their consistency with autopilot behaviour. The distribution of these paths at the intersection with the 6th handshake was then generated, with some paths outside (south) of the maximum range of the aircraft and which can therefore be eliminated. The candidate paths generated by the data error optimisation method were weighed according to the root mean square of the BFO values at each handshake. The distribution of results from these two methods were charted together, indicating that the total probability areas overlap on the 08:11 arc between approximately 35–39°S. These paths have then been extrapolated to the seventh handshake at 08:19 and <b>constrained</b> by the maximum range, intersecting the seventh arc between approximately 33.5–38.3°S.
