5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} the hormone <b>calcitonin,</b> which helps regulate blood calcium levels. Parafollicular cells produce <b>calcitonin</b> {{in response to}} high blood calcium. <b>Calcitonin</b> decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so <b>calcitonin</b> effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone. The effects of <b>calcitonin</b> are opposite those of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, <b>calcitonin</b> seems far less essential than PTH, as calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid hormone (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of calcium and {{phosphate}} homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of <b>calcitonin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scattered among {{follicular}} {{cells and}} in {{spaces between the}} spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell, parafollicular cells. These cells secrete <b>calcitonin</b> and so are also called C cells.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone and <b>calcitonin</b> (one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, {{also known}} as C cells, {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} <b>calcitonin,</b> are derived from neural crest cells, which migrate to the pharyngeal arches. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are <b>calcitonin</b> related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains <b>calcitonin</b> (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone <b>calcitonin,</b> which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by <b>calcitonin,</b> whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|Amylin also acts in bone metabolism, {{along with}} the related {{peptides}} <b>calcitonin</b> and <b>calcitonin</b> gene related peptide.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{the first}} example of {{alternative}} splicing in a transcript from a normal, endogenous gene was characterized. The gene encoding the thyroid hormone <b>calcitonin</b> {{was found to be}} alternatively spliced in mammalian cells. The primary transcript from this gene contains 6 exons; the <b>calcitonin</b> mRNA contains exons 1–4, and terminates after a polyadenylation site in exon 4. Another mRNA is produced from this pre-mRNA by skipping exon 4, and includes exons 1–3, 5, and 6. It encodes a protein known as CGRP (<b>calcitonin</b> gene related peptide). Examples of alternative splicing in immunoglobin gene transcripts in mammals were also observed in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|This {{drive to}} earlier {{diagnosis}} has also manifested {{itself on the}} European continent {{by the use of}} serum <b>calcitonin</b> measurements in patients with goiter to identify patients with early abnormalities of the parafollicular or calcitonin-producing cells within the thyroid gland. As multiple studies have demonstrated, the finding of an elevated serum <b>calcitonin</b> is associated with the finding of a medullary thyroid carcinoma in as high as 20% of cases.|$|E
25|$|The <b>calcitonin</b> {{doubling}} {{time was a}} better predictor of MTC survival than CEA but following both tests is recommended.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{where the}} {{threshold}} for thyroid surgery {{is lower than}} in the United States, an elaborate strategy that incorporates serum <b>calcitonin</b> measurements and stimulatory tests for <b>calcitonin</b> has been incorporated into the decision to perform a thyroidectomy; thyroid experts in the United States, {{looking at the same}} data sets have, for the most part, not incorporated <b>calcitonin</b> testing as a routine part of their evaluation, thereby eliminating a large number of thyroidectomies and the consequent morbidity. The European thyroid community has focused on prevention of metastasis from small medullary thyroid carcinomas; the North American thyroid community has focused more on prevention of complications associated with thyroidectomy (see American Thyroid Association guidelines below). It is not clear at this time who is correct.|$|E
25|$|While the {{increased}} serum concentration of <b>calcitonin</b> is not harmful, {{it is useful}} as a marker which can be tested in blood.|$|E
25|$|Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) {{is a form}} of thyroid {{carcinoma}} which originates {{from the}} parafollicular cells (C cells), which produce the hormone <b>calcitonin.</b>|$|E
25|$|VDR {{activation}} in the intestine, bone, kidney, and {{parathyroid gland}} cells {{leads to the}} maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and <b>calcitonin)</b> and {{to the maintenance of}} bone content.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} bisphosphonates, <b>calcitonin,</b> and ketamine. Doing nerve blocks with guanethidine appears to be harmful. Evidence for sympathetic nerve blocks generally is insufficient to support their use. Intramuscular botulinum injections may benefit people with symptoms localized to one extremity.|$|E
25|$|A second marker, {{carcinoembryonic antigen}} (CEA), also {{produced}} by medullary thyroid carcinoma, is {{released into the}} blood and it is useful as a serum or blood tumor marker. In general, measurement of serum CEA is less sensitive than serum <b>calcitonin</b> for detecting {{the presence of a}} tumor, but has less minute to minute variability and is therefore useful as an indicator of tumor mass.|$|E
25|$|P2Y receptors {{are also}} found on both neurons and glial cells. Their role is less clear {{than that of the}} P2X receptors, but it has been noted they have several {{conflicting}} functions. In some cases, these receptors act as analgesics, as P2Y1 has the ability to inhibit the action of P2X3. In other cases, the receptors contribute to nociception through the modulation of the extracellular concentration of <b>calcitonin</b> gene related peptide (CGRP). These conflicting roles are being researched further so that they may serve as potential targets {{for the development of a}} variety of therapeutic drugs.|$|E
25|$|After a thyroid nodule {{is found}} during a {{physical}} examination, {{a referral to}} an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur. Most commonly an ultrasound is performed to confirm {{the presence of a}} nodule and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter. Measurement of <b>calcitonin</b> is necessary to exclude the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a fine needle aspiration cytology test is usually performed and reported according to the Bethesda system.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-1980s, {{the group}} studied the compartimentalisation {{of the muscle}} cell upon development, {{as a model of}} {{synaptogenesis}} and in relation with the theoretical work on epigenesis. In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concommitent to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of gene transcription outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC, and a stimulation of gene transcription at the synapse by the <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide (CGRP) activating PKA and the ARIA (heregulin) activating tyrosine kinase cascades.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{remain high}} in the abdomen until the 7th month of gestation, when they move from the abdomen through the {{inguinal}} canals into {{the two sides of}} the scrotum. It has been proposed that movement occurs in two phases, under control of somewhat different factors. The first phase, movement across the abdomen to the entrance of the inguinal canal appears controlled (or at least greatly influenced) by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second phase, in which the testes move through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, is dependent on androgens (most importantly testosterone). In rodents, androgens induce the genitofemoral nerve to release <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide (CGRP), which produces rhythmic contractions of the gubernaculum, a ligament which connects the testis to the scrotum, but a similar mechanism has not been demonstrated in humans. Maldevelopment of the gubernaculum, or deficiency or insensitivity to either AMH or androgen can, therefore, prevent the testes from descending into the scrotum. Some evidence suggests there may even be an additional paracrine hormone, referred to as descendin, secreted by the testes.|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} {{mechanisms}} by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. {{as a result of}} menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears {{to be the most important}} in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of <b>calcitonin,</b> a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{function}} of the thyroid is {{the production of the}} iodine-containing thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) and the peptide hormone <b>calcitonin.</b> T3 is so named because it contains three atoms of iodine per molecule and T4 contains four atoms of iodine per molecule. The thyroid hormones have a wide range of effects on the human body. These include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} measuring <b>calcitonin</b> and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) {{concentrations in the}} blood was studied in 65 MTC patients who had abnormal <b>calcitonin</b> levels after surgery (total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection). [...] The prognosis correlated with {{the rate at which}} the postoperative <b>calcitonin</b> concentration doubles, termed the <b>calcitonin</b> doubling time (CDT), rather than the pre- or postoperative absolute <b>calcitonin</b> level: ...|$|E
2500|$|CDT {{more than}} 2 years: 41 {{patients}} out of 41 (100%) were alive {{at the end}} of the study. [...] These included 1 patient whose <b>calcitonin</b> was stable, and 11 patients who had decreasing <b>calcitonin</b> levels.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{clinical}} symptom of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma is diarrhea; occasionally a patient will have flushing episodes. [...] Both occur particularly with liver metastasis, and either symptom {{may be the}} first manifestation of the disease. [...] The flushing that occurs in medullary thyroid carcinoma is indistinguishable from that associated with carcinoid syndrome. [...] In MTC, the flushing, diarrhea, and itching (pruritis) are all caused by elevated levels of <b>calcitonin</b> gene products (<b>calcitonin</b> or <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide). [...] Alternatively, the flushing and diarrhea observed in carcinoid syndrome is caused by elevated levels of circulating serotonin.|$|E
2500|$|... and peptide hormones (e.g., <b>calcitonin,</b> C5a anaphylatoxin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), neurokinin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), cannabinoids, and oxytocin).|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} osteoblasts and osteoclasts are {{controlled}} {{by a number of}} chemical enzymes that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape. The cells also use paracrine signalling to control the activity of each other. For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by <b>calcitonin</b> and osteoprotegerin. [...] <b>Calcitonin</b> is produced by parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland, and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|There {{appear to}} be at least three {{distinct}} receptor complexes that bind with high affinity to amylin. [...] All three complexes contain the <b>calcitonin</b> receptor at the core, plus one of three receptor activity-modifying proteins, RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3.|$|E
2500|$|Mouse and rat poisons {{containing}} cholecalciferol cause hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in dogs. [...] Clinical signs include depression, loss of appetite, vomiting blood, weakness, and shock. [...] Treatment is {{as above}} for recent exposure. [...] When hypercalcemia occurs (which can take 1 to 2 weeks), treatment is with intravenous fluids (saline), diuretics, corticosteroids, and <b>calcitonin.</b> [...] Long term prognosis is good once {{the dog is}} stabilized.|$|E
2500|$|Osteoclasts are {{regulated}} by several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland, <b>calcitonin</b> from the thyroid gland, [...] and growth factor interleukin 6 (IL-6). This last hormone, IL-6, {{is one of}} the factors in the disease osteoporosis, which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand. Note that these molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast.|$|E
2500|$|Astrocytes detect {{neuronal}} {{activity and}} can release chemical transmitters, {{which in turn}} control synaptic activity. In the past, hyperalgesia {{was thought to be}} modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. [...] A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.|$|E
2500|$|Teriparatide ( [...] a {{recombinant}} {{parathyroid hormone}} [...] ) {{has been shown}} to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. Denosumab is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures but not in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone {{has been shown to}} improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. <b>Calcitonin</b> while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.|$|E
2500|$|After {{persistent}} {{peripheral tissue}} damage {{there is a}} release of several factors from the injured tissue {{as well as in}} the spinal dorsal horn. These factors increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn pain-projection neurons to ensuing stimuli, termed [...] "spinal sensitization," [...] thus amplifying the pain impulse to the brain. Release of glutamate, substance P, and <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide (CGRP) mediates NMDAR activation (originally silent because it is plugged by Mg2+), thus aiding in depolarization of the postsynaptic pain-transmitting neurons (PTN). In addition, activation of IP3 signaling and MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) such as ERK and JNK, bring about an increase in the synthesis of inflammatory factors that alter glutamate transporter function. ERK also further activates AMPARs and NMDARs in neurons. Nociception is further sensitized by the association of ATP and substance P with their respective receptors (P2X3) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), as well as activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and release of BDNF. Persistent presence of glutamate in the synapse eventually results in dysregulation of GLT1 and GLAST, crucial transporters of glutamate into astrocytes. Ongoing excitation can also induce ERK and JNK activation, resulting in release of several inflammatory factors.|$|E
