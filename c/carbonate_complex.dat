50|$|The micro-continent {{model was}} {{suggested}} by Thomas and Astini. It says that Precordillera originates from Laurentia from the south-east of the Ouachita Embayment.

Finally the continent collided with the Gondwana continent in middle Ordovician, changing the environment from a passive margin to extensive rifting. This model is strongly supported by the thick <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex</b> as well as matching fauna records.|$|E

50|$|To date, Ortek's {{commercial}} success {{is based on}} the company's patented AlkaGen Technology (an arginine bicarbonate/calcium <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex).</b> The Company plans on incorporating this technology in their sugarless soft chews, BasicBites. Arginine is a common amino acid found in many foods and is also naturally found in saliva. On tooth surfaces, arginine is broken down by certain pH rising plaque bacteria to acid-neutralizing alkali. This results in a sustained neutral or elevated oral plaque pH, which creates an optimal environment for remineralization of the teeth. The calcium component is available for enhanced remineralization and the bicarbonate, carbonate components also aids in buffering the teeth from acid attacks and support the activities of arginine and calcium. The AlkaGen technology, which is based on over 40 years of research in saliva chemistry, was licensed to the company by The Research Foundation of the State University of New York after being developed by Department of Oral Biology and Pathology at Stony Brook University. A 2008 clinical trial published in the Journal of Clinical Dentistry found that a confection with AlkaGen Technology was highly effective in preventing caries in Venezuelan children, as those consuming the confections had 62% less cavities than the placebo group. Ortek developed and commercialized two dental pastes for sensitive teeth and were based on the arginine bicarbonate/calcium carbonate technology. These products, DenClude and ProClude were sold to Colgate Palmolive in 2008. ProClude, is now called Colgate Sensitive Pro Relief Desensitizing Paste with Pro Argin Technology.|$|E

Batch tests, zeta potential measurements, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies were utilized to characterize the nature of U(VI) adsorption on ferrihydrite. Adsorption isotherms demonstrated that carbonate had {{a negative effect on}} U(VI) adsorption on ferrihydrite at pH > 6. Zeta potential measurements indicated that U(VI) was adsorbed as a cationic species (SO−UO 2 +) in the absence of carbonate and as anionic U(VI) complexes in the presence of carbonate at neutral pH. FTIR spectroscopic measurement of adsorbed U(VI) suggested that it was retained as uranyl <b>carbonate</b> <b>complexes</b> in the presence of carbonate.

Speciation study of metals in sediment provides information on the potential availability of metals (toxic) to biota under various environmental conditions. In water, the toxic metal specie is the free hydrated metal ion. The toxicity of metals depends especially on their chemical forms rather than their total metal content. The present study focuses on Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon. Earlier studies focused only on total metal concentrations in sediment and water. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine metal speciation (Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd) in the (operationally defined) sediment chemical fractions and metal speciation in reservoir water. This would reflect on metal bioavailability and toxicity. Water samples and bed sediments were collected from nine sites during the dry season and a sequential chemical fraction scheme was applied to the < 75 -μm sieve sediment fraction. Metal content in each fraction was determined by the FAAS technique. The data showed that the highest percentages of total metal content in sediment fractions were for: Fe in residual followed by reducible, Cr and Ni in residual and in reducible, Cu in organic followed by exchangeable, Zn in residual and in organic, Pb in organic and carbonate, Cd was mainly in carbonate. Total metal content in water was determined by ICP-MS technique and aqueous metal speciation was predicted using AQUACHEM software interfaced to PHREEQC geochemical computer model. The water speciation data predicted that a high percentage of Pb and Ni were present as <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex</b> species and low percentages as free hydrated ions, highest percentage of Zn as <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex</b> species followed by free hydrated ion, highest percentage of Cd as free hydrated ion followed by <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex</b> species.
