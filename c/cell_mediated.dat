5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> autoimmune reaction (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. This autoimmune, T <b>cell</b> <b>mediated,</b> process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E

An array of {{pharmacologically active substances}} is injected with the saliva of the tick, including anticoagulants, PGE2, prostacyclin, apyrase and in certain tick species antihistamines. PGE2 and prostacyclin inhibit platelet aggregation and dilate blood vessels.

25|$|Other {{cellular}} hypersensitivities include cytotoxic T <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> auto-immune disease, and {{a similar}} phenomenon; transplant rejection. Helper T cells are required to fuel {{the development of these}} diseases. In order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer T cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{has been}} identified as an important component of mammalian mucosal immune function, particularly B <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> immune responses and extrathymically derived T cells. This structure helps in the proper movement and removal of waste matter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic vessels that regulate pathogens, and lastly, might even produce early defences that prevent deadly diseases. Additionally, it is thought that this may provide more immune defences from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic system's B and T cells to fight the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them, so that immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less dangerously fight off pathogens. In addition there are different immune cells called innate lymphoid cells that function in the gut, to help the appendix maintain digestive health.|$|E
40|$|CD 4 + T <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> both delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) {{and acquired}} cellular resistance (ACR) were generated in mice after immunization with viable Listeria monocytogenes. In contrast, CD 4 + T cells from mice immunized with killed L. monocytogenes in complete Freund's adjuvant {{were capable of}} mediating only DTH but not ACR. To determine the functional difference between T <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> DTH and T <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> ACR, we examined two different populations of T cells for profiles of lymphokine production after stimulation with a specific antigen in vitro. The production of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and IL- 3 but not IL- 4 was observed in both T <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> only DTH and those mediating DTH and ACR. In this respect, both types of T cells could be categorized into the TH 1 population, and they produced macrophage chemotactic factor equally well. However, the production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was observed only in T <b>cells</b> capable of <b>mediating</b> both DTH and ACR. This result was confirmed not only by an enzyme immunoassay specific for murine IFN-gamma but also by Northern (RNA) analysis {{for the detection of}} IFN-gamma mRNA. These results suggested that the TH 1 population may be subdivided further into two distinct subsets and that the ineffectiveness of the killed bacterial vaccine may be partly explained by the dissociated development of T cell function...|$|R

25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B <b>cell</b> <b>mediated,</b> acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E
2500|$|Haseltine {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{publicly}} voice skepticism that an anti-HIV vaccine would soon be developed. At the second international HIV/AIDS meeting held in Paris in 1986 he noted that during infection the human immune response is fully activated, antiviral antibody levels are high and <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> immunity is fully active, yet the infection proceeds. [...] Therefore, known vaccine technologies which induce either one or the other or both were unlikely to work. This idea, very unpopular at the time, proved to be prophetic. The conclusion was that efforts to control the disease must rely on diagnosis, treatment and education as a vaccine would not be forthcoming soon.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{comparison}} of the effector <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> natural killer (NK) activity against mouse tumor cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against mouse tumor target cells coated with alloantisera indicated that NK cells and K-cells (effector <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> ADCC) may {{belong to the same}} subpopulation of lymphocytes, but they have a different mechanism of killing. Effector <b>cells</b> <b>mediating</b> NK activity and ADCC were nonadherent, nonphagocytic Fc receptor bearing cells that sediment at 3. 5 - 4. 5 mm/hour. Treatment with anti-Thy 1. 2 serum in the absence of complement resulted in an increase of NK activity, whereas this treatment caused a substantial loss in ADCC. Both NK activity and ADCC were equally sensitive to the in vivo or in vitro effects of X-irradiation. In vivo inoculations of high doses of hydrocortisone resulted in a reduction of NK activity, but ADCC was not affected. NK cells were trypsin-sensitive, with a profound decrease in the cytolytic activity being observed in a 4 -hour 51 Cr release assay. The activity, however, could be recovered after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Trypsin treatment did not inhibit ADCC as measured by the 18 -hour assay...|$|R
2500|$|Human {{sperm and}} eggs also lack {{molecules}} for the immune recognition of [...] "self". These immune markers are {{also known as}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens or more specifically in humans as human leukocyte antigens (HLA)). Therefore, a major question is how are human gametes recognized by immune effector cells. Specifically, their lack of MHC recognition markers should trigger the immune system, resulting in lysis of both sperm and eggs by leukocytes known as natural killer, or NK cells. These cells target and kill other cells lacking such MHC markers, a concept known as [...] "missing self". One distinct possibility is that sperm and eggs are recognized via oligosaccharides expressed on their surfaces. For example, human gametes are coated with carbohydrate sequences that have been implicated in the suppression of NK <b>cell</b> <b>mediated</b> responses.|$|E
