5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over {{the eastern part of}} the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> successor to Tiberius. Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters are <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded {{generally do not}} set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February, 20,000 spectators, a huge {{crowd for}} French rugby, {{turned out to}} watch the game against Wales. Although the Welsh {{went on to win}} 0–15, with three {{converted}} tries, they were prevented from scoring in the first half. They were <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> better team, but the French played with greater passion. Once again, while Neumeyer praised the French forwards, he singled out Guillemin for criticism, creating an imbalance in the French scrum. The Chronique de la Jeunesse, however, highlights Guillemin's dribbling with the ball. Nevertheless, for the final international match of the season against Ireland, Guillemin was dropped from the team, with approval from Reichel, although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, {{and after a}} partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. <b>Clearly</b> <b>the</b> author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E

5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight service company, witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to see <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial left turn onto a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. The tail light was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate on the flat ground {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>the</b> move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.|$|E

The SFU wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> better of the two sides.|$|E

5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} sculpture, Seneb's size {{required}} {{the creator of}} the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> opposite of the situation that actually existed. On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian was not {{the only}} {{challenger}} to Carinus' rule: the usurper M. Aurelius Julianus, Carinus' corrector Venetiae, took control of northern Italy and Pannonia after Diocletian's accession. Julianus minted coins from the mint at Siscia (Sisak, Croatia) declaring himself as emperor and promising freedom. It was all good publicity for Diocletian, and it aided in his portrayal of Carinus as a cruel and oppressive tyrant. Julianus' forces were weak, however, and were handily dispersed when Carinus' armies moved from Britain to northern Italy. As leader of the united East, Diocletian was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> greater threat. Over the winter of 284–85, Diocletian advanced west across the Balkans. In the spring, some time before the end of May, his armies met Carinus' across the river Margus (Great Morava) in Moesia. In modern accounts, the site has been located between the Mons Aureus (Seone, west of Smederevo) and Viminacium, near modern Belgrade, Serbia.|$|E
5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Williams car was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> quickest in Formula One and Hill {{went on to}} win {{the title}} ahead of his rookie {{teammate}} Jacques Villeneuve, becoming the first son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself. Taking eight wins and never qualifying off the front row, Hill enjoyed by far his most successful season. At Monaco, where his father had won five times in the 1960s, he led until his engine failed, curtailing his race and allowing Olivier Panis to take his only Formula One win. Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the Japanese Grand Prix, the final race of the year. However, Hill took the lead at the start and won both the race and the championship after the Canadian retired.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} of Sulien and his sons and grandsons the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr was an {{important}} scriptorium where texts were composed and copied. Rhygyfarch or Rhigyfarch, who was Sulien's eldest son, and may have succeeded him as bishop of St David's (after Sulien's second time in post), wrote, surely at his father’s request, his Vita Davidis or Life of St David (later translated into Welsh as Buchedd Dewi) c.1081 – c.1090. <b>Clearly</b> <b>the</b> book was intended to promote {{the restoration of the}} damaged see, especially {{in the face of the}} Norman challenge. Rhygyfarch and his brother Ieuan were both fine poets in Latin. Ieuan copied manuscripts and composed poetry (Ieuan also wrote, in Welsh, a verse to Padarn’s staff Cyrwen).|$|E
5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, {{probably}} that Easter and certainly by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage she was <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E
5|$|Political {{plans were}} thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone <b>clearly</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early {{priorities}} was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the dissident Liberals repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents {{were unwilling to}} serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without {{a majority in the}} Commons, the Conservatives {{had little choice but to}} accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.|$|E
