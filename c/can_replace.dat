5|$|Microdosing {{is another}} {{alternative}} {{to the use of}} animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing.|$|E

5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails.

5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of {{similarities between the}} innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E
5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E

5|$|At Will and Grace's apartment, Will and Val play Pyramid against Will's friends Ellen (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Rob (Tom Gallop). Grace, {{who comes}} home, is shocked when her Pyramid record with Will—2 minutes and 14 seconds—is {{the same as}} Will and Val's. Before leaving, Grace is horrified that Will called her Val. While at her office, Grace learns that Will is sick. She goes home to attend to him and is {{surprised}} to see Val there. Grace tells her that since she is home that Val can go. Val, however, does not leave. This results in the two fighting. The fight, however, is broken by Will and tells them to work the situation out. Grace admits she felt jealous of Val as she believed Val had replaced her, due to her not being there for Will. Will, however, reassures Grace that no one <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> her as his best friend. As a result, Grace and Val make up.|$|E
5|$|Outside of combat, Scarygirl navigates {{the game}} world by running, jumping, gliding, and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects. Scarygirl {{eventually}} gains {{access to a}} feather attachment that <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> the hook on her tentacle arm, allowing Scarygirl to hover and reach otherwise inaccessible locations. Stages contain deadly traps {{that have to be}} avoided, often by grappling over them, and most stages contain at least two paths through the stage, although after choosing one the option to backtrack and take the other route exists. Crystals, which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration, and heart fragments, which increase Scarygirl's maximum health, are scattered throughout stages. In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments, players will have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path.|$|E
5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he <b>can</b> <b>replace</b> it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested {{to see whether or not}} he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
