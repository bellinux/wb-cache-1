40|$|This paper {{extends the}} study of {{stationary}} gravity waves generated near the surface of Venus reported previously by Young et al. to include finite amplitude effects associated with large amplitude waves. Waves are forced near the surface of Venus by periodic forcing. The height-dependent profiles of static stability and mean wind in the Venus atmosphere play {{a very important role}} {{in the evolution of the}} nonlinear behavior of the waves, just as they do in the linear wave solutions. Certain wave properties are qualitatively consistent with linear wave theory, such as wave trapping, resonance, and wave evanescence for short horizontal wavelenghts. However, the finite amplitude solutions also exhibit many other interesting features. In particular, for forcing amplitudes representative of those that could be expected in mountainous regions such as Aphrodite Terra, waves generated near the surface can reach large amplitudes at and above <b>cloud</b> <b>levels,</b> with clear signatures in the circulation pattern. At still higher levels, the waves can reach large enough amplitude to break, unless damping rates above the clouds are sufficient to limit wave amplitude growth. Well below <b>cloud</b> <b>levels</b> the waves develop complex flow patterns as the result of finite amplitude wave-wave interactions, and waves are generated having considerably shorter horizontal wavelenghts than that associated with the forcing near the surface. Nonlinear interactions can excite waves that are resonant with the background wind and static stability fields even when the primary surface forcing does not, and these waves can dominate the wave spectrum near <b>cloud</b> <b>levels.</b> A global map of Venus topographic slopes derived from Magellan altimetry data shows that slopes of magnitude comparable to or exceeding that used to force the model are ubiquitous over the surface...|$|R

50|$|When {{viewed from}} a {{mountain}} or tall building, glories are {{often seen in}} association with a Brocken spectre, also called Mountain Spectre, the apparently enormously magnified shadow of an observer, cast (when the Sun is low) on clouds below the mountain on which the viewer is standing. The name derives from the Brocken, the tallest peak of the Harz mountain range in Germany. Because the peak is above the <b>cloud</b> <b>level</b> and the area frequently misty, conditions conducive to casting a shadow on a cloud layer are common. Giant shadows that seemed to move by themselves due to movement of the cloud layer (this movement is {{another part of the}} definition of the Brocken Spectre), and that were surrounded by glories, {{may have contributed to the}} reputation the Harz mountains hold as a refuge for witches and evil spirits.

50|$|The Jovian {{bands are}} bounded by zonal {{atmospheric}} flows (winds), called jets. The eastward (prograde) jets are {{found at the}} transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward (retrograde) jets mark the transition from belts to zones. Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, wind shear in belts is cyclonic, while in zones it is anticyclonic. The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100 m/s. These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7-1 bar. The prograde jets are generally {{more powerful than the}} retrograde jets. The vertical extent of jets is not known. They decay over two to three scale heights above the clouds, while below the <b>cloud</b> <b>level,</b> winds increase slightly and then remain constant down to at least 22 bar—the maximum operational depth reached by the Galileo Probe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approximation}} in the FPM can {{be summarized}} as follows. For each point [...] in the analysis domain [...] (star point), an approximated solution is locally constructed by using a subset of surrounding supporting points , which belong to the problem domain (local cloud of points [...] ). The approximation is computed as a linear combination of the cloud unknown nodal values (or parameters) and certain metric coefficients. These are obtained by solving a WLSQ problem at the <b>cloud</b> <b>level,</b> in which the distances between the nodal parameters and the approximated solution are minimized in a LSQ sense. Once the approximation metric coefficients are known, the problem governing PDEs are sampled at each star point by using a collocation method. The continuous variables (and their derivatives) are replaced in the sampled equations by the discrete approximated forms, and {{the solution of the}} resulting system allows calculating the unknown nodal values. Hence, the approximated solution satisfying the governing equations of the problem can be obtained. It {{is important to note that}} the highly local character of the FPM makes the method suitable for implementing efficient parallel solution schemes.|$|E
5000|$|On February 17, 1993, a snowy day, Bitlis {{was on an}} {{official}} trip by plane from the Güvercinlik Army Air Base in Ankara.

Bitlis, his aide-de-camp Fahir Işık, technician Emir Öner and the pilots, who had VIP green card certification for excellence in flying, died in the crash. The chief of staff, Gen.

40|$|In a cloud formed during {{adiabatic}} expansion, the {{droplet size}} distribution will be systematically {{related to the}} critical supersaturation of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), but this relationship can be complicated in entraining clouds. Useful information about cloud processes, such as mixing, {{can be obtained from}} direct measurements of the CCN involved in droplet nucleation. This was accomplished by interfacing two instruments for a series of flights in maritime cumulus clouds. One instrument, the counterflow virtual impactor, collected cloud droplets, and the nonvolatile residual nuclei of the droplets was then passed to a CCN spectrometer, which measured the critical supersaturation (S[subscript]c) spectrum of the droplet nuclei. The measured S[subscript]c spectra of the droplet nuclei were compared with the Sc spectra of ambient aerosol particles in order to identify which CCN were actually incorporated into droplets and to determine when mixing processes were active at different <b>cloud</b> <b>levels.</b> The droplet nuclei nearly always exhibited lower median S[subscript]c's than the ambient aerosol, as expected since droplets nucleate preferentially on particles with lower critical supersaturations. Critical supersaturation spectra from nuclei of droplets near cloud base were similar to those predicted for cloud regions formed adiabatically, but spectra of droplet nuclei from middle <b>cloud</b> <b>levels</b> showed some evidence that mixing had occurred. Near cloud top, the greatest variation in the spectra of the droplet nuclei was observed, and nuclei with high S[subscript]c's were sometimes present even within relatively large droplets. This suggests that the extent of mixing increases with height in cumulus clouds and that inhomogeneous mixing may be important near cloud top. These promising initial results suggest improvements to the experimental technique that will permit more quantitative results in future experiments...|$|R
