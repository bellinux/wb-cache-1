25|$|In the United States, ECT {{is usually}} given {{three times a}} week; in the United Kingdom, it is usually given twice a week. Occasionally it is given on a daily basis. A course usually {{consists}} of 6–12 treatments, but may be more or fewer. Following a course of ECT some patients may be given continuation or maintenance ECT with further treatments at weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals. A few psychiatrists in the US use multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT), where patients receive more than one treatment per anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy is not a required subject in US medical schools and not a required skill in psychiatric residency training. Privileging for ECT practice at institutions is a local option: no national certification standards are established, and no ECT-specific <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> experiences are required of ECT practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{converted}} to non-drafting triathlon racing Luxford began competing in Life Time Fitness Triathlon Series (amongst other races), securing numerous podium finishes. She also took second {{place at the}} 2012 Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. She then began branching out to longer distance races, including the Ironman 70.3 race series. In December 2012, in her first half Ironman distance event, she took first place at Ironman 70.3 in Canberra and then she took first place at the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship in Auckland in February 2013. Luxford continued her strong 2013 season with a second-place finish at the Ironman 70.3 European Championship in Wiesbaden and a third place a month later at the 2013 Ironman 70.3 World Championship. The following year, in 2014, against strong, competitive fields she took 2nd place at both the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship and at the Abu Dhabi International Triathlon. She also claimed the Ironman 70.3 Australian Championship title in Mandurah; however, a collision with a car whilst training meant that in her second 70.3 World Championship appearance {{she was unable to}} match her finish from the previous year, finishing 11th in Mont-Tremblant. In 2015, Luxford began working part-time in digital communications at the National Australia Bank in Melbourne whilst <b>continuing</b> <b>training</b> and competing. That year she competed in her first Ironman, finishing 6th at Ironman Asia-Pacific Championship in Melbourne and raced as a rookie at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, finishing 12th. She also competed successfully in 70.3 and Challenge Half events, winning Ironman 70.3 events in Western Sydney and Ballarat.|$|E
