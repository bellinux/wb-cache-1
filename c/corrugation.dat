5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. <b>Corrugation</b> likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E
25|$|The data {{obtained}} from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the <b>corrugation</b> of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This <b>corrugation</b> gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.|$|E

25|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> is {{a common}} issue with transit systems due to {{the high number of}} light-axle, wheel {{passages}} which result in grinding of the wheel/rail interface. Since maintenance may overlap with operations, maintenance windows (nighttime hours, off-peak hours, altering train schedules or routes) must be closely followed. In addition, passenger safety during maintenance work (inter-track fencing, proper storage of materials, track work notices, hazards of equipment near states) must be regarded at all times. At times, maintenance access problems can emerge due to tunnels, elevated structures, and congested cityscapes. Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.|$|E

Experimental investigations were carried out on five geometrical types of corrugated and simple tubes, with <b>corrugations</b> different in size and direction, subjected to axial compressive loading. In order to produce <b>corrugations,</b> an innovative solution is introduced. The results show that tubes with <b>corrugations</b> have a uniform load–displacement curve without an initial peak load. Moreover, introducing <b>corrugations</b> makes the failure mode more predictable and controllable. The latter is highly promising and of foremost interest to designers, as {{it is essential for}} reliable design of energy absorbers in practice. The experimental results show the significant effect of the presented corrugated tubes on improving the crashworthiness characteristics, controllability and collapse modes of circular tubes under axial loading...|$|R

The highest {{frequency}} (7554Hz) was found in the “overblown” condition and n was presumed as one <b>corrugation.</b> At the least flow rate, the frequency of 2452Hz compared favorably to n=3. At intermediate flow rates, several non-harmonically related frequencies occurred simultaneously suggesting that several corrugations were involved in the sound generation. In the smaller metal tube, a predominant tone appeared at 6174Hz and corresponded to n=2. A unique aspect of this whistle is that the internal flow carries both the unstable vortex downstream and the returning feedback signal upstream.|$|E

40|$|A {{perturbation}} {{analysis is}} carried out to the second order to give effective equations for Darcy-Brinkman flow through a porous channel with slightly corrugated walls. The flow is either parallel or normal to the <b>corrugations,</b> and the <b>corrugations</b> of the two walls are either in phase or half-period out of phase. The present study {{is based on the}} assumptions that the <b>corrugations</b> are periodic sinusoidal waves of small amplitude, and the channel is filled with a sparse porous medium so that the flow can be described by the Darcy-Brinkman model, which approaches the Darcian or Stokes flow limits for small or large permeability of the medium. The Reynolds number is also assumed to be so low that the nonlinear inertia can be ignored. The effects of the <b>corrugations</b> on the flow are examined, quantitatively and qualitatively, as functions of the flow direction, the phase difference, and the wavelength of the <b>corrugations,</b> as well as the permeability of the channel. It is found that the <b>corrugations</b> will have greater effects when it is nearer the Stokes' flow limit than the Darcian flow limit, and when the wavelength is shorter. For the same wavelength and phase difference, cross flow is more affected than longitudinal flow by the <b>corrugations.</b> Opposite effects can result from 180 ° out-of-phase <b>corrugations,</b> depending on the flow direction, the wavelength, as well as the permeability. © The Author(s) 2010. published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 31 May 201...|$|R

Sometimes, as men in deep thought do, he rose from his chair, and walked to and fro the four or five steps or so that conveyed him from end to end of his little room. At one of these times he chanced to look in the little looking-glass that hung between the windows, and was startled at the paleness of his face. It was quite white, indeed. Septimius was not in the least a foppish young man; careless he was in dress, though often his apparel took an unsought picturesqueness that set off his slender, agile figure, perhaps from some quality of spontaneous arrangement that he had inherited from his Indian ancestry. Yet many women might have found a charm in that dark, thoughtful face, with its hidden fire and energy, although Septimius never thought of its being handsome, and seldom looked at it. Yet now he was drawn to it by seeing how strangely white it was, and, gazing at it, he observed that since he considered it last, a very deep furrow, or <b>corrugation,</b> or fissure, it might almost be called, had indented his brow, rising from the commencement of his nose towards the centre of the forehead. And he knew it was his brooding thought, his fierce, hard determination, his intense concentrativeness for so many months, that had been digging that furrow; and it must prove indeed a potent specific of the life-water that would smooth that away, and restore him all the youth and elasticity that he had buried in that profound grave.|$|E

50|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> {{is a type}} {{of track}} wear that {{develops}} from track and train wheel set contact over time. Once this process has started it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time {{which may or may not}} develop into rail <b>corrugation</b> depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail <b>corrugation.</b> Rail <b>corrugation</b> is represented in wavelength. Typically, heavily corrugated rails experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20mm to 200mm intervals. Significant rail <b>corrugation</b> can decrease the service life span of tracks and make the replacement of the affected railroad track necessary. Rail <b>corrugation</b> is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially. Wear <b>corrugation</b> is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive <b>corrugation</b> can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail. Rail <b>corrugation</b> may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or alloyed rails, as oppose to the traditionally used carbon composite rail. The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail <b>corrugation</b> through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of high-speed railroad tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop <b>corrugation</b> (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high performance ballasted track) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail <b>corrugation</b> with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.|$|E
50|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> may be {{prevented}} by selecting rails with material compositions {{that are more}} resistant to <b>corrugation.</b> Heat-treated alloy steel rails with relative hardness are the most resistant as opposed to Bessemer steels due to a greater relative hardness. Rails with a Brinell hardness of 320-360 are best for <b>corrugation</b> resistant rails. Trains may vary speed on the tracks {{in an effort to}} prevent <b>corrugation</b> from affecting sections or rail on a transit systems. Varying a train’s speed, direction, and tonnage are beneficial for combating the growth of rail, as <b>corrugation</b> is caused by continually uniform friction. On subways and major transit systems, {{it is not possible to}} vary the direction of trains, making the use of annual and bi-annual rail grinding processes more applicable.|$|E
