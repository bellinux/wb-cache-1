Two Generation III foil air bearings with the same design but possessing different initial radial clearances were tested at room temperature against an as-ground PS 304 coated journal operating at 30, 000 rpm. Increases in radial clearance were accomplished by reducing the journal's outside diameter via an in-place grinding system. From each load capacity test the bearing load <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient</b> was calculated from the rule-of-thumb (ROT) model developed for foil air bearings. The test results indicate that, {{in terms of the}} load <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient,</b> radial clearance has a direct impact on the performance of the foil air bearing. Each test bearing exhibited an optimum radial clearance that resulted in a maximum load <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Relative to this optimum value are two separate operating regimes that are governed by different modes of failure. Bearings operating with radial clearances less than the optimum exhibit load capacity coefficients that are a strong function of radial clearance and are prone to a thermal runaway failure mechanism and bearing seizure. Conversely, a bearing operating with a radial clearance twice the optimum suffered only a 20 percent decline in its maximum load <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient</b> and did not experience any thermal management problems. However, it is unknown to what degree these changes in radial clearance had on other performance parameters, such as the stiffness and damping properties of the bearings...|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{dyslexia}} is {{a complex}} and heterogeneous disorder characterized by unexpected difficulty in learning to read. Although it {{is considered to be}} biologically based, the degree of variation has made the nature and locus of dyslexia difficult to ascertain. Hypotheses regarding the cause have ranged from low-level perceptual deficits to higher order cognitive deficits, such as phonological processing and visual-spatial attention. We applied the <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient,</b> a measure obtained from a mathematical cognitive model of response times to measure how efficiently participants processed different classes of stimuli. The <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient</b> was used to test the extent to which individuals with dyslexia can be distinguished from normal reading individuals based on their ability to take advantage of word, pronounceable nonword, consonant sequence or unfamiliar context when categorizing character strings. Within subject variability of the <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient</b> across character string types was fairly regular across normal reading adults and consistent with a previous study of word perception with the <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficient</b> - words and pseudowords were processed at supercapacity and unfamiliar characters strings at limited-capacity. Two distinct patterns were observed in individuals with dyslexia. One group had a profile similar to the normal reading adults while the other group showed very little variation in capacity across conditions. It is possible that these individuals used a similar strategy for all four conditions and were able to generalize this strategy when processing unfamiliar characters. This difference across dyslexia groups may be used to identify sub-types of the disorder and suggest significant differences in word level processing among these subtypes. Therefore, this approach may be useful in further delineating among types of dyslexia, which in turn may lead to better understanding of the etiologies of dyslexia...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} heat {{conduction}} can be modeled via random {{motion of particles}} of heat energy, although these particles do not physically exist: they are considered as special formal objects. The speed of diffusion of heat particles in each material is proportional to its temperature conductivity coefficient. This mathematical model underlying the method of obtaining the effective heat conductivity coefficient of a composite material described in the previous paper conductivity of composite materials with included balls of zero heat conductivity" now is being modified {{in order to deal}} with materials with various nonzero heat conductivity and <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Namely, when a particle passes from one material to another one, having smaller heat conductivity, it is reflected from the frontier with a certain probability. As a criterion of heat conductivity, we consider the probability that a heat particle starting on one surface of a composite layer, goes to its other surface in a time shorter than T. For a homogeneous material, this probability is calculated theoretically. For a layer of a composite, we perform a multiple computational experiment modeling heat conduction, and for the desired probability we find the confidence interval, wherefrom we obtain the confidence interval for the effective temperature conductivity coefficient, and, finally, calculate the effective heat conductivity coefficient. We have considered inclusions of materials with heat conductivity and volume heat <b>capacity</b> <b>coefficients</b> differing from those of the matrix in 3 times up or down. Ball inclusions of equal size were situated in a cubic order or chaotically. The ratio of the ball radius to the size of cubes was 0. 2, 0. 3, or 0. 4. In series of 4300 randomly moving particles, in all cases considered, the difference between the effective heat conductivity coefficients and those calculated by other methods does not exceed a statistical error. The developed method makes it possible to obtain effective heat conductivity coefficients for composites with inclusions of any size and shape; it can be applied also in a case of inclusions from several materials. The results obtained are reliable and only the computer capability restricts their exactness. </p...|$|R
