40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are among the}} most prevalent psychiatric conditions, and are associated with poor quality of life and substantial economic burden. <b>Cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy</b> is an effective treatment to reduce anxiety symptoms, but is also costly and labour intensive. Cost-effectiveness could possibly be improved by delivering <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy</b> in a blended format, where face-to-face sessions are partially replaced by online sessions. The aim of this trial is to determine the cost-effectiveness of blended <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy</b> for adults with anxiety disorders, i. e. panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder, in specialized mental health care settings compared to face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy.</b> In this paper, we present the study protocol. It is hypothesized that blended <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy</b> for anxiety disorders is clinically as effective as face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy,</b> but that intervention costs may be reduced. We thus hypothesize that blended <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy</b> is more cost-effective than face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy.</b> Methods/design: In a randomised controlled equivalence trial 156 patients will be included (n = 78 in blended <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy,</b> n = 78 in face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> behavioural <b>therapy)</b> based on a power of 0. 80, calculated by using a formula to estimate the power of a cost-effectiveness analysis: n = 2 (...|$|R
25|$|For {{patients}} whose panic disorder involves agoraphobia, the traditional <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> {{approach has been}} in vivo exposure, in which the affected individual, accompanied by a therapist, is gradually exposed to the actual situation that provokes panic.|$|E
25|$|In initial studies, <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> {{was often}} contrasted with {{behavioral}} treatments {{to see which}} was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for panic disorder by David M. Clark in the UK and David H. Barlow in the US.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{developed from}} the combination of <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT {{is based on the}} theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{cognitive}} behavior therapy became to {{be known}} {{not only as a}} therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies. These therapies include, but are not limited to, rational emotive therapy, <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy,</b> acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, reality therapy/choice theory, cognitive processing therapy, EMDR, and multimodal therapy. All of these therapies are a blending of cognitive- and behavior-based elements.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Albert Ellis {{originated}} rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). Independently a {{few years}} later, psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck developed a form of psychotherapy known as <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy.</b> Both of these included relatively short, structured and present-focused techniques aimed at identifying and changing a person's beliefs, appraisals and reaction-patterns, by contrast with the more long-lasting insight-based approach of psychodynamic or humanistic therapies. Beck's approach used primarily the socratic method, and links have been drawn between ancient stoic philosophy and these cognitive therapies.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s and '70s saw {{the rapid}} growth of Western Buddhism, {{especially}} in the United States. In the 1970s, psychotherapeutic techniques using “mindfulness” were developed such as Hakomi therapy by Ron Kurtz (1934–2011), possibly the first mindfulness based therapy. Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was a very influential development, introducing the term into Western Cognitive behavioral therapy practice. Kabat-Zinn's students Zindel V. Segal, J. Mark G. Williams and John D. Teasdale later developed Mindfulness-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> (MBCT) in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Objective: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} confirming increased inflammation in {{a subset of}} adults with depression. The impact of this relationship has mostly been considered in biologically based interventions; however, it also has potential implications for psychological <b>therapies.</b> <b>Cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> is {{the most commonly used}} psychological intervention for the treatment of depression with theories around its efficacy primarily based on psychological mechanisms. However, <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> may have an effect on, and its efficacy influenced by, physiological processes associated with depression. Accordingly, the purpose of this systematic review was {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> and inflammation. Method: Studies examining the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> in people with depression and other medical conditions (e. g. cancer, diabetes and heart disease) were examined. In addition, the relationship between change in inflammatory markers and change in depressive symptoms following <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy,</b> and the influence of pre-treatment inflammation on <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> treatment response were reviewed. Results: A total of 23 studies investigating the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> were identified. In 14 of these studies, at least one reduction in an inflammatory marker was reported, increases were identified in three studies and no change was found in six studies. Three studies examined the relationship between change in inflammation and change in depressive symptoms following <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy.</b> In two of these studies, change in depressive symptoms was associated with a change in at least one inflammatory marker. Finally, three studies examined the influence of pre-treatment inflammation on treatment outcome from <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy,</b> and all indicated a poorer treatment response in people with higher premorbid inflammation. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence suggests inflammation should be considered within the context of <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy,</b> although robust studies examining the relationship are sparse, and heterogeneity between studies and populations examined was high. The potential treatment implications of the bi-directional relationship between inflammation and <b>cognitive</b> behaviour <b>therapy</b> are discussed, and recommendations for future research are proposed...|$|R

25|$|Outpatient {{treatment}} involves periodic {{visits to}} a psychiatrist for consultation {{in his or her}} office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. Initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{roots of}} CBT {{can be traced}} to the {{development}} of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of <b>cognitive</b> <b>therapy</b> in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner's studies of conditioning in 1920. Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924 with Mary Cover Jones' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children. These were the antecedents of the development of Joseph Wolpe's behavioral therapy in the 1950s. It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on Ivan Pavlov's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced Hans Eysenck and Arnold Lazarus to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on classical conditioning. One of Eysenck's colleagues, Glenn Wilson showed that classical fear conditioning in humans could be controlled by verbally induced cognitive expectations, thus opening a field of research that supports the rationale of cognitive behaviorial therapy.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} supports the use of <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of schizophrenia. A course of <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy,</b> added to the antipsychotic regimen, is now considered to be an appropriate standard of care in the United Kingdom.

METHOD: The authors summarize current practice and data supporting the use of <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> for schizophrenia. RESULTS: Five aspects of <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> for schizophrenia are addressed: 1) evidence from randomized clinical trials, 2) currently accepted core techniques, 3) similarities to and differences from other psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia, 4) differences between the United States and United Kingdom in implementation, and 5) current directions of research. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of the evidence supporting <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> for schizophrenia suggests that this technique should have more attention and support in the United States. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{specificity}} {{and magnitude}} {{of the effects of}} <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> in the treatment of bulimia nervosa were evaluated. Seventy-five patients who met strict diagnostic criteria were treated with either <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy,</b> a simplified behavioral version of this treatment, or interpersonal psychotherapy. Assessment was by interview and self-report questionnaire, and many aspects of functioning were evaluated. All three treatments resulted in an improvement in the measures of the psychopathology. <b>Cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> was more effective than interpersonal psychotherapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight, extreme attempts to diet, and self-induced vomiting. <b>Cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy</b> was more effective than behavior therapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight and extreme dieting, but it was equivalent in other respects. The findings suggest that <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy,</b> when applied to patients with bulimia nervosa, operates through mechanisms specific to this treatment and is more effective than both interpersonal psychotherapy and a simplified behavioral version of <b>cognitive</b> behavior <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
