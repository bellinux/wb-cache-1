These systems were and {{are referred to as}} ”adaptive” because they adjust <b>cycles,</b> <b>splits,</b> and offsets within some period of time based on data that is collected by detectors deployed in the corridor. In essence, these systems respond to traffic within a time frame that can be 10 to 15 minutes after data is collected(Transportation Research Board, 2010), rather than adapting in real‐time. The distinction between these two systems may be clarified by reclassify adaptive systems into two categories: responsive-adaptive and real‐time adaptive. A responsive/adaptive system collects data over several minutes or cycles, transmits the data to an offsite location where software on a central computer system compares the field data to a menu of predetermined options based on preset parameters, and implements the selected option by uploading new timing plans to the field controllers(Schmidt, 2009). There is inherent response time lag in this methodology that is reflected in {{the amount of time that}} it takes for adjustments to be made. Depending on the system and a particular system’s methodology, these adjustments are made in <b>cycles,</b> <b>splits,</b> and/or offsets and lag behind actual traffic demand. A real‐time adaptive system generally performs the same task using more complex algorithms, but with fewer constraints and no lag time.|$|R

The recuperated <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> engine {{is an alternative}} cycle {{with the potential to}} achieve higher efficiencies than could be achieved using a conventional engine <b>cycle.</b> In a <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> engine, the compression and combustion strokes are performed in separate chambers. This enables direct cooling of the compression cylinder reducing compression work, intra cycle heat recovery and low heat rejection expansion. Previously reported analysis has shown that brake efficiencies approaching 60 % are attainable, representing a 33 % improvement over current advanced heavy duty diesel engine. However, the achievement of complete, stable, compression ignited combustion has remained elusive to date.

The <b>Split</b> <b>Cycle</b> technique provides a method to further increase the thermal efficiency, by reducing the thermodynamic losses in the heat recovery system.

This relation pervades all commonly-used commercial databases and is {{insensitive to the}} choice of database used for either prices or returns. We investigate four potential causes of the empirical regularity: survivorship bias, asymmetric returns to low-priced stocks, extreme returns, {{and the effects of}} stock-split adjustments on portfolio classifications. We find that survivorship bias accounts for approximately half of the returns documented to a share-price-based hedge strategy and that re-classifications caused by stock <b>split</b> <b>adjustments</b> account for substantially all of the remaining returns. We do not find that controlling for either low-priced stocks or extreme returns is effective in purging the data of the empirical price artifact. These findings and our explanations thereof are important, as they show that there are potentially troublesome consequences of using share price as a deflator in markets-based research. In particular, we note and illustrate cause for concern when interpreting associations between share-price-scaled variables and subsequent returns as evidence of market inefficiency.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> {{engine is}} a new {{reciprocating}} internal combustion engine with a potential of a radical efficiency improvement. In this engine, the compression and combustion–expansion processes occur in different cylinders. In the compression cylinder, the charge air is compressed through a quasi-isothermal process by direct cooling of the air. The high pressure air is then heated in a recuperator using the waste heat of exhaust gas before induction to the combustion cylinder. The combustion process occurs during the expansion stroke, in a quasi-isobaric process. In this paper, a fundamental theoretical cycle analysis and one-dimensional engine simulation of the <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> engine was undertaken. The {{results show that the}} thermal efficiency (η) is mainly decided by the CR (compression ratio) and ER (expansion ratio), the regeneration effectiveness (σ), and the temperature rising ratio (N). Based on the above analysis, a system optimization of the engine was conducted. The results showed that by increasing CR from 23 to 25, the combustion and recuperation processes could be improved. By increasing the expansion ratio to 26, the heat losses during the gas exchange stroke were further reduced. Furthermore, the coolant temperatures of the compression and expansion chambers can be controlled separately to reduce the wall heat transfer losses. Compared to a conventional engine, a 21 % total efficiency improvement was achieved when the <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> was applied. It was concluded that through the system optimization, a total thermal efficiency of 53 % can be achieved on <b>split</b> <b>cycle</b> engine...|$|R

Despite improvements in controller computational power, there have been relatively few innovations in occupancy-based performance measures or integration with other data. This paper introduces and demonstrates the use of graphical performance measures based on detector occupancy ratios to verify potential split failures and other signal timing shortcomings reported to practitioners by the public. The proposed performance measures combine detector occupancy during the green phase, detector occupancy during the first five seconds of the red phase, and phase termination cause (gap out or force off). These are summarized by time of day to indicate whether the phase is undersaturated, nearly saturated, or oversaturated. These graphical performance measures and related quantitative summaries provide a first-level screening and triaging tool for practitioners to assess user concerns regarding whether sufficient green times are being provided to avoid split failures. They can also provide outcome-based feedback to staff after making <b>split</b> <b>adjustments</b> to determine whether operation improved or worsened. The paper concludes by demonstrating how the information was used to make an operational decision to re-allocate green time that {{reduced the number of}} oversaturated cycles on minor movements from 304 to 222 during a Thursday 0900 - 1500 timing plan and from 240 to 180 during a Friday 0900 - 1500 timing plan...|$|R
