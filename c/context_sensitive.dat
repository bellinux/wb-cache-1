5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> attacks, is {{initiated}} when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter with female twins, which has become a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|The series offers combo-based combat, and {{includes}} a quick time event (QTE) feature, also called <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> attacks, which is initiated when the player has weakened a foe. It allows limited control of Kratos during the QTE cinematic sequence; success ends the battle, while failure usually results in damage to the player. As well as the QTE system, Ascension features a prompt-less free-form system, allowing players the choice of when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. A grab maneuver {{can be used on}} minor foes.|$|E

25|$|Tlingit grammar {{at first}} glance appears to be highly fusional, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.|$|E
25|$|Within most scenes, {{the player}} {{can control the}} main {{character}} by moving them around the environment; they can also hold down a button to see what thoughts are going through the character's mind, and trigger them to hear an internal monologue on that thought. When the player is near an object or another character they can interact with, they will be presented with a <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> icon that represents what control they need to do. These controls include pressing {{a button on the}} DualShock controller, moving the analogue sticks in a specific manner, or rotating the motion-sensitive controller in a specific way; in the version with PlayStation Move support, further actions based on the Move controllers are also present. These actions may lead to additional actions to fully complete the interaction. Some scenes impose a timer on the player, requiring them to complete the necessary actions in time to avoid the death or incapacitation of that character. In other scenes, the player does not have full control of the character but must instead be prepared to respond to these icons in the manner of quick time events, such as during a hand-to-hand fight or while driving frantically {{on the wrong side of}} the road.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in {{the first game of the}} series.

One judge noted that [...] "it's {{a very impressive}} example of the Toronto urban loft-housing model." [...] According to a multiple award winning City of Toronto study the building is a good precedent of a <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> and well-massed mid-rise building. It is respectful of the neighbourhood houses along Markham Street to the south. Yet the massing, materials, and façade of the building take their cue from three neighbouring 19th century warehouse buildings each with a strong [...] red brick base. The three buildings are: 474 Bathurst St, Pedlar People Building at 473-489 College St, and the Ladies Wear Building at 559 College St. The City of Ottawa Design and Planning Guidelines also make reference to Ideal Lofts.

He gave high marks to the versatility of playing modes, such as vehicle control and foot battle. He also praised the PC version for its extensive online play. Ivan Sulic of IGN praised the graphics, sound, general Star Wars setting, and online mode, but was {{very critical of}} both the AI and the single-player mode. [...] "This is a multiplayer-centric third and first-person shooter, [...] means players who opt to stick to single player will have something to do, but won't be thrilled enough to desire extended play." [...] He cited three major issues with the game's single player element: its easy difficulty, its lack of cohesion, and poor AI teammates and enemies. Of the AI, Sulic stated [...] "Everyone is an idiot. The game appears to use a sort of <b>context</b> <b>sensitive</b> AI, meaning bots in the right positions will do stuff (like use turrets and vehicles and lay down cover fire), but those not immediately engaged in combat will idly stand around helping themselves to an endless breather." ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{approaches}} {{playing as}} a complex experience, to understand its links with the phenomenon of gambling, thanks to some images, emblems of elements and forces which are investigated with instruments of a hermeneutic type. This interpretation aims to contribute to spreading a pedagogical problematization of gambling, a topic which has important repercussions on the most fragile sectors {{of the population and}} which today is almost exclusively the prerogative of psychologists, sociologists and economists. In this direction, in the <b>contexts</b> <b>sensitive</b> to pathological gambling, the possibility is proposed of starting up educational paths which, thanks to operating artistically, contribute to transforming the imagery of play, not simply by opposing it to a life of duty and work, but showing how it can represent a real alternative to the literality of the experience, to the fixity of the dynamics and relations, generating pleasure and well-being. It is possible to teach how to play not as a waste of time or source of alienation, nihilism or dependence but as an expression of vivifying and transformative tensions: competition in sport, defying chance in board games, identification in role play and exhilaration in rafting...|$|R

To account for this, I endorse the unitary approach to polarity-sensitivity due to Chierchia (2006) and argue that the differences between 'vreun' and other dependent indefinites stem from the types of alternatives they activate and the way these alternatives contribute to the overall meaning...|$|R

40|$|Information Technology (IT) {{in health}} {{services}} {{has become increasingly}} important for people's wellbeing. The nature of design of these technologies is complex – even more so when the context is of a sensitive nature, such as the user's health. Furthermore, when the users are children, several additional difficulties surface. Apart from the design <b>context</b> being <b>sensitive,</b> children have cognitive and communicational limitations that make any design method employed require adaptations. This thesis is conducted within the research project Child Health Interactive Peer Support (CHIPS) at Halmstad University. The project aims at developing Online Peer Support (OPS) for advancing the wellbeing of children who have or have had cancer. The project thus presents a unique design situation, and {{the aim of this}} thesis is to answer the question: How can children participate in the design of Online Peer Support for children with cancer? In order to answer this question, a literature review was performed to identify common properties of design methods with children, children were involved in the design of OPS for children with cancer, and the lessons learned from the empirical case were discussed. The properties of design methods with children were organised into three categories and later supplemented with properties of methods for performing research in a <b>sensitive</b> <b>context.</b> The empirical material was made up of six design workshops with two groups of children who were, or had previously been treated for cancer. From the design workshops and the subsequent discussions several lessons were learned, in addition to the result from the literature review, about how children can be involved in the design of OPS for children with cancer. Based on this, seven suggestions were made for adapting methods to suit design with children in a <b>sensitive</b> <b>context...</b>|$|R
