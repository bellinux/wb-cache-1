40|$|This paper {{examines}} the housing markets {{described in the}} Philadelphia Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), launched by Mayor John Street in April 2001, {{through the lens of}} social capital indicators. In SIAP’s view, the lack of hard data on the city 2 ̆ 7 s social and human assets made it difficult for NTI or other urban revitalization efforts to evaluate urban assets with the same rigor as urban deficits. The paper uses SIAP data on three categories of assets to examine their potential implications for the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative: social institutions, individual participation, and economic and ethnic diversity. The paper argues that each of the three dimensions measures a different temporal aspect of social capital. Using economic parlance, institutions was proposed as a lagging indicator, participation as a <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicator,</b> and diversity as a leading indicator of social capital. Specifically, the paper sought to assess whether differences in social capital reinforce or cut across housing markets, and whether a social capital perspective could help identify neighborhoods with a better than average chance of succeeding in transforming themselves...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is {{continuing}} controversy regarding predictors of poor outcome following mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (mTBI). This study aimed to prospectively examine the influence of preinjury factors, injury-related factors, and postinjury factors on outcome following mTBI. METHOD: Participants were 123 patients with mTBI and 100 trauma patient controls recruited and assessed in the emergency department and followed up 1 week and 3 months postinjury. Outcome was {{measured in terms of}} reported postconcussional symptoms. Measures included the ImPACT Post-Concussional Symptom Scale and cognitive concussion battery, including Attention, Verbal and Visual memory, Processing Speed and Reaction Time modules, pre- and postinjury SF- 36 and MINI Psychiatric status ratings, VAS Pain Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist-Specific, and Revised Social Readjustment Scale. RESULTS: Presence of mTBI predicted postconcussional symptoms 1 week postinjury, along with being female and premorbid psychiatric history, with elevated HADS anxiety a <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicator.</b> However, at 3 months, preinjury physical or psychiatric problems but not mTBI most strongly predicted continuing symptoms, with concurrent indicators including HADS anxiety, PTSD symptoms, other life stressors and pain. HADS anxiety and age predicted 3 -month PCS in the mTBI group, whereas PTSD symptoms and other life stressors were most significant for the controls. Cognitive measures were not predictive of PCS at 1 week or 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Given the evident influence of both premorbid and concurrent psychiatric problems, especially anxiety, on postinjury symptoms, managing the anxiety response in vulnerable individuals with mTBI may be important to minimize ongoing sequelae.

40|$|This paper compares {{three types}} of early warning {{indicators}} of financial instability – those based on financial market prices, those based on normalized measures of total credit and those based on liabilities of financial intermediaries. Prices perform well as <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicators</b> of market conditions but are not suitable as early warning indicators. Total credit and liabilities convey similar information and perform better as early warning indicators, but liabilities are more transparent and the decomposition between core and non-core liabilities convey additional useful information...|$|R
40|$|A central {{challenge}} of investigating {{the underlying mechanisms}} of and the individual differences in young children’s behavior is the measurement of the internal physiological mechanism and the involved expressive emotions. Here, we illustrate two paradigms that assess <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicators</b> of both children’s social perception {{as well as their}} emotional expression. In one set of studies, children view situations while their eye movements are mapped onto a live scene. In these studies, children’s internal arousal is measured via changes in their pupil dilation by using eye-tracking technology. In another set of studies, we measured children's emotional expression via changes in their upper-body posture by using depth sensor imaging technology. Together, these paradigms can provide new insights into the internal mechanism and outward emotional expression involved in young children’s behavior...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Cambridge University Press {{and can be}} found at: [URL] problems are a general risk factor for adolescent alcohol use. However, their role in relation to alcohol-specific risk pathways of intergenerational transmission of alcohol use is not well understood. Further, the roles of alcohol-specific contextual influences on children's early alcohol use have been little examined. In a 20 -year prospective, multimethod study of 83 fathers and their 125 children, we considered the predictors of child alcohol use by age 13 years. The predictors included fathers' adolescent antisocial behavior and alcohol use, both parents' adult alcohol use, norms about and encouragement of child use, parental monitoring, child-reported exposure to intoxicated adults, and parent-reported child externalizing behaviors. Path models supported an association between fathers' adolescent alcohol use and children's use (β = 0. 17) that was not better explained by <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicators</b> of fathers' and children's general problem behavior. Fathers' and mothers' adult alcohol use uniquely predicted child use, and exposure to intoxicated adults partially mediated the latter path. Other family risk mechanisms were not supported. However, parental alcohol use and child alcohol use were linked in expected ways with family contextual conditions known to set the stage for alcohol use problems later in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} upper-trophic-level species as {{ecosystem}} indicators {{is determined by}} our ability to relate changes in indices of their performance to changes at lower trophic levels. Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs 50 %). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data {{than any of the}} individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicators</b> of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hip joint wear {{simulators}} {{are used}} extensively {{to simulate the}} dynamic behaviour of the human hip joint and, through the wear rate, gain a concrete indicator about the overall wear performance of different coupled bearings. Present knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of important <b>concurrent</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as the coefficient of friction, could prove helpful for the continuing improvement in applied biomaterials. A limited number of commercial or custom-made simulators have been designed specifically for friction studies but always separately from wear tests; thus, analysis of these two important parameters has remained unconnected. As a result, a new friction sensor has been designed, built, and integrated in a commercial biaxial rocking motion hip simulator. The {{aim of this study}} is to verify the feasibility of an experimental set-up in which the dynamic measurement of the friction factor could effectively be implemented in a standard wear test without compromising its general accuracy and repeatability. A short wear test was run with the new set-up for 16106 cycles. In particular, three soft-bearings (metal-on-polyethylene, W 5 28 mm) were tested; during the whole test, axial load and frictional torque about the vertical loading axis were synchronously recorded in order to calculate the friction factor. Additional analyses were performed on the specimens, before and after the test, in order to verify the accuracy of the wear test. The average friction factor was 0. 110 ¡ 0. 025. The friction sensors showed good accuracy and repeatability throughout. This innovative set-up was able to reproduce stable and reliable measurements. The results obtained encourage further investigations of this set-up for long-term assessment and using different combinations of materials...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined visual 'and auditory monitoring of independent, concurrent sources. Subjects monitored {{from one to}} eight <b>concurrent</b> visual <b>indicators</b> for the occurrence of a "launch " event. Five between-groups conditions were studied: a visual-only group, plus four audiovisual groups that differed {{in the amount of}} information provided over the auditory channel. Accuracy scores were very high for all groups. Response times showed an overall increase with display density (number of concurrent sources). A significant group x density interaction revealed an advantage of one of the audiovisual conditions compared to the visual-only group at moderate density levels (5 or 6 concurrent sources), but not at lower or higher density levels. This finding probably indicates the value of an auditory signal to reduce visual search time...|$|R

Indicators of disease severity included frequency of joint pain/stiffness, use of antiinflammatory medications, and physical functioning assessed with the Short Form 36. Bar graphs were used to show concurrent variations in OA and markers, and associations were examined using log-linear models. Results In this sample, 46...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Computer Adaptive Test {{version of}} the Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members measure (CRIS-CAT) {{consists}} of three scales measuring Extent of, Perceived Limitations in, and Satisfaction with community integration. The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The {{purposes of this study}} were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT. The CRIS-CAT was developed using item response theory methods. The purposes of this study were to assess the reliability, concurrent, known group and predictive validity and respondent burden of the CRIS-CAT. Methods This was a three-part study that included a 1) a cross-sectional field study of 517 homeless, employed, and Operation Enduring Freedom / Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans; who completed all items in the CRIS item set, 2) a cohort study with one year follow-up study of 135 OEF/OIF Veterans, and 3) a 50 -person study of CRIS-CAT administration. Conditional reliability of simulated CAT scores was calculated from the field study data, and concurrent validity and known group validity were examined using Pearson product correlations and ANOVAs. Data from the cohort were used to examine the ability of the CRIS-CAT to predict key one year outcomes. Data from the CRIS-CAT administration study were used to calculate ICC (2, 1) minimum detectable change (MDC), and average number of items used during CAT administration. Results Reliability scores for all scales were above 0. 75, but decreased {{at both ends of the}} score continuum. CRIS-CAT scores were correlated with <b>concurrent</b> validity <b>indicators</b> and differed significantly between the three Veteran groups (P[*] 0. 9. MDCs were 5. 9, 6. 2, and 3. 6, respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. Number of items (mn, SD) administered at Visit 1 were 14. 6 (3. 8) 10. 9 (2. 7) and 10. 4 (1. 7) respectively for Extent, Perceived and Satisfaction subscales. Conclusion The CRIS-CAT demonstrated sound measurement properties including reliability, construct, known group and predictive validity, and it was administered with minimal respondent burden. These findings support the use of this measure in assessing community reintegration. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: 	Osteoarthritis is {{acknowledged}} as an enduring condition, however, in epidemiological studies, half {{the participants who}} report having osteoarthritis at one time report not having it at a subsequent time. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether variations in reporting doctor-diagnosed osteoarthritis reflected <b>concurrent</b> fluctuations in <b>indicators</b> of disease severity in mid-age women. Methods: Data were from 7, 623 7, 589 participants (aged 50 - 55 years in 2001) in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. Based on self-report of doctor-diagnosed osteoarthritis at surveys in 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010, the participants were classified according to pattern of osteoarthritis reporting (e. g. 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 =‘no’ on all surveys, 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 =‘no-yes-no-yes’). Indicators of disease severity included use of anti-inflammatory medications, frequency of joint pain/stiffness, use of anti-inflammatory medications, and physical functioning assessed with the SF- 36. Bar graphs were used to show concurrent variations in osteoarthritis and markers, and associations were examined using log-linear models. Results: In this sample, 46 % reported having osteoarthritis on at least one survey, with half these cases reporting not having osteoarthritis at a later survey. Odds of reporting joint pain/stiffness often (odds ratio (OR) 7. 26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 06 - 7. 47) and using anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 4. 44, CI 2. 37 - 8. 33) were higher, and physical functioning scores were lower (OR 3. 75, CI 3. 56 - 3. 95) when participants reported having osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Variations in reporting osteoarthritis coincided with episodic fluctuations in symptoms and functioning. Inconsistent reporting of osteoarthritis could therefore seems to reflect presence of symptoms rather than measurement error and should be considered in longitudinal studies...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nigeria is a {{large and}} diverse country with {{considerable}} social and economic variation, yet little is definitively known {{about the status of}} health intervention coverage and health outcomes at a subnational level. To address this knowledge gap, we developed methods to produce a comparable set of estimates that describe the trends and levels of key health indicators at the state level for all years between 2000 and 2013. Methods: We first systematically sought out all data sources that measure indicators of interest. We sourced unit-level data where possible, but in some cases used published estimates. We extracted data on all-cause under- 5 mortality, maternal and child health interventions, health system access, and socioeconomic factors for Nigeria's 37 states from 1998 to 2013. With the exception of mortality, which we estimated using methods described elsewhere, we developed a systematic approach to generate comparable time trend estimates. First, we tested more than 100 different model specifications for each indicator, accounting for time, covariates, and space in various ways, including linear models, natural cubic spline models, and spatially linked random effects. The best model for each indicator was chosen on the basis of predictive validity in a cross-validation framework incorporating a number of potential data missingness patterns. Finally, we estimated a mean posterior function with uncertainty using Gaussian process regression. In total, we produced complete time-series estimates for 35 coverage indicators, eight outcome indicators for under- 5 health including mortality, and 16 indicators of socioeconomic status for every state in Nigeria. Findings: At the national level, most indicators have shown modest trends towards increased coverage of primary care interventions, <b>concurrent</b> with improved <b>indicators</b> of socioeconomic status and improved health outcomes. However, {{there is a great deal}} of variation within Nigeria. While all states saw a declining trend in under- 5 mortality, we estimated a difference of 137 deaths per 1000 births between the state with the lowest level of child mortality (Edo State with 72 deaths per 1000 births) and the state with the highest level of child mortality (Zamfara with 209 deaths per 1000 births) in 2013. Results for intervention coverage were even more mixed, where some states saw trends decreasing and others increasing. For example in Kebbi state, skilled antenatal care coverage increased by 10 % in the 13 year period, while Plateau saw a 15 % decrease in coverage. Interpretation: Although Nigeria overall has made progress in the delivery of major primary care interventions, we note substantial within-country variation in coverage and health outcomes, suggesting high levels of inequality within Nigeria. Our estimates allow health policymakers and donors to prioritise interventions in areas with the greatest need: to this end, an online, publically available data visualisation tool for our results is available.
