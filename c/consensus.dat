40|$|The {{identification}} of alternatively spliced transcripts {{has contributed to}} a better comprehension of developmental mechanisms, tissue-specific physiological processes and human diseases. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of alternatively spliced variants commonly leads {{to the formation of}} heteroduplexes as a result of base pairing involving exons common between the two variants. S 1 nuclease cleaves single-stranded loops of heteroduplexes and also nicks the opposite DNA strand. In order to establish a strategy for mapping alternative splice-prone sites in the whole transcriptome, we developed a method combining the formation of heteroduplexes between 2 distinct splicing variants and S 1 nuclease digestion. For 20 <b>consensuses</b> identified here using this methodology, 5 revealed a conserved splice site after inspection of the cDNA alignment against the human genome (exact splice sites). For 8 other <b>consensuses,</b> conserved splice sites were mapped at 2 to 30 bp from the border, called proximal splice sites; for the other 7 <b>consensuses,</b> conserved splice sites were mapped at 40 to 800 bp, called distal splice sites. These latter cases showed a nonspecific activity of S 1 nuclease in digesting double-strand DNA. From the 20 <b>consensuses</b> identified here, 5 were selected for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation, confirming the splice sites. These data showed the potential of the strategy in mapping splice sites. However, the lack of specificity of the S 1 nuclease enzyme is a significant obstacle that impedes the use of this strategy in large-scale studies...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To propose {{and test}} a new {{approach}} based on community detection {{in the field of}} social computing for uncovering <b>consensuses</b> and treatment principles in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: Three Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP, and Wan Fang Data) were searched for published articles on TCM treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) from their inception until September 31, 2014. Zheng classification and herb data were extracted from included articles and used to construct a Zheng classification and treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DNZCT) network with nodes denoting Zhengs and herbs and edges denoting corresponding treating relationships among them. Community detection was applied to the DNZCT and detected community structures were analyzed. Results: A network of 201 nodes and 743 edges were constructed and six communities were detected. Nodes clustered in the same community captured the same semantic topic; different communities had unique characteristics, and indicated different treatment principles. Large communities usually represented similar points of view or <b>consensuses</b> on common Zheng diagnoses and herb prescriptions; small communities might help to indicate unusual Zhengs and herbs. Conclusion: The results suggest that the community detection-based approach is useful and feasible for uncovering <b>consensuses</b> and treatment principles of DN treatment in TCM, and could be used to address other similar problems in TCM...|$|R

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the area of {{education}} policy as a subset of public policy. It focuses on the issues associated with the Czech secondary school graduation examination (maturitní zkouška), presenting especially the current thinking {{in the area of}} graduation examination from the viewpoint of education policy actors. This thesis utilises the Advocacy Coalition Framework approach to identify belief <b>consensuses</b> within the graduation examination discourse across a segment of selected expert participants. For this purpose, the Q-methodology is applied as it is fundamentally able to reveal <b>consensuses</b> and thus identify the relevant coalitions. The chapter containing the outputs of Q factor analysis constitutes a crucial part of the thesis, clearly revealing two independent schools of thought in this area. Exploratory interviews were conducted during field research and their outputs significantly contributed to the description of the established factors and advocacy coalitions...|$|R

40|$|This {{experience}} report {{aimed to}} describe {{the development of the}} educational practice undertaken with nurses for the elaboration of a care proposal directed towards newborns in the obstetric center of a public hospital, based in good practices. It describes: strategies, stages of the workshops, <b>consensuses</b> of the care provided to the newborn, and evaluation of the process. The workshops were constituted of: embracement; interacting and raising awareness; planning, validating and defining paths; problematizing the issue; integrating; sharing and defining consensuses; and reviewing and redirecting conducts. The issues problematized were: divergences relating to skin-to-skin contact, clamping of the umbilical cord, administration of the credé method and konakion (phytomenadione), and bathing, among others. The group educational practice was an important instrument for the nurses to reflect critically on and problematize their health practices collectively, and is configured as a space for democratic relationships favorable to the socialization of knowledges, partnerships, negotiations, <b>consensuses</b> regarding the care and continuous education, allowing the creation and re-creation of knowledges, with a view to transforming and innovating the care for the newborn...|$|R

5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are <b>consensus,</b> {{the exact nature of}} which bears no <b>consensus</b> itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, <b>consensus</b> and the intellect. They use <b>consensus</b> under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
