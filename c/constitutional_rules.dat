5|$|Under the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rules</b> {{governing}} protocol in {{the event}} of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Elections for the SUC {{take place}} in October and seats are filled through {{proportional}} representation (PR), with constituencies representing each faculty. The elections in 2007, saw the use of online voting for the first time, resulting in a substantial {{rise in the number}} of people who both sought election and voted. Following the changes made to the constitution and <b>constitutional</b> <b>rules</b> in 2007, the number of Councillors was reduced to one hundred from around 160; the move is an attempt to streamline the process and increase competition for seats. The SUC also elects the membership of several committees which oversee the work of the relevant elected officers and formulate Union policy. The Union Speaker is elected at the inaugural meeting of the SUC each year.|$|E
2500|$|Constitutionalism {{has been}} {{described}} as being [...] "concerned with curbing oppressive government and preserving individual freedom while retaining a realm for the exercise of legitimate governmental power". A constitution can therefore be described as [...] "he fundamental and organic law of a nation or state, establishing the conception, character, and organization of its government, as well as prescribing the extent of its sovereign power and the manner of its exercise", or a specific statute containing provisions that serve those purposes. In this article, the term constitution (with a lowercase c) refers to the body of legal rules having constitutional effect in Singapore, while Constitution (with an uppercase C) refers to the main statute containing <b>constitutional</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

6000|$|It is enjoined that {{no person}} holding any office under the United States shall {{be a member}} of either House during his {{continuance}} in office. At first sight such a rule as this appears to be good in its nature; but a comparison of the practice of the United States government with that of our own makes me think that this embargo on members of the legislative bodies is a mistake. It prohibits the President's ministers from a seat in either house, and thereby relieves them from the weight of that responsibility to which our ministers are subjected. It is quite true that the United States ministers cannot be responsible as are our ministers, seeing that the President himself is responsible, and that the Queen is not so. Indeed, according to the theory of the American Constitution, the President has no ministers. The Constitution speaks only of the principal officers of the executive departments. [...] "He" [...] (the President) [...] "may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments." [...] But in practice he has his cabinet, and the irresponsibility of that cabinet would practically cease if the members of it were subjected to the questionings of the two Houses. With us the rule which prohibits servants of the State from going into Parliament is, like many of our <b>constitutional</b> <b>rules,</b> hard to be defined, and yet perfectly understood. It may perhaps be said, with the nearest approach to a correct definition, that permanent servants of the State may not go into Parliament, and that those may do so whose services are political, depending for the duration of their term on the duration of the existing ministry. But even this would not be exact, seeing that the Master of the Rolls and the officers of the army and navy can sit in Parliament. The absence of the President's ministers from Congress certainly occasions much confusion, or rather prohibits a more thorough political understanding between the executive and the legislature than now exists. In speaking of the government of the United States in the next chapter, I shall be constrained to allude again to this subject.* ...|$|E
