For the previous classifications do not reveal the entire meaning of the RC paradigm, we propose to classify the FCCMs according to architectural cri-teria. To analyze the phenomena inside FCCMs, we introduce a formalism based on microcode, in which any <b>custom</b> <b>operation</b> performed by a field-programmed computing facility is executed as a microprogram with two basic stages: SET CONFIGURATION and EXECUTE <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>OPERATION.</b> Based on the SET=EXECUTE formalism, we then propose an architectural-based taxonomy of FCCMs. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main {{results of a}} research aimed to theoretically define and numerically apply an optimization model for the economic analysis and strategic planning of the inland logistics of maritime containers imported through the seaports of Naples and Salerno located in the Campania region (Southern Italy). The containers can transit through the regional interports at Nola and Marcianise, {{as well as through}} extra-regional locations equipped with a railway terminal, before reaching their final destinations. The programming problem minimizes the total logistic cost of the container distribution operations over the port-hinterland network, subject to flow balance conditions at all origins, intermediate and destination nodes, as well as both to non-negativity restrictions on endogenous variables and capacity constraints over the railway links. It solves for the multimodal inland traffic demand among different nodes (seaports, interports, etc.) for full and empty units disembarked in Campania and, more generally, it estimates the modal split of inland distribution traffics of containers imported in Italy by sea through the Campania seaports. The total logistic cost includes transportation costs (by road and railway), terminal and <b>customs</b> <b>operation</b> costs, and in-transit inventory holding costs. inland container logistics, multimodal transport, regional logistic system, interports, customs, dwell time, total logistic cost, mathematical programming, virtual nodes. ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{potential}} problems in ports, which {{are expected to be}} compounded with the growth of the volumes of trade, is the dwelling of goods and its consequent costs. Container dwell time equals the duration containers are discharged and transported from ships to depots in order to be stored until the time the goods owner has released containers and dismissed it from terminals. The dwelling of goods results in taking up storage yards and port lots through congestion as well as decreasing Executive efficiency in loading and discharging which may cause an increase in lay time and demurrage costs. The purpose of the current study is an Application of ELECTRE III and Shannon Entropy for Strategy Selection for decreasing the Containers Dwell Time in Iranian Seaports. Firstly, factors involving in the Containers dwell time were dealt with in a review of the literature. Secondly, Executive strategies to decrease the Containers dwell time were formalized employing Delphi method.

40|$|Since 1998 the Port of Rotterdam and Delft University of Technology {{are working}} {{together}} to make the conventional container terminals capable of coping {{the demands of the}} container terminals of the future. These demands are: the increasingly larger ships service within relatively short times at competitive costs, the increasing service demands on the landside for handling the trucks, trains and barges. In 2004 both partners participated in a multidisciplinary research project entitled The Container Terminal of the Future. The main purpose of this research project was to generate new ideas to cope the demands mentioned above. From this project they concluded {{that it is possible to}} increase the berth productivity by means of a floating crane (the Floating Container Crane) working in the basin side of the ships. Moreover it is expected that this new concept will help to alleviate container terminals congestion because there is no demand for storage or internal transport in the deep-sea terminal. Furthermore, it is also expected that the total handling costs for containers to and from the hinterland can be reduced. This report concerns the logistical and economic aspects of the Floating Container Crane (FCC) in order to collaborate with both partners (the Port of Rotterdam and Delft University of Technology). So, at the end of the year 2006 a detailed analysis related to the <b>Customs</b> <b>operation</b> was carried out with the help of Customs of Rotterdam. Thanks to this analysis some logistical problems were detected in relation to the ideal FCC concept, which means a direct container transport from the deep-sea terminal to the inland terminals. These problems leaded to finding other possibilities to use the FCC, which implied an indirect transport. At the beginning of the year 2007 an economic analysis was carried out to check if the total handling costs for containers to and from the hinterland were actually reduced. This analysis only considered the possibilities of using the FCC that,for the moment, are feasible after the Customs Analysis. In the last stage of this project, the basins of the European Ports with inland waterway connections and with a significant amount of TEU were analysed knowing where the FCC has space enough to work in the basin side of the new generation container vessels.
