50|$|Common {{household}} tower {{fans are}} also cross-flow fans. Much {{of the early}} work focused on developing the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> for both high and low-flow-rate conditions, and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One phenomenon particular to the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as turbines (pressure decrease).|$|E
40|$|High-resolution Ply {{measurements}} of the flow field inside <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fans</b> have been performed in planes normal and parallel to the fan axis, both outside and inside the impeller. The well known difficulties in obtaining the optical access inside the impeller have been overcome by allowing the internal flow planes to be illuminated by the laser light sheet or shot by the CCD camera through the moving blade vanes. Measurements have been performed in two <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fans</b> having the same two-module impeller but casing geometries based on very different design concepts. PIV data in planes normal to the rotor axis show {{a strong correlation between}} vorticity distribution and turbulent shear stresses inside the eccentric vortex of each fan. Furthermore, they provide useful elements to explain the very different performance of the two fans evidenced by their characteristic curves. Measurements in planes parallel to the impeller axis show that wide three-dimensional recirculation structures develop near the casing end walls at the discharge of the fans. These mean flow structures are responsible for the backflow into the end portions of the impeller of part of the discharged fluid, which is then transported axially by the eccentric vortex towards the rotor central disc before being discharged once again outside the impeller. In the case of <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fans</b> including few rotor modules, the existence of significant axial velocity components inside the eccentric vortex can alter substantially the flow picture, common in the current literature, resulting from 2 -D numerical models or measurements performed in a single transverse plane of the fan...|$|R

To accomplish this task, a new 20 -bladed rotor was designed in SolidWorks and imported into ANSYS-CFX, which was used to analytically determine the thrust generated at speeds ranging from 4, 000 rpm to 10, 000 rpm. Upon successful simulation, a carbon-fiber model was fabricated and tested at speeds from 4, 000 rpm to 9, 700 rpm.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedVertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) has primarily seen {{research and development}} in the two traditional fields, namely the rotary wing and jet propulsion, with each seeking incremental improvements in thrust generation and fuel efficiency, respectively. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in {{the viability of the}} <b>Cross-Flow</b> <b>Fans</b> (CFF) being the primary source of aircraft propulsion. There has been measured success in horizontal flight; however, VTOL propulsion with CFFs remains elusive. The current study seeks to determine the feasibility of combining two CFFs in a back-to-back configuration that could augment the thrust generated, thus making VTOL a reality. Making use of an optimized CFF housing, the research aimed to maximize the thrust generated in the above mentioned configuration by varying the gap between the CFFs. Computational fluid simulations of the dual CFF configuration was performed using ANSYS CFX to find the thrust generated as well as the optimal operating point. Analysis was done at three different speeds (3, 000 rpm, 5, 000 rpm and 8, 000 rpm) and four different distances between the dual CFFs (26 mm, 52 mm, 78 mm and 104 mm).

50|$|The FanWing is an {{aircraft}} configuration {{in which a}} horizontal-axis <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> is used in close conjunction with a fixed wing. The fan forces airflow over the fixed surface to provide both lift and forward thrust.|$|E
5000|$|The flow {{within a}} <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> may be broken up into three {{distinct}} regions: a vortex region near the fan discharge, called an eccentric vortex, the through-flow region, and a paddling region directly opposite. Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative, {{and as a}} result, {{only a portion of}} the impeller imparts usable work on the flow. The <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan,</b> or transverse fan, is thus a two-stage partial admission machine. The popularity of the crossflow fan in the HVAC industry comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide high pressure coefficient. Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry, the diameter readily scales to fit the available space, and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application.|$|E

A research group from Nanjing, China built and tested a Propulsive Wing wind tunnel model, demonstrating the high lift and low drag capabilities of the design.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of large jet-powered transport aircraft, {{the majority of these}} vehicles have been designed by placing thrust-generating engines either under the wings or on the fuselage to minimize aerodynamic interactions on the vehicle operation. However, advances in computational and experimental tools along with new technologies in materials, structures, and aircraft controls, etc. are enabling a high degree of integration of the airframe and propulsion system in aircraft design. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been investigating a number of revolutionary distributed propulsion vehicle concepts to increase aircraft performance. The concept of distributed propulsion is to fully integrate a propulsion system within an airframe such that the aircraft takes full synergistic benefits of coupling of airframe aerodynamics and the propulsion thrust stream by distributing thrust using many propulsors on the airframe. Some of the concepts are based on the use of distributed jet flaps, distributed small multiple engines, gas-driven multi-fans, mechanically driven multifans, <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fans,</b> and electric fans driven by turboelectric generators. This paper describes some early concepts of the distributed propulsion vehicles and the current turboelectric distributed propulsion (TeDP) vehicle concepts being studied under the NASA s Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) Project to drastically reduce aircraft-related fuel burn, emissions, and noise by the year 2030 to 2035...|$|R
50|$|The <b>cross-flow</b> or {{tangential}} <b>fan,</b> sometimes {{known as}} a tubular fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier, and is used extensively in the HVAC industry. The fan is usually long {{in relation to the}} diameter, so the flow approximately remains two-dimensional away from the ends. The CFF uses an impeller with forward curved blades, placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> {{comprises}} a radial {{arrangement of}} blades around a central axis, which {{is placed in}} a shaped duct. Rotating the fan causes air to be drawn in {{at one end of}} the duct, passed through the fan and expelled at the other end. The FanWing is a lifting rotor which uses this principle to augment lift, even at very low airspeeds, by drawing air downwards. A prototype UAV was flown in 2007.|$|E
50|$|The Propulsive Wing {{is a new}} {{patented}} UAV (Unmanned aerial vehicle) with {{extremely high}} lift and internal volume. The Propulsive Wing is a completely new class of aircraft based on an embedded, distributed <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> propulsion system within a thick wing. The fan, partially embedded within the airfoil section, draws the flow in from the suction surface and exhausts at the trailing edge. In cruise, the combination of distributed boundary-layer ingestion and wake filling increase propulsive efficiency, while distributed vectored thrust provides substantial improvements in pressure drag.|$|E

However, to compete with current methods of aircraft propulsion, further performance improvements of the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> are needed. A baseline model of a <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> geometry developed by Vought Systems in the 1970 s was scaled from a 12 - inch diameter rotor to a 6 -inch diameter rotor as a more realistic size for integration into a fan-in-wing concept to provide both thrust vectoring and boundary layer control over the wing. Using the computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS CFX, baseline performance trends were verified against previous 12 - and 6 -inch diameter models. Data from this model was then used to design a configuration of inlet guide vanes {{in an effort to}} increase the loading on the first stage of the fan and gain an improvement in pressure ratio over the baseline <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan.</b> The CFD results were then compared with experimental results from a <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> test assembly modified to replicate the CFD model with inlet guide vanes. While the application of the particular inlet guide vane configuration did not result in the desired performance improvements, it did validate that computational fluid dynamics can adequately predict the impact of various design changes on the performance of the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> as well as provide valuable insight into the behavior of the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> for future efforts in performance improvement.

Those characteristics make it very favorable as a propulsive means for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. However, further design improvements are needed for competitive comparison with existing conventional aircraft propulsion methods. The baseline configuration was scaled from a 12 -inch diameter, 30 -bladed rotor developed by Vought Systems in the 1970 s to a 6 -inch rotor as a more realistic size for integration into a propulsive wing. Using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS CFX, previous baseline configuration models were validated at full-speed range to verify the software's prediction. Then, a model with the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> embedded at the trailing edge was built and different configurations were examined. An attempt was made to improve the performance of the <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> embedded airfoil by thrust and thrust-to-power ratio, and lift and drag forces were calculated.

A parametric study determined optimum blade stagger angle using thrust, power, and thrust-to-power ratio as desired output variables. A MarkForged Mark One 3 D printer was used to print components of a carbon-fiber composite <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> rotor.

These performance characteristics were compared to a rotor of the same geometry previously manufactured from traditional carbon fiber components. The optimum stagger angle for the current 26 -bladed, 101. 6 mm (4 inch) diameter rotor was determined to be 10 ¡ forward of its previous position. The 3 D printed rotor was found to produce less thrust, but also required less power. This was thought to be caused by the outward deflection of the rotor blades due to centripetal force in conjunction with the surface roughness of the blades.

Recently, more investigations revealed that a <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> (CFF) was capable of providing the propulsion.

The design was developed based on the Gottingen 570 airfoil and generated lift coefficients of four [...] {{greater than the sum}} of the parts [...] due to the fundamental coupling between the wing and <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan.</b> The wing was characterized with Ansys' CFX solver over tip-speed ratios of zero (hover) to infinity (glide), and predicted a hover angle of 36 ¼ with 56 % of the lift coming from the airfoil. This meant that a full 90 ¼ rotation was not required to go from hover to forward flight; additionally, even while hovering, {{more than half of the}} lift was generated by the airfoil. The airfoil was manufactured from pre-impregnated carbon fiber using a mold produced by 3 D printing. Printer filament selection was based on glass transition temperature and printability. ABS filament was chosen due to its high temperature resistance and relative ease of 3 D printing.

40|$|To provide {{necessary}} {{plant protection}} in orchards, spray drops are transported to {{and into the}} apple tree canopy with an air jet from a fan sprayer. The interaction between the spray air jet and the canopy is central to effective droplet transport, spray coverage and pest control. Converging air jets were introduced {{as a way of}} improving the spray application. In this study, a two unit <b>cross-flow</b> <b>fan</b> orchard sprayer, configured as converging or plane (vertical fan units) air jets, were compared in several experiments. Inclining the top or bottom fans towards the tree created different types of converging air jets. The influence of these air jets on spray deposition, on air velocities and on forces acting on apple trees was measured. Deposition was measured throughout the season with fluorescent tracer on leaf sized filterpaper targets inside canopies. Different types of air velocity measurements were made with the fan sprayer passing the tree. Peak velocities were recorded at positions throughout apple tree canopies, and indepth measurements of several air velocity parameters were made inside, above and beyond an apple tree canopy. Velocity pulse values were integrated over time. Air velocity profiles were measured in stationary situations and compared to existing mathematical models. Forces and moments caused by the air jet striking the tree were measured with a new method, utilizing a multicomponent force transducer, placed between the tree trunk and the ground. Compared to plane air jets, converging air jets resulted in significantly higher deposition values, more uniformly distributed through the canopy. The converging air jets increased the air velocity parameters in the denser parts of the canopy, and resulted in higher air power and energy at those positions. Converging air jets transferred greater forces to the canopy. This could be explained by the ability of the converging air jets to reduce the air flow directed above the trees, thereby concentrate and increase the amount of spray liquid, penetrating into the densest part of the canopy. Finally, an increased air velocity improved deposition prerequisites. The new method for measuring forces and moments has a potential to extend and complement other application technology measuring methods.
