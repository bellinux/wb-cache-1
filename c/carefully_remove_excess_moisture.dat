40|$|Fluidized bed dryers (FBDs) {{are used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry to <b>remove</b> <b>excess</b> <b>moisture</b> from granule prior to tablet formation. As granule moisture content is reduced from its initial to final state, the velocity required to fully fluidize the granule decreases and the bed voidage decreases. The change in these fluidization properties are attributed to the decrease in the interparticle force load created by a reduction in liquid bridging as moisture is removed. During constant velocity drying, these fluidization properties result in a bubbling fluidization state, which evolves into a bubble coalescing regime as drying proceeds. This behaviour was identifiable using pressure fluctuation time-series analysis techniques. Distributor design studies using dry and wet granule in a conical fluidized bed suggest that the punched plate design limits bubble coalescence when compared to the perforated plate and Dutch weave mesh designs. Furthermore, the Dutch weave results in extensive segregation, which is undesirable from a fluidization perspective. Local drying hydrodynamic measurements using x-ray densitometry found that the punched and perforated plates generate a centralized bubbling core region during drying with a defluidized bed periphery. This fluidized core region grows as drying proceeds until the defluidized region disappears. Under the same operating conditions, a porous plate distributor creates extensive channelling and defluidization across the entire bed cross-section during the constant rate period of drying. These poor fluidization characteristics are a result of the porous plate introducing the gas into the bed as a fine dispersion. Lastly, the hydrodynamics associated with the conical vessel geometry improves the circulation and mixing patterns in fluidized bed dryers. This is especially the case in the entry region of the conical bed where the high inlet gas velocity prevents defluidization around the periphery of the bed. The straight walled geometry of the cylindrical bed resulted in defluidization in this area. As a result, the hydrodynamics associated with bubbling differ significantly between the geometries over the course of drying...|$|R

40|$|The {{depletion}} of petroleum has prompted the global oil industry {{to look at}} an alternative source for fuel from renewable energy source, {{one of which is}} biodiesel. Biodiesel is a notable alternative to the widely used petroleum-derived diesel fuel since it can be generated by domestic natural resources such as palm oil, soybeans, rapeseeds, coconuts and even recycled cooking oil, and thus reduces dependence on diminishing petroleum fuel. Interest in biodiesel has been expanding recently due to government incentives and high petroleum prices. The majority of biodiesel today is produced via base-catalyzed transesterification with methanol. In order to find the optimal values of biodiesel yield, it is suggested to find the optimum reaction temperature, reaction time and the methoxide:oil ratio. In this study, the parameters were: reaction temperature of 40, 50, and 60 (°C); reaction time of 40, 50 and 60 (minutes); and methanol to oil ratio of 4 : 1, 6 : 1, and 8 : 1. For every experiment done, raw CPO was treated with magnesium sulphate to <b>remove</b> <b>excess</b> <b>moisture</b> then heated at 50 °C and mixed with methoxide (potassium hydroxide and methanol) according to the considered parameters. The agitation speed was set at 250 rpm. After the transesterification process was completed, the hot mixture was left to settle for at least 12 hours in a separator funnel. As soon as the separation was done, two layers were formed, the lower layer of glycerine and the upper layer of palm oil methyl ester. The product of palm oil methyl ester was washed with 70 °C hot tap water for few times. The final product of biodiesel was transferred to a heated oven at 50 °C to <b>remove</b> <b>excess</b> water. The optimum biodiesel yield from the research was 88 % at methoxide:oil ratio of 6 : 1, time of 60 minutes and temperature of 60 °C.

The success could help botanists to collect and store the genes of many important tropical plants whose seeds have proved impossible to preserve so far. The seeds of many economically important tropical species such as rubber, coconut, cocoa and coffee are described as 'recalcitrant' because {{they are unable to}} be dried slowly and frozen like 'orthodox' seeds which can survive in this state for many years. Carefully done, orthodox seeds can be dried down to 5 % moisture which means there is little danger that on freezing ice will form in the tissue of the seed and kill it. Recalcitrant seeds have such a high water content that they {{have not been able to}} be dried enough to risk freezing them. A high proportion of tropical species produce recalcitrant seed which has meant that in order to preserve genetic diversity, that seed of each species has to be collected and then each successive generation grown: all of which takes time and space, which is not always available. Trials have been conducted on iackfruit by scientists at the Malaysian (University of Agriculture in Selangor. To overcome the problem of freezing seed they used instead just the embryo which contains much less moisture than the whole seed. Initially this was a difficult operation as the embryos of jackfruit and other recalcitrant species are only a few millimetres long. The embryos were coated with a solution of diethyl sulphoxide and proline to protect them from cold injury from water in the atmosphere.
