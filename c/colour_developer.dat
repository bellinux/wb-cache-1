50|$|If colour {{negative}} film is processed in conventional black and white developer, and fixed and then bleached with a bath containing hydrochloric acid and potassium dichromate solution, the resultant film, once exposed to light, can be redeveloped in <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> to produce an unusual pastel colour effect.|$|E
5000|$|Next, {{the film}} is {{developed}} to completion in the <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> bath, which contains CD-3 as the colour developing agent. When film enters the <b>colour</b> <b>developer,</b> the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or [...] "exposes") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is {{not a part of}} the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the [...] "leftover" [...] of the negative image, that is, a positive image. As the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes in situ. Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to [...] "kick off" [...] the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is changed to iron (II) EDTA ({Fe+++ EDTA} + {Ag^\circ} + Br^- -> {Fe++ EDTA} + AgBr) before fixing, and final wash. The most common processing chemistry for such films is E6, derived from a long line of developers produced for the Ektachrome range of films.|$|E

5000|$|In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) [...] transparencies, {{the film}} is first {{processed}} in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding [...] "push" [...] processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the <b>colour</b> <b>developer.</b> The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{reaction}} of solutions of the leuco dyes crystal violet lactone and N-benzoyl leuco methylene blue with acid-treated montmarillonite (as occurs with carbonless copying papers), most of the offered ye is intercalated within the interlayers of the montmorillonite structure remaining after acid attack. This phenomenon was demonstrated by XRD and also by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During acid treatment, octahedral cations are dissolved from exposed edges of the montmorillonite lamellae and amorphous ilica builds up in these areas. As a result, the BET(N 2) specific surface area increases from ~ 60 mZ/g to ~ 300 mZ/g and, consequently, the theoretical reactivity towards leuco dyes. Nevertheless, only small quantities of the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the amorphous ilica. The excellent colour intensity and, in particular, the resistance to fading {{in the light of}} the montmorillonite dye complexes may be explained by the protected position of the dye molecules within the interlayers of the montmorillonite. Montmoril lonite is capable of intercalating organic molecules between its unit layers (Fahn, 1963) and such compounds with long-chain quaternary alkyl ammonium ions have attained much importance in the paint industry as thixotropic and thickening agents (Fahn & Buckl, 1968). Reactions of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite are also becoming important in their capacity as <b>colour</b> <b>developers</b> in the acceptor sheet of carbonless copying papers (von Raven & Fended, 1980; Fenderl &von Raven, 1982). The present paper describes the results of an investigation into {{the reaction}}s of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite to form light-resistant stable complexes. Particular aspects examined were the amount of dye uptake as a function of time, and the physical and chemical changes occurring in the acid-activated montmoril lonite as a result of dye adsorption...|$|R
40|$|The various {{sustainability}} logics can be synchronised {{with the}} 3 × 3 × 3 Rubik’s Cube’s solution algorithms, and {{the relations of}} the cube’s sides define a planning strategy that provides a new scientific approach for renewable investment planning. We theoretically evaluated the various solution processes, and paralell sustainable investment planning levels following the solution levels and stages of the cube. After these various level-evaluations, we made „low-carbon interpretation” summaries. To show the various states of the cube, and to attach an explanation to the low-carbon interpretations, we used the Online Ruwix Cube Solver program. By solving the cube, we imitated the process of project development, meaning the road from complete disorder {{to the state of}} complete order. The complete state of equilibrium for Rubik’s Cube is the solved state. It’s not coincidence, that when someone sees a cube in disorder, their first idea is to solve it, since the desired state is the cube which has only single-colour sides. Rubik’s Cube has inherent harmony even in its colour setting, the choice of <b>colours</b> by the <b>developer</b> was intended, and the neighboring logic of colours is not the work of coincidence. Without the mistification of the cube, we can state that it alredy has an inherent and colorful harmony even in its visual appeal, that makes us suggest a seamless logic and perfect logic supports its construction. During the theoretical process analysis, the goal of demonstrating the various rotations was to show what kinds of cube interactions are supposed behind the advancement from state to state, meaning which cubes’/attributes’ effects on each other we have to analyse during the rotation process. We didn’t define the exact locations and interactions for these during the research, but the division of the process to phases did happen, and we also synced the solution phases to the mechanisms of project development...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAnti-HIV- 1 IgM {{antibody}} is {{an important}} immunoassay target for early HIV antibody detection. ObjectivesThe objective {{of this study is}} to determine if the early HIV antibody sensitivity of the 60 s INSTI test is due to detection of anti-HIV- 1 IgM in addition to IgG. Study DesignTo demonstrate HIV gp 41 IgM antibody capture by the INSTI HIV- 1 gp 41 recombinant antigen, an HIV-IgM ELISA was conducted with commercial HIV- 1 seroconversion samples. To demonstrate that the INSTI dye-labelled Protein A-based <b>colour</b> <b>developer</b> (CD) has affinity to human IgM, commercial preparations of purified human immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE, and IgG) were blotted onto nitrocellulose (NC) and probed with the CD to observe spot development. To determine that INSTI is able to detect anti-HIV- 1 IgM antibody, early seroconversion samples, were tested for reduced INSTI test spot intensity following IgM removal. ResultsThe gp 41 -based HIV-IgM ELISA results for 6 early seroconversion samples that were INSTI positive determined that the assay signal was due to anti-HIV- 1 IgM antibody capture by the immobilised gp 41 antigen. The dye-labelled Protein-A used in the INSTI CD produced distinct spots for purified IgM, IgA, and IgG blotted on the NC membrane. Following IgM removal from 21 HIV- 1 positive seroconversion samples with known or undetermined anti-HIV- 1 IgM levels that were western blot negative or indeterminate, all samples had significantly reduced INSTI test spot intensity. ConclusionsThe INSTI HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 Antibody Test is shown to detect anti-HIV- 1 IgM antibodies in early HIV infection which enhances its utility in early HIV diagnosis...|$|E
