50|$|<b>Carzelesin</b> (U-80244) is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug {{containing}} a relatively nonreactive chloromethyl {{precursor to the}} cyclopropyl function. Activation of <b>carzelesin</b> requires two steps, (a) hydrolysis of a phenylurethane substituent to form U-76073, followed by (b) ring closure to form the cyclopropyl-containing DNA-reactive U-76074. The formation of the DNA-reactive U-76074, via U-76073, from <b>carzelesin</b> was shown to proceed very slowly in phosphate-buffered saline (t1/2 greater than 24 h) but to occur rapidly in plasma from mouse, rat, dog, and human (initial t1/2 values ranging from 18 min for mouse to 52 min for rat) and in cell culture medium (t1/2 approximately 40 min). Although <b>carzelesin</b> was less potent in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo optimal dosage and showed low affinity for binding to DNA, it was therapeutically more efficacious against mouse L1210 leukemia than was U-76074 or adozelesin (U-73975), another cyclopropylpyrroloindole analogue which is currently in phase I clinical trials. <b>Carzelesin</b> also {{proved to be more}} efficacious than U-76074 or adozelesin against mouse pancreatic ductal 02 adenocarcinoma, a system reported to be resistant to every agent tested. <b>Carzelesin</b> was highly effective against this tumor and produced 97% tumor growth inhibition. In addition, i.v. administered <b>carzelesin</b> showed significant activity (National Cancer Institute criteria) against i.v. or s.c. implanted Lewis lung carcinoma, i.p. or s.c. implanted B16 melanoma, s.c. implanted colon 38 carcinoma, and five s.c. implanted human tumor xenografts, including clear cell Caki-1 carcinoma, colon CX-1 adenocarcinoma, lung LX-1 tumor, ovarian 2780 carcinoma, and prostatic DU-145 carcinoma. <b>Carzelesin</b> treatment produced 100% complete remissions (no palpable tumor mass at the termination of the experiment) in mice bearing early-stage human ovarian 2780. Pharmacologically, <b>carzelesin</b> proved to be relatively schedule and route independent and was highly active against i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia, regardless of whether the analogue was given i.v., i.p., s.c., or p.o. These results, collectively, suggest that <b>carzelesin</b> is absorbed and distributed well. Both <b>carzelesin</b> and adozelesin caused marked tumor shrinkage in mice bearing human lung LX-1 or advanced-stage human ovarian 2780 carcinoma; however, tumor regrowth occurred shortly after the treatment with adozelesin was stopped. Little or no apparent tumor regrowth occurred after treatment with <b>carzelesin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{synthetic}} analogs of duocarmycins include adozelesin, bizelesin, and <b>carzelesin.</b> As {{members of}} the cyclopropylpyrroloindole family, these investigational drugs have progressed into clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} cancer.|$|E
50|$|The work of Dale L. Boger {{and others}} created a better {{understanding}} of the pharmacophore and mechanism of action of the duocarmycins. This research has led to synthetic analogs including adozelesin, bizelesin, and <b>carzelesin</b> which progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Similar research that Boger utilized for comparison to his results involving elimination of cancerous tumors and antigens was centered around the use of similar immunoconjugates that were introduced to cancerous colon cells. These studies related to Boger's research involving antigen-specificity that is necessary to the success of the duocarmycins as antitumor treatments.|$|E
40|$|<b>Carzelesin</b> is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole {{analogue}} {{which acts}} as a DNA-sequence-specific alkylating agent. In this phase I study, <b>Carzelesin</b> was given as a 4 -weekly 10 min i. v. infusion to 51 patients with advanced solid tumours. Patients received a median of two courses (range 1 - 5) at one of nine dose levels: 24, 48, 96, 130, 150, 170, 210, 250 and 300 microg m(- 2). According to NCI-CTC criteria, non-haematological toxicities (grade 1 / 2) included fever, nausea and vomiting, mucositis and anorexia, none of which was clearly dose related. The dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and consisted mainly of neutropenia {{and to a lesser}} extent thrombocytopenia. From the dose level 150 microg m(- 2), the haematological toxicity (particularly thrombocytopenia) was delayed in onset, prolonged and cumulative in some patients. In several courses, double WBC nadirs occurred. The maximum tolerated dose for a single course was 300 microg m(- 2). From the dose level 170 microg m(- 2), the intended dose intensity could not be delivered to most patients receiving > 2 courses owing to cumulative haematological toxicity. The dose level with the best dose intensity for multiple courses was 150 microg m(- 2). The pharmacokinetics of <b>Carzelesin</b> and its metabolites (U- 76, 073; U- 76, 074) have been established in 31 patients during the first course of treatment using a HPLC method. <b>Carzelesin</b> exhibited linear pharmacokinetics. The concentration of U- 76, 074 (active metabolite) extended above the lower limit of quantitation (1 ng ml(- 1)) for short periods of time and only at the higher dose levels. There was no relationship between neutropenia and the AUC of the prodrug <b>Carzelesin,</b> but the presence of detectable plasma levels of the active metabolite U- 76, 074 was usually associated with a substantial decrease in ANC value...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: In a phase II trial, the {{activity}} of <b>carzelesin,</b> a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug analog, was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: <b>Carzelesin</b> was used as second- or third-line chemotherapy in patients with breast, ovarian, head and neck cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and as first-line chemotherapy in patients with colorectal and gastric cancer and melanoma. The drug was given as a bolus infusion at a 4 -weekly dose of 150 microg/m 2. A total of 140 patients were entered {{and a total of}} 285 courses were administered. RESULTS: In general, the compound was well tolerated. Myelotoxicity was the most common toxicity. Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was observed in 18. 6 % of the courses, neutropenia in 20. 3 %, thrombocytopenia in 16. 2 % and anemia in 8. 7 %. Double nadirs were seen in a total of 41 courses for neutrophils, in 40 for leukocytes and in 3 for platelets. Non-hematological toxicity was very mild. Only one partial response in a patient with melanoma was seen. CONCLUSIONS: At this dose and schedule <b>carzelesin</b> did not yield activity in the types of tumors studied.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the pharmacokinetic behavior of <b>carzelesin</b> in 31 patients receiving this drug by 10 -min intravenous infusion in a Phase I clinical trial, which {{was conducted at}} institutions in Nijmegen (institution 1) and Brussels (institution 2). The dose steps were 24, 48, 96, 130, 150, 170, 210, 250, and 300 microg/m 2. <b>Carzelesin</b> is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug that requires metabolic activation via U- 76, 073 to U- 76, 074. The lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method {{used in this study}} was 1 ng/ml for the parent drug and its metabolic products. <b>Carzelesin</b> was rapidly eliminated from plasma (elimination half-life 23 +/- 9 min; mean value +/- SD). At all dose levels, U- 76, 073 was found as early as in the first samples taken after the start of the infusion. However, the concentration of U- 76, 074 exceeded the LLQ for only short periods and only at the higher dose levels. Although the plasma levels of all three compounds were well above the respective IC 50 values obtained by in vitro clonogenic assays, they were much lower than those observed in a preclinical study in mice. There was a substantial discrepancy in the mean plasma clearance observed between patients from institution 1 (7. 9 +/- 2. 1 l h[- 1] m[- 2]) and those from institution 2 (18. 4 +/- 13. 6 l h[- 1] m[- 2]; P = 0. 038), probably reflecting problems with drug administration in the latter institution. The results recorded for patients in institution 1 indicated that the AUC increased proportionately with increasing doses. There was a good correlation between the maximal plasma concentration and the AUC, enabling future monitoring of drug exposure from one timed blood sample. Urinary excretion of <b>carzelesin</b> was below 1 % of the delivered dos...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the myelotoxicity and the anti-tumor potential of tallimustine, {{three of its}} analogues and <b>carzelesin,</b> with melphalan as reference substance. Tallimustine was tested by clonogenic assays on both human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (hCB) cells, the other compounds on hCB only. The degree of inhibition of the haemopoietic progenitors GM-CFC, CFC-E and BFU-E was evaluated after exposure to different concentrations. The same schedules were tested on five tumour cell lines. We found that the dose-response curves for tallimustine on BM and hCB cells were similar. <b>Carzelesin</b> was shown {{to be the most}} potent of the substances tested and to be the one with the best in vitro therapeutic index; of the distamycin analogues, the one bearing an alpha-bromoacrylic group (FCE 25450) had the best index. For melphalan, tallimustine and <b>carzelesin,</b> the concentration inhibiting the growth of 70 % of progenitor cells in vitro (ID 70) was similar to the concentrations found in the serum of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We conclude that hCB cells may be used instead of BM cells for in vitro myelotoxicity tests. Therapeutic indexes can be extrapolated from this model and could help in selecting the most promising analogue for further clinical development. The in vitro-active concentrations are similar to myelotoxic concentrations in patients, suggesting a predictive value for the assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} formulation {{of a new}} anti-tumour agent has often been perceived as the bottleneck in anti-cancer drug development. In order {{to increase the speed}} of this essential development step, the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) agreed in 1987 to form the Joint Formulation Working Party (JFWP). The main goal of the JFWP is to facilitate the rapid progress of a new drug through pharmaceutical developmental to preclinical toxicology and subsequently to phase I clinical trial. Under the auspices of the JFWP around 50 new agents have been developed or are currently in development. In this report we present our formulation experiences since the establishment of the JFWP with a selected number of agents: aphidicolin glycinate, bryostatin 1, carmethizole, <b>carzelesin,</b> combretastatin A 4, dabis maleate, disulphonated aluminium phthalocyanine, E. O. 9, 4 -hydroxyanisole, pancratistatin, rhizoxin, Springer pro-drug, SRI 62 - 834, temozolomide, trimelamol and V 489.
