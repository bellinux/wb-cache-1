40|$|Abstract—Multicore {{architectures}} commonly feature simultaneous multithreading (SMT), {{a hardware}} technology {{to improve the}} performance of multi-threaded applications, such as web servers. By studying a TPC-W testbed we observe that the performance of SMT for a multi-tier application strongly depends on the workload mix in execution in the system, thus prompting the need for smart management policies to decide when to enable or disable SMT. To tackle this problem, we propose the Runtime SMT Performance Optimizer (RPO), a module for the Apache web server that automates SMT activation and deactivation at runtime. Decisions rely on the estimated mix of requests in execution {{in the system and}} a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> based on historical data about the ability of each request to benefit from SMT. Experimental results indicate that RPO can gain up to 40 % in request latency compared to the best static SMT configuration policy, at the expense of a small overhead of 0. 6 % utilization on average for each core.

As the HIPC initiative was launched well after the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM 5) was published in 1993, there has been concern among compilers that the current framework does not adequately address some of the HIPC debt-related transactions. This discussion paper reviews the various debt relief mechanisms used by creditors in providing debt relief in all phases of the HIPC Initiative, sets out the current framework in BPM 5 used for monitoring debt transactions, drawing on the concepts and methodologies outlined in the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users where appropriate, and identifies gaps. The final section provides a list of issues for Committee consideration.

40|$|The often {{mentioned}} {{but never}} deeply investigated service characteristic of "no {{transfer of ownership}} " is {{a starting point for}} a property-rights based foundation of business relationships in the service industry. Looking at the distribution of property-rights between customer and service provider the service exchange could be regarded as an economic relationship {{in the sense of a}} limited in time transfer of certain kinds of property-rights: "Usus", "Fructus", "Abusus". The ownership determining right of selling all these rights to third parties will remain unchanged. By including the ownership related aspect of externalities a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> can be developed that integrates the whole service sector including information related services and services provided by non-profit organisations and the government, within one theoretical concept. Therefore relationships seem to be a necessary by-product of the economic features of services in terms of a contractual relation. However, relationships in services still remain a design variable for the service provider. No transfer of complete ownership creates serious incentive problems and the problem of being "locked in" due to dedicated investments and sunk costs. Both will cause serious behavioural uncertainty and safeguarding against opportunistic behaviour induces transaction costs. In order to promote and facilitate service transactions a service provider have to choose appropriate institutional designs of governance mechanisms that mitigate these economic consequences. 1...|$|E

In the mid- 1990 s, a growing underground economy was uncovered by chance in the Atlantic Canada lobster fishery. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police proceeds of crime unit found a series of large money transfers into a Royal Bank branch in Halifax, they thought that drug money was being moved. It {{turned out to have}} been cash sales of lobster. This represents $ 40 to $ 60 million in lost tax revenue, and a similar challenge for the common resource model for lobster fisheries management. To help answer the {{research question}} I examined the history and structure of the Atlantic Canadian lobster fishery, the impact of government and non-government policies and interactions with the lobster fishery and examined the tax evasion, statistical fraud detection and collusion/market power literature. The literature review gave rise to a number of potential variables for inclusion in a model that would serve to predict illegal and underreported activity in the lobster fishery. First, Benford’s Law was tested as a possible variable for inclusion. Non-conformity with Benford’s Law was observed in both the lobster fishery in LFA 33 and LFA 34 plus the snowcrab fishery. However, non conformance with Benford’s Law does not mean that there is certainty of fraud or human manipulation. Second, a market power screen was applied to the lobster fishery. Quantitative support for community-based differences in compliance with fisheries regulations has been demonstrated there is value in including a market power indicator variable as a variable of interest in the model. Last logistic panel data models were developed and tested. The outcome of the model building process were two models that have a better than chance discriminatory ability and a reasonable <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> that may lead to sanctions.

40|$|Abstract — In {{short-lived}} transactions, database systems ensure atomicity {{by either}} committing {{all of the}} elements <b>of</b> the <b>transaction,</b> or canceling {{all of them in}} case of an error. With long-running processes, the notion <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> takes on a different meaning, and it is no longer possible to rely on database managed transactions: we need so called compensation processes. Much like alternative paths in a use-case, compensation processes constitute the bulk of business process definition, and are error-prone. The purpose of this work is to lay the foundation for a methodology for designing compensation processes based on 1) a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> business <b>transactions</b> in terms <b>of</b> an accounting ontology, and 2) a catalogue of compensation heuristics associated with these transactions.

40|$|Contracts {{are rarely}} self-enforcing. It is both {{necessary}} and prudent for {{the parties to}} find some manner in which to guarantee their investments. Though {{it has long been}} recognized that legalistic remedies make up {{only a small part of}} the governance mechanism, the form of the non-legal structure has only recently been suggested. ^ Following Williamson I have argued that the form of the institutional structure used to support the contractual relations depends upon the character <b>of</b> the <b>transaction</b> being effectuated. Where the transaction involves idiosyncratic investment the governance mechanism is apt to be transaction-specific. Conversely, as the investments become more standardized a concomitant reduction in governance specialization results. ^ To test these propositions a modified case study method was employed. The data was evaluated by first analyzing the characteristics of the investment necessary to effectuate the exchange and then using this information to identify the form <b>of</b> the shipper-carrier <b>transaction.</b> Two broad <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> [...] standardized and idiosyncratic [...] were created and contracts grouped accordingly. Next the institutional structure supporting the rail-freight contracts was analyzed. The result was a careful pairing <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> characteristics to governance mechanisms. ^ At least three conclusions are suggested by the data. First, as Macaulay suggested years ago, contracts go beyond the four corners of the formal document. There are informal understandings, collateral to the formal terms, that are as much a part of the contract as any written term. Second, idiosyncratic and standardized transactions give rise to different governance forms. Third, the governance forms appear to be related to the characteristics of the transactions: idiosyncratic transactions give rise to specialized, transaction-specific governance that is characterized by trust relations and a realized mutuality <b>of</b> interest. Standardized <b>transactions</b> are generally governed by less specific structures that tend to be market oriented. ...|$|R

The factors are derived from the analysis <b>of</b> e-commerce <b>transactions</b> and include the transaction partners, the information and trust they need, the type of flows between the partners, the revenue generation, and the cost for premature termination <b>of</b> the <b>transaction.</b> We apply the framework to a theoretically driven BM classification and illustrate the framework with two cases of the Australian tourism industry. Our analysis reveals that transaction phases determine how mature a BM is and therefore how advanced the transfer <b>of</b> business <b>transaction</b> from traditional to online environment is. According to our results, the number <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> phases supported online is an indicato...|$|R

40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{research has}} been conducted on the definition and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> e-commerce business models, little research has integrated the support and impact <b>of</b> distinct <b>transaction</b> phases within e-commerce business models. Indeed, any channel design decisions depend on the arrangement <b>of</b> the three <b>transaction</b> phases, viz. information phase, agreement phase and fulfilment phase. Whereas in literature, a complete support <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> phases is implicitly assumed, in practice, e-commerce firms exist that consciously do not support all three transaction phases through the online channel. In cases for which only certain phases are supported in one channel, the customer is required to switch to another channel to complete the transaction. To gain an initial understanding of the relevance <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> phases, we examine the influence <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> phase support in one channel on satisfaction and reuse intention of an e-commerce website under consideration of users 2 ̆ 7 prior experiences. We conduct a laboratory experiment involving two e-commerce business models that differ only in the number <b>of</b> supported <b>transaction</b> phases via the online channel. Empirical data was analysed using a Bayesian network approach. Our analysis indicates the types of users who value partial support compared to those users who prefer full support <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> phases. The results will assist firms in meeting future challenges regarding user engagement and attraction to their online stores...|$|R
50|$|The UUCW {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} {{to the size of the}} software being developed. It is calculated based on the number and complexity of the use cases for the system. To find the UUCW for a system, each of the use cases must be identified and classified as Simple, Average or Complex based on the number <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> the use case contains. Each classification has a predefined weight assigned. Once all use cases have been classified as simple, average or complex, the total weight (UUCW) is determined by summing the corresponding weights for each use case. The following chart shows the different <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> use cases based on the number <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and the weight value assigned for each use case within the classification.|$|R
40|$|To {{a rapidly}} {{increasing}} degree, traditional organizational structures evolve in {{large parts of}} the world towards online business using modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capabilities. For efficient applications of inter-organizational information systems, the alignment between business and ICT is a key factor. In this context, business analysis using business modelling can be regarded as a first step in designing economically sustainable e-business solutions. This thesis examines how business modeling can be used to improve e-business design. We examine how business stakeholder intentions and different objectives of business collaborations can be used to obtain an explorative business model that {{can be used as a}} basis for designing e-business solutions. The thesis proposes a set of artifacts for business modeling and e-service design. In regard to business modeling, we propose methods that consider internal aspects such as strategic intentions of actors and external aspects such as business collaborations among them. Considering stakeholder intentions, we introduce a method to design business models based on goal models. A set of templates for designing goal models and a set of transformation rules to obtain business models based on goal models are proposed. To further improve business models considering business collaborations, we suggest a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> business <b>transactions</b> that considers underlying business objectives of business collaborations. Utilizing the suggested business transactions, we then propose a method to improve business modeling. Finally, we propose a method for designing e-services using business models. The methods suggested support business modelers as well as process and services designers in executing their tasks effectively. The methods have been assessed through applications in two cases...|$|R
