25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the <b>container</b> <b>walls.</b> Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

2500|$|In {{continuum}} mechanics, {{stress is}} a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is {{the measure of the}} deformation of the material.

[...] When a liquid is in a closed container under pressure, each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles. [...] The <b>container</b> <b>walls</b> and the pressure-inducing surface (such as a piston) push against them in (Newtonian) reaction.

50|$|Stokes, {{transitional}} and Newtonian settling {{describe the}} behaviour {{of a single}} spherical particle in an infinite fluid, known as free settling.

Settling that has these forces in appreciable magnitude is known as hindered settling. Subsequently semi-analytic or empirical solutions may be used to perform meaningful hindered settling calculations.|$|E

For the two cases, typical temperature fields for unsteady, one-dimensional heat conduction problems were observed. However, the uniform temperature field was formed faster for the compounded rubber than for the vulcanized one.
