40|$|The {{olfactory}} cortex receives converging axonal inputs {{from many}} mitral and tufted {{cells in the}} olfactory bulb. Recent studies indicate that single <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> integrate signals from diverse odorants. However, there remains a basic question, namely, the signals from which kinds of odorants are integrated by the individual <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons?</b> The present study examined {{the possibility that some}} <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> integrate signals from distinct component odorants of natural foods because individual foods produce a fixed combination of odorants. Previous psychophysical studies of core odorants emitted by fruits and vegetables suggest that the olfactory images of individual natural foods are basically characterized by the profile of structural and perceptual categories of food-born odorants. The single-unit spike responses of neurons in the dorsoposterior part of rat anterior piriform cortex to a panel of eight food-related categories of odorants were herein examined. The results showed that many <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> in this region are tuned selectively to either a single category or a specific combination of distinct categories. The <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> showed mixture facilitation and mixture inhibition when stimulated with mixtures of distinct categories, thus suggesting that olfactory circuits {{may play a role in}} enhancing the category-profile selectivity of individual neurons. These results indicate that signals from distinct categories of food-born odorants are integrated in these <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> This suggests that these <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> detect the odorant-category profile of foods to distinguish distinct food odors...|$|R

40|$|Causes {{of lower}} {{induction}} of Hsp 70 in neurons during heat shock {{are still a}} matter of debate. To further inquire into the mechanisms regulating Hsp 70 expression in neurons, we studied the activity of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF 1) and histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) at the hsp 70 promoter in rat <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> Heat shock induced a transient and efficient translocation of HSF 1 to neuronal nuclei. However, no binding of HSF 1 at the hsp 70 promoter was detected while it bound to the hsp 25 promoter in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> during heat shock. Histone PTMs analysis showed that the hsp 70 promoter harbors lower levels of histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> compared to PC 12 cells under basal conditions. Transcriptomic profiling data analysis showed a predominant usage of cryptic transcriptional start sites at hsp 70 gene in the rat cerebral cortex, compared with the whole brain. These data support a weaker activation of hsp 70 canonical promoter. Heat shock increased H 3 Ac at the hsp 70 promoter in PC 12 cells, which correlated with increased Hsp 70 expression while no modifications occurred at the hsp 70 promoter in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> Increased histone H 3 acetylation by Trichostatin A led to hsp 70 mRNA and protein induction in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> In conclusion, we found that two independent mechanisms maintain a lower induction of Hsp 70 in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> First, HSF 1 fails to bind specifically to the hsp 70 promoter in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> during heat shock and, second, the hsp 70 promoter is less accessible in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells due to histone deacetylases repression...|$|R

Findings: The aim of this work was to study the effect of NO on amino acid neurotransmitter release (Asp, Glu, Gly and GABA) in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> {{as well as the}} mechanism underlying the release of these neurotransmitters. <b>Cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> were stimulated with SNAP, a NO donor, and the release of different amino acid neurotransmitters was measured by HPLC. The involvement of voltage dependent Na+ and Ca 2 + channels as well as cGMP in its mechanism of action was evaluated. Conclusions: Our results indicate that NO induces release of aspartate, glutamate, glycine and GABA in <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> and that this release is inhibited by ODQ, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase.

50|$|The whisker barrel cortex {{contains}} {{different types}} of neurons that receive input {{from a range of}} sources that themselves receive and process an array of {{different types of}} information. As a result, neurons of the whisker barrel cortex respond to whisker-related input, but {{in a way that is}} specific to the neurons type and location. This can manifest in different ways. The simplest way is whether the <b>cortical</b> <b>neuron</b> responds only to the deflection of one whisker, or to the deflection of many whiskers. Neurons in layer 4 barrels tend to strongly or exclusively respond to one whisker, while neurons in other layers are less strongly tuned and can respond to multiple whiskers. Neurons that respond to the deflection of multiple whiskers typically have a primary whisker, to which they respond the most. The difference in response magnitude between deflection of the primary whisker and secondary whiskers can also vary between neurons. Stimulation of multiple whiskers may produce a response that is equal to the sum of the responses if each whisker was stimulated independently, or it may be different. Some neurons show greater responses when multiple neurons are stimulated in sequence, and the sequence may be direction specific.|$|E

5000|$|As an antidepressant, {{positive}} results {{were found in}} animal models of depression. NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have been shown in animal models to attenuate the hearing loss caused by aminoglycosides It is thought that aminoglycosides mimic endogenous polyamines at NMDA receptors and produce excitotoxic damage, leading to hair cell loss. Antagonizing NMDA receptors to reduce the excitotoxicity would prevent that hearing loss. Dizocilpine was found to block the development of kindled seizures, although {{it does not have}} any effect on completed kindled seizures. Oddly, it was discovered to decrease rabies virus production and {{is believed to be the}} first neurotransmitter antagonist to present with antiviral activity. Rat <b>cortical</b> <b>neuron</b> cells were infected with the rabies virus and those incubated with dizocilpine had virus produced reduced about 1000-fold. It is not known how MK-801 has this effect; the rabies virus suspension, without cells, was inoculated with dizocilpine and the drug failed to produce a virucidal effect, indicated that the mechanism of action is something other than direct killing of the virus. It was also tested against herpes simplex, vesicular stomatitis, poliovirus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus. It did not have activity against these other viruses, however. Dizocilpine was also shown to potentiate the ability of levodopa to ameliorate akinesia and muscular rigidity in a rodent model of parkinsonism. [...] When dizocilpine was administered to rats 15 minutes after a spinal trauma, the long-term neurological recovery of the trauma was improved. [...] However, NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have largely failed to show safety in clinical trials, possibly due to inhibition of NMDA receptor function that is necessary for normal neuronal function. Since dizocilpine is a particularly strong NMDA receptor antagonist, this drug is particularly likely to have psychotomimetic side effects (such as hallucinations) that result from NMDA receptor blockade. Dizocilpine had a promising future as a neuroprotective agent until neurotoxic-like effects, called Olney's Lesions, were seen in certain brain regions of test rats. Merck, a drug company, promptly dropped development of dizocilpine.|$|E

Primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neuron</b> cells were prepared from rat embryos of embryonic day 18 and treated with NMMA (NOS inhibitor) or PTIO (NO scavenger).

In rat <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons,</b> leptin elicited neuroprotective effects against NMDA-induced cell death, which were concentration-dependent (10 - 100 ng/ml) and largest when the adipokine was preincubated for 2 h before the neurotoxic stimulus. In both rat and mouse <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons,</b> leptin-induced neuroprotection was fully antagonized by paxilline (Pax, 0. 01 - 1 μM) and iberiotoxin (Ibtx, 1 - 100 nM), with EC 50 s of 38 ± 10 nM and 5 ± 2 nM for Pax and Ibtx, respectively, close to those reported for Pax- and Ibtx-induced Ca(2 +) - and voltage-activated K(+) channels (Slo 1 BK channels) blockade; the BK channel opener NS 1619 (1 - 30 μM) induced a concentration-dependent protection against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> from mice lacking one or both alleles coding for Slo 1 BK channel pore-forming subunits were insensitive to leptin-induced neuroprotection.

40|$|<b>Cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> are {{sensitive}} to the timing of their synaptic inputs. They can synchronize their firing on a millisecond time scale and follow rapid stimulus fluctuations with high temporal precision. These findings suggest that <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> have an enhanced sensitivity to synchronous synaptic inputs that lead to rapid rates of depolarization. The voltage-gated currents underlying action potential generation may provide one mechanism to amplify rapid depolarizations. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relations between membrane potential fluctuations and spike threshold in cat visual <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> recorded intracellularly in vivo. We find that visual stimuli evoke broad variations in spike threshold that are caused in large part by an inverse relation between spike threshold and the rate of membrane depolarization preceding a spike. We also find that spike threshold is inversely related to the rate of rise of the action potential upstroke, suggesting that increases in spike threshold result from a decrease in the availability of Na+ channels. By using a simple neuronal model, we show that voltage-gated Na+ and K+ conductances endow <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> with an enhanced sensitivity to rapid depolarizations that arise from synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs.

In the mustached bat, electric stimulation of <b>cortical</b> Doppler-shifted constant-frequency <b>neurons,</b> which are highly specialized for frequency analysis, evokes the centrifugal BF shifts of ipsilateral collicular and <b>cortical</b> Doppler-shifted constant-frequency <b>neurons</b> and contralateral cochlear hair cells. Bicuculline applied to the stimulation site changed the centrifugal BF shifts into centripetal BF shifts. On the other hand, electric stimulation of neurons in the posterior division of the auditory cortex, which are not particularly specialized for frequency analysis, evokes centripetal BF shifts of <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> located near the stimulated <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> Bicuculline applied to the stimulation site augmented centripetal BF shifts but did not change {{the direction of the}} shifts. These observations support the hypothesis and indicate that centripetal and centrifugal BF shifts are both based on a single mechanism consisting of two components: facilitation and inhibition...|$|R
40|$|In this study, cyanidin- 3 -glucoside (C 3 G) {{fraction}} {{extracted from}} the mulberry fruit (Morus alba L.) was investigated for its neuroprotective effects against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and glutamate-induced cell death in rat primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> Cell membrane damage and mitochondrial function were assessed by LDH release and MTT reduction assays, respectively. A time-course study of OGD-induced cell death of primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> at 7 days in vitro (DIV) indicated that neuronal death was OGD duration-dependent. It was also demonstrated that OGD for 3. 5 h resulted in approximately 50 % cell death, {{as determined by the}} LDH release assay. Treatments with mulberry C 3 G fraction prevented membrane damage and preserved the mitochondrial function of the primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> exposed to OGD for 3. 5 h in a concentration-dependent manner. Glutamate-induced cell death was more pronounced in DIV- 9 and DIV- 11 cells than that in DIV- 7 neurons, and an application of 50 µM glutamate was shown to induce approximately 40 % cell death in DIV- 9 neurons. Interestingly, treatment with mulberry C 3 G fraction did not provide a protective effect against glutamate-induced cell death in primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons.</b> On the other hand, treatment with mulberry C 3 G fraction maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons</b> exposed to OGD as assessed by the intensity of rhodamine- 123 fluorescence. These results therefore suggest that the neuroprotective effects of mulberry C 3 G fraction are mediated by the maintenance of the MMP and mitochondrial function but not by attenuating glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in rat primary <b>cortical</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R
