50|$|The {{use of the}} armour as {{the means}} of {{providing}} earthing to the equipment supplied by the cable (a function technically known as the circuit protective conductor or CPC) {{is a matter of}} debate within the electrical installation industry. It is sometimes the case that an additional core within the cable is specified as the CPC (for instance, instead of using a two <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> for line and neutral and the armouring as the CPC, a three <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> is used) or an external earth wire is run alongside the cable to serve as the CPC. Primary concerns are the relative conductivity of the armouring compared to the cores (which reduces as the cable size increases) and reliability issues. Recent articles by authoritative sources have analysed the practice in detail and concluded that, for the majority of situations, the armouring is adequate to serve as the CPC under UK wiring regulations.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{research}} the crosstalk of multiconductor <b>cable’s</b> different <b>core</b> lines, based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, the Crosstalk of the four <b>core</b> lines <b>cable</b> without metal shield layer is researched by simulation.

But when cable is working in thunder and rain, the grounding line of the cable may induce very high voltage, and the high voltage may disturb the <b>core</b> lines of <b>cable</b> that used to transfer useful signals, so the crosstalk can’t be neglected. Experiment is done with four <b>core</b> lines <b>cable</b> without metal shield layer that lay on the earth. Experimental and simulation results are nearly same, which are compared.

40|$|Most high {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) devices {{have been established}} by employing a single tape or a few tapes in parallel.

In previous works, a <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> has been described and the thermal stability of the superconducting winding using the <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> is analyzed. In this paper, first the <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> is introduced which has a copper former and two conductor layers, internal layer and external layer. Subsequently, a finite-element analysis model of the <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> is built to analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of each conductor layer by taking seven design parameters into consideration: Cable A, Cable B, Cable C, Cable D, Cable E, Cable F, and Cable G with different pitch angle and twist pitch, and the structure parameters of the <b>core</b> <b>cable</b> are optimally designed {{on the basis of the}} electromagnetic characteristics analysis.

40|$|Multipath {{communications}} at the Internet scale {{have been a}} myth for a long time, with no actual protocol being deployed so that multiple paths could be taken by a same connection on the way towards an Internet destination. Recently, the Multipath Transport Control Protocol (MPTCP) extension was standardized and is undergoing a quick adoption in many use-cases, from mobile to fixed access networks, from data-centers to core networks. Among its major benefits – i. e., reliability thanks to backup path rerouting; throughput increase thanks to link aggregation; and confidentiality thanks to harder capacity to intercept a full connection – the latter has attracted lower attention. How interesting would it be using MPTCP to exploit multiple Internet-scale paths hence decreasing the probability of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks is a question to which we try to answer.
