5|$|Following her husband's death, Reagan {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support federally funded {{embryonic stem cell}} research, {{in the hope that}} this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.|$|E

5|$|In Asia, Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is found}} in Turkey. It {{can also be found}} in Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, Gilan, Mazandaran, Fars, Hormozgan, Lorestan and Khorasan. However, until 2012, all the records from Iran were listed as Theodoxus doriae. In Africa this species occurs in Algeria, and {{possibly}} (or probably) in Morocco, where there are records which some authors <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be reliable. However, instead of one species, Theodoxus fluviatilis, Brown (1994) recognized three species in northwestern Africa: Theodoxus numidicus, Theodoxus maresi, Theodoxus meridionalis.|$|E
5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E

5|$|Conference play {{began with}} a loss to the Texas Longhorns in the annual Red River Rivalry on October 7, and ended with a win over the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the Big 12 Championship Game on December 2. The Sooners {{finished}} the regular season with an 11–2 record (7–1 in Big 12) while winning their fourth Big 12 title and their 40th conference title overall. They received an automatic berth to the Fiesta Bowl, where they were upset by the Boise State Broncos, 42-43, in what many <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} greatest bowl games of all time.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{continued}} his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the Cincinnati Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final. At the US Open he defeated Söderling in the quarters and Djokovic, {{for the third}} consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be the greatest shot of his career, a tweener winner, to setup match points. Federer played del Potro in the final and led two sets to one before ultimately losing a fourth set tiebreaker and subsequently the match.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1371, Vukašin {{was killed}} and his forces {{defeated}} in the Battle of Maritsa. About two months later, Tsar Uroš died. This formally made Marko {{the king of the}} Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko's Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.|$|E

5|$|The Australian team {{joined the}} MCC cricketers {{on the journey}} to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some {{newspapers}} suggested Fender should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that Fender was overlooked. Fender began the season poorly and was not picked {{for the first three}} Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players {{in the course of the}} summer, many of whom critics did not <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be of suitable quality. Fender began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. Fender scored 44 not out and took two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; Fender retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a great deal from Warwick Armstrong's captaincy of the Australians.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the most}} one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
