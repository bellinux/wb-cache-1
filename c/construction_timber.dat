5|$|A long-distance {{communication}} system that used {{smoke and mirrors}} existed in the region, and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, Huérfano Mountain in northern New Mexico, and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, <b>construction</b> <b>timber,</b> and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E

[...] The fruit is eaten by birds and bats (which disperse the seeds) and fed to livestock. [...] Its flowers are visited by birds and bats, and it serves as a roosting site and food source for a variety of animals.

500|$|The {{construction}} of the new stone castle {{was part of a}} programme of building which transformed Caernarfon; town walls were added, connected to the castle, and a new quay was built. The earliest reference to building at Caernarfon dates from 24June 1283, when a ditch had been dug separating the site of the castle from the town to the north. A bretagium, a type of stockade, was created around the site to protect it while the permanent defences were under <b>construction.</b> <b>Timber</b> was shipped {{from as far away as}} Liverpool. Stone was quarried from nearby places, such as from Anglesey and around the town. A force of hundreds worked on the excavation of the moat and digging the foundations for the castle. As the site expanded, it began to encroach on the town; houses were cleared to allow the construction. Residents were not paid compensation until three years later. While the foundations for the stone walls were being created, timber-framed apartments were built for EdwardI and Eleanor of Castile, his queen. [...] They arrived at Caernarfon on either 11or 12July 1283 and stayed for over a month.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually {{throughout}} the nation, over-harvest of firewood remains problematic. [...] Despite {{the availability of}} liquefied petroleum gas in towns and cities, firewood is sold more at energy-competitive prices because cutting and selling it is a fallback when better employment opportunities aren't forthcoming. [...] Firewood still supplies 80% of Nepal's energy for heating and cooking. [...] Harvesting <b>construction</b> <b>timber</b> and lopping branches for fodder for cattle and other farm animals are also deforestation/degradation drivers in all geographic zones.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he had no}} {{experience}} fighting Indians, Fetterman criticized Carrington's defensive posture and expressed contempt about the Indian foes. He allegedly boasted, [...] "Give me 80 men and I can ride through the whole Sioux nation." [...] Many other officers shared Fetterman's feelings. Shortly after Fetterman arrived at Fort Kearny, Carrington gave the captain permission to attempt a night ambush. However, the Indians saw through it and instead stampeded a herd of the cattle {{on the bank of}} the Powder River opposite Fetterman's intended trap. On November 22, Fetterman himself almost fell into an Indian ambush. He had accompanied an escort that guarded a wagon train gathering firewood and <b>construction</b> <b>timber</b> for Fort Kearny. A single Indian appeared, trying to entice the soldiers into chasing him into the woods. Lieutenant Bisbee, commanding the wagon train, sensibly took cover instead of pursuing the bait.|$|E

2500|$|The {{morning of}} December 21, 1866, {{was clear and}} cold. About 10 a.m., Carrington {{dispatched}} a wagon train to the [...] "pinery" [...] – about five miles northwest and the nearest source of <b>construction</b> <b>timber</b> and firewood for Fort Kearny. Almost 90 soldiers were detailed to guard the wagon train. Less than an hour later, Carrington's pickets on Pilot Hill signalled by flag that the wagon train was under attack. Carrington ordered a relief party composed of 49 infantrymen of the 18th Infantry and 27 mounted troopers of the 2nd Cavalry {{under the command of}} Captain James Powell. By claiming seniority as a brevet lieutenant colonel, Fetterman asked for and was given command of the relief party. Powell remained behind. Another officer of the 18th, Lt. George W. Grummond, a known critic of Carrington, led the cavalry, which had been leaderless since Bingham's death in early December. Captain Frederick Brown, until recently the post quartermaster and another of Carrington's critics, and two civilians, James Wheatley and Isaac Fisher, joined Fetterman, bringing the relief force up to 81 officers and men. The infantry marched out first; the cavalry had to retrieve its mounts before it could follow and catch up.|$|E
