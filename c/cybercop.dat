50|$|Metal Jack was {{originally}} planned as {{a sequel to}} the live-action tokusatsu show Dennou Keisatsu <b>Cybercop,</b> but due to complications with the show's production, it was made into an animated series instead without any official ties to <b>Cybercop.</b> However, due to low viewership, {{the length of the}} show's run was shortened by one cours. Head writer Hiroyuki Kawasaki would later recycled some of the same situations from Metal Jack in Brave Police J-Decker. The show was also the debut of Nobutoshi Canna (who acted under the stage name of Nobutoshi Hayashi).|$|E

50|$|Dennou Keisatsu <b>Cybercop</b> (Computer Police Cybercops) is a Japanese tokusatsu TV series. First {{created in}} 1988 by Toho Enterprises, {{the show was}} an attempt to create a Tokusatsu series using the Super Sentai motif, but the idea was dropped after the unaired episode 0. Though the series itself still {{slightly}} resembled a sentai show, with most of the protagonists wearing colored armor. The show was broadcast on NTV and aired from October 2, 1988 to July 5, 1989.|$|E
40|$|Two {{new books}} venture {{deep into the}} belly of global {{cybercrime}} and fraud, writes Ramon Lobato, in his review of the books 'DarkMarket: cyberthieves, <b>cybercops</b> and you,' by Misha Glenny, published by Random House, London, 2011, and 'The money laundry: regulating criminal finance in the global economy,' by J.

50|$|The newest growth sectors for {{organized}} crime are identity theft and online extortion. These activities are troubling because they discourage consumers {{from using the}} Internet for e-commerce. E-commerce was supposed {{to level the playing}} ground between small and large businesses, but the growth of online {{organized crime}} is leading to the opposite effect; large businesses are able to afford more bandwidth (to resist denial-of-service attacks) and superior security. Furthermore, organized crime using the Internet is much harder to trace down for the police (even though they increasingly deploy <b>cybercops)</b> since most police forces and law enforcement agencies operate within a local or national jurisdiction while the Internet makes it easier for criminal organizations to operate across such boundaries without detection.|$|R
50|$|Lucifer: Takeda's ex-partner in the future, {{was also}} transported {{with him and}} Kageyama to the 20th century through the same time-space portal. At first, his only wish is to avenge his dead comrades, {{targeting}} Jupiter as his nemesis and challenging him to a death confront. He allies with Baron Kageyama believing Takeda was the traitor who murdered his companions. Eventually, it is revealed that Kageyama was the mole. From then, Lucifer decides to aid the <b>Cybercops</b> without joining the group, helping them in battle more often than not. Lucifer's bit, along with Jupiter's, {{is the most powerful}} of the Bit Suits, as it is more equipped and enhanced than the others. Armed with two high-power pistols called Impulse Magnum, two machine-guns which come from his back to shoulders, the Pulsar Cannon, Gigamax and the Cyber Graviton, an energy absorber-releaser on his chest.|$|R
5000|$|Shinya Takeda/Jupiter: Found by the Interpol rescue team, Takeda was {{transferred}} to the <b>Cybercop</b> division in the hopes of unraveling his secret past. For some reason, Takeda is unable to remember his past memories. While he has a very sunny disposition and is often very fun-loving, he has a considerable temper that can escalate into a “battle rage” when fighting opponents. When this happens, Jupiter is able to summon his own Cyber Arm, the Cyber Thunder Arm, through a process called Cyber Boming, which ultimately kills his nemesis, despite its unsure origins. The Jupiter Bit is the most advanced bit in ZAC arsenal and is far more powerful {{than any of the other}} Bit Suits. Later, it is revealed that Takeda was brought in to the year 1999 by a time-space portal fend, which opened after the Babylon Tower's explosion in the 23rd century, along with Lucifer and Kageyama. His original codename was [...] "Z226" [...] (Z-Double Two Six). His Jupiter Bit Suit, as well as the Cyber Thunder Arm came with him to the past. In the end of the series, he goes back to the 23rd century with Lucifer and Tomoko, who asks to go with them to fight for a better time.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} culture of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice, and to investigate how new users ("newbies") acquire the necessary linguistic and social skills to acculturate to this community. The study of the culture of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice (<b>CyberCoP)</b> considers the values, norms, and traditions of the community, and focuses on the aspects of belonging and the distinction between groups: newbies and advanced users. It analyses the Hotline <b>CyberCoP</b> by taking the reader through the acculturation process as experienced by newbies. Newbies are initially ignorant of every aspect of the culture of the Hotline <b>CyberCoP,</b> whereas advanced users have knowledge of the program, language, behaviour, and even secret codes. This study takes what is principally an ethnomethodological approach, as it analyses the characteristics and interconnectedness of categories in the data set. Data were collected over an eleven-month period in order to verify categories in the data set. Informants were also used to help decode the higher-level aspects of the in-group 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge base. It was found that newbies go through a process of change, both linguistically and in terms of acquiring group membership through Legitimate Peripheral Participation. They have to undertake a number of tasks in order to become functioning members of the Hotline Cybercommunity of Practice. These include creating a social identity, playing roles, learning group mores, and group language practices. Even advanced members are not exempt from the acculturation process, which in important respects is continuous and incremental as the culture of the Cybercommunity evolves. The study contributes to an understanding of interpersonal communication, language, culture, naming, personal identity, customs, and the processes of acculturation in an online <b>CyberCoP.</b> It also contributes to a wider understanding of acculturation, and of online interactive communication, communities, and discourse. The significance of the research is that it is the first study of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice to be undertaken. Because Hotline was established in the 1990 s the program contained many more features and members had more control over the entire <b>CyberCoP</b> than newer technologies such as Skype and Facebook. An understanding of the processes and dynamics of group formation, and maintenance provides a rare opportunity to examine the creation and management of a group ethos, and gives greater understanding {{the way in which the}} Hotline Cyber Community of Practice deals with newbies. The study provides valuable insights to sociologists, linguists, and educators, who wish to understand the way in which Cyber Communities of Practice work, or who are planning to utilise these for online learning...|$|E
5000|$|Led by the feline-like Madam Durwin who {{commands}} the ghostly white Harcross Death Droids. These {{can also be}} outfitted {{with a number of}} deadly weapon attachments affording them a great deal of versatility and customization. Durwin was an expert in biology and genetics. Thus her name, which was a play of Charles Darwin, a famous naturalist. Durwin was ordered to destroy the train tracks which the <b>Cybercops</b> were also traveling on with Luna, after learning Luna was an android. As Durwin warned Luna, Luna was nevertheless killed by baron Kageyama, who showed puzzlement over why his most beautiful creation would betray him. Luna said: [...] "You could never understand the feelings of a puppet! You became a doll without human feelings!" [...] After Luna exploded, the Baron confessed he loved her, as it's impossible to be a perfect doll by not having feelings and by thus being dangerous.|$|R
