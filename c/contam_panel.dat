Because of this and the fact that people in general have a high consumption of cereal-based foods, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> considered that grains might be the major contributor of dietary exposure to citrinin. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that not enough data were available in the literature to carry out a dietary exposure assessment.|$|E

40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} by the European Commission to deliver a Scientific Opinion on {{guidance}} on methodological principles and scientific methods {{to be taken into account}} when establishing Reference Points for Action (RPAs) for non-allowed pharmacologically active substances in food of animal origin. This guidance document presents a simple and pragmatic approach which takes into account both analytical and toxicological considerations. The aim is to define an analytical concentration for a non-allowed pharmacologically active substance that can be determined by official control laboratories and is low enough to adequately protect the consumers of food commodities that contain that substance. The proposed step-wise approach considers factors such as analytical capability, toxic potential and pharmacological activity of the substance in question, and includes the identification of the Reasonably Achievable Lowest Limit of Quantification (RALLOQ), the establishment of a Toxicological Screening Value (TSV) and the derivation of a Toxicologically Based Limit of Quantification (TBLOQ). The TBLOQ is compared with the RALLOQ for the respective substance. If the TBLOQ is equal to or higher than the RALLOQ, then the latter can be accepted as the RPA. If the TBLOQ is lower than the RALLOQ, then the sensitivity of the analytical method needs to be improved. In the case where no further analytical improvements are feasible, a substance-specific risk assessment should be considered. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that RPAs should be matrix independent. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> noted that sometimes non-edible matrices are monitored to identify the administration of non-allowed pharmacologically active substances. In these cases, RPAs cannot be applied. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> also proposed several criteria where the European Commission might consider it appropriate to consult EFSA for a substance-specific risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{was asked}} by the European Commission to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on sterigmatocystin (STC) in food and feed. STC is a polyketide mycotoxin that shares its biosynthetic pathway with aflatoxins. Following an EFSA call for data, analytical results from 247 food and 334 feed samples were submitted. In food, analytical results on STC were reported to be all below the limit of detection or limit of quantification. In feed, only four quantified results were reported. Therefore, the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> concluded that the available occurrence data are too limited to carry out a reliable human and animal dietary exposure assessment. Acute oral toxicity of STC is relatively low, and liver and kidneys are the target organs. STC is mutagenic in both bacterial and mammalian cells after metabolic activation and forms DNA adducts. Tumourigenicity has been observed after oral, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and dermal administration resulting in hepatocellular carcinomas, haemangiosarcomas in the liver, angiosarcomas in brown fat and lung adenomas. Since no exposure data were available, the margin of exposure approach for substances that are genotoxic and carcinogenic could not be applied for STC, and thus the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> could not characterise the risk for human health. Regarding animals, the Panel noted that STC is hepatotoxic in poultry and pigs, and nephrotoxic in poultry and toxic in several fish species. However, in the absence of exposure data for livestock, fish and companion animals, and given the limited knowledge on the adverse effects of STC, the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> could not characterise the risk for animal health. More occurrence data on STC in food and feed need to be collected to allow dietary exposure assessment.

40|$|Nivalenol is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} various Fusarium species. The European Commission (EC) asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific {{opinion on the}} risk to human and animal health related {{to the presence of}} nivalenol in food and feed. A total of 13 164 results for nivalenol in food, feed and unprocessed grains, collected in 2001 - 2011 from 18 European countries, were available for the evaluation. The highest mean concentrations for nivalenol were observed in oats, maize, barley and wheat and products thereof. Grains and grain-based foods, in particular bread and rolls, grain milling products, pasta, fine bakery wares and breakfast cereals, made the largest contribution to nivalenol exposure for humans. Animal exposure to nivalenol is primarily from consuming cereal grains and cereal by-products. The available information on the toxicokinetics of nivalenol is incomplete. Evidence exists for metabolic de-epoxidation in some species. Based on the data available, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> concluded that the overall weight of evidence is that nivalenol is unlikely to be genotoxic. Toxic effects of nivalenol include immunotoxicity and haematotoxicity. A reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts in a 90 -day rat study was identified as the critical effect for human risk assessment. Using these data and a benchmark dose analysis the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1. 2 µg/kg b. w. per day. All chronic human dietary exposures to nivalenol estimated, based on the available occurrence data in food, are below the TDI, and are therefore not a health concern. No toxicity data were identified for ruminants, rabbits, fish and companion animals but lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels were identified in pigs and poultry. Based on estimates of exposure the risk of adverse health effects of feed containing nivalenol is low for both these species...|$|E
40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in commercially available foods for infants and young children. It was requested to describe the relation of important parameters of the distribution of the occurrence data to the new EU maximum levels (MLs), and to assess whether these MLs are sufficient to aim to decrease the dietary exposure of infants and young children to dioxins and DL-PCBs. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> did not perform an exposure or risk assessment, but evaluated whether the enforcement of the new EU MLs will result in a decrease in the concentration of dioxins and DL-PCBs in foods for infants and young children, and thus in a potential decrease in exposure of this population group. A total of 516 samples was included in the evaluation, reported by 13 European countries and covering the period 2003 to 2011. All accepted data (upper-bound) were below the current MLs for foods for infants and young children of 0. 1 pg WHO 2005 -TEQ/g w. w. for dioxins and 0. 2 pg WHO 2005 -TEQ/g w. w. for the sum of dioxins and DL-PCBs. Therefore, the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that, based on the available data, the current MLs are not an incentive to decrease the concentrations of dioxins and DL-PCBs in the relevant foods. From the reported data, {{it is not possible to}} conclude on any time trend concerning the dioxin and DL-PCB levels in foods for infants and young children. The Panel recommended that more occurrence data on representative samples are needed, particularly for those foods for infants and young children where only a few results are available so far. Moreover, the sensitivity of the analytical methods should be improved, if lower MLs were to be considered in the future...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{was asked}} by the European Commission to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on ergot alkaloids (EAs) in food and feed. EAs are produced by several members within the fungal orders of Hypocreales and Eurotiales. In Europe, Claviceps purpurea is the most widespread Claviceps species within the Hypocreales. A total of 20 558 analytical results for EAs in 1 716 food, 496 feed and 67 unprocessed grain samples were considered in this opinion. Based on the EAs identified in sclerotia of C. purpurea, and recent literature data, the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> based its risk assessment on the main C. purpurea EAs, namely ergometrine, ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine (which is a mixture of a- and ß- isomers), ergocornine, and the corresponding –inine epimers. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> performed estimates of both chronic and acute exposure for various age groups across European countries. A BMDL 10 of 0. 33 mg/kg b. w. per day was calculated for the incidence of tail muscular atrophy in a 13 -week rat feeding study of ergotamine. This effect was considered representative of the vasoconstrictive effects of EAs and provided a suitable reference point for establishment of a group acute reference dose of 1 µg/kg body weight (b. w.) and a group tolerable daily intake of 0. 6 µg/kg b. w. per day. The Panel concluded that whilst the available data do not indicate a concern for any population subgroup, the dietary exposure estimates relate to a limited number of food groups and a possible unknown contribution from other foods cannot be discounted. Estimates of exposure for livestock based on example diets and levels of EAs in cereal grains reported suggest that under normal conditions the risk of toxicosis is low...|$|E
40|$|The current {{tolerable}} {{daily intake}} (TDI) for zearalenone (ZEN) of 0. 25 μg/kg body weight (bw) per day established by the EFSA Panel for Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> in 2011 is based on oestrogenicity in pigs. No new studies were identified to change this TDI. The modified forms of ZEN identified are phase I and phase II metabolites. Phase I metabolites are mainly formed through reduction. Phase II metabolites are formed by conjugation of ZEN and its phase I metabolites with glucose or sulfate, and in animals glucuronic acid. The few data on the occurrence of modified forms of ZEN indicated that cereal-based foods are the main source, containing amounts varying from a few up to 100 % of ZEN. Most of the phase I metabolites have oestrogenic activity and {{it is assumed that}} their combined action will be additive. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> found it appropriate to set a group TDI of 0. 25 μg/kg bw per day expressed as ZEN equivalents for ZEN and its modified forms (phase I and phase II metabolites). To account for differences in in vivo oestrogenic potency, each phase I metabolite was assigned a potency factor relative to ZEN to be applied to exposure estimates of the respective ZEN metabolites. It was assumed that conjugates (phase II metabolites) of ZEN and its phase I metabolites, which per se have no oestrogenic activity, will be cleaved releasing ZEN and its phase I metabolites. These conjugates were assigned the same relative potency factors as their aglycones. The overall uncertainty associated with the present assessment is considered as high. It would rather overestimate than underestimate any risk of modified ZEN. Several aspects of the uncertainty could be reduced provided more data are made available on oestrogenicity of modified ZEN, in particular α-zearalenol, in pigs. <br/...|$|E
40|$|T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins (T- 2 and HT- 2) are {{important}} trichothecenes. They {{have been subject}} of formal risk assessment by various organisations, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The EFSA <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> recently established a group Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 100 ng/kg body weight/day for the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2. To assess the actual dietary exposure of Dutch consumers to T- 2 and HT- 2 a {{study was conducted in}} the Netherlands, in which duplicate portions of 24 -h diets collected in 2011 were investigated for these toxins. This collection comprised 128 duplicate diets of the adult segment of the Dutch population, divided over a spring and autumn collection period. The diets in the study were homogenised and processed to lyophilised powders. Aliquots of every two of the samples were pooled to test portions that were analysed with a method, based on immunoaffinity chromatography clean-up in combination with GC-MS/MS determination. The method had a limit of quantification of 0. 01 mu g/kg original non-lyophilised diet for both T- 2 and HT- 2. Recoveries ranged from 92 - 114 % for T- 2 and from 71 - 106 % for HT- 2, determined at levels of addition ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 3 mu g/kg. In practically all samples investigated, numerical values for the concentrations of T- 2 and HT- 2 could be obtained. Exposure estimates of the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 in the 2011 study ranged from non-detectable to 18. 6 ng/kg body weight/day. In addition limited sets of pooled samples of duplicate diets retained from collections in the period 1976 - 2004 were analysed for T- 2 and HT- 2. In all samples the mean and individual intakes of the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 of the respondents were below the group TDI of the EFSA <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel.</b> From this study it was concluded that no health risks are expected from current exposure of adult Dutch consumers to T- 2 and HT- 2...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the recent}} {{scientific}} opinion published by the EFSA <b>CONTAM</b> <b>panel</b> on the risks to human and animal health related {{to the presence of}} nivalenol in food and feed, this article provides an update on the determination of this Fusarium mycotoxin. After a brief introduction into the chemistry of nivalenol, chromatographic methods as well as other approaches are being discussed. Methods for the determination of nivalenol are well established and can be applied for the analysis of cereals, food, feed and biological samples. Accurate quantification of nivalenol is mostly carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with (multi-stage) mass spectrometry (MS) often within a multi-analyte approach. Some novel techniques, such as direct analysis in real time (DART) MS and electrochemical methods, have shown potential to determine nivalenol, but applications for routine measurements are not yet available. None of the currently available analytical methods has been formally validated in interlaboratory validation studies. While a certified calibrant for nivalenol is available, no matrix reference materials have been developed. Due to the scarcity of appropriate antibodies also no rapid immunochemical methods specific for nivalenol have become availabl...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that deer, like sheep and goats, eat the grasses and plants very close to the soil, {{resulting}} in increased uptake of soil particles. Therefore, for deer—similar to cattle and sheep—the soil next to the feed can serve as a relevant PCDD/F and PCB exposure pathway. In addition, forest soils, especially in populated areas, have a higher PCDD/F and PCB content than grasslands due to the adsorption of pollutants via leaves and transfer to the topsoil [60]. PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels in liver of deer and wild boar in central Europe are generally high and are elevated in some meat [17, 61, 62]. In Germany the livers of deer (median 45.2  pg PCDD/F–PCB-TEQ/g fat) and wild boar (median 50.8  pg PCDD/F–PCB-TEQ/g fat) showed very high levels, well over the EU maximum level of 12  pg TEQ/g fat applicable to bovine or ovine livers up to 2011. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> concluded that “frequent consumption of deer liver, especially for high consumers may be of health concern” and that “frequent consumption of sheep liver, particularly by women of child-bearing age and children, may be a potential health concern” [27]. For wildlife, however, there are no regulatory PCDD/F or dl-PCB limits in the EU.|$|E
40|$|Pectenotoxin (PTX) -group toxins are a {{group of}} polyether-lactone toxins. They have been {{detected}} in microalgae and bivalve molluscs in Australia, Japan and New Zealand and {{in a number of}} European countries. Their presence in shellfish was discovered due to their acute toxicity in the mouse bioassay after intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of lipophilic extracts of shellfish. PTX-group toxins are exclusively produced by Dinophysis species. They can be found in filter-feeding bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels. To date 15 different analogues have been isolated and characterised. PTX-group toxins are heat stable, but they are easily destroyed under strong basic conditions such as used for hydrolysis of acyl esters of the okadaic acid (OA) -group toxins. PTX-group toxins are also labile under acidic conditions. PTX-group toxins in shellfish are always accompanied by toxins from the OA-group. This appears to be the basis for grouping PTX-group toxins and OA-group toxins in the European regulation. The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> concluded that because PTX-group toxins do not share the same mechanism of action as OA-group toxins they should not be included in the regulatory limit for OA-group toxins.

40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} by the European Commission to {{consider}} new developments regarding inorganic mercury and methylmercury toxicity and evaluate whether the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provisional tolerable weekly intakes for methylmercury of 1. 6 µg/kg body weight (b. w.) and of 4  µg/kg b. w. for inorganic mercury were still appropriate. In line with JECFA, the <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for inorganic mercury of 4 µg/kg b. w., expressed as mercury. For methylmercury, new developments in epidemiological studies from the Seychelles Child Developmental Study Nutrition Cohort have indicated that n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish may counteract negative effects from methylmercury exposure. Together with the information that beneficial nutrients in fish may have confounded previous adverse outcomes in child cohort studies from the Faroe Islands, the Panel established a TWI for methylmercury of 1. 3 µg/kg b. w., expressed as mercury. The mean dietary exposure across age groups does not exceed the TWI for methylmercury, with the exception of toddlers and other children in some surveys. The 95 th percentile dietary exposure is close to or above the TWI for all age groups. High fish consumers, which might include pregnant women, may exceed the TWI by up to approximately six-fold. Unborn children constitute the most vulnerable group. Biomonitoring data from blood and hair indicate that methylmercury exposure is generally below the TWI in Europe, but higher levels are also observed. Exposure to methylmercury above the TWI is of concern. If measures to reduce methylmercury exposure are considered, the potential beneficial effects of fish consumption should also be taken into account. Dietary inorganic mercury exposure in Europe does not exceed the TWI, but inhalation exposure of elemental mercury from dental amalgam is likely to increase the internal inorganic mercury exposure; thus the TWI might be exceeded...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{was asked}} by the European Commission to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the health risks from citrinin in food and feed. Citrinin is a mycotoxin produced by several species of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Monascus and occurs mainly in stored grains. The available occurrence data were not adequate to carry out a dietary exposure assessment. Citrinin is nephrotoxic and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 20 µg/kg body weight (b. w.) per day was identified from a 90 -day study in rats. Due to the limitations and uncertainties in the database, the derivation of a health-based guidance value was not considered appropriate but a level of no concern for nephrotoxicity of 0. 2 µg/kg b. w. per day was determined. Based on the available data a concern for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity could not be excluded at the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity. In the absence of adequate exposure data, characterisation of the risk of citrinin as a food contaminant was based on the estimate of the citrinin concentrations in grains and grain-based products that would result in an exposure equal to the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity. For high consuming toddlers, other children and adults this citrinin concentration is between 9 and 53 µg citrinin/kg and between 19 and 100 µg citrinin/kg for average consumers, respectively. For animals, risk characterisation was based on the estimate of the citrinin concentration in grains that would result in exceedance of the NOAEL of 20 µg/kg b. w. per day for pigs, which ranged between 640 and 1 173 µg/kg. The <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the impact of uncertainties on the risk assessment is large, and more data regarding the toxicity and the occurrence of citrinin in food and feed in Europe are needed to enable refinement of the risk assessment...|$|E

These two bodies {{have concluded that the}} PTWI (Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake) of 25 μg lead/kg body weight was no longer appropriate for the protection of health. Considering the new information on lead, the Scientific Committee has grasped a dossier to reassess the risks of lead for the Belgian population and to use existing methodologies (approach Margin Of Exposure, MOE) to characterize the risks in absence of PTWI. The EFSA <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> identified the developmental neurotoxicity in children, cardiovascular effects and nephrotoxicity in adults as critical effects for risk assessment and derived Benchmark Dose Lower Confidence Limits (BMDL) values for these critical effects. The lowest BMDL value for lead dietary intake was derived from lead concentration in blood. This is 0, 5 μg lead/kg body weight/day for developmental neurotoxicity in children. In the current evaluation, different routes of exposure were considered to calculate the total exposure to lead of adults and children. Dietary exposure is the main route of exposure to lead for the general population. Lead exposure through ingestion of soil particles and dust is more important than dietary exposure in children living in urban areas. In some populations, exposure may be stressed because of certain cultural factors (use of crafts kitchen utensils and illicit cosmetics). Margin Of Exposure values between 1. 5 and 5. 4 were estimated for the total exposure to lead of adults using the BMDL values proposed by EFSA. In children, the determined MOE’s were less than 1 indicating that the harmful effects on neurological development would not be excluded.

40|$|Malachite green (MG) {{has been}} used {{globally}} in aquaculture but is not registered for use in food-producing animals in the European Union. The European Commission requested EFSA to evaluate whether a reference point for action (RPA) of 2 μg/kg for the sum of MG and its major metabolite leucomalachite green (LMG) is adequate to protect public health. Available occurrence data were not suitable for a reliable exposure assessment. The hypothetical dietary exposure was calculated, considering the RPA as occurrence value {{for all types of}} fish, fish products and crustaceans. Mean dietary exposure across different European dietary surveys and age classes would range from 0. 1 to 5. 0 ng/kg body weight (bw) per day. For high and frequent fish consumers, the exposure would range from 1. 3 to 11. 8 ng/kg bw per day. Both MG and LMG induced formation of DNA adducts in livers of rats and/or mice, and of micronuclei in mice. LMG also induced cII transgene mutations in mouse liver. MG caused a small, not dose-related, increase in thyroid gland follicular adenomas and carcinomas, and of mammary gland carcinomas in female rats. LMG caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice. Both MG and LMG may be considered as carcinogenic and as genotoxic in vivo. A lower 95 % confidence limit for a benchmark response of 10 % extra risk (BMDL 10) of 13 mg/kg bw per day for hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was selected as reference point for neoplastic effects. For non-neoplastic effects, a lower 95 % confidence limit for a benchmark response of 5 % extra risk (BMDL 05) of 6 mg/kg bw per day was selected for the effect of MG on liver weight and of LMG on body weight. The margins of exposure were 1. 1 × 106 or greater for neoplastic effects and 4. 9 × 105 or greater for non-neoplastic effects.

The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (<b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel)</b> evaluated 7, 175 occurrence data. Esters of 3 - and 2 -MCPD and glycidyl esters were found {{at the highest levels}} in palm oil/fat, but most vegetable oil/fats contain substantial quantities. Mean middle bound (MB) dietary exposure values to total 3 -MCPD, 2 -MCPD and glycidol, respectively, across surveys and age groups in µg/kg body weight (bw) per day were 0. 2 – 1. 5, 0. 1 – 0. 7 and 0. 1 – 0. 9; high exposure (P 95) values were 0. 3 – 2. 6, 0. 2 – 1. 2 and 0. 2 – 2. 1. Animal studies show extensive hydrolysis of esterified 3 -MCPD and glycidol following oral administration; esterified and free forms were assumed to contribute equally to internal exposures. Nephrotoxicity was consistently observed in rats treated with 3 -MCPD. Data on 2 -MCPD toxicity were insufficient for dose–response assessments. Chronic treatment with glycidol increased the incidence of tumours in several tissues of rats and mice, likely via a genotoxic mode of action. The Panel selected a BMDL 10 value for 3 -MCPD of 0. 077 mg/kg bw per day for induction of renal tubular hyperplasia in rats and derived a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0. 8 µg/kg bw per day. The mean exposure to 3 -MCPD was above the TDI for ‘Infants’, ‘Toddlers’ and ‘Other children’. For glycidol, the Panel selected a T 25 value of 10. 2 mg/kg bw per day for neoplastic effects in rats. The margins of exposure (MoEs) were 11, 300 – 102, 000 and 4, 900 – 51, 000 across surveys and age groups at mean and P 95 exposures, respectively.

The new maximum residue limits (MRL) both for BaP and sum of PAH 4 compounds in smoked meat and meat products were defined by the legislation of Serbia, as well, and it is in accordance with EU regulation. The aim of this paper was the validation of the method for identification and determination of benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, benz[a]anthracene and benzo[b]fluoranthene in smoked meat and smoked meat products. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was used for extraction of lipids and lipophilic compounds. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) was used in order to remove lipids from analysed samples. High-performance liquid chromatographic with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) was applied for identification and quantification of PAH 4 compounds. Fluorescence detector operated at excitation/emission wavelength 275 / 385 nm for BaA and CHR, 256 / 446 nm for BbF and 260 / 410 nm for BaP, respectively. On the base of experimental results it is possible to conclude as follows: The in-house validation procedure of the method meets all criteria (applicability, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, recovery, LOD and LOQ) set out by EU Regulation No. 836 / 2011. The method is suitable for operative control of PAH 4 content in smoked meat products. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. III 46009...|$|E
40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are plant toxins {{that occur}} mainly in Datura, Atropa and Hyoscyamus sp, {{belonging to the}} Solanaceae family, besides {{a variety of other}} families such as Erythroxylaceae, Brassicaceae, Proteaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Convolvulaceae and Cruciferae. The TAs occur {{in all parts of the}} plants and botanical impurities have been found in a range of crops due to accidental contamination during harvesting. The intoxication via the food leads to anticholinergic effects (e. g. blurred vision, pupil dilation, dry mouth, vomiting, muscle spasms, tachycardia, etc.), culminating in severe intoxications and death. The EFSA <b>CONTAM</b> <b>Panel</b> established a group Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 0. 016 μg/kg body weight (b. w.) expressed as the sum of (-) -hyoscyamine and () scopolamine, assuming equivalent potency. Infants and young children are the most exposed age classes as they consume a higher amount of cereal-based products per body weight. EFSA estimated that the dietary exposure of toddlers could be up to seven times the group ARfD. Recently, two European legislation acts were published in this field: Commission Recommendation (EU) 2015 / 976, recommending the monitoring of tropane alkaloids in certain food categories, and Commission Regulation (EU) 2016 / 239, enforcing maximum levels of tropane alkaloids in certain cereal-based foods for infants and young children. The EURL-Mycotoxins organised a proficiency test (PT) concerning the determination of atropine and scopolamine in cereal-based baby food, aiming to underpin and assess the measurement capability of Member States' (MS) laboratories. Particular focus was given to levels relevant for enforcement of legislation. Two samples were distributed to the participants: one sample labelled “C” – biscuits for infants containing approx. 1. 2 µg/kg of atropine and 0. 2 µg/kg of scopolamine, and one sample labelled “E” – cereals for porridge containing approx. 7. 4 µg/kg of atropine and 1. 0 µg/kg of scopolamine. Forty-eight datasets from 18 EU MS laboratories were received. Overall, 81 % of the z-scores were in the range of - 2 to 2 and 90 % were in the range of - 3 to 3. For the lowest TA level (sample C) still 75 % of z-scores fell into an acceptable range (|z| ≤ 2), while the mass fraction of scopolamine was far below the target level of 1 µg/kg. In line with this observation, the vast majority of reported LOQs were below 1. 0 µg/kg. The methodologies used by the participants can be clustered into three groups: the method supplied by the EURL; the RIKILT SOP A 1070 and methods based on QuEChERS. The instrumental determination was by LC-MS/MS, with one exception (GC-MS). The recoveries reported by the participants were close to 95 %. No statistically significant dependence of the z scores on the analytical methodology was observed. These results support the assumption that atropine and scopolamine can be reliably determined at the maximum levels proposed by the EU to ensure the protection of infants and young children's health using state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation.  JRC.
