5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. <b>Crime</b> <b>was</b> also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E

5000|$|In Islamic {{criminal}} jurisprudence, a tazir <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> a <b>crime</b> that <b>is</b> punished {{according to}} a judge's discretion. A [...] "deterrent crime" [...] <b>is</b> a <b>crime</b> with a fixed sentence. Tazir punishments should generally be less severe. There are no strict proof requirements as there are for hadd.

Stroud's <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> handled in the federal system, as Alaska at that time was still a federal territory, and not a state with its own judiciary system.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description.

40|$|<b>Crime</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as one of the major threats to socio-economic development. The variable offending behaviour of criminals is nonetheless little understood. Clusters of crime have direct implications on crime prevention strategies. This study examines variability in offending patterns, based on the spatial and temporal patterns of historical crime. Point patterns of criminal events are mapped over a study area in eastern Nairobi, and the distribution of various types of <b>crimes</b> <b>is</b> examined throughout a 24 -months study period. Although various other factors influential to <b>crime</b> <b>are</b> identified, the association between rainy seasons and high rates of <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> distinctly observed...|$|R

5|$|After the 1982 Tylenol murders, new FDA {{regulations}} {{went into}} effect which made it a federal - rather than just a state or local - crime to tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> prosecutable as a federal product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist.|$|E
5|$|Arad's {{police force}} {{was chosen as}} the {{exceptional}} force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> cited. Arad's force was able {{to reduce the amount of}} such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, in a rare incident, shot dead a man threatening to kill his ex-wife with a knife.|$|E

30|$|<b>Crime</b> {{prediction}} <b>is</b> inherently difficult. <b>Crime</b> {{analysis has}} already confirmed that <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> unequally distributed {{in time and}} space [1]. Furthermore, <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> a highly dynamic and complex phenomenon driven by the people and the environment where they meet [2], and scholars in different disciplines are still investigating various elements for predictive power. Knowing when and where <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> more likely to occur can help various actors engaged in crime reduction: urban planners to design safer cities [3] and police forces to better direct their patrols [4].|$|R

The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film {{is based on}} the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> check fraud; he became so experienced that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other checking forgers. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles.|$|E

His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> burglary.|$|E

40|$|Main {{weakness}} of economics of <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> that {{it focuses on}} rational offender who is isolated from society. This thesis gives overview of game theory models, which take into account possible reactions of other actors to offender`s actions. I show that some variables of <b>crime</b> <b>are</b> dependent on individual`s social environment and I analyze them using moral costs of crime, where some gains and losses from <b>crime</b> <b>are</b> interconnected between people. Two own models are presented. First model deals with aggregated crime with significant role of moral costs of <b>crime.</b> Second model <b>is</b> a modification of Inspection game which includes moral costs of <b>crime</b> and <b>is</b> than modeled using evolutionary game theory. Result of first model is higher volatility of crime than in standard models of rational offender. <b>Crime</b> <b>is</b> maximally volatile in time in the second model. There is a critical level of moral costs of crime and after reaching this level, assumptions of inspection game are violated and society converges to state with zero <b>crime.</b> It <b>is</b> demonstrated on both models that <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> a self- propagating phenomenon, because of social interactions...|$|R

5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E
5|$|Street <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E
