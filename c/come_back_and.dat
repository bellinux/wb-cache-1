Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 {{that he would like to}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> guest star.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up {{in the realm of}} the dead, only to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> report their experiences.|$|E
5|$|The evening draw, which {{consisted}} of men's team play, saw Team North America extending their lead to five points.

60|$|The thick-set Selenite {{had gone}} some paces unheeded. He <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> stood {{between us and}} the great machine.

25|$|We must {{be careful}} here, because it is quite {{possible}} that an algorithm will (temporarily) leave blanks in between figures, then <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fill something in.

25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field.
