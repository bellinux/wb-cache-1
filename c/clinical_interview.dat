In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E
25|$|DSPD is {{diagnosed}} by a <b>clinical</b> <b>interview,</b> actigraphic monitoring, and/or a sleep diary {{kept by the}} patient {{for at least two}} weeks. When polysomnography is also used, it is primarily for the purpose of ruling out other disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea. If a person can adjust to a normal daytime schedule on her/his own, with just the help of alarm clocks and will-power, the diagnosis is not given.|$|E

25|$|Though {{assessment}} of psychological trauma may {{be conducted in}} an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve {{the use of a}} structured interview. Such interviews might include the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, & Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured <b>Clinical</b> <b>Interview</b> for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for Posttraumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{observation}} – Clinical {{psychologists are}} also trained {{to gather data}} by observing behavior. The <b>clinical</b> <b>interview</b> is {{a vital part of}} assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after coming}} into care the {{children}} are intensively assessed, in foster care, and then receive multi modal treatments. Foster carers are also formally assessed using a structured <b>clinical</b> <b>interview</b> which includes in particular {{the meaning of the}} child to the foster parent. Individualised interventions for each child are devised based on age, clinical presentation and information on the child/foster carer match. The assessment 'team' remains involved in delivering the intervention. Those running the programme maintain regular phone and visit contact and there are support groups for foster parents.|$|E
40|$|Within {{cognitive}} science, <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> {{have long}} been used as an instrument for studying cognitive development and conceptual reasoning {{in part because of}} their flexibility and improvisational nature. Yet, at the same time, those qualities invite the criticisms that the questioning and responses of an interviewer change the very cognition this tool is designed to study. We believe that is a valid concern, and suggest that analysis of <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> must take into account that they are a form of conversational interaction. With that goal in mind, we identify and present nine conversational moves made in a corpus of 150 <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> with middle school students on various science topics. These moves, we argue, function not only to produce rich data, but also to help in navigating some fundamental challenges inherent in <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews.</b> Identifying these moves represents an important first step for a cognitive and developmental research program that can better articulate how and when conceptual knowledge is expressed in these dynamic and often improvised interactions...|$|R
30|$|We {{are also}} {{carrying}} out an {{increased number of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> to strengthen the validation efforts for our revised assessment and to test our hypotheses about what written evidence reveals about student thinking. The structured <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> used {{in the current study}} constrained the interviewer from asking additional probing questions that could have provided additional evidence to make strong inferences about the number sequences available to the children. In our ongoing research, we are conducting semi-structured <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> that allow for more focused follow-up questioning. This way, we may be better able to make strong inferences about children’s number sequences based on the interviews and, thus, stronger validity claims based on the match between findings from interviews and children’s written work.|$|R
40|$|As {{research}} about the learning that results when children {{play video games}} becomes more popular, questions arise about what methodological and analytical tools are most appropriate to access and document this learning. Thus far, researchers have mostly adopted pre/post assessments, ethnography, and learning analytics. In this paper we (re) introduce cognitive <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> as a methodology particularly suited to answering {{many of the most}} pressing questions about games and learning. To that end we describe four challenges of studying learning in video games with pre-post assessments that we claim can be addressed by the addition of <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews.</b> We then consider how <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> can help to explain and describe patterns detected from ethnographic observations and detailed game play logs...|$|R
25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, it is only when the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go to some sort of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured <b>Clinical</b> <b>Interview</b> for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain line of treatment is often discussed and then selected. It is important to consider all factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful to try something else.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of specialist nursing practice has blurred {{the boundaries between}} medicine and nursing. This mainly qualitative study compares the structure of epilepsy specialist nurse (ESN) and consultant neurologist (CN) <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> at first seizure presentation and opinion on diagnosis. Twenty patients with a suspected first seizure were randomly allocated for clinical review with an ESN and then a CN, or vice versa. <b>Clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> were unstructured and audio-recorded. The ESN and CN reached an independent diagnosis for each patient. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim. Emergent themes were identified, catalogued and grouped into major thematic areas. Annotated audio recordings, medical notes and dictated clinic letters were used to validate findings. Statistical analysis of inter-rater agreement of diagnosis was evaluated using Kappa. The <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> of CN and ESN were similar in structure. Differences demonstrated CNs concentrated on the prodrome to events and expressed less diagnostic uncertainty. ESNs concentrated on post-ictal recovery and used more investigations. Complete disagreement on diagnosis occurred in 5 (25 %) patients.

40|$|Researchers in {{the science}} {{education}} community make extensive use of cognitive <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> as windows into student knowledge and thinking. Despite our familiarity with the interviews, there has been very limited research addressing the ways that students understand these interactions. In this work we examine students’ behaviors and speech patterns {{in a set of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> about chemistry for evidence of their tacit understandings and underlying expectations about the activity in which they are engaged. We draw on the construct of framing from anthropology and sociolinguistics and identify clusters of behaviors that indicate that students may alternatively frame the interview as Inquiry, an Oral Examination, or an Expert Interview. We present two examples of students shifting between frames during the course of individual interviews. By examining the surrounding interaction we identify both conceptual and epistemological interviewer cues that facilitate and constrain frame shifts. We discuss the implications of dynamic student framing, that is identifiable in student behaviors and discourse, for researchers who use <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> to map student’s intuitive science knowledge...|$|R
2500|$|The rate of {{progression}} can {{be measured}} using an outcome measure called the [...] "ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R)", a 12-item instrument administered as a <b>clinical</b> <b>interview</b> or self-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability); {{it is the most}} commonly used outcome measure in clinical trials and is used by doctors to track disease progression. Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower disorder, on average, people with ALS lose about 0.9 FRS points per month. A survey-based study amongst clinicians showed that they rated a 20% change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R as being clinically meaningful.|$|E
2500|$|A 2013 review {{published}} in the European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience states [...] "that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects." [...] As {{an example of the}} problem of the superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms, the authors gave the example of a patient saying they [...] "feel depressed, sad, or down", showing that such a statement could indicate various underlying experiences: [...] "not only depressed mood but also, for instance, irritation, anger, loss of meaning, varieties of fatigue, ambivalence, ruminations of different kinds, hyper-reflectivity, thought pressure, psychological anxiety, varieties of depersonalization, and even voices with negative content, and so forth." [...] The structured interview comes with [...] "danger of over confidence in the face value of the answers, as if a simple 'yes' or 'no' truly confirmed or denied the diagnostic criterion at issue." [...] The authors gave an example: A patient who was being administered the Structured <b>Clinical</b> <b>Interview</b> for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders denied thought insertion, but during a [...] "conversational, phenomenological interview", a semi-structured interview tailored to the patient, the same patient admitted to experiencing thought insertion, along with a delusional elaboration. The authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy: either the patient did not [...] "recognize his own experience in the rather blunt, implicitly either/or formulation of the structured-interview question", or the experience did not [...] "fully articulate itself" [...] until the patient started talking about his experiences.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ) is a lay-administered, {{structured}} {{interview to}} derive insomnia disorders {{according to the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD- 10) and research diagnostic criteria/International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Second Edition (RDC/ICSD- 2). The concordance between diagnoses derived from the BIQ and <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews</b> was only moderate and the prevalence estimates based on the BIQ were significantly different from estimates based on <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews.</b> We hypothesized that a modification of the scoring algorithm closer to the diagnostic criteria would improve {{the performance of the}} BIQ. METHODS: Probability subsample of population-based epidemiological survey respondents (n= 2011) completed clinical reappraisal (n= 176) interviews. We compared the modified scoring with the original scoring in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, areas under the characteristic curve, and Cohen's kappa to detect DSM-IV-TR, ICD- 10 and RDC/ICSD- 2 insomnia diagnoses by the BIQ against <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews.</b> RESULT: The diagnostic accuracy was improved with the modified scoring. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the DSM-IV-TR, ICD- 10, RDC/ICSD- 2 and any of the insomnia diagnoses ranged from 0. 76 to 0. 87. Using the modified scoring, {{there was no significant difference}} between prevalence estimates based on the BIQ classification and <b>clinical</b> <b>interviews.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The BIQ with modified scoring enhanced case detection and produced more accurate prevalence estimates of DSM-IV-TR, ICD- 10 and RDC/ICSD- 2 insomnia disorders. With scoring algorithms now extended to DSM- 5 and ICSD- 3 diagnoses, the BIQ should be more widely used in clinical and research settings...|$|R
