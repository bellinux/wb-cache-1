The water vapour absorption and desorption processes of laminated leather are described. Water vapour absorption in the laminated leather and its separate layers may {{be classified as}} non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for the leather of different structures. Water vapour desorption of leather changes according to the exponential law and for microporous film according to the linear one. Water vapour absorption/desorption mechanism depends on the leather permeability. Microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer properties of the laminated leather.

Three-dimensional moisture flow simulations are conducted, that show how the stratigraphic units and fault offsets and properties at Yucca Mountain create complex three-dimensional flow patterns. Even for a really uniform infiltration rates, these geological complexities result in large lateral flow components and often concentrated flow into the water table. When the major faults are assumed to act as <b>capillary</b> barriers, <b>moisture</b> buildup occurs close to the faults. Conversely, when the faults are assumed to readily absorb water and allow for vertical migration, lateral flow is greatly enhanced and relatively dry conditions {{are found in the}} rock matrix adjacent to the faults.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{isotropic}} {{materials with}} a significant fraction of micro-pores, the cumulative water intake per unit of inflow surface area typically yields a linear function of the square root of time elapse. The authors postulate that this dependence has a limited range of validity. The validity of this approximation starts from an initial period that is inversely proportional to the rate of water intake and ends much before the material reaches the <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> content. Experimental investigation presented here uses a differential presentation of the cumulative water inflow and clearly indicates that material such as calcium silicate or brick belong to a broad class of materials characterized by a constant water absorption coefficient (A-coefficient). Initial period varies from 12 to 4 minutes. On the other hand, materials with a multiple pore-system such as an Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) may display a systematically varying A-coefficient.

40|$|A coupled sharp-front (SF) liquid {{transport}} and evaporation model {{is used to}} describe the capillary rise of moisture in monoliths and masonry structures. This provides a basis for the quantitative engineering analysis of moisture dynamics in such structures, with particular application to the conservation of historic buildings and monuments. We show how such a system responds to seasonal variations in the potential evaporation (PE) of the immediate environment, using meteorological data from southern England and Athens, Greece. Results from the SF analytical model are compared with those from finite-element unsaturated-flow simulations. We examine the magnitude and variation of the total flow through a structure as a primary factor in long-term damage caused by leaching, salt crystallization and chemical degradation. We find wide seasonal variation in the height of moisture rise, and this, together with the large estimated water flows, provides a new explanation of the observed position of salt-crystallization damage. The analysis also allows us to estimate the effects of future climate change on the <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> dynamics of monoliths and masonry structures. For example, for southern England, predicted increases in PE for the period 2070 – 2100 suggest substantial increases in water flux, from which we expect increased damage rates...|$|E

Knitting pattern and density are two very important features in assembly which can influence fabric properties. In the case of compression garments, the type of knitting pattern (warp or circular) can complement the design and provide the most effective level of compression.

40|$|The Boltzmann {{transformation}} {{method is}} {{used to determine the}} liquid water diffusivity from moisture content profiles as measured in a capillary water absorption experiment. An inter-laboratory comparison for analyzing the reliability of the determination method showed that the inaccuracy in the liquid water diffusivity is caused by scatter in the transformed data and by uncertainty in the boundary conditions at the intake surface and ahead of the steep moisture front. A methodology is proposed based on (1) the evaluation of the validity of the diffusion approach, (2) a simplified handling of the boundary conditions, (3) smoothing of the scattered data and (4) the evaluation {{of the quality of the}} determined liquid water diffusivity. For HAM (Heat-Air-Moisture transport) calculations values of the liquid water diffusivity for moisture contents higher than the <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> content are disregarded. The liquid water diffusivity can be described by an exponential function limited at a lower moisture content bound. To describe the moisture diffusivity including liquid water and water vapour transports, a new parametric description of the moisture diffusivity is presented, which shows sufficient flexibility both in the hygroscopic and overhygroscopic ranges. When permeability is calculated from diffusivity, the permeability should monotonically increase with decreasing capillary pressure. In the hygroscopic region it should coincide with the measured water vapour permeabilities...|$|E
40|$|We {{deal with}} the textural aspects, {{porometry}} and hydric behaviour of combinations of building materials and their durability under attack by salt crystallisation and freezing. We selected 4 types of lime mortar (pure lime mortar, lime mortar + air-entraining agent, lime mortar + pozzolana and lime mortar + air-entraining agent + pozzolana) which were used in combination with either brick or calcarenite stone. Lime mortars were chosen because they are compatible with traditional building materials, including the bricks and calcarenites that were widely used in the historical buildings that make up our architectural heritage. There are more similarities between the pore size ranges in calcarenites and mortars than there are between those in bricks and mortars. In all cases, a fine layer of calcite microcrystals develops at the contact surface between the mortar and the stone or brick. This is produced by {{the transformation of the}} portlandite, which concentrates in this area due to <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> migration. This surface may on the one hand represent an obstacle to the flow of water between the different parts of the system formed by these materials, but on the other it may also favour greater adherence between the components, especially in the calcarenite + mortar combination, which proved to be the most resistant to deterioration in the freeze–thaw tests...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiscale}} network {{approach is}} proposed {{as a practical}} method for estimating the isothermal permeability of porous building materials covering hygroscopic and overhygroscopic ranges. The multiscale approach {{is based on the}} concept of examining the porous space at different levels of magnification, and it allows modeling of combined liquid water and water vapor transfer over a wide saturation range. The proposed method simply requires the knowledge of common moisture properties, such as the capillary pressure curve, the capillary absorption coefficient and water vapor permeability, which can be determined from standard experiments. Hysteresis between drainage and wetting due to air entrapment can be adequately modeled by considering only those pores that become filled by water. The calculated network permeability is validated comparing experimental and simulation results of isothermal capillary absorption and drying processes in ceramic brick and calcium silicate. It is shown that transient moisture processes of capillary absorption from a dry sample and the isothermal drying from an initially capillary saturated sample can be accurately modeled by a single nonlinear permeability and capillary pressure curve. The capillary pressure curve to be used is the main wetting curve, which describes the moisture content relationship from the dry state to the <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> content, correctly taking into account air entrapment phenomena.

40|$|Many {{problems}} faced by geotechnical engineers require the prediction of the water flux boundary condition at the soil surface. Soil covers for the decommissioning of landfills and tailings piles {{are one of the}} primary engineering applications in this category. The purpose of a cover may be to minimize infiltration, reduce radon fluxes, or prevent the generation of acidic leachates. Two cover concepts which are currently being evaluated for various applications are <b>capillary</b> barriers and <b>moisture</b> retaining covers. Both of these concepts involve multi-layered soil covers in which the soils and the layering combinations are chosen to achieve the design requirements. The processes of evaporation and moisture redistribution in homogeneous and layered soils were studied through the use of column evaporation tests. Six soil columns were tested: three homogeneous profiles, and three layered configurations. The soils used for the column evaporation tests were an aeolian sand (Beaver Creek sand), a natural silt, and a processed silt. The column evaporation tests were conducted with a constant head boundary condition (representing a shallow water table) {{at the base of the}} column for 31 days, after which the lower boundary condition was changed to a zero flux condition. The column evaporation tests were continued for approximately 30 days with the zero flux boundary condition at the base of the column. Measurements taken during the column evaporation tests included gravimetric water contents, temperatures, suctions (using tensiometers) and evaporation rates. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the influence of soil hydraulic properties (saturated hydraulic conductivity, air entryvalue, andpore size distribution index) on the maximum evaporation rate sustainable from soil profiles corresponding to those used in the column evaporation tests. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the air entry value have a greater effect on the maximum evaporation rate than the pore size distribution index for the soils and layering combinations analyzed. The column evaporation tests were modelled using the computer program SWIM (Soil Water Infiltration and Movement). SWIM is based on the Richards equation for flow in unsaturated porous media and accounts only for liquid phase flow. The SWIM model was limited by the curve fitting functions used to determine moisture retention curves and hydraulic conductivity functions. The computed moisture contents from SWIM showed reasonable agreement for the natural silt and processed silt. The results for the Beaver Creek sand showed poor agreement due to the steep moisture retention curve for this material. This thesis indicates that selective layering of multi-layered soil covers has potential in designing <b>capillary</b> barriers or <b>moisture</b> retaining covers where the covers will be subjected to predominantly evaporative conditions...|$|R

The analysis is focused to small salt concentrations, having practically negligible effect on the material porosity but significantly increasing hygroscopic moisture content of the bricks. The simply experiment, consisting in monitoring of isothermal one-dimensional capillary uptake and following drying was carried out for salt free and salt contaminated bricks. Tests were done for two different salt concentrations. The moisture uptake and release during the tests was determined by weighting the samples. The experimental results were compared with numerical simulation {{of the process of}} drying.

On the basis of the comparison, the effect of salt contamination on moisture transport parameters was evaluated.

40|$|Wind-driven rain (WDR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} moisture sources for a building facade. Therefore, a reliable prediction of WDR loads is a prerequisite to assess the durability of building facade components. However, current state of the art Heat-Air-Moisture (HAM) models that are used to assess the moisture behaviour of building facades are still based on several simplifications. Important phenomena of WDR such as raindrop impact, absorption, evaporation and runoff are not yet taken fully into account. This paper presents the implementation and application of a rainwater runoff model coupled to a 2 D HAM model. In the first part of the paper, the runoff model itself is briefly described and implemented. In the second part, the coupled runoff-HAM model is used to calculate absorption and runoff of WDR during a two-shower rain event on two different types of porous facades with different capillary absorption coefficient and <b>capillary</b> <b>moisture</b> content. The calculation is performed with a realistic distribution of the impinging WDR intensity, based on CFD simulations, and with meteorological data, on a 10 - minute basis. The impinging rain water that cannot be absorbed by the material develops a water film on the surface and runs down along the wall. It is shown that runoff of WDR can have significant influence on the moisture behaviour of the facade, e. g. materials with low capillary absorption coefficients may absorb almost double the amount of impinging WDR when including runoff. Also the moistening time of the facade was to be found extended. To conclude some important notes are given for future development of runoff model...|$|E
50|$|The {{soil type}} {{is one of}} the most {{essential}} factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate bearing capacity and drainage, and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of sand and gravel. Well graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low frost heave potential. Sand and clay can be susceptible to erosion. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against capillary action responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting <b>capillary</b> draw of <b>moisture</b> by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of seawater level resulting from tidal fluctuations is usually neglected in regional groundwater flow studies. Although the tidal oscillation is damped near the shoreline, {{there is a}} quasi-steady-slate rise in the mean water-table position, which may have an influence on regional groundwater flow. In this paper the effects of tidal fluctuations on groundwater hydraulics are investigated using a variably saturated numerical model that includes {{the effects of a}} realistic mild beach slope, seepage face and the unsaturated zone. In particular the impact of these factors on the velocity field in the aquifer is assessed. Simulations show that the tidal fluctuation has substantial consequences for the local velocity field {{in the vicinity of the}} exit face, which affects the nearshore migration of contaminant in coastal aquifers. An overheight in the water table as a result of the tidal fluctuation is observed anti this has a significant effect on groundwater discharge to the sea when the landward boundary condition is a constant water level. The effect of beach slope is very significant and simplifying the problem by considering a vertical beach face causes serious errors in predicting the water-table position and the groundwater flux. For media with a high effective <b>capillary</b> fringe, the <b>moisture</b> retained above the water table is important in determining the effects of the tidal fluctuations.

40|$|There {{have been}} recent {{developments}} in grippers {{that are based on}} capillary force and condensed water droplets. These are used for manipulating micro-sized objects. Recently, one-finger grippers have been produced that are able to reliably grip using the capillary force. To release objects, either the van der Waals, gravitational or inertial-forces method is used. This article presents methods for reliably gripping and releasing micro-objects using the <b>capillary</b> force. The <b>moisture</b> from the surrounding air is condensed into a thin layer of water on the contact surfaces of the objects. From the thin layer of water, a water meniscus between the micro-sized object, the gripper and the releasing surface is created. Consequently, the water meniscus between the object and the releasing surface produces a high enough capillary force to release the micro-sized object from the tip of the one-finger gripper. In this case, either polystyrene, glass beads with diameters between 5 – 60 µm, or irregularly shaped dust particles of similar sizes were used. 3 D structures made up of micro-sized objects could be constructed using this method. This method is reliable for releasing during assembly and also for gripping, when the objects are removed {{from the top of the}} 3 D structure—the so-called “disassembling gripping” process. The accuracy of the release was lower than 0. 5 µm...|$|R
