Wheat is the primary <b>cereal</b> <b>grain</b> with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.

Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period.

5|$|The corn crake's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds {{a nest of}} grass leaves in a hollow {{in the ground and}} lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and <b>cereal</b> <b>grain.</b> Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.|$|E
