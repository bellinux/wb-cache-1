40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in creating computer games for learning, problem solving, and other high-level cognitive activities. When investigating whether gameplay {{is conducive to}} such activities, gameplay is often studied as a whole. As a result, cognitive implications {{can be linked to}} the game but not to its structural elements. Given that gameplay arises from interaction between the player and the game, it is the structural <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> that should be investigated to better understand the design of gameplay. Furthermore, minor variations in the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> can have significant cognitive implications. However, such variation has not been studied yet. Thus, {{to gain a better understanding}} of how we can study the effect <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> on the cognitive aspect of gameplay, we conducted an exploratory investigation of two computer games.

40|$|This paper {{advocates for}} {{supporting}} movement awareness in ubiquitous computing {{as a means}} of transforming technology design through an approach that considers movement as an experiential <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> rather than a solely functional one. Somatic awareness, or the awareness of the body from the inside, is one of the primary components of movement experience, yet its resource for technology design is not yet fully understood within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The inclusion of phenomenological movement experience in computational interaction has the potential to improve user experience, enhance the fidelity and quality of communication, and produce heightened engagement for users. Although somatic awareness has received little attention within HCI, other disciplines offer theories and frameworks that can inform the development of technology to support movement awareness. Through the discussion of theories of embodiment from a diverse range of disciplines including cognitive science, dance, somatic practices, and philosophy, this paper presents an argument for the importance of movement experience as a <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> with technology. It provides a history of movement within HCI, highlighting movement’s role in a variety of theories and frameworks, and identifies two distinct approaches toward the utilization of movement in HCI — task oriented and experience-oriented.

Disentangling the positive and negative <b>components</b> <b>of</b> species <b>interactions</b> is a critical step in advancing our understanding <b>of</b> how the <b>interaction</b> between organisms shift along physical and biotic gradients. We performed a manipulative field experiment to quantify the positive and negative <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interactions</b> between a perennial forb, Aster tenuifolius, and three dominant, matrix-forming grasses and rushes in a New England salt marsh. Specifically, we asked whether positive and negative interaction components: (1) are unique or redundant across three matrix-forming species (two grasses; Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, and one rush; Juncus gerardi), and (2) change across Aster life stages (seedling, juvenile, and adult). For adult Aster the strength <b>of</b> the facilitative <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the matrix-forb <b>interaction</b> was stronger than the competitive <b>component</b> for two <b>of</b> the three matrix species, leading to net positive interactions. There was no statistically significant variation among matrix species in their net or component effects. We found little difference in the effects of J. gerardi on Aster at later life-history stages; interaction component strengths did not differ between juveniles and adults. However, mortality of seedlings in neighbor removal plots was 100 %, indicating a particularly strong and critical facilitative effect of matrix species on this forb during the earliest life stages. Overall, our results indicate that matrix forming grasses and rushes have important, yet largely redundant, positive net effects on Aster performance across its life cycle.

Two of the three participants significantly slowed their reactions in expectation of the stop signal as revealed by a control experiment without stop signals.

An innovative seeding technique that exploits the peculiar photon conversion topology, successfully applied in the CMS track reconstruction sequence, is presented. The performances of this technique and the substantial enhancement of photon conversion reconstruction efficiency are discussed. Application examples are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{membrane}} phospholipid affinity data,, for 14 basic drugs spanning a wide lipophilicity range {{were measured}} by HPLC {{on two different}} phospholipid stationary phases, i. e. IAM. PC. MG and IAM. PC. DD 2. These data related weakly with log PN values, the n-octanol/water partition coefficients of the neutral forms; poorer relationships were found with log D 7. 0 values, the n-octanol/water partition coefficients of the mixtures of neutral and ionized forms at pH 7. 0. The lack of collinearity confirms that, differently from partition in n-octanol/water, partition in phospholipids encodes not only lipophilic/hydrophobic intermolecular recognition forces but also ionic bonds, due to electrostatic interactions between electrically charged species and phospholipids, according to the ???pH-piston hypothesis???. This <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> was parameterized by ?? values; they are {{the differences between the}} values experimentally measured and the values expected for neutral isolipophilic compounds. ?? values of the various analytes changed almost linearly from positive to negative values at increasing lipophilicity. This behaviour is consistent with an interaction mechanism with membrane phospholipids including two intermolecular interaction forces: i) lipophilic/hydrophobic interactions, which decrease on ionization proportionally to the lipophilicity of the neutral forms, and ii) electrostatic interactions, which increase on ionization and are quite constant for all the analytes at a given ionization degree. Since BBB passage of the considered compounds is supposed to be based on passive mechanisms, we investigated the possible relationships between log BB values, i. e. the logarithms of the ratio between brain and blood concentrations, and three physico-chemical parameters, i. e. i) log PN (lipophilic interaction of the neutral form), ii) (global interaction with phospholipids), and iii) ?? (electrostatic <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> with phospholipids). Log BB values related better with log PN than with values, suggesting that the electrostatic interactions encoded in the latter parameter might act as trapping forces in a phospholipid barrier. Actually, we observed an inverse linear dependence of log BB on ?? values, but only for the compounds showing positive ?? values. We conclude that the driving force for BBB passage is the lipophilicity of the neutral forms, log PN, and not the lipophilicity actually displayed at the experimental pH, log D 7. 0. Indeed, the latter does not adequately take into account the role played by protonation in the analyte/membrane interactions because protonation, although hindering membrane passage, can either reduce or enhance partition in phospholipids, depending on analyte lipophilicity...|$|E

The scale derived from the IAM system {{was different from the}} lipophilicity scale expressed by the log P, due to the peculiar capability of phospholipids to well accommodate the ionized form of some molecules and show additive or repulsive extra-interactions when particular structural motifs on the molecule are present. The relationship between log P and log kw previously obtained for compounds interacting on IAM phase by a uniquely lipophilicity-based mechanism, allowed us to calculate, from log P, the values of log kw expected for the drugs considered. These values were subtracted from the log kw experimentally determined and the differences were assumed to quantify the amount of extra-interactions (hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions) with phospholipids (delta log kw). The coefficients of permeability through the human skin (Kp) for the compounds considered did not correlate with either log kw or log P values.
