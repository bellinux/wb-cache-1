40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{applications to}} food process {{are well known}} due {{to the possibility of}} quickly and uniformly heating food matrix (1). Fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> conventional production technology consists of a first steam pasteurization for a period varying from 2 to 10 min depending on pasta size and weight, initial microbial density and wet steam or superheated steam, followed by a drying phase with forced hot air at a temperature not exceeding 65 °- 70 °C to increase pasta consistency and stabilize the shape. Fresh semolina pasta RF pasteurization/pre-drying process is already used by some companies a reduction of microbiological parameters, reduced time pasteurization, a better cooking bheavior, keeping g a great intensity taste and aroma the typical of fresh semolina <b>pasta.</b> Fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> production has several healthy and technology problems with respect to fresh semolina pasta, thus RF pasteurization/pre-drying process requires a proper implementation and evaluation of effects on different types of products.
