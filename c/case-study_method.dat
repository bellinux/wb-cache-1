50|$|The {{purposes}} of the standards include combatting ignorance of science, creating common standards for teaching in the U.S., and developing greater interest in science among students so that more of them choose to major {{in science and technology}} in college. Overall, the guidelines are intended to help students deeply understand core scientific concepts, to understand the scientific process of developing and testing ideas, and to have a greater ability to evaluate scientific evidence. Curricula based on the standards may cover fewer topics, but will go more deeply into specific topics, possibly using a <b>case-study</b> <b>method</b> and emphasizing critical thinking and primary investigation. Possible approaches to implementing the standards may even include replacing traditional siloed high school courses such as biology and chemistry with a case-study approach that uses a more holistic method of teaching science. Many education supply companies have already started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers implement these new principles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study that {{demonstrates}} how to apply pattern matching as an analytical <b>method</b> in <b>case-study</b> research. Case-study design is appropriate for the investigation of highly-contextualized phenomena that occur within the social world.

The findings from such multiple methods can be reconciled in case-study analysis, specifically through a pattern-matching technique. Although this technique is theoretically explained in the literature, there is scant guidance on how to apply the method practically when analyzing data. This paper demonstrates the steps taken during pattern matching in a completed case-study project that investigated the influence of cultural diversity in a multicultural nursing workforce on the quality and safety of patient care.

Appropriate scientific methods were only used to investigate cognitive performance in a modest number of studies up to the 1960 s, and it was being argued as late as the mid 1970 s that affective processes rather than cognitive processes were the key to understanding the psychological aspects of MS. However, the early 1980 s, saw major developments in test procedures for the detection of subtle and selective cognitive changes, in the use of brain imaging techniques, and in collaboration between neurologists and neuropsychologists.

40|$|Abstract: We discuss {{three ways}} to {{coordinate}} descriptions of mathematical knowledge with psychometric models (i. e., statistical models for tests) when building assessments. The three examples are sequenced {{to move from}} more coarse-grained to more fine-grained descriptions of mathematical knowledge and to move from models that simply scale to those that both scale and classify. We use tests on rational number developed for in-service middle school teachers to illustrate each combination. Our primary goal is to describe and compare several approaches to assessment that can inform research in undergraduate mathematics education as well, not to describe results of research on teachers in detail. In this paper we examine different ways that the research base in mathematics education can be leveraged to build tests {{that can be used}} with large samples. Much of the research on mathematical thinking has relied on <b>case-study</b> <b>methods</b> that provide insight into how individuals access and use knowledge in the course of reasoning about problem situations. The time and effort required to use these methods renders them impractical with large samples. Large-scale tests, especially multiple-choice tests, are relatively easy to administer to large samples, but are usually insensitive to aspects of reasoning that case-study work has identified as essential fo...|$|R

Over time, there has been a slight improvement in boys’ literacy performance but the greatest area of growth is generally boys’ numeracy, rather than boys’ literacy. Further aims of the study were to isolate school-based factors, which are potentially responsible for this phenomenon, from community-based factors and to explore the possibility that, rather than boys being advantaged, girls were actually being disadvantaged by practices at the school.

30|$|Logistics {{collaboration}} {{has emerged}} a prevalent strategy to mitigate challenge {{individuals and organizations}} encounter. A successful collaboration, however, depends on certain trustworthy behaviors partner exhibit. To that end, understanding aspects constituting behavioral uncertainty and mechanisms by which such aspects affect partner trust is a necessary. This necessity counts on emergent behavioral trust uncertainties, constituted by partner’s actions and interactions occurring during collaboration. While this is a necessary requirement, {{most of the studies}} in the literature lack {{to take into account the}} influence of behavioral uncertainty on collaboration and partner trust. To that effect, this paper uncovers outlined limitation by establishing behavioral factors influencing partner trust in operational stage of logistics collaboration. To accomplish this objective, a systematic literature review (SLR) is deployed to consolidate research domains of logistics, supply chain, collaboration, and trust. SLR proceeds by defining a review protocol, followed by a search process conducted in 5 databases using 20 search terms on articles published between 2001 and 2015 inclusively. Among findings this SLR has revealed are four behavioral factors and thirteen criteria proposed to affect partner trust. Additionally, these factors constitute success and measurable criteria needed for empirical investigation which may employ experimental and/or <b>case-study</b> <b>methods.</b> Moreover, synthesized factors extend further an understanding of behavioral trust in ad hoc collaborative networks, a large part of which being supported by networks of humans and computers.|$|R

Does this context {{have an effect on the}} way in which research is integrated into more traditional scholarly culture? What is the impact of national infrastructure and funding regimes? The research sought to determine how, within the confines of what is practicable and realistic, the creation and use of digital resources in the humanities can best be carried out. Research was conducted using qualitative <b>case-study</b> <b>methods</b> and compared the history and development of a sample of projects in the USA and England. Findings were that institutional commitment to humanities computing was vital, and that this is best achieved when centres focus on research rather than teaching or support. Funding was found to be a key issue, as was the way in which young scholars are developed. All of these issues were affected by the prestige which humanities computing is perceived to have amongst more traditional scholars, since the discipline has been threatened in institutions where humanities computing is not held in high esteem. It is therefore argued that researchers in humanities computing must communicate the importance of their work to their more traditional colleagues to ensure the continued survival of the discipline...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{the main}} {{aim of this}} paper is to clarify several issues of {{conflicting}} jurisdiction over crimes committed on board aircraft in flight. The study will examine the way in which the Tokyo Convention attempts to provide justice in the event of aviation security violations, and discuss its effectiveness in preventing such offences in the future. Methods: formal legal and <b>case-study</b> <b>methods</b> together with inductive reasoning, and comparison were used to analyse the legislation in the area of jurisdiction over crimes and other offences committed on board aircraft in flight. Results: it follows from the study that although the Tokyo Convention has contributed considerably to the establishing of clearer rules of jurisdiction over offences committed on board aircraft, considerable deficiencies of this treaty remain. The results have important implications for international policy-making. Discussion: the results of the study reveal several weaknesses of the Tokyo Convention. Firstly, it does not provide any definition or list of offences to which it applies, instead it relies on national penal laws to do so. In addition, the ‘freedom fighter exception’ and the lack of a strong enforcement mechanism may prove to impede the effective attainment of the Tokyo Convention’s main objectives – that is, to provide justice in the event of aviation security violations, and prevent such offences in the future. Therefore, further improvement in aviation security legislation is necessary to ensure that it is effective and adequate in the challenges faced today. </p...|$|R

Objective We demonstrate how a landscape vulnerability framework combining sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and exposure to climate change framed along two main axes of concern can help to identify potential strategies for conservation and adaptation decision-making, using a landscape in Madagascar’s spiny forest as a <b>case-study.</b> <b>Methods</b> To apply such a vulnerability landscape assessment, we inferred the sensitivity of habitats using temporal and spatial botanical data-sets, {{including the use of}} fossil pollen data and vegetation surveys. For understanding adaptive capacity, we analysed existing spatial maps (reflecting anthropogenic stressors) showing the degree of habitat connectivity, matrix quality and protected area coverage for the different habitats in the landscape. Lastly, for understanding exposures, we used climate change predictions in Madagascar, together with a digital elevation model. Results The fossil pollen data showed how sensitive arid-adapted species were to past climate changes, especially the conditions between 1000 and 500 cal yr BP. The spatial analysis then helped locate habitats on the two-dimensional axes of concern integrating sensitivity, adaptive capacity and climate change exposure. By identifying resistant, resilient, susceptible, and sensitive habitats to climate change in the landscape under study, we identify very different approaches to integrate conservation and adaptation strategies in contrasting habitats. Conclusion This framework, illustrated through a case study, provides easy guidance for identifying potential integrated conservation and adaptation strategies, taking into account aspects of climate vulnerability and conservation capacity...|$|R
