25|$|A Nicol prism was {{an early}} type of {{birefringent}} polarizer, that consists of a crystal of calcite which has been split and rejoined with <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam.</b> The crystal is cut such that the o- and e-rays are in orthogonal linear polarization states. Total internal reflection of the o-ray occurs at the balsam interface, since it experiences a larger refractive index in calcite than in the balsam, and the ray is deflected {{to the side of}} the crystal. The e-ray, which sees a smaller refractive index in the calcite, is transmitted through the interface without deflection. Nicol prisms produce a very high purity of polarized light, and were extensively used in microscopy, though in modern use they have been mostly replaced with alternatives such as the Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Foucault prism, and Glan–Taylor prism. These prisms are not true polarizing beamsplitters since only the transmitted beam is fully polarized.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting and his partner, Isaac A. Rehn, {{took out}} three patents that were [...] "improvements" [...] in the wet-plate {{collodion}} process. Cutting developed {{a method for}} adhering the two pieces of glass together using <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam.</b> Though meant {{as a way to}} hermetically seal the ambrotypes as a preservation method, the process was ultimately unnecessary as the varnish layer itself worked extremely well as a protectant. In fact, ambrotypes that utilized Cutting's patent are known to exhibit deterioration caused by the technique. Numerous high-profile lawsuits (E. Anthony, J. Gurney, C.D. Fredericks, J. Bogardus) and disputes surrounding the patents may have had an intimidating effect, and discouraged a wider use of [...] "instantaneous" [...] (stop action) photography during the Civil War. Cutting's patented formula featured the chemical component, bromide of potassium, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the collodion. When the patent extensions came up for renewal in 1868, the Patent Office decided that the original patents should not have been issued, and the extension was denied. The decision was partly based on evidence found in Henry Snelling's book, [...] "The History and Practice of Photography." [...] Snelling in 1853 had described the use of the same key ingredients found in Cutting's high-speed, emulsion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> {{was also}} {{commonly}} used for making permanent microscope slides. In biology, for example, {{it can be}} used to conserve microscopic samples by sandwiching the sample between a microscope slide and a glass coverslip, using <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> to glue the arrangement together and enclose the sample to conserve it. Xylene balsam, <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> dissolved in xylene, is also used for preparing slide mounts. Some workers prefer terpene resin for slide mounts, as it is both less acidic and cheaper than balsam. Synthetic resins have largely replaced organic balsams for such applications.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its high}} optical {{quality and the}} {{similarity}} of its refractive index to that of crown glass (n = 1.55), purified and filtered <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> was traditionally used in optics as an invisible-when-dry glue for glass, such as lens elements. Lenses glued with <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> (or with other similar glues) are called cemented lenses. Also, other optical elements can be cemented with <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam,</b> such as two prisms bonded to form a beam splitter. Balsam was phased out as an optical adhesive during World War II, in favour of polyester, epoxy, and urethane-based adhesives. In modern optical manufacturing, UV-cured epoxies are often used to bond lens elements.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> {{is in the}} construction of the Nicol prism. A Nicol prism consists of a calcite crystal cut into two halves. <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> is placed between the two layers. Calcite is an anisotropic crystal and has different refractive indices for rays polarized along directions parallel and perpendicular to its optic axis. These rays with differing refractive indices are known as the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The refractive index for <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> is in between the refractive index for the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Hence the ordinary ray will be totally internally reflected. The emergent ray will be linearly polarized, and traditionally this has been one of the popular ways of producing polarized light.|$|E

50|$|<b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> is {{amorphous}} when dried. Since it {{does not}} crystallize with age, its optical properties do not deteriorate. However, it has poor thermal and solvent resistance.|$|E

50|$|Optical relief (usually {{noted as}} simply relief) {{is a concept}} in optical {{mineralogy}} which refers to the degree in which mineral grains {{stand out from the}} mounting medium, usually either oil with a known refractive index or <b>Canada</b> <b>Balsam.</b> Relief {{is an important part of}} the Becke line test.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, in 1905, John Crewe Wood, a {{solicitor}} in Swindon, Wiltshire, England, patented a {{laminated glass}} {{for use as}} windscreens / windshields.

50|$|Certain optical components, {{such as a}} Wollaston prism or Nicol prism, {{are made}} of {{multiple}} transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other.

50|$|The Wollaston prism {{consists}} of two orthogonal calcite prisms, cemented together on their base (traditionally with <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam)</b> to form two right triangle prisms with perpendicular optic axes. Outgoing light beams diverge from the prism, giving two polarized rays, with the angle of divergence determined by the prisms' wedge angle and the wavelength of the light. Commercial prisms are available with divergence angles from 15° to about 45°.|$|E
50|$|Nicol {{made his}} prism by {{bisecting}} a parallelepiped of Iceland spar (a naturally occurring, transparent crystalline form of calcium carbonate) along its shortest diagonal, then cementing {{the two halves}} together with <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam.</b> Light entering the prism is refracted into two rays, one of which emerges as plane-polarized light. Nicol prisms greatly facilitated the study of refraction and polarization, and were later used to investigate molecular structures and optical activity of organic compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Carding. Insects (especially Coleoptera and Hemiptera) are {{glued to}} {{rectangular}} pieces of acid free card or Bristol board providing a stage. Typical sizes are 4.5 x 11 mm;5 x 14 mm;6 x 17 mm;10 x 21 mm;13 x 30 mm. Printed lines allow uniform {{placement of the}} entomological pin. Though this is convenient, it is dubious practice at best, because it obscures features that might be necessary for taxonomic or morphological studies. In any case, {{at the very least}} the glue should be sufficiently conveniently soluble to be removed with solvents when necessary. With such considerations in mind, <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> is about as good an adhesive as any.|$|E
50|$|A Glan-Thompson prism {{is a type}} of {{polarizing}} prism {{similar to}} the Nicol and Glan-Foucault prisms. It consists of two right-angled calcite prisms that are cemented together by their long faces. The optical axes of the calcite crystals are parallel and aligned perpendicular to the plane of reflection. Birefringence splits light entering the prism into two rays, experiencing different refractive indices; the p-polarized ordinary ray is totally internally reflected from the calcite-cement interface, leaving the s-polarized extraordinary ray to be transmitted. The prism can therefore be used as a polarizing beam splitter. Traditionally <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> was used as the cement in assembling these prisms, but this has largely been replaced by synthetic polymers.|$|E
50|$|A Nicol prism {{is a type}} of polarizer, {{an optical}} device used to produce a {{polarized}} beam of light. It is made {{in such a way that}} it eliminates one of the rays by total internal reflection, i.e the ordinary ray is eliminated and only the extraordinary ray is transmitted through the prism. It was the first type of polarizing prism, invented in 1828 by William Nicol (1770-1851) of Edinburgh. It consists of a rhombohedral crystal of Iceland spar (a variety of calcite) that has been cut at an angle of 68° with respect to the crystal axis, cut again diagonally, and then rejoined as shown, using a layer of transparent <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> as a glue.|$|E
5000|$|The Becke {{line test}} is a {{technique}} in optical mineralogy that helps determine the relative refractive index of two materials. It is done by lowering the stage (increasing the focal distance) of the petrographic microscope and observing which direction the light appears to [...] "move" [...] toward. This movement will always go into the material of higher refractive index. Typically, this is done by comparing 1) two (or more) minerals, 2) a mineral versus thin section epoxy (or other cement such as <b>Canada</b> <b>Balsam</b> which has a moderate refractive index of 1.54), and/or 3) a mineral versus an oil of known refractive index (as in oil immersion studies). They are also used for the addition of gold to gold or in gold to gold extractions.|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{examples}} of plant resins include amber, Balm of Gilead, balsam, <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam,</b> Boswellia, copal from trees of Protium copal and Hymenaea courbaril, dammar gum from {{trees of the}} family Dipterocarpaceae, Dragon's blood from the dragon trees (Dracaena species), elemi, frankincense from Boswellia sacra, galbanum from Ferula gummosa, gum guaiacum from the lignum vitae trees of the genus Guaiacum, kauri gum from trees of Agathis australis, hashish (Cannabis resin) from Cannabis indica, labdanum from mediterranean species of Cistus, mastic (plant resin) from the mastic tree Pistacia lentiscus, myrrh from shrubs of Commiphora, sandarac resin from Tetraclinis articulata, the national tree of Malta, styrax (a Benzoin resin from various Styrax species), Spinifex resin from Australian Spinifex grasses, and turpentine, distilled from pine resin.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{varieties}} {{of the species}} are very popular as Christmas trees, particularly in the northeastern United States. The resin is used to produce <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam,</b> and was traditionally used as a cold remedy and as a glue for glasses, optical instrument components, and for preparing permanent mounts of microscope specimens. Given its use as a traditional remedy and the relatively high ascorbic acid content of its needles, historian Jacques Mathieu {{has argued that the}} balsam fir was the [...] "aneda" [...] that cured scurvy during the second expedition into Canada of Jacques Cartier. The wood is milled for framing lumber (part of SPF lumber), siding and pulped for paper manufacture. Balsam fir oil is an EPA approved nontoxic rodent repellent. The balsam fir is also used as an air freshener and as incense.|$|E
50|$|Fine-grained rocks, {{particularly}} those containing minerals of high birefringence, such as calcite, are sometimes prepared as ultra-thin sections. An ordinary 30 μm thin section is prepared {{as described above}} but the slice of rock {{is attached to the}} glass slide using a soluble cement such as <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> (soluble in ethanol) to allow both sides to be worked on. The section is then polished on both sides using a fine diamond paste until it has a thickness in the range of 2-12 μm. This technique has been used to study the microstructure of fine-grained carbonates such as the Lochseitenkalk mylonite in which the matrix grains are less than 5 μm in size. This method is also sometimes used in the preparation of mineral and rock specimens for transmission electron microscopy and allows greater accuracy in comparing features using both optical and electron imaging.|$|E
50|$|In 1851 John Benjamin Dancer invented microphotographs using a {{collodion}} {{process and}} a microscope {{converted to a}} camera. This resulted in a microphotograph about 3 mm2 in area. The main disadvantage of Dancer's method was that the viewing of the microphotographs required a microscope which {{was at the time}} an expensive instrument. In 1857 Dagron solved the problem by inventing a method of mounting the microphotographs {{at the end of a}} small cylindrical lens. Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally biconvex Stanhope lens and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the focal length of the convex side of the cylindrical lens. This produced a plano-convex lens, where Dagron was able to mount the microscopic photograph on the flat side of the lens using <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> as adhesive. This arrangement enabled the picture to be focused.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, non-cubic {{ceramics}} can {{be prepared}} as thin sections, also known as petrography, for examination by polarized transmitted light microscopy. In this technique, the specimen is sawed to ~1 mm thick, glued to a microscope slide, and ground to a thickness (x) approaching 30 µm. [...] A cover slip is glued onto the exposed surface. The adhesives, such as epoxy or <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> resin, must have approximately the same refractive index (η ≈ 1.54) as glass. Most ceramics have a very small absorption coefficient (α ≈ 0.5 cm &minus;1 for alumina in Fig. 2) in the Beer-Lambert law below, and can be viewed in transmitted light. Cubic ceramics, e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia and spinel, have the same refractive index in all crystallographic directions and are, therefore, opaque when the microscope's polarizer is 90° out of phase with its analyzer.|$|E
5000|$|Doublets can be air-spaced, cemented, or [...] "oiled." [...] Oiled {{doublets}} {{hold the}} optical fluid {{in place with}} surface tension alone. In a cemented doublet, the lenses are held together by an adhesive with mechanical strength, such as optically transparent epoxy. <b>Canada</b> <b>balsam</b> was traditionally used for this purpose. Some doublets use no adhesive between the lenses, relying on external fixturing to hold them together, either because the optical design requires a gap or because thermal expansion {{differences between the two}} lenses won't allow cementing. These are called [...] "un-cemented", [...] "air-spaced" [...] or [...] "broken contact" [...] doublets. [...] A sub-type of air-spaced doublet is the dialyte, a design where elements are widely spaced to save on the amount of glass used or where the elements cannot be cemented because they have strongly dissimilar curvatures.|$|E
5000|$|Do not {{clean with}} solvents, {{do not use}} ultrasound, you can use only {{distilled}} water, or a mixture of water and ethanol (add up to 0.5% crosslinker).
