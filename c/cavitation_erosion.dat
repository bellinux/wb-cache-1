50|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{that can affect}} water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder <b>cavitation</b> and <b>erosion.</b> This {{is due to a}} phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder. When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall. This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent <b>cavitation</b> and <b>erosion</b> damage.

These waves are propagated in the target volume and reflected as rarefaction waves of similar magnitude. The rarefaction phase causes the liquid to form bubbles or cavitate. Subsequent bubble collapse near the container wall is usually asymmetric giving rise to impulsive liquid jets and shock waves, which erode or `pit' the surface.

Similarly CO 2 or Cl gives ion for corrosion of metal. These corrosive gasses along with sand-jetting effect accelerate the erosion. A small amount of sand can initiate pitting {{on the surface and}} the new surface is attacked by the reactive gasses or acids. Hence, the pump handling fluid from the well bore or at the surface production operations or at the downstream petroleum processing industries will develop micro-pitting and as a result there will be surface roughness.

Supercritical water oxidation is the oxidation of fuel, generally waste material, in {{a body of water}} under conditions above the thermodynamic critical point of water. The current state of the art in supercritical water oxidation plant effluent treatment is to cool the reactor effluent through heat exchangers or direct quench, separate the cooled liquid into a gas/vapor stream and a liquid/solid stream, expand the separated effluent, and perform additional purification on gaseous, liquid, brine and solid effluent. If acid gases are present, corrosion is likely to occur in the coolers. During expansion, part of the condensed water will revaporize. Vaporization can damage the valves due to <b>cavitation</b> and <b>erosion.</b> The present invention expands the effluent stream without condensing the stream.

40|$|The control {{methods of}} {{ultrasonic}} cavitation applied now {{within the range}} from 20 kHz to 80 kHz use either control of ultrasound source parameters (amplitude, acoustic power, etc.) or control {{of one of the}} <b>cavitation</b> effects (<b>erosion</b> of materials, sonoluminescence, power of acoustic noise, etc.). These methods provide effective management of technological processes, however, make it impossible to relate the estimated effect with parameters of pulsations of cavitation bubbles. This is, mainly, due to influence of a number of uncontrollable parameters, in particular, such as temperature, composition of liquid, gas content, etc. as well as because of the difficulty to establish interrelation between the estimated effect and parameters of pulsations. As a result, in most cases it is difficult to compare controlled parameters of ultrasonic cavitation among themselves, and quantitative characteristics of processes become {{depending on the type of}} ultrasonic installation and conditions of their measurement. In this regard, methods to determine parameters of bubble pulsations through sounding a cavitation area by low-intensity laser radiation or to record cavitation noise sub-harmonics reflecting dynamics of changing radius of cavitation bubbles are of interest. The method of optical sounding, via the analysis of spectral components of a scattered signal recorded by a photo-detector, allows us to define a phase of the bubbles collapse with respect to the sound wave and a moving speed of the bubbles wall, as well as to estimate a cavitation index within the light beam section. The method to record sub-harmonicas of cavitation noise allows us to define parameters of pulsations, average for cavitation areas.

40|$|In general, the {{potential}} of current conventional high-temperature materials has been exploited to a large extent. The industries are therefore looking forward to development of alternative materials for their industrials application, which would be lighter, stronger and having improved higher temperature potential compared to the presently available alloys. Among the various high temperature materials for the future, intermetallics-base alloys are prime candidates for alternative materials. In this thesis work, Ni 3 Al- and MoSi 2 -based materials were specially investigated for their industrial. On Ni 3 Al-based materials Attractive engineering properties of Ni 3 Al alloys is their increasing yield strength with increasing temperature up to about 650 - 750 ÂºC. This type of strength behaviour suggested that the Ni 3 Al-based intermetallic alloys may have good wear properties in the peak-strength temperature range. Consequently, investigations of their sliding friction and wear were initiated. In fact, a number of laboratory {{studies have indicated that}} Ni 3 Al-based alloys have significant potential in wear-critical applications, especially in <b>cavitations</b> <b>erosion</b> and in sliding wear at the temperature range between 400 ÂºC and 650 ÂºC. In this work, an existed Ni 3 Al-based alloy 77. 7 Ni- 9. 8 Al- 11. 5 Fe- 0. 5 Mn- 0. 5 Ti- 0. 1 B in weight percentages and its composite reinforced by 6 vol. % Cr 3 C 2 -particles were studied and related to their microstructures. Hot isostatic pressing and casting were applied for preparing the materials. Wear rate of the test materials under different loads and their scuffing resistance were measured by Pin-on-Disk method. SEM, EDS, XRD, and EBSD techniques were used to observe the microstructures and identify the phase constitutions of the tested materials. The tribological performance related to the analytical results revealed that the single phase Ni 3 Al-based alloy showed a better wear-resistance compared to duplex microstructure. And the investigation also indicated that the hard Cr-carbide played a positive role on tribological intermetallics reducing the wear-rate. On MoSi 2 -based materials MoSi 2 is presently considered {{as one of the most}} promising due to its high melting point (2030 ÂºC) and excellent elevated-temperature oxidation resistance. However, like most of other intermetallics, the major problem, which has impeded their use, as high temperature materials, is their poor ductility and toughness during brittle-to-ductile transition temperature, BDTT, and low strength level above at temperature. In other words, their low temperature strength is limited by brittle fracture while the high temperature strength is governed by plastic flow. From the earlier investigations it was clear that the addition of alloying elements could not make the monolithic MoSi 2 compound having the right combination of ambient temperature toughness and high temperature strengthen. For the most demand depends on the development of engineered composite materials. In this work, the attention was mostly focused on ZrO 2 -particles reinforced MoSi 2 -matrix composites. The working results indicated (1) a PLS process could be a practical and economical method for producing MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 composites; (2) ZrO 2 -particles of less than 1 Î¼m usually generated the better sintered density, RT-hardness and toughness than of the composites compared with the bigger particles; (3) the composites containing 15 â€“ 25 vol. % unstable zironia (USZ) showed a better toughening effect, compared to the composites having less or more particles; and (4) A deteriorated oxidation resistance of MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 composite compared to its monolithic counterpart is due to the formation of the porous oxide layer of ZrSiO 4 +SiO 2 mixture and a retarded Si diffusion by the inner oxidation and reaction between SiO 2 and ZrSiO 4. Therefore, an alloying addition for further forming a protective oxide layer is necessary on developing this type of composites.
