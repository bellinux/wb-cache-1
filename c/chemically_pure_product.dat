40|$|The {{synthesis}} of chiral 3 -aryl- 1 -alkynes 3 via cross-coupling of 3 -alkyl- and 3, 3 -dialkyl- 1 -bromo- 1, 2 -dienes 1 and arylbromocuprates (RCuBr) MgBr. LiBr 2 was examined. With phenylcopper reagents and its para-substituted derivatives, {{as well as}} with 2 -naphthyl cuprates, the reaction gave compounds 3 with high regioselectivity and good yields on the <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> <b>product.</b> On the contrary, when ortho-substituted phenyl reagents and 1 -naphthyl cuprates were used, the regioselectivity of the process was very dependent upon the steric requirements of the alkyl substituents on the bromoallenic substrate. When the steric bulk was increased, remarkable quantities of isomeric arylallenes 4 were also observed in the reaction mixtures. The high 1, 3 -anti stereoselectivity of the coupling process allowed us to obtain enantiomerically enriched 3 -aryl- 1 -alkynes from optically active allenic substrates, thus indicating a simple pathway toward the {{synthesis of}} quaternary stereogenic centers characterized by an aryl group. A possible cross-coupling mechanism was also suggested to explain the regio- and stereochemical data. For the preparation of omega-functionalized 3 -phenyl- 1 -alkynes, the reaction of 1 -bromo- 3 -phenylpropadiene with Knochel reagents RCu(CN) ZnCl. 2 LiCl was also studied; this reaction led to the acetylenic compounds in high yields mainly when the R group (also omega-functionalized) on the copper reagent was primary...|$|E

40|$|Magnetite and sulfides in {{the black}} rims of {{carbonate}} globules in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 have been studied extensively because of the claim by McKay et al. that they are biogenic in origin. However, exclusively inorganic (abiotic) processes are able {{to account for the}} occurrence of carbonate-sulfide-magnetite assemblages in the meteorite. We have previously precipitated chemically zoned and sulfide-bearing carbonate globules analogous to those in ALH 84001 (at {{less than or equal to}} 150 C) from multiple fluxes of variable-composition Ca-Mg-Fe-CO 2 -S-H 2 O solutions. Brief heating of precipitated globules to approx. 470 C produced magnetite and pyrrhotite within the globules by thermal decomposition of siderite and pyrite, respectively. We have also shown that morphology of magnetite formed by inorganic thermal decomposition of Fe-rich carbonate is similar to the morphology of so-called biogenic magnetite in the carbonate globules of ALH 84001. Magnetite crystals in the rims of carbonate globules in ALH 84001 are <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> [Note: "Chemically pure" is defined here as magnetite with Mg at levels comparable or lower than Mg detected by [8] in ALH 84001 magnetite]. A debate continues on whether or not <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite can form by the thermal decomposition of mixed Mg-Fe-carbonates that have formed under abiotic conditions. Thomas-Keprta et al. argue that it is not possible to form Mg-free magnetite from Mg-Fe-carbonate based on thermodynamic data. We previously suggested that <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite could form by the thermal decomposition of relatively pure siderite in the outer rims of the globules. Mg-Fe-carbonates may also thermally decompose under conditions conducive for formation of <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite.

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the origin of}} nanophase magnetite in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 has been widely debated for nearly a decade. Golden et al. have reported producing nearly <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite from thermal decomposition of chemically impure siderite [(Fe, Mg, Mn) CO 3]. This claim is significant for three reasons: first, {{it has been argued that}} <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite present in the carbonate disks in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 could have formed by the thermal decomposition of the impure carbonate matrix in which they are embedded; second, the chemical purity of magnetite has been previously used to identify biogenic magnetite; and, third, previous studies of thermal decomposition of impure (Mg,Ca,Mn) -siderites, which have been investigated under a wide variety of conditions by numerous researchers, invariably yields a mixed metal oxide phase as the <b>product</b> and not <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite. The explanation for this observation is that these siderites all possess the same crystallographic structure (Calcite; R 3 c) so solid solutions between these carbonates are readily formed and can be viewed on an atomic scale as two chemically different but structurally similar lattices...|$|R
