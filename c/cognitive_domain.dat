Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested {{for a range of}} neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery. All six children performed in the normal range on most tests, including verbal IQ and performance IQ, but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one <b>cognitive</b> <b>domain,</b> such as complex attention (one child), short-term memory (one child) and internalizing behaviour/affect (two children). Group means for each <b>cognitive</b> <b>domain</b> were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS.|$|E
2500|$|This body {{of theory}} may have {{implications}} for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. [...] "Doing things with words" [...] presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy illocutionary force, however, {{they would need to}} have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel <b>cognitive</b> <b>domain</b> consists of what philosophers term [...] "institutional facts"— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.

2500|$|Benjamin Bloom (1913–1999) {{spent over}} 50 {{years at the}} University of Chicago, where {{he worked in the}} {{department}} of education. He believed that all students can learn. He developed taxonomy of educational objectives. The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>domain</b> deals with how we think. It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex. The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. [...] The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories. The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values. The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex. The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination. The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives {{that could be used to}} help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy. [...] The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material. Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses. Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.|$|E

This study was a quasi-experiment research using Randomized Control Only Design.

In non-demented PD patients, changes in cognitive functions over time appear to be modest.
