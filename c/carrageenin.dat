A sheep anti-rat IL- 1 ra serum potentiated response to LPS, <b>carrageenin,</b> bradykinin, TNFα and IL- 1 β but not IL- 8. <b>Carrageenin</b> and LPS stimulated and production of immunoreactive TNFα, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 ra in the skin of injected paws.

40|$|Algae {{have been}} {{classified}} by botanists into four large groups: the Chlorophyceae or green algae, the Phaeophyceae or brown algae, the Rhodophyceae or red algae, and the Cyanophyceae or blue-green algae. The polysaccharides which are extracted from marine algae may be differentiated into reserve polysaccharides, analogous to starch in land plants, and into structural polyrsaccharides, analogous to cellulose in land plants. Laminarin from brown seaweeds and Floridean starch from certain red algae are reserve polysaccharides while algihates (from brown seaweeds) and <b>carrageenin</b> and agar (from red seaweeds) are structural polyrsaccharides.

Vitamin supplementation increased the number of thrombocytes in the inflammatory exsudate in <b>carrageenin</b> and LPS injected fish...|$|E
40|$|Rats were {{subjected}} to various experimental procedures which affected lymphocyte numbers, {{in an attempt to}} investigate the participation of individual subpopulations of these cells in the development of acute, non-immune inflammation. Deficient T function, as evidenced in neonatally thymectomized animals, or in 6 -week-old animals thymectomized and afterwards exposed to multiple total-body X-ray irradiations, did not interfere with the development of the acute inflammatory responses of the animals to <b>carrageenin.</b> In the former circumstance, the numbers of circulating B lymphocytes, identified by the presence of surface immunoglobulins, were increased. In thymectomized and irradiated rats, the B-lymphocyte subpopulation was reduced. Circumstances causing attenuated inflammatory reactions to <b>carrageenin</b> resulted, first, from lymphocyte depletion by chronic drainage from the thoracic duct and, second, from irradiation of the animals with a single large dose of X-ray, the animals being tested 24 h after irradiation. B lymphocytes in blood remained within the normal range after chronic lymphatic drainage, but a large dose of X-ray markedly reduced their number. In both cases the attenuation of the responses to <b>carrageenin</b> {{did not seem to be}} associated with nonspecific hyporeactivity, or with the effect of the treatments on the other blood cells, It is suggested that the development of acute, non-immune inflammation is influenced by lymphoid cells which might constitute a specific subclass of cells, distinct from fully differentiated T and B lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effect of the}} plant of Eclipta alba (Family – Asteraceae) was evaluated using <b>carrageenin,</b> mediators such as histamine and serotonin induced paw oedema, and cotton pellet induced granuloma tests for their effect on acute and chronic phase inflammation models in rats. Maximum inhibition (55. 85 %) was noted at the dose of 500 mg/kg after 3 hr of drug treatment in <b>carrageenin</b> induced paw oedema, whereas the Indomethacin (standard drug) produced 61. 30 % of inhibition. In the chronic model (cotton pellet induced granuloma) the CEEA and standard drug showed decreased formation of granuloma tissue by 49. 7, 41. 5, 22. 1 % and 53. 48 % respectively. The results indicate the potent {{anti-inflammatory effect}} and therapeutic efficacy of Eclipta alba extract on animal models, which is compared with Indomethacin.

40|$|Effects of an orally active non-peptide (BK) B 2 {{receptor}} antagonist, FR 173657 ((E) - 3 -(6 -acetamido- 3 -pyridyl) - N-[N-[2, 4 -dichloro- 3 -[(2 -methyl- 8 -quinolinyl) oxymethyl]phenyl]-N-methylaminocarbonylmethyl] acrylamide) on {{the plasma}} exudation in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy were investigated. Plasma exudation induced by intrapleural injection of bradykinin (BK, 3 [*]nmol per rat) into male SD strain rats (SPF, 8 weeks old) were significantly inhibited by oral administration of novel B 2 receptor antagonist FR 173657 (3 – 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, 1 [*]h before BK injection) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas that induced by histamine was not. The inhibitory effect of 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 FR 173657 persisted {{for more than}} 4 [*]h. Intrapleural injection of λ-carrageenin (2 % (w/v), 0. 1 [*]ml per rat) caused marked plasma exudation and accumulation of exudates from 1 [*]h after <b>carrageenin</b> injection. The maximum plasma exudation response was observed 5 [*]h after <b>carrageenin.</b> The oral administration of FR 173657 to rats (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, 1 [*]h before <b>carrageenin)</b> significantly (by 50 – 77 %) blunted the plasma exudation 1, 3, 5, and 7 [*]h after <b>carrageenin,</b> causing a significant parallel reduction (by 42 – 57 %) in the volume of exudates. The anti-inflammatory effect of FR 173657 on rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy was almost equipotent {{with that of the}} peptide B 2 antagonist Hoe 140 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, soy bean trypsin inhibitor (0. 3 [*]mg per rat, intrapleural injection) and bromelain (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). In pleurisy induced by intrapleural injection of a histamine releaser, compound 48 / 80, the plasma exudation was observed only within 20 [*]min after the injection. This plasma exudation was not affected by FR 173657, although it was completely inhibited by a mixture of pyrilamine (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and methysergide (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). These results indicate that FR 173657 is an orally active, promising anti-inflammatory agent for kinin-dependent inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{injected}} in the footpad with <b>carrageenin</b> developed local inflammation which {{peaked at}} 48 hr. This delayed-type footpad swelling was significantly reduced in mice injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) {{with a specific}} nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, L-NGmonomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA). The draining lymph node (DLN) cells from mice injected 48 hr previously with <b>carrageenin</b> produced {{significantly higher levels of}} proliferation and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), IL- 2, IL- 6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but less IL- 10, compared to cells from saline-injected controls, when stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A) in vitro. Treatment of the carrageenin-injected mice with L-NMMA had little effect on the proliferative response of the DLN cells, but significantly reduced the production of IL- 1, IL- 2, IL- 6 and IFN-gamma, and increased the secretion of IL- 10. These data demonstrate that NO plays a significant role in local inflammation and the pattern of cytokines induced in this model...|$|E
