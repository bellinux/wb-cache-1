5|$|A {{baseball}} field in Fresno named after Chance operated from 1935 to 1941. Joe DiMaggio {{played in the}} first-ever game at Frank Chance Field. Retired players participated in an exhibition game in Chance's honor in 1937. John McGraw, a <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> rival of Chance, considered Chance {{one of the greatest}} players he ever saw.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{inconsistent}} {{nature of}} {{the record of the}} action, <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one account over another.

5|$|The 32X is {{considered}} a commercial failure. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.|$|E

5|$|Treadgold's {{estimates}} {{are based on}} figures for Constantine's army provided by Zosimus, who is notorious among scholars as an unreliable chronicler, both in general and as regards figures in particular: e.g. he reports that 60,000 Alamanni were killed at the Battle of Strasbourg in 357, an absurd inflation of the 6,000 reported by the <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> reliable Ammianus Marcellinus.|$|E

5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E
5|$|ATMOS is {{marketing}} {{a satellite}} navigation system developed by young prodigy Luke Rattigan (Ryan Sampson). The system also reduces {{carbon dioxide emissions}} to zero; UNIT requested the Doctor's help because the technology is not <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> might be alien. UNIT are also concerned about fifty-two simultaneous deaths occurring spontaneously several days earlier. The Doctor travels to Rattigan's private school to investigate the system and discovers that the recent events have been plotted by an alien warrior race known as the Sontarans.|$|E

The cartoon style of the film, accompanied by traditional Chinese music, is often cited as its most striking feature.|$|E
5|$|Although Crane {{was born}} after the war, {{and had not}} at the time {{experienced}} battle first-hand, the novel {{is known for its}} realism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> {{one of the most}} prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E

Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters of practical life, which was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts verbatim out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both <b>contemporary</b> <b>and</b> in retrospect, {{has been}} mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except {{for a brief period}} through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
