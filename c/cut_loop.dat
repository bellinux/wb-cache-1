A dual-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs being input fed, and the other being coupled. This dual-band planar antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs. A triple-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs being input fed and the other IPA being coupled. This triple-band antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs, and a conductor extending horizontally from the monopole antenna towards, but not reaching the coupled ILA. Another dual-band antenna includes an inner <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> antenna encompassed by an outer <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> antenna.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{procedure}} for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the corresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific parameterisation of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum we can uniquely identify the coefficients {{of the desired}} integral functions simply by examining the behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude $A_ 6 (1 ^-, 2 ^+, 3 ^-, 4 ^+, 5 ^-, 6 ^+) $. The direct nature of this extraction procedure allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure. Comment: 42 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{constructing}} one-loop amplitudes using a unitarity bootstrap approach we discuss a general systematic procedure for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted after examining {{the behavior of the}} cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of a specifically chosen parameterization of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum approach infinity. Measurements of new physics at the forthcoming experimental program at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will require a precise understanding of processes at next-to-leading order (NLO). This places increased demands for the computation of new one-loop amplitudes. This in turn has spurred recent developments towards improved calculational techniques. Direct calculations using Feynman diagrams are in general inefficient. Developments of more efficient techniques have usually centered around unitarity techniques [1], where tree amplitudes are effectively 'glued' together to form loops. The most straightforward application of this method, in which the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum is in D = 4, allows for the computation of 'cut-constructible' terms only, i. e. (poly) logarithmic containing terms and any related constants. QCD amplitudes contain, in addition to such terms, rational pieces which cannot be derived using such cuts. These 'missing' rational parts can be extracted using <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momenta in D = 4 - 2 {var_epsilon}. The greater difficulty of such calculations has restricted the application of this approach, although recent developments [3, 4] have provided new promise for this technique. Recently the application of on-shell recursion relations [5] to obtaining the 'missing' rational parts of one-loop processes [6] has provided an alternative very promising solution to this problem. In combination with unitarity methods an 'on-shell bootstrap' approach provides an efficient technique for computing complete one-loop QCD amplitudes [7]. Additionally other new methods have also proved fruitful for calculating rational terms [8]. Such developments have again refocused attention on the optimization of the derivation of the cut-constructable pieces of the amplitude. Deriving cut-constructible terms for any one-loop amplitude reduces to the computation of coefficients of a set of scalar bubble, scalar triangle and scalar box integral functions. Box coefficients may be found with very little work, directly from the quadruple cut of the relevant box function [9]. A unique box coefficient contributes to each distinct quadruple cut. Unfortunately triangle and bubble coefficients cannot be derived in quite so direct a manner. Multiple scalar integral coefficients appear inside a two-particle cut or triple cut. It is therefore necessary to disentangle the relevant bubble or triangle coefficients from any other coefficients sharing the same cut [1, 4, 10, 11]. The large number of NLO processes of interest for the LHC suggests that a completely automated computational procedure is highly desired. To this end we discuss, in this proceeding, a recently proposed method [12, 13] for the direct, efficient and systematic extraction of bubble and triangle coefficients which is well suited to automation...|$|E
40|$|Actuated {{traffic signal}} {{controllers}} typically depend on inductive loop detectors to determine {{demand for a}} particular signal phase. The basic philosophy of these controllers is to only provide a green indication to a particular lane group {{when there is a}} vehicle waiting. If an inductive loop detector fails, it must be put in recall mode so that the lane group with the corresponding failed detector is serviced every cycle. When actuated controllers operate in this mode, the performance of the signalized intersection degenerates. Since the vast majority of actuated intersections operate with inductive loop detectors it is useful to have maintenance procedures {{that can be used to}} replace loop detectors that have failed due to pavement distress. This paper describes a procedure that has been developed using directional boring equipment to install a micro loop below the surface of the pavement where it is not subject to pavement distress. The authors believe this procedure will provide a cost effective method of restoring actuated control on approaches or lanes groups where the pavement condition makes it unfeasible to install or re-install a traditional saw <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> detector. ...|$|E

40|$|Genetic events {{often require}} {{proteins}} to be activated by interacting with two DNA sites, trapping the intervening DNA in a loop. While much {{is known about}} looping equilibria, only {{a few studies have}} examined DNA-looping dynamics experimentally. The restriction enzymes that cut DNA after interacting with two recognition sites, such as FokI, can be used to exemplify looping reactions. The reaction pathway for FokI on a supercoiled DNA with two sites was dissected by fast kinetics to reveal, in turn: the initial binding of a protein monomer to each site; the protein‚Äìprotein association to form the dimer, trapping the loop; the subsequent phosphodiester hydrolysis step. The DNA motion that juxtaposes the sites ought on the basis of Brownian dynamics to take ‚àº 2 ms, but loop capture by FokI took 230 ms. Hence, DNA looping by FokI is rate limited by protein association rather than DNA dynamics. The FokI endonuclease also illustrated activation by looping: it <b>cut</b> <b>looped</b> DNA 400 times faster than unlooped DNA...|$|R

40|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, bare {{particles}} are dressed by {{a cloud of}} virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, {{and it is only}} these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with <b>cut</b> <b>loops.</b> Comment: 32 pages including supplementary materia...|$|R
