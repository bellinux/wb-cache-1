The {{core of this}} issue is the projectors’s design, i. e. the numerical model of projection, is mostly influenced by {{the representation of the}} object of interest, decomposed on a basis of functions, and on the approximations made for the projection on the detector. Voxel driven and ray driven projection models, widely appre-ciated for their short execution time, are too <b>coarse.</b> <b>Distance</b> driven model has a better accuracy but also relies on strong approximations to project voxel basis functions.

40|$|Multidimensional NMR {{techniques}} and 13 C/ 15 N isotope labelling {{have been used}} to study the structural and dynamic properties of the trans-activation response (TAR) RNA element from HIV- 1. Theoretical analysis of the anticodon loop region of yeast tRNA was first performed. High resolution structures were obtainable when <b>coarse</b> <b>distance</b> constraints and the CHARMm forcefield were employed. A medium resolution NMR structure of the active ΔTAR 29 mer RNA was also determined, revealing interesting conformations in the bulge and loop regions. The local atomic dynamics of ΔTAR were examined with two-dimensional 13 C- 1 H NMR relaxation methods. Pulse sequences were developed to measure relaxation times in fully coupled RNA spin systems. Observed T 1, T 2 and NOE values were fit to various forms of the Lipari-Szabo motional model. The resulting order parameters and internal correlation times correlate strongly with local structural features of ΔTAR. Studies on the solution structure of one natural occurring mutant of TAR, the HIVRF loop sequence, indicate that the TAR structure may adopt a more compact loop structure that cannot be fully determined with current NMR methods...|$|E
40|$|Very recently, a kind {{of spatial}} network {{constructed}} with power-law distance distribution and total energy constriction is proposed. Moreover, it has been pointed out that such spatial networks have the optimal exponents δ in the power-law distance distribution for the average shortest path, traffic dynamics and navigation. Because the distance is estimated approximately in real world, we present an <b>distance</b> <b>coarse</b> graining procedure to generate the binary spatial networks in this paper. We find that the <b>distance</b> <b>coarse</b> graining procedure {{will result in the}} shifting of the optimal exponents δ.

40|$|Abstract – Localization in {{wireless}} sensor networks {{gets more}} and more important, because many applications need to locate the source of incoming measurements as precise as possible. Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) provides a fast and easy algorithm to locate devices in {{wireless sensor networks}}. The algorithm is derived from a centroid determination which calculates the position of devices by averaging the coordinates of known reference points. To improve the calculated position in real implementations, WCL uses weights to attract the estimated position to close reference points provided that <b>coarse</b> <b>distances</b> are available. Due {{to the fact that}} Zigbee provides the Link Quality Indication (LQI) as a quality indicator of a received packet, it {{can also be used to}} estimate a distance from a node to reference points...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{technological}} developments in low-power electronics and wireless communication {{have increased the}} use of ad hoc wireless sensor networks for environmental monitoring and security applications. A typical network is a randomly distributed collection of scores of low-power wireless sensor nodes. Network localization {{is the process of}} estimating the location of each sensor in the network. Network localization is an imperative capability for the effective operation of wireless sensor networks. In this research project we explore an innovative approach to localization that uses an array of directional antennas, together with a node’s radio communications, to sense the bearing and distance between neighboring nodes. We also pursue a variety of computational methods to determine the best position estimator. 	We found that the proposed localization approach can measure the angle of arrival (AOA) with about 4 degrees mean absolute error and can determine distance between the transmitter and receiver with 5 feet mean absolute error using the prototype antenna array. In addition, the mean absolute distance error between the actual and estimated positions was found to be 14. 5 feet (about 4. 5 meters). Also, compared to other approaches, our approach can solve the network localization problem with fewer beacon nodes needed in the network, which means a significant reduction in hardware and software cost. 	Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-coherently using directional arrays in wireless sensor networks for determining angle from radio signal strength. The estimated angles, combined with either <b>coarse</b> <b>distance</b> information or a few known node locations, provide a solution for the network localization task...|$|E

40|$|Recently, spatial {{networks}} have attracted much attention. The spatial network is constructed from a regular lattice by adding long-range edges (shortcuts) with probability P (r) ∼ r − δ, where r is the geographical {{distance between the}} two ends of the edge. Also, a cost constraint on the total length of the additional edges is introduced (∑ r = C). It has been pointed out that such {{networks have}} optimal exponents δ for the average shortest path, traffic dynamics and navigation. However, when δ is large, too many generated long-range edges {{will be added to}} the network. In this scenario, the total cost constraint cannot be satisfied. In this paper, we propose a <b>distance</b> <b>coarse</b> graining procedure to solve this problem. We find that the optimal exponents δ for the traffic process, navigation and synchronization indeed result from the trade-off between the probability density function of long-range edges and the total cost constraint, but the optimal exponent δ for percolation is actually due to dissatisfying the total cost constraint. On the other hand, because the <b>distance</b> <b>coarse</b> graining procedure widely exists in the real world, our work is also meaningful in this aspec...|$|R
40|$|A Doppler {{weather radar}} is a device for weather {{observation}} that emits and receives signals while rotating its antenna to observe distribution {{of rain and}} wind in a wide area around it. It is thus considered the most suitable device for detecting gusts. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has already deployed larger Doppler radars nationwide. While those can observe a wide area, their spatial resolution is <b>coarser</b> at <b>distances</b> far away. Furthermore, they make observations higher in the atmosphere at greater distances. As they were not designed for railway use, larger radars are not entirely suitable for observing ground wind distribution that is important for railways.

The overall distance distributions reflect in detail the contents of sequence specific substructures maintained by local interactions (such as ff-helixes), and longer range interactions (like disulfide bridges and fi-sheets). The distance distributions are shown to be indicative for a given fold class. We also show that a volume scaling of the distances, makes distance distributions for protein chains of different length superimposeable. Distance distributions were also calculated specifically for amino acids separated by a given number of residues. Specific features in these distributions are visible for sequence separation up to 20 amino acid residues.

40|$|CONCLUSION Volcano/ice {{interactions}} produce meltwater. Meltwater {{can enter}} the groundwater cycle and {{under the influence of}} hydrothermal systems, it can be later discharged to form channels and valleys or cycled upward to melt permafrost. Water or ice-saturated ground can erupt into phreatic craters when covered by lava. Violent mixing of meltwater and volcanic material and rapid release can generate lahars or jokulhlaups, that have the ability to freight <b>coarse</b> material, great <b>distances</b> downslope from the vent. Eruption into meltwater generate unique appearing edifices, that are definitive indicators of volcano/ice interaction. These features are hyaloclastic ridges or mounds and if capped by lava, tuyas. On Earth, volcano/ice interactions are limited to alpine regions and ice-capped polar and temperate regions. On Mars, where precipitation may be an ancient phenomenon, these interactions may be limited to areas of ground ice accumulation or the northern lowlands where water may have ponded fairly late in martian history. The recognition of features caused by volcano/ice interactions could provide strong constraints for the history of volatiles on Mars...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTomographic {{iterative}} reconstruction methods need a {{very thorough}} modeling of data. This point becomes critical {{when the number}} of available projections is limited. At the core of this issue is the projector design, i. e., the numerical model relating the representation of the object of interest to the projections on the detector. Voxel driven and ray driven projection models are widely used for their short execution time in spite of their <b>coarse</b> approximations. <b>Distance</b> driven model has an improved accuracy but makes strong approximations to project voxel basis functions. Cubic voxel basis functions are anisotropic, accurately modeling their projection is, therefore, computationally expensive. Both smoother and more isotropic basis functions better represent the continuous functions and provide simpler projectors. These considerations have {{led to the development of}} spherically symmetric volume elements, called blobs. Set apart their isotropy, blobs are often considered too computationally expensive in practice. In this paper, we consider using separable B-splines as basis functions to represent the object, and we propose to approximate the projection of these basis functions by a 2 D separable model. When the degree of the B-splines increases, their isotropy improves and projections can be computed regardless of their orientation. The degree and the sampling of the B-splines can be chosen according to a tradeoff between approximation quality and computational complexity. We quantitatively measure the good accuracy of our model and compare it with other projectors, such as the distance-driven and the model proposed by Long et al. From the numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our projector with an improved accuracy better preserves the quality of the reconstruction as the number of projections decreases. Our projector with cubic B-splines requires about twice as many operations as a model based on voxel basis functions. Higher accuracy projectors can be used to improve the resolution of the existing systems, or to reduce the number of projections required to reach a given resolution, potentially reducing the dose absorbed by the patient...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{increased}} {{availability of}} genome sequences has advanced {{the development of}} genomic distance methods to describe bacterial diversity. Results of these fast-evolving methods are highly correlated {{with those of the}} historically standard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. However, these genomic-based methods can be done more rapidly and less expensively and are less prone to technical and human error. They are thus a technically accessible replacement for species delineation. Here, we use several genomic comparison methods, supported by our own proteomic analyses and metabolic characterization as well as previously published DNA-DNA hybridization analyses, to differentiate members of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex into three species. This pathogen group consists of diverse and widespread strains that cause bacterial wilt disease on many different plants. Results We used three different methods to compare the complete genomes of 29 strains from the R. solanacearum species complex. In parallel we profiled the proteomes of 73 strains using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Proteomic profiles together with genomic sequence comparisons consistently and comprehensively described the diversity of the R. solanacearum species complex. In addition, genome-driven functional phenotypic assays excitingly supported an old hypothesis (Hayward et al. (J Appl Bacteriol 69 : 269 – 80, 1990)), that closely related members of the R. solanacearum could be identified through a simple assay of anaerobic nitrate metabolism. This assay allowed us to clearly and easily differentiate phylotype II and IV strains from phylotype I and III strains. Further, genomic dissection of the pathway distinguished between proposed subspecies within the current phylotype IV. The assay revealed large scale differences in energy production within the R. solanacearum species complex, indicating <b>coarse</b> evolutionary <b>distance</b> and further supporting a repartitioning of this group into separate species. Conclusions Together, the results of these studies support the proposed division of the R. solanacearum species complex into three species, consistent with recent literature, and demonstrate the utility of proteomic and genomic approaches to delineate bacterial species.
