40|$|Existing {{classification}} of the Croatian seaports {{does not fit}} the level and {{meet the needs of}} the economic development of the Republic of Croatia, particularly after the Republic of Croatia joined the European Union. Equalizing public service offered by a port with the purpose of the port itself (general purpose – port open for public traffic, special purpose – port not open for public traffic) limits the economic development and aggravates the implementation of the basic market policies of the EU. Therefore, modernisation of the basic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> in the Croatian legislation is suggested. Basic categorization of ports should be as follows: public service ports, private service ports and private ports for private needs of an entrepreneur. </p...|$|E
30|$|The adopted {{methodology}} {{of this work}} {{has been used in}} several cases to investigate issues of transport, with different variations, both in time and at a spatial level of analysis. Ferrari et al. [12], proposed a new method of measuring the quality of traffic on highways, based on analysis of main components. In particular, by studying a large number (155 thousands) vehicles passing at bidirectional highway of similar geometrical characteristics and taking into account the composition of the flow in each case (based on the percentage of heavy vehicles), along with features such as speed, transit time and external conditions (day and night, summer-winter), they produced a vector of 15 variables, representing the traffic conditions. Using the Principal Component Analysis, they grouped these variables into three main components, explaining 75  % of the total variance of the 15 variables. Analyzing how the three main components change together, four areas of traffic flow were recognized, free flow, steady flow, unstable flow and difficult to flow, which determine the traffic conditions. Other researchers [13 – 15], analyze data traffic on a daily basis (hours and days of week), trying to develop traffic flow models using cluster analysis. In a recent work of this group, Weijermars and van Berkum [15] attempted to analyze traffic flow models on freeways in order get a better traffic management. To be more specific, analyzing data based on vehicles flow and velocity for all days time periods of the week and special conditions (working days, weekends, holidays, vacation) on the highway A 50 in Denmark, they ended up with five clusters, which exhibit distinct daily flow profiles and can form the basis for a model formulation of the daily traffic management. Chen et al. [16] use cluster analysis to investigate the traffic impacts of the housing projects functioning, with the intention of classifying and assessing the construction projects, in urban and suburban areas. Tongzon [17] suggested the method of principal component analysis for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ports.</b> This method used a number of common variables for container ports worldwide and concluded in a classification with emphasis on similarity, preparing the ground for benchmarking analysis. Papadaskalopoulos et al. [18], trying to give a further spatial dimension to the impact of transport networks (in terms of development of the areas and the creation of spatial—development modules due to the structure and operation of networks) took into account, along with the number of networks, accessibility and network nodes the spatial structure of residences. The identification of new spatial entities as urban groups, based initially in the construction of Accessibility Matrix and spatial weighting refers to the connections of the first order (direct-line) centers in relation to transport routes. The results of Accessibility Matrix, i.e. nodal settlements, in combination with other variables (population size of cities, scale and significance of axes that cross these cities, existence of other nodes, infrastructure etc.), used furthermore for determining spatial units, consisting of groups of residential centers (clusters). The formation of these groups is to use methods of taxonomic analysis and imprinting them using the corresponding tree.|$|E

40|$|The paper mainly {{addresses}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>port</b> management by estimating a quantitative model {{dealing with the}} evaluation of the economic effects of maritime container terminals. A <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>port</b> activities is first proposed in order to assign the different types of economic effects to them. In doing this, two concepts of "efficiency" arise, that is, a corporate efficiency and a global efficiency. The model then deals with the estimation of the corporate efficiency by highlighting the factors determining it and their specific contribution. Finally, two in-depth analyses of the model based on cluster and factor techniques are conducted and future research lines are put forward...|$|R
30|$|Characterizing Macroscopic Port Roles from {{network traffic}} {{provides}} highly valuable information for various network management tasks. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is not to exhaustively list all possible port behaviors, but provides a definition and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>port</b> roles. In this paper, we firstly classify port roles into six categories, which are scanned ports, failed service ports, client ports, server ports, P 2 P ports, and overlay ports. Secondly, we propose a port role distribution diagram and define a port behavior measurement metrics to characterize network traffic. A two-class EM fuzzy clustering algorithm is designed to quantitatively determine the classification criteria in the classification distribution diagram. Finally we validate the proposed method based on network traffic captured from a link in the CERNET.|$|R
50|$|The Quinta <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> {{vineyards}} in the Douro is {{a system}} that grades the terroir and quality potential of vineyards in the Douro wine region to produce grapes suitable for the production <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> wine. In Portuguese, a quinta is a wine producing estate, which can be a winery or a vineyard. While other wine classification systems may classify the winery (such as the 1855 Bordeaux classification), the Douro quinta classification is based upon the physical characteristics of the vineyard. The classification system is run by the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e Porto (IVDP) and shares some similarities to the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> Champagne vineyards in that one of the purposes of the system is to ensuring that vineyards producing grapes with the highest quality potential receive a high price. A secondary function <b>of</b> the quinta <b>classification</b> is the establishment of permitted yields for production. Quintas with a higher classification (and theoretically capable of producing grapes of higher quality) are permitted to harvest more grapes than a vineyard that received a lower classification.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decades the cruise {{industry}} {{developed into a}} mass market using large vessels and adding more revenue-generating passenger services onboard. It is a highly concentrated business {{both in terms of}} players (i. e. four players accounting for 96 % of the market) and markets (i. e. the Caribbean and the Mediterranean accounting for more than 70 % of the deployed capacity). Under such circumstances vessel deployment strategies and itinerary design by cruise operators are primordial and are affected by market circumstances and requirements and by pure operational considerations. This paper focuses on capacity deployment and itineraries in two major cruise markets: the Caribbean and the Mediterranean through an analysis of itineraries and ship deployment. We argue that the cruise industry sells itineraries, not destinations, implying a level of flexibility in the selection <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call. The paper also reveals that the two cruise markets are not functioning independently but are interconnected in an operational manner, particularly through the repositioning of vessel units to cope with variations in seasonal demand among the regional markets.
