5000|$|In 1888 the Hohenzollern Locomotive Works {{delivered}} {{the first two}} narrow gauge [...] Feldbahn locomotives for the Prussian Army. These used a <b>conical</b> <b>development</b> of the launch boiler. A backplate of enlarged diameter and a greatly reduced smokebox tubeplate were fitted into a steeply conical shell. This was installed with the upper edge of the cone horizontal. The purpose of the conical shape was to increase water depth over the furnace, the hottest part of the evaporative surface. The furnace and tubes were moved to {{the lower part of}} the shell, with the tubes running upwards parallel to the lower edge of the cone. A difficulty was the boiler's lack of steam space, requiring an enlarged dome, of almost as much capacity as the main shell. As a major virtue of the launch boiler is the simplicity of its construction, rolling a conical shell and fitting a large dome represented a considerable increase in their complexity and cost.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{remainder}} term in the first order <b>conical</b> <b>development</b> of a convex function is given {{in the framework of}} infinite dimensional normed spaces. Lower and upper estimates of this remainder are tackled, and the action of the conjugacy operation on these estimates is characterized. In particular, we shed some light on the duality between the class of conically differentiable convex functions and the class of metrically well-set functions. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the {{generally}} bee-pollinated genus Lotus {{a group of}} four species have evolved bird-pollinated flowers. The floral changes in these species include altered petal orientation, shape and texture. In Lotus these characters are associated with dorsiventral petal identity, suggesting that shifts in the expression of dorsal identity genes {{may be involved in}} the evolution of bird pollination. Of particular interest is Lotus japonicus CYCLOIDEA 2 (LjCYC 2), known to determine the presence of papillate conical cells on the dorsal petal in L. Â japonicus. Bird-pollinated species are unusual in not having papillate conical cells on the dorsal petal. Using RT-PCR at various stages of flower development, we determined the timing of expression in all petal types for the three putative petal identity genes (CYC-like genes) in different species with contrasting floral morphology and pollination syndromes. In bird-pollinated species the dorsal identity gene, LjCYC 2, is not expressed at the floral stage when papillate conical cells are normally differentiating in bee-pollinated species. In contrast, in bee-pollinated species, LjCYC 2 is expressed during <b>conical</b> cell <b>development.</b> Changes in the timing of expression of the above two genes are associated with modifications in petal growth and lateralisation of the dorsal and ventral petals in the bird-pollinated species. This study indicates that changes in the timing, rather than spatial distribution, of expression likely contribute to the modifications of petal micromorphology and petal size during the transition from bee to bird pollination in Macaronesian Lotus species.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{countries}} across sub-Saharan Africa {{are rapidly}} increasing insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage to combat malaria, but systematic {{data on the}} use of those ITNs and the factors affecting this use are scarce. Methods A household survey was conducted during malaria season in 23 communities of Amhara and Oromia Regional States, Ethiopia, stratified by degree of urbanization (rural, peri-urban, or urban), whether or not they received indoor residual spraying (IRS), and whether or not free nets had been distributed. Descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to describe household net ownership and identify factors associated with use or non-use of nets already in the household. A qualitative component consisting of observations of ITNs in households and several open-ended questions provided further understanding of the reasons for ITN use and non-use. Results Of 857 surveyed households, 91 % owned at least one ITN, but only 65 % of ITNs owned had been used the prior night. The multivariate analysis found that the factors significantly associated with an ITN being used were regional state (Amhara) (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0. 61; 95 % Confidence Interval [C. I. ] 0. 43 - 0. 86]; p Conclusion The very high ITN ownership in the study areas suggests that a strategy targeting free nets to rural and poor households combined with support for the commercial sector is an effective means of achieving high coverage. The data suggests that use of ITNs owned could be increased by distribution of <b>conical</b> ITNs, continued <b>development</b> of the commercial sector, replacement schemes for worn-out ITNs, assistance with hanging of ITNs, and communication addressing misperceptions about ITNs. </p...|$|R
