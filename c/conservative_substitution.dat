Here, we focus on its ability to internalize into cells-a trait associated with a privileged subclass of peptides called cell-penetrating peptides-and whether it can be improved through <b>conservative</b> <b>substitutions.</b> Mutants of CTX were made using solid-phase peptide synthesis and internalization into human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells was monitored by fluorescence and confocal microscopy. CTX_M 1 (ie, [K 15 R/K 23 R]CTX) and CTX_M 2 (ie, [K 15 R/K 23 R/Y 29 W]CTX) mutants showed at least a twofold improvement in uptake compared to CTX. We further showed that these mutants internalize into HeLa cells largely via an energy-dependent mechanism. Importantly, the mutants have high stability, remaining intact in serum for over 24 h; thus, retaining the characteristic stability of their parent peptide.

To examine the role of this region in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 morphogenesis and replication, four highly conserved positions in the MHR were individually altered by site-directed mutagenesis. <b>Conservative</b> <b>substitution</b> of two invariant residues (glutamine 155 and glutamic acid 159) abolished viral replication and significantly reduced the particle-forming ability of the mutant gag gene products. <b>Conservative</b> <b>substitution</b> of the third invariant residue in the MHR (arginine 167) or of an invariably aromatic residue (tyrosine 164) had only a moderate effect. However, removal of the extended side chains of these amino acids by substitution with alanine prevented viral replication and affected virion morphogenesis. The replacement of tyrosine 164 with alanine substantially impaired viral particle production. By contrast, the substitution of arginine 167 with alanine had only a two- to threefold effect on particle yield but {{led to the formation}} of aberrant core structures. The MHR mutant which were severely defective for particle production had a dominant negative effect on particle formation by the wild-type Gag product. The role of the MHR in the incorporation of the Gag-Pol precursor was examined by expressing the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins individually from separate plasmids. Only when the two precursor polyproteins were coexpressed did processed Gag and Pol products appear in the external medium. The appearance of these products was unaffected or only moderately affected by substitutions in the MHR of the Gag-Pol precursor, suggesting that the mutant Gag-Pol precursors were efficiently incorporated into viral particles. The results of this study indicate that specific residues within the MHR are required both for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particle assembly and for the correct assembly of the viral core.

Here we have employed site-directed mutagenesis (introducing 31 mutations at 16 positions) to locate candidate catalytic residues within the 301 amino acid Pnk polypeptide. We found that alanine substitutions for Arg 38 and Arg 126 inactivated the 5 ′-kinase, but spared the 3 ′-phosphatase activity. <b>Conservative</b> <b>substitutions</b> of lysine or glutamine for Arg 38 and Arg 126 did not restore 5 ′-kinase activity. These results, together with previous mutational studies, highlight a constellation of five amino acids (Lys 15, Ser 16, Asp 35, Arg 38 and Arg 126) that likely comprise the 5 ′-kinase active site. Four of these residues are conserved at the active sites of adenylate kinases (Adk), suggesting that Pnk and Adk are structurally and mechanistically related. We found that alanine substitutions for Asp 165, Asp 167, Arg 176, Arg 213, Asp 254 and Asp 278 inactivated the 3 ′-phosphatase, but spared the 5 ′-kinase. <b>Conservative</b> <b>substitutions</b> of asparagine or glutamate for Asp 165, Asp 167 and Asp 254 did not revive the 3 ′-phosphatase activity, nor did lysine substitutions for Arg 176 and Arg 213. Glutamate in lieu of Asp 278 partially restored activity, whereas asparagine had no salutary effect. Alanine substitutions for Arg 246 and Arg 279 partially inactivated the 3 ′-phosphatase; the conservative R 246 K change restored activity, whereas R 279 K had no benefit.

SODs. Experimental determination of the enzymatic reaction rate indicated that the charge located on the residue 134 gives 19 % contribution to the guidance of superoxide anion at low ionic strength. This value matches the association rates predicted by brownian dynamics. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalase}} {{multigene family}} in Arabidopsis includes three genes encoding individual subunits that associate to form {{at least six}} isozymes that are readily resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. CAT 1 and CAT 3 map to chromosome 1, and CAT 2 maps to chromosome 4. The nucleotide sequences of the three coding regions are 70 to 72 % identical. The amino acid sequences of the three catalase subunits are 75 to 84 % identical and 87 to 94 % similar, considering <b>conservative</b> <b>substitutions.</b> Both the individual isozymes and the individual subunit mRNAs show distinct patterns of spatial (organ-specific) expression. Six isozymes are detected in flowers and leaves and two are seen in roots. Similarly, mRNA abundance of the three genes varies among organs. All three mRNAs are highly expressed in bolts, and CAT 2 and CAT 3 are highly expressed in leaves...|$|R
50|$|The dot-matrix approach, which implicitly {{produces}} {{a family of}} alignments for individual sequence regions, is qualitative and conceptually simple, though time-consuming to analyze on a large scale. In the absence of noise, it can be easy to visually identify certain sequence features—such as insertions, deletions, repeats, or inverted repeats—from a dot-matrix plot. To construct a dot-matrix plot, the two sequences are written along the top row and leftmost column of a two-dimensional matrix and a dot is placed at any point where {{the characters in the}} appropriate columns match—this is a typical recurrence plot. Some implementations vary the size or intensity of the dot depending on the degree of similarity of the two characters, to accommodate <b>conservative</b> <b>substitutions.</b> The dot plots of very closely related sequences will appear as a single line along the matrix's main diagonal.|$|R
40|$|A leucine residue at {{position}} 370 (L 370) in 29 - 4 Shaker K+ channels resides within two overlapping sequence motifs conserved among most voltage-gated channels: the S 4 segment and a leucine heptad repeat. Here we investigate the effects observed upon substitution of L 370 {{with many other}} uncharged amino acid residues. We find that smaller or more hydrophilic residues produce greater alterations in both activation and inactivation gating than does substitution with other large hydrophobic residues. In addition, subunits containing less <b>conservative</b> <b>substitutions</b> {{at position}} 370 are restricted in their assembly with wild-type subunits and are unlikely to form homomultimeric channel complexes. Consistent {{with the idea that}} L 370 influences the tertiary structure of these channels, the results indicate that L 370 undergoes specific hydrophobic interactions during the conformational transitions of gating; similar interactions may take place during the folding, insertion, or assembly of Shaker K+ channel subunits...|$|R
