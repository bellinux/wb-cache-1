50|$|Suzuki Recycle Injection System (SRIS) was {{an attempt}} by the {{manufacturer}} to reduce visible emissions from a two stroke motorcycle. It was a small check valve in the bottom of each <b>crank</b> <b>chamber.</b> Two stroke engines have a tendency to collect unburnt oil and fuel {{in the bottom of the}} <b>crank</b> <b>chamber</b> at idle. Upon acceleration, after a period of idling, the unburned oil and fuel gets sucked up the transfer ports and contributes to an overrich mixture for the first 5 to 10 seconds resulting in a smokescreen from the exhaust. The SRIS plumbing routed the unburned fuel and oil to the next cylinder in the firing order thus allowing it to mix more thoroughly with the incoming charge of that cylinder and lowering the production of visible smoke. Overall fuel and oil consumption was unchanged but visible smoke was greatly reduced on sudden acceleration from rest.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the <b>crank</b> <b>chamber.</b> Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a cooling}} fan for the {{honeycomb}} radiator and the engine incorporates a pump to ensure the flow of coolant. Lubrication is forced by pump to all the bearings. A float indicator shows the depth {{of oil in the}} <b>crank</b> <b>chamber.</b> Ignition is by High Tension Bosch magneto and may be manually advanced or retarded. The carburettor is by Claudel.The thin steel-cone clutch engages with the Ferodo lined flywheel. The Ferodo linings are in sections which may be replaced individually. The gearbox is suspended at four points. It is operated by a hand lever controlled by a gate and now has four speeds forward and reverse.|$|E
25|$|From 1973 the LC10W engines also {{received}} Suzuki's SRIS (Suzuki Recycle Injection System), {{a method for}} lowering visible exhaust smoke by collecting and burning residual oil/gas lying {{in the bottom of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>chambers.</b> This was first seen on the Suzuki GT750, GT550, and GT380 motorcycles. In an effort to reduce CO, HC, and NOx emissions, the EPIC (Exhaust Port Ignition Cleaner) system was also installed.|$|R

In the working plant, aluminum materials collected from the markets were classified into three groups as drink cans, pots-pans and <b>crank</b> <b>chambers.</b> These material groups were mixed at different ratios in recycling processes to produce aluminium alloy which meets the customer specifications.

50|$|The {{first model}} year (1972), the GT750J, had a double-sided, twin-leading shoe, 200 mm drum front brake with 180 mm drum rear. The Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS) that {{connected}} the left- and right-side exhausts together {{was designed to}} boost low-end torque. Carburetors were 32 mm Mikuni slide type and power output was 67 bhp at 6,500 rpm. Also included was Suzuki's SRIS (Suzuki Recycle Injection System) which was a method for lowering the visible exhaust smoke by collecting and burning residual oil/gas lying {{in the bottom of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>chambers.</b> This was a first for any two-stroke from any manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|About 1900 Birch {{built his}} first motorcycle, which he also named the George Eliot. The bike had three innovations: {{the engine was}} {{positioned}} where the pedals are on a bicycle, the engine was built into the frame, {{and it had a}} low-tension magneto superseding the battery type ignition. Two of his bikes were shown at the 1902 Stanley Show. The brochure from the show described them as one (is) fitted with Simms' Magneto in conjunction with Birch's advance sparking apparatus. This machine is constructed with Birch's patent combined <b>crank</b> <b>chamber</b> and bottom bracket built in the frame; surface carburetter (carburetor), belt drive, Birch's disc hubs, and compound brake. The other has a surface carburetter, wipe contact, accumulator, trembler coil, and self-compenszing contact ...|$|E
