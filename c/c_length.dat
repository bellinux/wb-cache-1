Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) for example used for this purpose (a) the principle of relativity, (b) homogeneity and isotropy of space, and (c) the requirement of reciprocity. Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911) argued that this derivation is incomplete and needs additional assumptions. Their own calculation was based on the assumptions that: (a) the Lorentz transformation forms a homogeneous linear group, (b) when changing frames, only the sign of the relative speed changes, (<b>c)</b> <b>length</b> contraction solely depends on the relative speed. However, according to Pauli and Miller such models were insufficient to identify the invariant speed in their transformation with the speed of light— for example, Ignatowski was forced to seek recourse in electrodynamics to include the speed of light. So Pauli and others argued that both postulates are needed to derive the Lorentz transformation. However, until today, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate.|$|E

Earlier attempts at video news tracking used all shots in a story, regardless of whether they improved the query or not. Some of those shots are bound to be disruptive to the matching process. Due to this problem with the current methods, we propose a shot selection method which utilizes the similarity between shots within a story to automatically extract shots that are highly representative of the story content. Specifically, three methods are proposed: a) similar shot exclusion; b) similar shot inclusion; and <b>c)</b> <b>length</b> based shot selection.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{different approaches}} performed {{to obtain a}} more significant esophageal length. METHODS: An experimental model using 28 cadavers was conceived. Randomized groups: Group A (n= 10) underwent laparotomic transhiatal approach; Group B (n= 9) which differed from {{the first in the}} conduction of a wide phrenotomy and Group C (n= 9) esophageal dissection was performed through a left anterolateral thoracotomy. RESULTS: Final length variations for Group A were 2. 12 cm and 3. 29 cm and for Group B 3. 24 cm and 3. 66 cm, without and with esophageal traction, respectively. In Group <b>C</b> <b>length</b> gain observed was 3. 81 cm. The mediastinal dissections conducted through the hiatus was considered the procedure that produced the better esophageal mobilization, and the association of wide phrenotomy significantly improved the results.
