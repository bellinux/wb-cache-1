40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{requirements}} for an effective reliable inspection and discard policy based on monitoring the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> used in Indian mines. This contrasts with current practice which is based upon a policy of 'Statutory Life Policy'. Data have been collected data on rope service to study the influence of operating parameters on the degradation mechanisms affecting hoisting ropes in Indian mines. In addition to this, records on failed/premature discarded hoisting ropes from Indian mines have been also collected to classify the prominent causes of failure in terms of operating parameters. These data include 645 records <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> (606 from 303 drum winders and 39 from 11 friction winders) which have been In service, and 45 records of failure and premature discard categorized in terms of different parameters. These data inform the proposed recommendations for policy to minimised failure through the adoption an efficacious inspection procedure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Current methods <b>of</b> {{inspecting}} wire <b>rope</b> for {{broken wires}} or excessive wear include visual inspection, physical measurements <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> diameter, and electromagnetic nondestructive testing (NDT). Visual inspection and physical measurement arc the least comprehensive methods.

The test rope was run through a commercially available NDT instrument.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of three 1 - 1 / 4 -diam manufactured wire <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> 6 x 19 classification {{was done to}} identify and describe reference <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> new <b>rope.</b> Reference <b>condition</b> is <b>of</b> value when examining tested or retired <b>ropes.</b> Measurements <b>of</b> strand and <b>rope</b> pitch and <b>of</b> wire and <b>rope</b> diameter confirmed adherence <b>of</b> all <b>ropes</b> to those construction specifications. Mechanical properties of strength and ductility were determined by accepted methods for the ropes and wires from the ropes.

40|$|Abstract—The {{reliable}} and safe use <b>of</b> wire <b>rope</b> {{is crucial for}} crane operations. Wire rope is a very useful and long lasting structural element when properly used and maintained. Therefore, wire rope safety is (or should be) a constant concern <b>of</b> wire <b>rope</b> operators and safety authorities. Safe use of the crane wire ropes depends directly on the rope condition, and on the in-time and reliable rope inspection. This study {{is focused on the}} failure analysis <b>of</b> crane wire <b>ropes</b> in service in Morocco. Wire defects and <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> a lifting <b>rope</b> have been studied and presented in this paper. Special attention is given to conditions that can lead to internal damage such as broken wires, wear as well as corrosion. Various nondestructive tests methods have been used in this application for wire ropes control such as visual inspection, radiographic and electromagnetic. The results of the nondestructive testing have made it possible to determine the safety status <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> and establish preventive maintenance procedures to extend the useful life <b>of</b> a <b>rope.</b> It is concluded that maintenance, inspection and discard policy must be determined in recognition of the degradation mechanisms that operate in different rope applications.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} and mechanism of parallel polygonal line groove multilayer winding drum were investigated by an experimental approach. Strain-electricity method {{was used to}} test the stress of the cylinder body and the end plates of the drum. Experimental results show that the distribution of the axial bending stress on cylinder body is symmetric in the radial symmetry section. The largest axial bending stress appears in the symmetry plane; however the minimum stress is in the sections close to the end plates on both sides. The axial bending stress of the cylinder body is found to grow with the number of layers wrapped around the drum increasing, while the increment of the stress decreases. When the layer number <b>of</b> the wire <b>rope</b> increases from 4 to 5, the increment of the stress is less than 3 [MPa]. Intorduction With the fast development of the marine engineering, cross-river and cross-ocean bridge construction, port transportation and construction of hydropower stations, the demand of high-lifting hoisting machinery is increasing. In order {{to solve the problem of}} high-lifting, the parallel polygonal line groove multilayer winding drum is used, which can make wire rope wind around grooves formed by anterior layer wire rope loops, improve contact <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> wire <b>rope</b> and prolong wire rope’...|$|R
