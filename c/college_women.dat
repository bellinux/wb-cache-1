500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects {{the reality of what}} is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, with one of the scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five <b>college</b> <b>women</b> will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E

2500|$|... {{place in}} Cambodia, {{a country in}} desperate need after {{essentially}} all of its educated class were destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s. In June 2005, the Harpswell Foundation completed a four-room school building {{in the village of}} Tramung Chrum, about 50 miles from Phnom Penh. In July 2006, the Foundation completed a dormitory and leadership center for <b>college</b> <b>women</b> in Phnom Penh, which allows outstanding women to attend college. This dormitory serves all the colleges in Phnom Penh {{and is one of the}} first dormitories for women in Cambodia. Not having a safe place to live while attending college has been the major obstacle preventing young women from outside Phnom Penh (over 90% of the population) to receive a college education. Colleges in Cambodia do not provide housing for their students. Male students can live in the Buddhist temples, but female students cannot. The dormitory and leadership center houses 36 women, who have been selected on the basis of their intelligence, ambition, and leadership potential. In addition to providing free housing, food, and medical care, the facility gives these young women free classes in English and computer skills; readings and discussion of current events in Cambodia and the world to develop their critical thinking skills; and a weekly leadership seminar. In 2010, the Harpswell Foundation completed a second dormitory and leadership center for <b>college</b> <b>women</b> in Phnom Penh, housing 48 young women. The new facility has a large conference room, called the Hall of Great Women, where we hold national conferences on the theme of women's empowerment. In 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei. The program consists of an intense, two week summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program will have a total of 25 participants each year and will develop a strong alumnae association.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "brassiere" [...] was {{gradually}} shortened to [...] "bra" [...] in the 1930s. According to a 1934 survey by Harper's Bazaar, [...] "bra" [...] {{was the most}} commonly used expression for the garment among <b>college</b> <b>women.</b> The bra was becoming more sophisticated, and home-sewn versions vanished in the 1930s. In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet, A through D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Two other companies, Model and Fay-Miss, began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s. Adjustable bands were introduced using multiple eye and hook positions in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{study done}} at Old Dominion University, Thomas F. Cash, Julie R. Ancis and Melissa D. Strachan studied <b>college</b> <b>women</b> and their attitudes toward gender, feminist {{identity}} and body image. [...] "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image dysphoria in women's daily lives." [...] A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. [...] "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype." [...] These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to body dysmorphic disorder, body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the fall}} of 1907, Hedgeman was {{instrumental}} in founding Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, America's first Greek-letter organization established by Black <b>college</b> <b>women.</b> [...] Hedgeman {{was inspired by the}} accounts of Tremaine Robinson, a faculty member at Howard who shared her sorority experiences at Brown University.

To establish a sorority, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907. Together, the nine classmates founded Alpha Kappa Alpha on January 15, 1908. Hedgeman served as vice-president of the sorority, since she was a junior, and designed the insignia for the sorority. Starting in the 1920s, as national treasurer of Alpha Kappa Alpha for more than 20 years, Lyle (by then married) continued to guide the sorority and its growth.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reworked}} {{and extended}} version of Master of the Universe was split into three parts. The first, titled Fifty Shades of Grey, was released as an e-book and a print on demand paperback in May 2011 by The Writers' Coffee Shop, a virtual publisher based in Australia. The second volume, Fifty Shades Darker, {{was released in}} September 2011; and the third, Fifty Shades Freed, followed in January 2012. The Writers' Coffee Shop had a restricted marketing budget and relied largely on book blogs for early publicity, but sales of the novel were boosted by word-of-mouth recommendation. The book's erotic nature and perceived demographic of its fan base as being composed largely of married women over thirty led to the book being dubbed [...] "Mommy Porn" [...] by some news agencies. The book has also reportedly been popular among teenage girls and <b>college</b> <b>women.</b> By {{the release of the}} final volume in January 2012, news networks in the United States had begun to report on the Fifty Shades trilogy as an example of viral marketing and of the rise in popularity of female erotica, attributing its success to the discreet nature of e-reading devices. Due to the heightened interest in the series, the license to the Fifty Shades trilogy was picked up by Vintage Books for re-release in a new and revised edition in April 2012. The attention that the series has garnered has also helped to spark a renewed interest in erotic literature. Many other erotic works quickly became best-sellers following Fifty Shades success, while other popular works, such as Anne Rice's The Sleeping Beauty trilogy, have been reissued (this time without pseudonyms) to meet the higher demand.|$|E
