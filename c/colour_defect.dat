40|$|The Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test (F-M 100) {{was used}} to examine 30 {{patients}} with their first episode of unilateral demyelinating optic neuritis (DON) at presentation, after 6 weeks and after 6 months. Twelve patients satisfactorily completed the test with the affected eye at presentation. This number had increased to 23 by 6 weeks and to 27 by 6 months. No patient with a visual acuity of LogMAR 0. 86 (Snellen equivalent approx 6 / 43) or worse, could complete the test. The mean total error score of affected eyes showed significant improvement at each subsequent examination but was always worse than the non-affected eyes. There was a significant correlation between total error scores and visual acuities of affected eyes at presentation and after 6 months. Fourteen patients recovered a visual acuity of LogMAR 0. 0 (Snellen equivalent 6 / 6) or better but the total error scores of the affected eyes were significantly worse than the non-affected eyes (p = 0. 017), indicating that defective colour vision is an indicator of a previous episode of DON despite the recovery of normal visual acuity. DON is reported to produce a red-green (Type II) axis of <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> but individual F-M 100 polar diagrams were usually generally abnormal and did not show any predominance of recognisable axis of <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> at any examination.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of the Farnsworth D- 15 hue test in detecting early etham-butol toxicity compared to the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong from January 2012 to April 2013. Medical records for consecutive patients with tuberculosis referred for suspect-ed ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy were reviewed. All consenting subjects underwent both the Ishihara pseudo-isochromatic plates and the Farnsworth D- 15 hue test. Those with pre-existing optic neuropathies, poor visual acuity, signifi-cant cataract, known congenital <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects,</b> retinopathies, and those on other systemic medications with potential ocular toxicity side effects were excluded. The qualitative results for the 2 screenings tests were compared. Results: During the study period, 65 eligible subjects, with tuberculosis, prescribed with ethambutol, were recruited. On Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates testing, all (100 %) of the subjects had normal results. On Farnsworth D- 15 hue test-ing, 23. 1 % (15 / 65) had abnormal results: 12. 3 % (8 / 65) had a tritan (blue-yellow) defect and 10. 8 % (7 / 65) had non-specific <b>colour</b> <b>defects</b> not conferring to a single colour deficiency.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of congenital colour defects on a clinical computer test for equiluminous colour discrimination is studied. Differences in {{relative spectral sensitivity}} and changes in colour contrast discrimination are two distinct manifestations of the abnormal genes responsible for congenital red-green defects. The very simple and rapid method of the heterochromatic flicker brightness test acts like an anomaloscope {{and can be used}} to distinguish protan and deuteran defectives. The depth of the congenital <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> can be quantified by the colour contrast threshold measured in equiluminous conditions along a single red-green axis identical for all types of red-green colour defectives. Colour contrast thresholds in tritan colour axes are not influenced by congenital red-green defects and therefore they are of extreme clinical interest to detect and quantify acquired colour defects, even {{in the presence of a}} previously unknown congenital red-green defect...|$|E
40|$|The {{eye colour}} mutant sepia (se 1) is {{defective}} in PDA { 6 -acetyl- 2 -amino- 3, 7, 8, 9 -tetrahydro- 4 H-pyrimido[4, 5 -b]-[1, 4]diazepin- 4 -one or pyrimidodiazepine} synthase {{involved in the}} conversion of 6 -PTP (2 -amino- 4 -oxo- 6 -pyruvoyl- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydropteridine; also known as 6 -pyruvoyltetrahydropterin) into PDA, a key intermediate in drosopterin biosynthesis. However, {{the identity of the}} gene encoding this enzyme, as well as its molecular properties, have not yet been established. Here, we identify and characterize the gene encoding PDA synthase and show that it is the structural gene for sepia. Based on previously reported information [Wiederrecht, Paton and Brown (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2195 – 2200; Wiederrecht and Brown (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14121 – 14127; Andres (1945) Drosoph. Inf.

All cloned and expressed candidates exhibited relatively high thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities and low activity towards 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene, characteristic of Omega class GSTs, whereas only CG 6781 catalysed the synthesis of PDA in vitro. The molecular mass of recombinant CG 6781 was estimated to be 28  kDa by SDS/PAGE and 56  kDa by gel filtration, indicating that it is a homodimer under native conditions. Sequencing of the genomic region spanning CG 6781 revealed that the se 1 allele has a frameshift mutation from ‘AAGAA’ to ‘GTG’ at nt 190 – 194, and that this generates a premature stop codon. Expression of the CG 6781 open reading frame in an se 1 background rescued the eye <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> as well as PDA synthase activity and drosopterins content. The extent of rescue was dependent on the dosage of transgenic CG 6781.

40|$|M. Phil. Despite {{many years}} of research, {{diabetic}} retinopathy (DR), and diabetic macular edema (DME) remain difficult to diagnose, prevent, and treat. The complicated nature of the disease, the limited information on DR and DME and the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in South Africa, provided motivation for this study. To {{the best of my}} knowledge, this is the first study in our country to identify demographic, medical and visual aspects of DR and DME collectively. A further incentive was the availability in optometry of recently developed computer software based upon multivariate statistics, which provided a unique opportunity to analyze, for example, tri-variate contrast sensitivity acuities using stereo-pair scatter plots. All refractive status measurements were also analyzed and compared with the same method. Together, the results from this study provide a broader clinical and research perceptive on DR and DME. In this cross-sectional study, 202 diabetic patients at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg were recruited. Demographic variables included age, gender, race, age of diagnosis, duration of DM, and social habits. Medical variables included systemic conditions present, blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), lipid profiles, glycerated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and other available biochemical data (for example cholestrol, urea and creatinine levels). Visual variables included, distance, pinhole and near visual acuities, contrast sensitivity acuities, refractive status measured with autorefraction, colour vision, Amsler grid, intra ocular pressures (IOP), and fundus photography. Administration of the Impact of Visual Impairment (IVI) questionnaire provided new information concerning the restrictions in daily living participation caused by DR or DME. The predominant characteristics of the study population consisted of Type 1 DM among female Coloured subjects. Approximately 66 % of all subjects had also been diagnosed with hypertension. The mean age of the subjects was 52 (± 14) years, age of diagnosis 41 (± 13) years, and duration of DM 10. 8 (± 9. 7) years. Mean blood pressures (136 / 81 ± 20. 5 / 11 mmHg) and glycerated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c, 9. 9 ± 3. 4 %) values were slightly higher than the recommended control levels (BP= 120 / 80 mmHg and HbA 1 c = 6 to 7 %). However, mean total cholesterol and all other biochemical tests results were within recommended control ranges. Visually, mean refractive states were near emmetropia. Both distance visual acuities and pinhole acuities displayed mild visual loss, between 6 / 9 and 6 / 12. Mean contrast sensitivity acuities decreased from 6 / 12 to 6 / 24 to 6 / 60, as contrast levels were reduced from 100 % to 10 % and 2. 5 % respectively. A high percentage (75 %) of tritan <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> was found overall.

MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study employing a multi-stage random sampling approach was conducted in the major commercial towns within the central region of Ghana. Participants were taken through a comprehensive eye examination after the administration of a structured questionnaire. Results 520 male commercial vehicle drivers were enrolled for this study {{with a mean age}} of 39. 23 years ± 10. 96 years and mean visual acuity of 0. 02 ± 0. 08 logMAR. Protans were more likely to be involved in RTAs (χ 2 = 6. 194, p= 0. 034). However, there was no statistically significant association between abnormal stereopsis (OR= 0. 89 95 % CI: 0. 44 – 1. 80, p= 0. 56), poor vision due to refractive error (χ 2 = 3. 090, p= 0. 388) and the occurrence of RTAs.

40|$|Defects in {{commercial}} cheese {{result in a}} downgrading of the final cheese and a consequential economic loss to the cheese producer. Developments of defects in cheese are often not fully understood and therefore not controllable by the producer. This research investigated the underlying factors {{in the development of}} split and secondary fermentation defect and of pinking defects {{in commercial}} Irish cheeses. Split defect in Swiss-type cheese is a common defect associated with eye formation and manifests as slits and cracks visible in the cut cheese loaf (Reinbold, 1972; Daly et al., 2010). No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defect and possible factors which may contribute to the defect were reviewed. Models were derived to describe the relationship between moisture, pH, and salt levels and the distance from sample location to the closest external block surface during cheese ripening. Significant gradients within the cheese blocks were observed for all measured parameters in cheeses at 7 day post/after manufacture. No significant pH gradient was found within the blocks on exit from hot-room ripening and at three months post exit from the hot-room. Moisture content reached equilibrium within the blocks between exit from hot-room and 3 months after exit from hot-room while salt and salt-to-moisture levels had not reached equilibrium within the cheese blocks even at three months after exit from hot-room ripening. A characterisation of Swiss-type cheeses produced from a seasonal milk supply was undertaken. Cheeses were sampled on two days per month of the production year, at three different times during the manufacturing day, at internal and external regions of the cheese block and at four ripening time points (7 days post manufacture, post hot-room, 14 days post hot-room and 3 months in a cold room after exit from hot-room). Compositional, biochemical and microbial indices were determined, and the results were analysed as a splitplot with a factorial arrangement of treatments (season, time of day, area) on the main plot and ripening time on the sub-plot. Season (and interactions) had a significant effect on pH and salt-in-moisture levels (SM), mean viable counts of L. helveticus, propionic acid and non-starter lactic acid bacteria, levels of primary and secondary proteolysis and cheese firmness. Levels of proteolysis increased significantly during hot-room ripening but also during cold room storage, signifying continued development of cheese ripening during cold storage (> 8 °C). Rheological parameters (e. g. springiness and cohesiveness) were significantly affected by interactions between ripening and location within cheese blocks. Time of day of manufacture significantly affected mean cheese calcium levels at 7 days post manufacture and mean levels of arginine and mean viable counts of NSLAB. Cheeses produced {{during the middle of the}} production day had the best grading scores and were more consistent compared to cheeses produced early or late during day of manufacture. Cheeses with low levels of S/M and low values of resilience were associated with poor grades at 7 days post manufacture. Chesses which had high elastic index values and low values of springiness in the external areas after exit from hot-room ripening also obtained good commercial grades. Development of a pink <b>colour</b> <b>defect</b> is an intermittent defect in ripened cheese which may or may not contain an added colourant, e. g., annatto. Factors associated with the defect were reviewed. Attempts at extraction and identification of the pink discolouration were unsuccessful. The pink colour partitioned with the water insoluble protein fraction. No significant difference was observed between ripened control and defect cheese for oxygen levels and redox potential or for the results of elemental analysis. A possible relationship between starter activity and defect development was established in cheeses with added coulourant, as lower levels of residual galactose and lactose were observed in defective cheese compared to control cheese free of the defect. Swiss-type cheese without added colourant had significantly higher levels of arginine and significantly lower lactate levels. Flow cell cytometry indicated that levels of bacterial cell viability and metabolic state differed between control and defect cheeses (without added colourant). Pyrosequencing analysis of cheese samples with and without the defect detected the previously unreported bacteria in cheese, Deinococcus thermus (a potential carotenoid producer). Defective Swiss-type cheeses had elevated levels of Deinococcus thermus compared to control cheeses, however the direct cause of pink was not linked to this bacterium alone. Overall, research was undertaken on underlying factors associated with the development of specific defects in commercial cheese, but also characterised the dynamic changes in key microbial and physicochemical parameters during cheese ripening and storage. This will enable the development of processing technologies to enable seasonal manipulation of manufacture protocols to minimise compositional and biochemical variability and to reduce and inhibit the occurrence of specific quality defects...|$|E

Two alternative hypotheses of the colour vision deficiency are that it is an acquired disorder which is a prodromal sign of the dystrophy or that it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, these hypotheses were rejected because the colour vision deficiency had the characteristics of a typical sex linked disorder.

For exposure of hands, the permissable dose limit is 500 mSv. For radiation workers at MINT, the hand exposure dose measured from a thermoluminent-dosemeter ring worn {{on the right and}} left finger ranged from 0 to 257. 2 mSv (mean 5. 78 + 28. 60 mSv) and 0 to 155. 5 mSv (mean 4. 50 + 17. 62 mSv) respectively.

In spite of that, colour vision testing using Fansworth Munsell 100 -Hue test (FM 100 -Hue) conducted on 187 workers at MINT (of which 105 were radiation workers and 82 were non-radiation workers) revealed a polar decrease of hue discrimination especially for the blue-yellow axis, when compared to 40 normal subjects in the control group. Mean of square root of total error scores (AITES) for radiation workers (7. 08 + 2. 42) and non-radiation workers (7. 03 + 2. 06) showed significant differences when compared to the control group (4. 18 + 0. 89)) (ANOVA F(2, 224) = 32. 32, p< 0. 05) Analysis of results of FM 100 -Hue test using the Vingrys method revealed <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects</b> in 46. 3 % of radiation workers and 33. 3 % of non-radiation workers.

The ethambutol-induced red-green <b>colour</b> vision <b>defect</b> in goldfish {{was argued}} to {{originate in the}} retina because after ethambutol application: (1) inhibitive interactions in red-green (double) opponent ganglion cells are lost [Van Dijk & Spekreijse, 1982 (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, 24, 128 - 133); Wietsma & Spekreijse, 1992 (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science Suppl., 33, 1032) ] and (2) the depolarizing responses to red light in the biphasic horizontal cells are reduced. To account for these findings Spekreijse, Wietsma and Neumeyer [(1991) Vision Research, 31, 551 - 562] suggested that ethambutol induced dark adaptation in the retina. In this paper the dark adaptation hypothesis is tested with the following results: (1) ethambutol changes only transiently the receptive field size and spectral sensitivity of horizontal cells; (2) the spectral characteristics of horizontal cells do not change in long-term ethambutol-treated goldfish; (3) formation of spinules on horizontal cell dendrites in cone terminals, a parameter for light adaptation, remains unaffected.

40|$|Fast-growing hybrid aspens (Populus tremula L. × P. tremuloides Michx.) are {{currently}} {{of great interest}} in Sweden since they can produce biomass at high rates and, at the same time, {{can be used to}} produce higher value wood products. This study focuses on the effects of pruning hybrid aspen to improve its wood quality. About 50 % of the trees in the experimental stand were pruned by removing twigs, at heights up to 4 m, when they were 7 – 8 years old. Ten years later, 20 pruned and 20 unpruned trees, representing four clones, were randomly selected. Ten knots or twig/stem junctions, respectively, per tree were exposed for inspection using a chain saw and examined. The results revealed that pruned trees cicatrised the knots within about three years and thereafter produced substantial amounts of faultless wood. In contrast, unpruned trees (which had retained almost 80 % of their twigs, often as dry twigs with bark pockets) had produced small uneven amounts of quality wood. Removal of twigs with acute angles and/or large diameters resulted in greater <b>colour</b> <b>defects</b> and rot in annual rings outside the pruning position, but the time of cicatrisation was not significantly affected. The results show that pruning can be used to enhance the wood quality of hybrid aspen over a short time period, and that pruning should be performed early during the rotation period when branches are small, in order to minimize discolouration and rot in the new annual rings...|$|R
40|$|A general {{review on}} pig {{genetics}} is given. The main topics covered are: karyotype and chromosomal abnormalities, coat <b>colour,</b> hereditary <b>defects</b> and disorders, disease resistance, immunogenetics, biochemical polymorphisms, linkages and syntenies, and quantitative traits of economic importance. As regards the latter field, special emphasis {{is put on}} the known influences of marker genes on performance traits. Lists of genes controlling coat colour, blood groups (erythrocyte antigens), and electrophoretic variants of blood serum proteins and blood cell enzymes are tabulated. A list of 29 genetic abnormalities which {{can be considered as}} probably monogenic in the pig is also given. The total number of presently identified loci is around 100. I...|$|R
5000|$|In Semitic linguistics, the elative is a {{stage of}} {{gradation}} in Arabic {{that can be used}} both for a superlative and comparative. The Arabic elative has a special inflection similar to that of <b>colour</b> and <b>defect</b> adjectives, though differing in the details. To form an elative, the consonants of the adjective's root are placed in the context ʾaCCaC (or ʾaCaCC if the second and third consonants are the same), which, generally speaking, in most situations inflects for case but not for gender or number. Furthermore, elatives belong to the diptote declension. E.g. [...] (...) 'small' derives the elative [...] (...) 'smaller', [...] (...) 'new' derives [...] (...) 'newer', [...] (...) 'rich' derives [...] (...) 'richer'.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects</b> and diabetic retinopathy on diabetic patients' ability to use a visual method of measuring their own blood glucose concentrations. Forty-eight diabetics whose colour vision and retinal status was assessed by an ophthalmologist carried out 311 blood glucose estimations using oxidase-peroxidase test strips which were then compared with laboratory values. There was a trend towards poor performance with advancing age but neither colour vision nor diabetic retinopathy had a significant effect on patients' ability to use this visual method of estimating blood glucose concentrations. The vast majority of diabetics who will benefit from being able to monitor their own blood glucose control should have no difficulty in using a visual method of testing, even if they do have <b>defects</b> of <b>colour</b> vision...|$|R
40|$|Trichromatic {{colour vision}} is of {{considerable}} importance to primates but is absent in other eutherian mammals. Primate colour vision is traditionally {{believed to have}} evolved for finding food in the forest. Recent work has tested the ecological importance of trichromacy to primates, both by measuring the spectral and chemical properties of food eaten in the wild, and by testing the relative foraging abilities of dichromatic and trichromatic primates. Molecular studies have revealed the genetic mechanisms {{of the evolution of}} trichromacy, and are providing new insight into visual pigment gene expression and <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects.</b> By drawing together work from these different fields, we can {{gain a better understanding of}} how natural selection has shaped the evolution of trichromatic colour vision in primates and also about mechanisms of gene duplication, heterozygote advantage and balancing selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of colour vision and discrimination {{of an individual}} forms {{an integral part of}} a routine eye and vision examination. With the increasing prevalence of inherited <b>colour</b> vision deficiencies, <b>defects</b> of <b>colour</b> vision can be detected in an optometric practice by means of a variety of tests available. The present article comprises an overview of the design and function of a selection of colour vision tests that are administered manually and, in some cases, have been modified to form a computerised version...|$|R
40|$|Cone–rod dystrophies are {{inherited}} retinal dystrophies {{that are}} characterized by progressive degeneration of cones and rods, causing an early decrease in central visual acuity and <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects,</b> followed by loss of peripheral vision in adolescence or early adult life. Both genetic and clinical heterogeneity are well known. In a family with autosomal recessive cone–rod dystrophy, genetic analyses comprising genome scan with microsatellite markers, fine mapping and candidate gene approach resulted {{in the identification of}} a homozygous missense GUCY 2 D mutation. This is the first GUCY 2 D mutation associated with autosomal recessive cone–rod dystrophy rather than Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe disease leading to childhood blindness. This study hence establishes GUCY 2 D, which is a common cause for both recessive LCA and dominant cone–rod dystrophy, as a good candidate for autosomal recessive cone–rod dystrophy...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, great {{advances}} {{have been made}} in our understanding of the molecular basis of <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects,</b> {{as well as of the}} patterns of genetic variation in individuals with normal colour vision. Molecular genetic analyses have explained the diversity of types and degrees of severity in colour vision anomalies, their frequencies, pronounced individual variations in test results, etc. New techniques have even enabled the determination of John Dalton’s real <b>colour</b> vision <b>defect,</b> 150 years after his death. Inherited colour vision deficiencies most often result from the mutations of genes that encode cone opsins. Cone opsin genes are linked to chromosomes 7 (the S or “blue” gene) and X (the L or “red” gene and the M or “green” gene). The L and M genes are located on the q arm of the X chromosome in a head-to-tail array, composed of 2 to 6 (typically 3) genes - a single L is followed by one or more M genes. Only the first two genes of the array are expressed and contribute to the colour vision phenotype. The high degree of homology (96 %) between the L and M genes predisposes them to unequal recombination, leading to gene deletion or the formation of hybrid genes (comprising portions of both the L and M genes), explaining the majority of the common red-green colour vision deficiencies. The severity of any deficiency is influenced by the difference in spectral sensitivity between the opsins encoded by the first two genes of the array. A rare defect, S monochromacy, is caused either by the deletion of the regulatory region of the array or by mutations that inactivate the L and M genes. Most recent research concerns the molecular basis of complete achromatopsia, a rare disorder that involves the complete loss of all cone function. This is not caused by mutations in opsin genes, but in other genes that encode cone-specific proteins, e. g. channel proteins and transducin...|$|R
40|$|A {{defect in}} the blue {{sensitive}} mechanism {{has been reported in}} certain ocular and systemic diseases. For example, tritanopic <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects</b> and changes to the S-cone electroretinogram (ERG) have been demonstrated in glaucoma and diabetes mellitus. Electrophysiological methods of eliciting the S-cone ERG, however, often result in considerable L- and M-cone intrusion. We report the findings of a study employing the silent substitution S-cone ERG technique, which is thought to represent an almost pure S-cone signal, and the L'Anthony desaturated D 15 colour vision test in subjects with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with no or minimal background retinopathy. The results of this study show a significantly increased S-cone ERG b-wave implicit time and significantly worse colour vision in those with background retinopathy compared with those with no diabetic retinopathy. This suggests that S-cone pathway dysfunction may be responsible for the deterioration in colour vision found in diabetes mellitus...|$|R
