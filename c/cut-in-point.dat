40|$|Flexible {{workpiece}} {{includes the}} materials like elasticity spline, textile fabric, and polyurethane sponge, {{due to the}} fact that processing trajectory is composed by small arc or small line segment primitives and the deformation of the flexible workpiece during the processing trajectory, making the captured image of processing trajectory not clear, the edge of processing image over local uneven gray, and also the pixels of boundaries between the processing trajectory image edge and background organizations not obvious. This paper takes corner search of processing trajectory as the <b>cut-in-point,</b> slope angle curve of starting and terminal point of each primitive is also designed, put forward the search algorithm that regards Daubechies (4) as wavelet operator to conduct slope angle curve for multiple scales wavelet transform, by judging whether there is a point of the curve appears wavelet transform extremum to determine whether the point is a corner point based on wavelet edge modulus maxima extract principle. Finally, proposed a decomposition/reconstruction design method of FIR filters based on wavelet transform of processing image. Eight-tap transpose FIR filter is used to design the decomposition of Daubechies (4) and reconfigurable computing IP core. The IP core wavelet decomposition of the total time-consuming increases only 5. 561 % in comparsion with PC. Trajectory angle relative error is 2. 2 %, and the average measurement time is 212. 38 [*]ms...|$|E
