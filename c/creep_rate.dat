25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the <b>creep</b> <b>rate</b> grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Geosynthetic-reinforced walls {{have been}} viewed by the civil engineer-ing {{profession}} as a new technology whose acceptable long-term performance {{is yet to be}} established. Nevertheless, geosynthetic walls have been in use for almost 25 years. Much of the uncertainty associated with acceptance of geosynthetic-reinforced wall technologies is related to time-dependent deformation. This paper summarizes the <b>creep</b> <b>rates</b> measured in full-scale walls and compares them to <b>creep</b> <b>rates</b> measured in-isola-tion in the laboratory where the applied load level matches values estimated for the same structures in the field. In the majority of cases, the laboratory in-isolation <b>creep</b> <b>rates</b> were the same as or greater than the measured reinforcement <b>creep</b> <b>rates</b> in full-scale walls, corroborating that reinforcement load levels can be estimated from measured strain data. At the end of wall construction, it appears that the reinforcement is primarily exhibiting creep, with only minor stress relaxation. However, in the long-term, there is a trend toward reinforcement stress relaxation. Furthermore, the long-term behavior observed in the full-scale walls indicates that the reinforcement loads are well below values required to cause creep rupture over the design life of the structures and, in some cases...|$|R

2500|$|Coble creep is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled creep. In Coble creep the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble creep to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring creep, thus, Coble creep will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble creep k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the grain boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble creep occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring creep. Coble creep is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring creep. It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring creep. Generally, the diffusional <b>creep</b> <b>rate</b> should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring <b>creep</b> <b>rate</b> and Coble <b>creep</b> <b>rate.</b> Diffusional creep leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains.

When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of creep fracture.|$|E
