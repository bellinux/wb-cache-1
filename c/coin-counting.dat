50|$|The typical Coinstar coin-cashing kiosk {{is green}} {{and the size}} of a large vending machine. They are located at grocery stores, drug stores, larger merchants, banks or other retail locations. The <b>coin-counting</b> service is {{available}} in the US (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Ireland and the UK.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coin-counting</b> {{processing}} fee, {{deducted from}} the total once coins have been counted, is 11.9% in the USA, 11.9% in Canada, 8.7% in Ireland and 6.8% in the UK. Some machines may offer a lower rate; {{in this case the}} store hosting the machine has subsidised the rate.|$|E
50|$|To process coins, loose {{change is}} {{poured into the}} machine. In the United States, the machine accepts all {{denominations}} of coins from one-cent coins to one-dollar coins, its only restriction being 1943 steel cents and Eisenhower Dollars. When the machine finishes counting coins it issues a scrip, called a voucher, which the user can redeem at the place of business providing the <b>coin-counting</b> service at face value for currency. The same mode of operation and redemption is provided on those Coinstar machines situated in Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, and Puerto Rico.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{sections}} of the U.S., regional banks have begun offering free <b>coin-counting</b> services {{in the amount of}} a gift card. Refunds are often given in cash rather than {{in the form of a}} gift card. In some cases, it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank; the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders. TD Bank's [...] "Penny Arcade" [...] coin counters were free and available to both customers and non-customers in many branches, but as of November 2010, the bank charges a 6% fee for non-customers to use the machine. In May 2016, in the wake of a New York state lawsuit over accuracy, TD Bank said that it had suspended use of its Penny Arcade machines and would be removing them from all of its locations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A new {{intelligent}} <b>coin-counting</b> {{system is}} described in this paper. The proposed system is effective and flexible {{for the purpose of}} performing <b>coin-counting</b> using image captured from webcam. Image processing techniques are employed to prepare data for image understanding, and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network is employed for performing the classification task. Extensive and promising results were obtained and the analysis suggests the proposed Radial Basis Function type classifier provides good results for high accuracy in <b>coin-counting...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} to teach four mild and moderately retarded persons to sum {{the value of}} coin combinations was tested. Subjects were first taught to count a single target coin, and then to sum that coin in combination with coins previously trained. Five American coins and various combinations were trained. Modelling, modelling with subject participation, and independent counting by the subject constituted the training sequence. The subjects improved from a mean pretest score of 29 % to 92 % correct at posttest. A four-week followup score showed a mean of 79 % correct. A multiple-baseline design suggested that improvement in <b>coin-counting</b> performance occurred only after the coin was trained. The results indicate that this procedure has potential for teaching the retarded to sum combinations of coinds in 5 to 6 hr of instruction...|$|E
40|$|A {{program was}} {{designed}} to teach coin equivalence to mentally retarded adolescents. Coin equivalence was defined as choosing several different combinations of coins to equal specified target values. A pretest-posttest matched-groups design was employed with an experimental group receiving the monetary training, and a no-training control group. A multiple baseline across <b>coin-counting</b> responses was also incorporated in the experimental group. Training was divided into six stages, each teaching one specific method of combining coins to equal 10 target values from 5 cents through 50 cents. A three-component response chain was used, requiring (a) naming, (b) selecting and counting, and (c) depositing target monetary values into a coin machine. Experimental subjects improved significantly in coin equivalence performance and maintained their skill on follow up tests; control subjects did not...|$|E
