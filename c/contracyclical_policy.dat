40|$|This address - the Doug Purvis {{memorial}} lecture for 1998 - evaluates federal {{fiscal policy}} {{over the last}} 50 years. During the 1950 s and 1960 s the federal government benefited from high growth and low interest rates; its share of GDP doubled while, on average, the budget was balanced. Things deteriorated in the 1970 s and 1980 s; the government was confused regarding its objectives, and - with lower growth and higher interest rates - the vicious circle of debt dynamics set in. In the late 1980 s, problems were further compounded by an inappropriate monetary-fiscal policy mix. Federal fiscal policy has been a success since 1994, {{in part because the}} government has learned some lessons from the earlier years - such as the payoff of restricting attention to at most one or two economic objectives at a time. For the coming 15 years, Dodge recommends small budget surpluses, so that a federal debt-to-GDP ratio of about 35 percent can be reached within that time frame. He further recommends that the government should focus on stimulating private saving and investment, not <b>contracyclical</b> <b>policy,</b> and that further research in the areas of health-care delivery and generalized wage subsidies should be treated as a top priority. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the potential of}} a variable investment tax credit to relieve the pressure of a <b>contracyclical</b> monetary <b>policy</b> on the housing and State and local government sectors. In particular, it examines the potential of such a policy instrument to affect business capital expenditures in the U. S. manufacturing sector at the twodigit SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) level of aggregation. If a variable investment tax credit can affect investment expenditures with sufficient force and speed, the active use of such a policy instrument could reduce the stabilization burden now borne by the housing and State and local government sectors. Perhaps the best known recent works {{in this area are}} those by Hall and Jorgenson (11, 12, 13) and Bischoff (2). The model used by Hall and Jorgenson assumes that the elasticity of the desired capital stock with respect to the implicit rental rate on capital is unity, that is, it is an assumed rather than an estimated value. In addition, their model has a theoretical difficulty which recent research [6] has found to be of empirical consequence. Essentially this difficulty stems from attempting to explain the demand for an input, capital, by use of output in a single equation model. Bischoff’s model is more general than that used by Hall and Jorgenson in that it assumes a CES production function, instead of Cobb-Douglas, and it is a putty-clay model as opposed to a putty-putty model. Bischoff’s model still has the same theoretical difficulty alluded to above, however. Furthermore, his model must be estimated by nonlinear estimation tech...|$|R
