25|$|In {{reconstructive}} rhinoplasty, the {{defects and}} deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters, and must restore to normal function, form, and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones; disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages; a collapsed {{bridge of the}} nose; <b>congenital</b> <b>defect,</b> trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), autoimmune disorder, cancer, intranasal drug-abuse damages, and failed primary rhinoplasty outcomes. Rhinoplasty reduces bony humps, and re-aligns the nasal bones after they are cut (dissected, resected). When cartilage is disrupted, suturing for re-suspension (structural support), {{or the use of}} cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the re-establishment of the normal nasal contour of the nose for the patient. When the bridge of the nose is collapsed, rib-cartilage, ear-cartilage, or cranial-bone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity, and thus the aesthetic continuity of the nose. For augmenting the nasal dorsum, autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to (artificial) prostheses, because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications.|$|E

40|$|Background: The ECLAMC (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Congénitas) is an {{epidemiological}} surveillance program for <b>congenital</b> <b>defects</b> that operates in Chile since 1969. Aim: To communicate {{the frequency of}} disabling <b>congenital</b> <b>defects</b> in Chile in the period 1982 - 1997. Material and methods: A review of the ECLAMC registry, choosing 12 congenital defects: amelia, limb amputations, limb reductions, arthrogryposis, hip luxation and subluxation, spina bifida, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, cephalocele, talipes equinovarus, Down syndrome and multiple abnormalities. Results: In the study period, 283, 403 births occurred and 7, 917 newborns were malformed (7, 654 born alive and 263 stillbirths). The <b>congenital</b> <b>defects</b> prevalence rates appeared higher in Chile than in other Latin American countries, specially among stillbirths. Among the studied maternity hospitals, the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile, showed the higher prevalence of <b>congenital</b> <b>defects.</b> Rancagua and the Navy Hospital in Valparaiso have a high frequency of Down syndrome.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the prevalence and prenatal ultrasound detection of clubfoot in Tuscany {{during a period}} of 20 years. Methods: This is a descriptive analysis on data from the Tuscan register of <b>congenital</b> <b>defects,</b> covering a 20 -year period from 1992 to 2011. The Tuscan registry of <b>congenital</b> <b>defects</b> is a population-based register for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies. The study included all cases of pre- or postnatally diagnosed clubfoot (isolated clubfoot and cases associated with other <b>congenital</b> <b>defects).</b> Overall prevalence and pre-natal detection rates were calculated. Results: Among the 549 931 deliveries recorded in Tuscany between 1992 and 2011, 858 cases of clubfoot were registered, with a prevalence of 1. 56 / 1000. Seventy-eight percent of cases were isolated. The detection rate was higher when the defect was associated with other anomalies compared to isolated forms. Over the study period, there was a substantial improvement in the prenatal detection of clubfoot (from 11 to 31 % overall). For isolated forms, detection rate improved from 4 to 16 %, and for cases associated with other <b>congenital</b> <b>defects,</b> it increased from 43 to 73 %. Conclusion: Prevalence of clubfoot in Tuscany is 1. 56 per 1000 births, in agreement with the incidence reported in epidemiological studies in Europe.
