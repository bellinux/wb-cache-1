We employed the combination of density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics (MM), within the ONIOM approach, to evaluate the structures and energies involved on the most representative reactions observed on ethene polymerization, using the Brookhart catalytic system. All intermediates and transition state structures along these elementary steps were treated as representatives of the polymerization process.

40|$|On {{the role}} of the imide axial ligand in the spin and {{oxidation}} state of Mn corrole and corrolazine complexesElectronic structure calculations have been performed on four different Mn corrole and corrolazine complexes to clarify {{the role of}} the imide axial ligand on the relative stability of the different spin states and the stabilization of the high valent Mn ion in these complexes. Multiconfigurational perturbation theory energy calculations on the DFT optimized geometries shows that all complexes have a singlet ground state except the complex with the strongest electron withdrawing substituent on the imide axial ligand, which is found to have a triplet ground state. The analysis of the sigma and pi interaction between metal and imide ligand shows that this spin crossover is caused by a subtle interplay of geometrical factors (Mn-N distance and <b>coordination</b> <b>angle)</b> and the electron withdrawing character of the substituent on the imide, which reduces the electron donation to the metal centre. The analysis of the multiconfigurational wave functions reveals that the formally MnV ion is stabilized by an important electron transfer from both the equatorial corrole/corrolazine ligand and the axial imide. The macrocycle donates roughly half an electron, being somewhere between the closed-shell trianionic and the dianionic radical form. The imide ligand transfers 2. 5 electrons to the metal center, resulting in an effective d-electron count close to five in all complexes...|$|E
40|$|The human opposable thumb {{enables the}} hand to perform {{dexterous}} manipulation of objects, which requires well-coordinated digit force vectors. This {{study investigated the}} directional coordination of force vectors generated by the {{thumb and index finger}} during precision pinch. Fourteen right-handed, healthy subjects were instructed to exert pinch force on an externally stabilized apparatus with the pulps of the thumb and index finger. Subjects applied forces to follow a force-ramp profile that linearly increased from 0 to 12 N and then decreased to 0 N, at a rate of ± 3 N/s. Directional relationships between the thumb and index finger force vectors were quantified using the <b>coordination</b> <b>angle</b> (CA) between the force vectors. Individual force vectors were further analyzed according to their projection angles (PAs) with respect to the pinch surface planes and the shear angles (SAs) within those planes. Results demonstrated that fingertip force directions were dependent on pinch force magnitude, especially at forces below 2 N. Hysteresis was observed in the force-CA relationship for increasing and decreasing forces and fitted with exponential models. The fitted asymptotic values were 156. 0 ± 6. 6 ° and 150. 8 ± 9. 3 ° for increasing and decreasing force ramps, respectively. The PA of the thumb force vector deviated further from the direction perpendicular to the pinching surface planes than that of the index finger. The SA showed that the index finger force vector deviated in the ulnar-proximal direction, whereas the thumb switched its force between the ulnar-proximal and radial-proximal directions. The findings shed light on the effects of anatomical composition, biomechanical function, and neuromuscular control in coordinating digit forces during precision pinch, and provided insight into the magnitude-dependent force directional control which potentially affects a range of dexterous manipulations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceChloride and hydrosulfide are the {{principal}} ligands assumed to govern transport of copper in hydrothermal fluids. Existing solubility experiments suggest that Cu(I) -hydrosulfide complexes are dominant compared to chloride complexes at low salinities in alkaline solutions (H 2 S(aq) /HS- pH buffer), and may be important in transporting Cu in low density magmatic vapors, potentially controlling the liquid-vapor partitioning of Cu. This study provides the first in situ evidence of the solubility of copper sulfides and the nature {{and structure of the}} predominant Cu species in sulfur-containing fluids at temperatures up to 592 degrees C and pressures of 180 - 600 bar. XANES and EXAFS data show that at elevated T (<= 200 degrees C), Cu solubility occurs via a linear Cu complex. At 428 degrees C in alkaline solutions. Cu is coordinated by two sulfur atoms in a distorted linear <b>coordination</b> (<b>angle</b> similar to 150 - 160 degrees). This geometry is consistent with the species Cu(HS) (2) (-) predicted by earlier solubility studies. In addition, in situ measurements of the solubility of chalcocite in 2 in NaHS solutions performed in this study are in remarkably good agreement with the solubilities calculated using available thermodynamic data for Cu(I) -hydrosulfide complexes, also supporting the interpretation of speciation in these studies and validating the extrapolation of low-T thermodynamic properties for Cu(HS) (2) (-) to high P-T. Data on phase separation for the 2 m NaHS solution show that while significant amounts of copper can be partitioned into the vapor phase, there is no indication for preferential partitioning of Cu into the vapor. This is consistent with recent partitioning experiments conducted in autoclaves by Pokrovski et al. (2008 a) and Simon et al. (2006). XANES data suggest that the species present in the low density phase is very similar to that present in the high density liquid, i. e., Cu(HS) (2) (-), although Cu(HS) (H 2 S) (0) cannot be excluded on the basis of XAS data...|$|E
40|$|Cationic chiral dirhodium(II,III) carboxamidates, {{obtained}} from the oxidation of the corresponding dirhodium(II,II) carboxamidates by nitrosonium salts, are efficient promoters in asymmetric Lewis acid catalyzed reactions. High regiocontrol and stereocontrol have been achieved with the cationic chiral dirhodium(II,III) carboxamidate whose ligand is (R) -menthyl (S) - 2 -oxopyrrolidine- 5 -carboxylate in 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions of nitrones with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. In addition, higher rates and selectivities have been obtained in hetero-Diels-Alder and carbonyl-ene reactions with the diastereomeric catalyst having the (S) -menthyl (S) - 2 -oxopyrrolidine- 5 -carboxylate ligand. Dramatic solvent influences on reaction rates and selectivities characterize the catalysis of cationic chiral dirhodium(II,III) carboxamidates, and these influences are explained by competitive coordination of solvent to catalyst and by the influenced <b>coordination</b> <b>angle</b> of the aldehyde substrate relative to catalyst by the solvent environment. Rhodium vinylcarbenes, generated from the reactions between vinyldiazoacetates and dirhodium catalysts, are highly reactive intermediates. Through reacting rhodium vinylcarbenes with nitrones, we have discovered a [3 + 3]-cycloaddition pathway; and by using chiral dirhodium carboxylates as the catalysts, a highly enantioselective [3 + 3]-cycloaddition of nitrones with vinyldiazoacetates has been achieved. The products of this [3 + 3]-cycloaddition are 3, 6 -dihydro- 1, 2 -oxazines, which are versatile intermediates for the synthesis of α-substituted β-amino acids and related compounds that are not easily accessible by other methods. The broad scope of cyclic and acylic nitrones that are applied demonstrates {{the power of this}} methodology. The limitation of this [3 + 3]-cycloaddition methodology is the requirement of using the β-TBSO-substituted vinyldiazo compounds as the rhodium vinylcarbene precursors. Although vinyldiazoacetates without the β-TBSO substituent are not reactive for the [3 + 3]-cycloaddition with nitrones, we have discovered an alternative reaction pathway with an unsubstituted vinyldiazoacetate. The reaction occurs with a dirhodium vinylcarbene-induced [3 + 2] nitrone cycloaddition, followed by subsequent cascade carbenoid aromatic cycloaddition/N-O cleavage and rearrangement. In this cascade process, both the [3 + 2]-cycloaddition of nitrones with a rhodium vinylcarbene and the [1, 7]-oxygen migration with N-O cleavage are unprecedented in the literature. The complexity of the reaction pathway and the uniqueness of the formed heterocyclic products are of great interest to synthetic chemists...|$|E

We find that distances and angles in the primary coordination sphere are in general close to the expected (or ideal) values. Deviations occur primarily for oxygen coordinating atoms and {{are found to be}} mainly due to H-bonding of the oxygen coordinating ligand to protein residues, bidentate binding arrangements, and multi-zinc sites.

Analysis of the stereochemistry shows that carboxyl elec-His-Zn motifs are geometrically rigid, while water elec-His-Zn motifs show the most geometrical variation. As catalytic motifs have a higher proportion of carboxyl elec atoms than structural motifs, they provide a more rigid framework for zinc binding. This is understood biologically, as a small distortion in the zinc position in an enzyme can have serious consequences on the enzymatic reaction.

40|$|International audienceThe newly {{introduced}} model-free {{control is}} applied to a multivariable decoupled longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. It combines two outputs (lateral and longitudinal motions) via two inputs (braking/traction wheel torques and steering angle). It yields driving maneuvers requiring a control <b>coordination</b> of steering <b>angle,</b> braking and traction torques, {{in order to ensure}} an accurate tracking in straight or curved trajectories. It is also robust with respect to modeling errors and parametric uncertainties, even during critical driving situations, where such a control is required. Convincing computer simulations are displayed with noisy real data from a laboratory vehicle, which were used as reference trajectories and acquired under high lateral accelerations...|$|R

The CuII atom, which lies on a twofold rotation axis, displays a square-pyramidal <b>coordination.</b> The dihedral <b>angles</b> of the 1, 10 -phenanthroline ligand {{with respect to the}} furan rings of the carboxylate anions that are connected to the metal atom are 62. 18 &# 8197;(11) and 88. 27 &# 8197;(12) &# 176;...|$|R
40|$|Density functional/molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} performed on liquid antimony (588 atoms and six temperatures between 600 K and 1300 K) and on neutral Sb clusters with up to 14 atoms. We study structural patterns (<b>coordination</b> numbers, bond <b>angles,</b> and ring patterns, structure factors, pair distribution functions) and dynamical properties (vibration frequencies, diffusion constants, power spectra, dynamical structure factors, viscosity) and compare with available experimental results and {{with the results of}} our previous simulations on Bi. Three short covalent bonds characteristic of pnictogens are common in the clusters, and higher temperatures lead in the liquid to broader bond angle distributions, larger total cavity volumes, and weaker correlations between neighboring bond lengths. There are clear similarities between the properties of Sb and Bi aggregate...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{amorphous}} carbon (a-C) thin film on a [1 1 1] diamond surface {{has been studied}} by a tight-binding (TB) molecular dynamics (MD) technique. Six different three-dimensional networks were constructed with periodic boundary conditions in two dimensions. Time-dependent non-equilibrium growth was simulated with atom-by-atom deposition and it was described as in real experiments without an artificial model of energy dissipation. An additional seventh structure was constructed by a melt quenching procedure which is widely used in computer generations of amorphous networks. The final structures consist of over 100 atoms. Densities, radial distribution functions (RDFs), <b>coordination</b> numbers, bond <b>angle</b> distributions and ring statistics were analyzed. During relaxation {{the temperature in the}} amorphous film decreases with stretched-exponential function. The time dependence of bond length and bond angl...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the kinematics of liberation moment in the elite archers. Methods: Ten elite archers (male = 5, female = 5), who were the members of the provincial and national teams, were studied. The trunk and upper extremities of the subjects were determined by 5 reflective markers. Each archer performed 10 successful trials. Using Motion Analysis System (150 Hz with a low pass filter having a cut-off frequency of 7 Hz) and based on markers’ <b>coordination,</b> the <b>angles</b> and angular velocities of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist of pulling hand in the sagittal plane at the moment of liberation were calculated. Results: Means (SD) of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles were 93. 1 (4. 0), 135. 7 (5. 7), 15. 3 (2. 8) °, respectively. Means (SD) of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist angular velocities were 55. 4 (23. 5), 38. 4 (16. 1), 81. 9 (36. 6) °/s, respectively. Conclusion: The fast wrist extension causes a quick arrow release and enhancements in the results of archery. In addition, coordination between elbow flexion and shoulder extension assists the archer to pull the bow at its maximum range. These amounts and kinematic relations can serve as a criterion for coaches and elementary archers to enhance their level of performance...|$|R
