30|$|On 10 March 2005 two of {{the four}} {{electric}} systems in Mexico (Northwest Grid and the National Grid), which had operated asynchronously until that date were synchronized. As soon as the tie lines were connected, sustained inter-area oscillations were observed throughout the system, which would eventually lead to the separation of the system again. Thanks to WAMS, it was possible to record and simulate the oscillations that were present during the synchronous operation. PMUs also make possible direct visualization of power system frequency, voltage, phase angle, active and reactive power, etc. However, to find the origin of the oscillations and to correct the settings for excitation controls and PSSs of generators, it was necessary to calculate the curves of real power versus frequency (P-F) and reactive power versus voltage (Q-V) of machines and <b>connection</b> <b>circuits</b> among systems.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the left temporal pole (Brodmann area 38 (BA 38)) participates in diverse language functions, including semantic processing, speech comprehension, and naming. Utilizing the activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a meta-analytic connectivity study was conducted to further our understanding on the role of BA 38 in language. Departing from the BrainMap functional database, 11 papers corresponding to 12 paradigms including 201 participants were selected. Initially, � 3 ̆c 0. 01 was employed as the significance level, resulting in the presence of four different activation clusters. However,when the significance level was lowered to � 3 ̆c 0. 05, sixteen activation clusters appeared, including classical language areas such as Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. It was concluded that (1) this meta-analytic connectivity study suggests the presence of two major <b>connection</b> <b>circuits</b> involving BA 38; one is related to language,while the othermay be involved in visuospatial and integrative audiovisual functions.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the main circuit of electrical connections at a nuclear electric power plant that has two units with a capacity of 1, 200 MW each has been determined. Reliability, economical, maneuverable properties of the atomic power plant under study are largely determined by its main circuit, so {{the choice of the}} circuit for the design and its status in the process of operation occur to be critical objectives. Main electrical <b>connection</b> <b>circuits</b> in nuclear electric power plants are {{selected on the basis of}} the schematic networks of the energy system and the land attached to the plant. The circuit of the connection of a nuclear power plant to the grid in the original normal operating modes at all stages of the construction of such a plant should provide the outcome of the full added capacity of a nuclear power plant and the preservation of its stability in the power system without the influence of the emergency system automatics when any outgoing transmission line is disabled. When selecting the main circuit the individual capacity of the installed units and their number are taken into account as well as the order of development of the plant and power supply system; the voltage on which the power of a plant is delivered; a shortcircuit current for switchgear high voltage and the need for their limitation by circuit means; the most power that can be lost when damage to any switch.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{electric}} <b>connection</b> <b>circuits</b> of power plants (based {{on fossil fuels}} as well as renewable sources) entail generator circuit-breakers (GCBs) at the generator terminals, since the presence of that electric equipment offers many advantages related to the sustainability of a power plant. In an alternating current (a. c.) circuit the interruption of a short circuit is performed by the circuit-breaker at the natural passing through zero of the short-circuit current. During the current interruption, an electric arc is generated between the opened contacts of the circuit-breaker. This arc must be cooled and extinguished in a controlled way. Since the synchronous generator stator can flow via highly asymmetrical short-circuit currents, the phenomena which occur {{in the case of}} short-circuit currents interruption determine the main stresses of the generator circuit-breaker; the current interruption requirements of a GCB are significantly higher than for the distribution network circuit breakers. For shedding light on the proper moment when the generator circuit-breaker must operate, using the space phasor of the short-circuit currents, the time expression to the first zero passing of the short-circuit current is determined. Here, the manner is investigated in which various factors influence the delay of the zero passing of the short-circuit current. It is shown that the delay time is influenced by the synchronous machine parameters and by the load conditions which precede the short-circuit. Numerical simulations were conducted of the asymmetrical currents {{in the case of the}} sudden three-phase short circuit at the terminals of synchronous generators. Further in this study it is emphasized that although the phenomena produced in {{the electric}} arc at the terminals of the circuit-breaker are complicated and not completely explained, the concept of exergy is useful in understanding the physical phenomena. The article points out that just after the short-circuit current interruption by the generator the circuit-breaker (when the GCB has been subjected at the metal contact terminals to the high temperature of a plasma arc, up to 50, 000 K) between its opened contacts, there arises the transient recovery voltage (TRV) which constitutes the most important dielectric stress after the electric arc extinction. Since the magnitude and shape of the TRV occurring across the generator circuit-breaker are critical parameters in the recovering gap after the current zero, in this paper, we model, for the case of the faults fed by the main step-up transformer, the equivalent configurations, with operational impedances, for the TRV calculation, taking into account the main transformer parameters, on the basis of the symmetrical components method...|$|E

To perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the amplitudes and frequencies of the vibrational components of the electromagnetic torque of the electric motor. Results. The conducted researches allowed to reveal the peculiarities of the effect of the parameters of the elements of various types of power circuits of the parametric control converters on the vibrational components of the electromagnetic torque of an induction electric motor. Calculations and physical modeling have been performed, it has been possible to establish the conditions for the occurrence of electromagnetic pulsations and to determine the ways of their elimination. It was found that the magnitude of pulsations of the electromagnetic moment of an induction electric motor in quasi-permanent modes depends on the selected power circuit of the converter's stator and rotor commutators, the composition of the elements included in them, and the <b>connection</b> <b>circuits.</b> Comparison of calculated and experimental waveform when starting induction electric motors indicates that the pulsation of the electromagnetic torque is affected by: the size of the opening angle of the valves, their control methods, the rotor speed, the parameters of the electric motor and the mechanism are static and inertial moments. At the same time, it was revealed that the use of resistor-thyristor modules in the power circuits of the stator and rotary commutators reduces the magnitude of the pulsation of the electromagnetic torque of the induction electric motor. Increase the value of its maximum and average torques. Limit the magnitude of the shock and alternating torques when it starts and the transition from one speed to another. Scientific novelty. It is proposed to use a generalized circuit of parametric control of an induction electric motor for studying the change in the electromagnetic torque. The circuit consists of resistor – thyristor modules in stator and rotary commutators.

This approach has the advantages of increased reliability, due to the redundancy of the system, and flexibility, since modules can be added or removed as needed.
