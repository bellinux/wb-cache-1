25|$|Assembly {{language}} uses a mnemonic {{to represent}} each low-level machine instruction or opcode, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc. Many operations require {{one or more}} operands in order to form a <b>complete</b> <b>instruction</b> and most assemblers can take expressions of numbers and named constants as well as registers and labels as operands, freeing the programmer from tedious repetitive calculations. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.|$|E
60|$|William's {{presence}} in Normandy {{had the effect}} which had been anticipated from it. It awakened every where {{a great deal of}} enthusiasm in his favor. The soldiers were pleased to see how handsome their young commander was in form, and how finely he could ride. He was, in fact, a very superior equestrian for one so young. He was more fond, even, than other boys of horses; and as, of course, the most graceful and the fleetest horses which could be found were provided for him, and as Theroulde had given him the best and most <b>complete</b> <b>instruction,</b> he made a fine display as he rode swiftly through the camp, followed by veteran nobles, splendidly dressed and mounted, and happy to be in his train, while his own countenance beamed with a radiance in which native intelligence and beauty were heightened by the animation and excitement of pride and pleasure. In respect to the command of the army, of course the real power remained in Alan's hands, but every thing was done in William's name; and in respect to all external marks and symbols of sovereignty, the beautiful boy seemed to possess the supreme command; and as the sentiment of loyalty is always the strongest when the object which calls for the exercise of it is most helpless or frail, Alan found his power very much increased when he had this beautiful boy to exhibit as the true and rightful heir, in whose name and for whose benefit all his power was held.|$|E

40|$|The {{instruction}} {{window is}} a critical component and a major energy consumer in out-of-order superscalar processors. An important source of energy consumption in the instruction window is the <b>instruction</b> wakeup: a <b>completing</b> <b>instruction</b> broadcasts its result register tag and an associative comparison is performed with all the entries in the window. This paper shows that a very large fraction of the <b>completing</b> <b>instructions</b> have to wake up {{no more than a}} single instruction currently in the window. Consequently, we propose to save energy by using indexing to only enable the comparator at the single instruction to wake up. Only in the rare case when more than one instruction needs to wake up, our scheme reverts to enabling all the comparators or a subset of them. For this reason, we call our scheme Hybrid. Overall, our scheme is very effective: for a processor with a 96 -entry window, the number of comparisons performed by the average <b>completing</b> <b>instruction</b> with a destination register is reduced to 0. 8. The exact magnitude of the energy savings will depend on the specific instruction window implementation. Furthermore, the application suffers no performance penalty...|$|R

50|$|France’s {{subsequent}} {{contribution was}} just as vital for HP as the former and it consisted of the first integrated circuit designed within the company. The engineers and the management were anxiously awaiting {{the arrival of the}} processed chip, which arose from France’s cutting and pasting of its layout. Being armed with two most important technologies that catapulted Silicon Valley, France was the obvious choice for carrying the intricate load of designing the miniature processor for HP-35, the first scientific pocket calculator. While he did not get the recognition of having designed the first microprocessor in the world, France’s HP-35 calculating unit had all the characteristics associated with a microprocessor. It had a <b>complete</b> <b>instruction</b> set for controlling its arithmetic units. The algorithms for trigonometric and logarithmic algorithms took advantage of this instruction set which has put the slide rule out of business. But it also opened the door to a new genre of pocket calculators. Being familiar with his instruction set France saw the opportunity to give the business community their own pocket calculator. In consultation with business experts France designed algorithms that are still in use to this day in the commercial world.|$|E
50|$|The 8085 is {{a binary}} {{compatible}} {{follow up on}} the 8080. It supports the <b>complete</b> <b>instruction</b> set of the 8080, with exactly the same instruction behavior, including all effects on the CPU flags (except for the AND/ANI operation, which sets the AC flag differently). This means {{that the vast majority}} of object code (any program image in ROM or RAM) that runs successfully on the 8080 can run directly on the 8085 without translation or modification. (Exceptions include timing-critical code and code that is sensitive to the aforementioned difference in the AC flag setting or differences in undocumented CPU behavior.) 8085 instruction timings differ slightly from the 8080—some 8-bit operations, including INR, DCR, and the heavily used MOV r,r' instruction, are 1 clock cycle faster, but instructions that involve 16-bit operations, including stack operations (which increment or decrement the 16-bit SP register) generally 1 cycle slower.It is of course possible that the actual 8080 and/or 8085 differs from the published specifications, especially in subtle details. (The same is not true of the Z80.) As mentioned already, only the SIM and RIM instructions were new to the 8085.|$|E
5000|$|Better Place and Renault {{announced}} the Fluence Z.E. {{was the first}} modern electric car with a swappable battery available on the Better Place electric vehicle network [...] with (QuickDrop) battery swapping technology. Battery switching or swapping is a technology that enables the driver to swap a depleted battery with a fully charged one by going through a battery switch station. In a demonstration with electric taxi cabs run in Tokyo {{until the end of}} 2010, the trial battery switch station allowed drivers to exchange their car's depleted battery pack for a 100 mi fully recharged one in 59.1 seconds on average. In August 2010 Better Place announced a non-binding order of 100,000 Renault Fluence ZE and four months later Better Place claimed to have sold 70,000 cars from that order, a year away from the public launch of the Better Place network.Better Place customers needed only to drive up to the entrance of a battery switch station to start the switch process. The Oscar in-car navigation system uses a WiFi connection to communicate with the station's computers and an RFID tag on the windscreen of the subscriber's car identifies it. The barrier opens and the customer drives up to a mark. The dashboard screen and external monitors then give instructions to select Neutral and turn off the ignition.The remaining process is fully automated, similar to going through a car wash, so the driver never has to leave the car. In just a few minutes, a robot beneath the car removes the depleted battery and replaces it with a full one. Once <b>complete,</b> <b>instruction</b> is given to restart the car and an exit barrier lifts.|$|E
