40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{evaluate}} the perfor-mance of a <b>continuous</b> media <b>delivery</b> technique, called threshold-based multicast. Similar to patching, threshold-based multicast allows two clients that request the same video to share a channel without having to delay the earlier request. It ensures sharing by permitting the client with the later arrival time to join an ongoing multicast session initiated for the earlier request. However, threshold-based multicast does not allow a later arriving client to always join an ongoing multicast session. If it has been some time since the ongoing multicast session was started, a new multicast session is initiated. That is, a threshold is used to control the fre-quency at which new multicast sessions are started. We derive the optimal threshold that minimizes the server bandwidth required. Our analytical result shows that threshold-based multicast signifi-cantly reduces the server bandwidth requirement. Furthermore, we perform a simulation study demonstrating the performance gain of <b>continuous</b> media <b>delivery</b> by threshold-based multicast.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Continuous</b> dopaminergic <b>delivery</b> is {{recognized}} for {{the capacity to}} ameliorate symptoms in Parkinson’s dis-ease (PD). In advanced PD the short comings of orally administered Levodopa/Carbidopa include fluctuations resulting in unstable effect and dyskinesia. Levodopa/Carbidopa intestinal gel, LCIG, (Duodopa®, Abbott Laboratories) is delivered continuously through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with the inner tube placed in the duodenum {{by means of a}} device (CADD legacy Duodopa pump (CE 0473)). The therapy implies <b>continuous</b> dopaminergic <b>delivery</b> directly to the duodenum and is therefore unaffected by gastric emptying and represents a major adjuvant in the treatment of advanced PD with significant improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms. The aim {{of this paper is to}} suggest the prerequisites for a LCIG clinic and propose a feasible set-up and lean organization of a movement disorder clinic. Secondly, the paper proposes practical handling of patients in LCIG treatment for advanced PD based on experience and initiation of LCIG treatment and follow-up in forty patients...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} designing rack storage systems managed according to a Last-In Fist-Out (LIFO) policy. The system is supposed to house a number of cyclic items (i. e. characterized by batch production and <b>continuous</b> <b>deliveries</b> policies). This kind of behaviour is common for high-consumption products in the food industry, such as pasta and bakery products. The aim {{of the study is}} to define a static design solution by assigning each item to a number of LIFO racks so that the overall system performance results are satisfactory. The dynamic behaviour is kept under control by adopting automated material handling devices such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). This paper is an extension of a previous work by Ferrara et al. (2011), here named the single-allocation procedure, by allowing each item to be assigned to two different rack typologies (double-allocation solution). The convenience of the double-allocation solution in comparison with the single-allocation one is proven by a significant case study from the food industry...|$|R

50|$|Among notable {{corporate}} {{examples of}} Lean IT adopters is UK-based grocer Tesco, which has entered into strategic partnerships {{with many of}} its suppliers, including Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Coca-Cola, eventually succeeding in replacing weekly shipments with <b>continuous</b> <b>deliveries</b> throughout the day. By moving to eliminate stock from either {{the back of the}} store or in high-bay storage, Tesco has gotten markedly closer to a just-in-time pull system (see Pull/demand system).Lean IT is also attracting public-sector interest, in-keeping with the waste-reduction aims of the lean government movement. One example is the City of Cape Coral, Florida, where several departments have deployed lean IT. The city’s police records department, for instance, reviewed its processing of some 20,000 traffic tickets written by police officers each year, halving the time for an officer to write a ticket and saving $2 million. Comparable benefits have been achieved in other departments such as public works, finance, fire, and parks and recreation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} to lower cholesterol. High doses of orally administered simvastatin {{has previously been}} shown to improve fracture healing in a mouse femur fracture model. In this study, simvastatin was administered either subcutaneously or directly to the fracture area, {{with the goal of}} stimulating fracture repair at acceptable doses. Methods Femur fractures were produced in 70 mature male Balb-C mice and stabilized with marrow-nailing. Three experiments were performed. Firstly, 20 mice received subcutaneous injections of either simvastatin (20 mg) or vehicle. Secondly, 30 mice were divided into three groups of 10 mice receiving <b>continuous</b> subcutaneous <b>delivery</b> of the vehicle substance, the vehicle with 5 mg or with 10 mg of simvastatin per kg bodyweight per day. Finally, in 20 mice, a silicone tube was led from an osmotic mini-pump to the fracture area. In this way, 10 mice received an approximate local dose of simvastatin of 0. 1 mg per kg per day {{for the duration of the}} experiment and 10 mice received the vehicle compound. All treatments lasted until the end of the experiment. Bilateral femurs were harvested 14 days post-operative. Biomechanical tests were performed by way of three-point bending. Data was analysed with ANOVA, Scheffé's post-hoc test and Student's unpaired t-test. Results With daily simvastatin injections, no effects could be demonstrated for any of the parameters examined. <b>Continuous</b> systemic <b>delivery</b> resulted in a 160 % larger force at failure. <b>Continuous</b> local <b>delivery</b> of simvastatin resulted in a 170 % larger force at failure as well as a twofold larger energy uptake. Conclusion This study found a dramatic positive effect on biomechanical parameters of fracture healing by simvastatin treatment directly applied to the fracture area. </p...|$|R
