40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} the likely effects on global forests of a further reduction in wood products tariffs including both solid wood products and pulp and paper, as has been proposed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the Asia Pacific Economic Community (APEC). The tariff reductions would be an extension of the tariff reductions associated with the Uruguay Round (Federal Register 1999). The questions include both how international trade is likely to change in response to further tariff reduction and also the implications for timber harvests and forests generally of such trade liberalization in the various forest regions. The paper finds that the evidence suggests further reductions in tariffs on forest products are likely to generate only very modest increases in worldwide trade and production, and the increased harvest pressures on forests due to tariff reduction should be quite modest. The major countries likely to experience export and production increases are found largely in the northern hemisphere and are {{likely to be able to}} facilitate additional harvests with minimal effects on the forests due to the modest nature of the impact, new forest practices laws, new forest set-asides, and movement toward improved practices designed to achieve multifaceted sustainable forestry. Furthermore, there is little reason to expect that tariff reductions will significantly increase harvests from tropical forests. Earlier tariff reductions appear to have had minimal impacts on tropical harvests or exports. Nevertheless, tropical forests will remain under deforestation pressure due to land <b>conversion</b> <b>objectives,</b> commonly to provide additional agricultural lands. ...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), {{currently}} {{operating in}} the United States, is used for material testing at very high neutron fluxes. Powered with highly enriched uranium (HEU), the ATR has a maximum thermal power rating of 250 MWth. Because of the large test volumes located in high flux areas, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting HEU driven reactor cores to low-enriched uranium (LEU) cores. The present work investigates the optimized LEU Monolithic and Dispersed fuel with 10 B loading minimization design and evaluates the subsequent neutronics operating effects of these optimized fuel designs. The MCNP ATR 1 / 8 th core model was used to optimize the 235 U and minimize the 10 B loading in the LEU core, such that the differences in K-eff and heat flux profiles between the HEU and LEU cores were minimized. The fuel depletion methodology MCWO was used to calculate K eff versus effective full power days (EFPD) in this paper. The MCWO-calculated results for the optimized LEU Monolithic and Dispersed fuel cases demonstrated adequate excess reactivity such that the K-eff versus EFPD plot {{is similar to the}} ATR reference HEU case study. Each HEU fuel element contains 19 fuel plates with a fuel meat thickness of 0. 508 mm (20 mil). In this work, the proposed LEU Monolithic (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case with nominal fuel meat thickness of 0. 330 mm (13 mil) and 235 U enrichment of 19. 7 wt% is used to optimize the radial heat flux profile by varying the fuel meat thickness. The proposed LEU fuel meat varies from 0. 203 mm (8. 0 mil) to 0. 254 mm (10. 0 mil) at the inner four fuel plates (1 - 4) and outer four fuel plates (16 - 19). In addition, an optimized LEU dispersed (U 7 Mo) case with all the fuel meat thickness of 0. 635 mm (25 mil) was also proposed. Then, for both Monolithic and dispersed cases, a burnable absorber – 10 B, was added in the inner and outer plates to reduce the initial excess reactivity, and the higher to average ratio of the inner/outer heat flux more effectively. The final minimized 10 B loading for LEU case studies will have 0. 635 g in the LEU fuel meat at the inner 2 fuel plates (1 - 2) and outer 2 fuel plates (18 - 19), which can achieve peak to average ratios similar to those for the ATR reference HEU case study. The investigation of this paper shows the optimized LEU Monolithic (U- 10 Mo) and Dispersed (U 7 Mo) cases can all meet the LEU <b>conversion</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|E

Methods. We introduce a theoretical probabilistic model to estimate consumer behavioral intention and purchasing prospect on social networks, outline parameters that can be exploited to increase click-rate and conversion, and motivate a new strategy to market products online. The model explores increasing online stores’ sales conversion by utilizing a product collection landing page that is marketed to consumers through a single “Hook” image. To implement the model, we developed a novel technological method that enabled online stores to post different “Hook” images on social networks and hyperlink them to the product collection landing pages they created. Results. Stores and marketers developed four types of “Hook” images: themed-collaged product images, single product images, lifestyle images, and model images.

Two specific scenarios will be highlighted and discussed that motivated this research: The Interactive Electromechanical Necklace and the Wireless-Batteryless Electronic Sensors. The objective is to wirelessly gather energy from one RF source and convert it into usable DC power that is further applied to a set of low-power-demanding electronic circuits. This idea improves the accomplishments of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags systems. The RF-to-DC <b>conversion</b> <b>objective</b> is accomplished by designing and characterizing an element commonly known as a Rectenna, which consists of an antenna and an associated rectification circuitry. The rectenna is fully characterized in this dissertation and it is used for powering electronic lights, sounds, transmitters, and different types of sensors as well. The wireless power transmission system is presented in the first place with the development of a special set of wearable beads for an interactive necklace. These beads allow physical interaction between the necklace and electronic elements placed in the environment. This scenario demonstrates that passive electronics without batteries are possible. Next I also design and implement low-power sensors that will use the energy delivered from the rectennas to perform active tasks. The switching sensor provides visual/audio feedback to the user when there's a change {{in the state of the}} sensed object (i. e. LEDs lit when a stapler runs out of staples); the humidity sensor permits monitoring the humidity in the soil of a flower pot. The sensor actively transmits the information of any of two possible stages (dry soil/humid soil) to its environment. This scenario extends the capabilities of common RFID tags, where not only they transmit information but also can react to their environment in an active fashion. by Jorge Ulises Martinez Araiza.

40|$|CONTEXT: Abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) {{represents}} the superior treatment for apical pelvic organ prolapse (POP) but {{is associated with}} increased length of stay, analgesic requirement, and cost compared with transvaginal procedures. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) and robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RSC) may offer shorter postoperative recovery while maintaining equivalent rates of cure. OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the literature on LSC and RSC for clinical outcomes and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search of the available literature from 1966 to 2013 on LSC and RSC with a follow-up of at least 12 mo was performed. A total of 256 articles were screened, 69 articles selected, and outcomes from 26 presented. A review, not meta-analysis, was conducted due {{to the quality of}} the articles. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: LSC has become a mature technique with results from 11 patient series encompassing 1221 patients with a mean follow-up of 26 mo. Mean operative time was 124 min (range: 55 - 185) with a 3 % (range: 0 - 11 %) <b>conversion</b> rate. <b>Objective</b> cure was achieved in 91 % of patients, with similar satisfaction rates (92 %). Six patient series encompassing 363 patients treated with RSC with a mean follow-up of 28 mo have been reported. Mean operative time was 202 min (range: 161 - 288) with a 1 % (range: 0 - 4 %) <b>conversion</b> rate. <b>Objective</b> cure rate was 94 %, with a 95 % subjective success rate. Overall, early outcomes and complication rates for both LSC and RSC appeared comparable with open ASC.
