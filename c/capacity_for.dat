5|$|Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track {{is located}} at Hunderfossen. It had a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 10,000 spectators {{and is the only}} {{bobsleigh}} and luge track in the Nordic countries. Ice hockey was played at two venues: Håkon Hall in Lillehammer and Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gjøvik. Håkon Hall has a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 10,500 spectators, and also features the Norwegian Olympic Museum. The Cavern Hall is built as a man-made cave and had a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 5,300 spectators. Skating events took place at two venues in Hamar. Hamar Olympic Hall had a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 10,600 spectators and featured speed skating events, while figure skating and short track speed skating was held at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Alpine skiing was split between two ski resorts: Hafjell in Øyer and Kvitfjell in Ringebu. The former was used for the slalom and giant slalom, while the latter hosted downhill and super-G.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in late 1965, {{a number}} of B-52Ds {{underwent}} Big Belly modifications to increase bomb <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at 24 of 500lb (227kg) or 750lb (340kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from 27 to 84 for 500lb bombs, or from 27 to 42 for 750lb bombs. The modification created enough <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> a total of 60,000lb (27,215kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000lb (9,980kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours and included an aerial refueling by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, B-52s began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand so that refueling was not required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Urban {{landscape}} {{plants are}} {{an important component of}} the urban ecosystem, playing a significant role in the adsorption of airborne particulates and air purification. In this study, six common landscape plants in Beijing were chosen as research subjects, and the adsorption <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> each different plant leaf and the effects of the leaf structures <b>for</b> the adsorption <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> particulates were determined. Preliminary results show that needle-leaved tree species adsorbed more airborne particulates than broad-leaved tree species for the same leaf area. Pinus tabuliformis exhibits the highest adsorption capacity, at 3. 89 ± 0. 026 μg·cm− 2, almost two times as much as that of Populus tomentosa (2. 00 ± 0. 118 μg·cm− 2). The adsorption <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> PM 10 of the same tree species leaves, in different polluted regions had significant differences, and the adsorption <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> PM 10 of the tree species leaf beside the Fifth Ring Road were higher than those of the tree species leaves in the Botanical Garden, although the adsorption <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> PM 2. 5 of the same tree species in different polluted regions had no significant differences. By determining the soluble ion concentrations of the airborne particulates in two regions, it is suggested that the soluble ion concentrations of PM 10 in the atmosphere in the Botanical Garden and beside th...|$|R
