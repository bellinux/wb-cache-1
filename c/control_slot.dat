" This investigation served {{to determine the effect}} of the auto <b>control</b> <b>slot</b> on the properties and performances of airplanes at large angles of attack.

The main idea which actuated {{the research was}} to simulate a complex MAC Protocol in a wireless environment and espy its behavior under different physical, traffic, and network configurations. The TDMA protocol itself is completely custom and not based on any one particular industry specification. Our approach is ideal for exchanging data and control information in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) and wireless mesh networks so that resource needs (in terms of slot availability) of participating nodes can be rapidly accommodated for Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. The approach described in this paper allow an efficient resource allocation strategy such that each participating node can converge to a consistent TDMA <b>control</b> <b>slot</b> usage that is optimum for the topology and resource demand of a dynamic wireless network environment and then we further proceeded with capacity planning for such networks based on the optimum <b>control</b> <b>slot</b> usage...|$|E

40|$|The central aim of {{the paper}} is to apply and assess a {{nonlinear}} optimal control strategy to suppress bypass transition, due to bimodal interactions [T. A. Zaki and P. A. Durbin, “Mode interaction and the bypass route to transition,” J. Fluid Mech. 531, 85 (2005) ] in a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer. To this end, a Lagrange variational formulation is employed that results {{in a set of}} adjoint equations. The optimal wall actuation (blowing and suction from a <b>control</b> <b>slot)</b> is found by solving iteratively the nonlinear Navier-Stokes and the adjoint equations in a forward/backward loop using direct numerical simulation. The optimization is performed in a finite time horizon. Large values of optimization horizon result in the instability of the adjoint equations. The <b>control</b> <b>slot</b> is located exactly in the region of transition. The results show that the control is able to significantly reduce the objective function, which is defined as the spatial and temporal integral of the quadratic deviation from the Blasius profile plus a term that quantifies the control cost. The physical mechanism with which the actuation interacts with the flow field is investigated and analysed in relation to the objective function employed. Examination of the joint probability density function shows that the control velocity is correlated with the streamwise velocity in the near wall region but this correlation is reduced as time elapses. The spanwise averaged velocity is distorted by the control action, resulting in a significant reduction of the skin friction coefficient. Results are presented with and without zero-net mass flow constraint of the actuation velocity. The skin friction coefficient drops below the laminar value if there is no mass constraint; it remains however larger than laminar when this constraint is imposed. Results are also compared with uniform blowing using the same time-average velocity obtained from the nonlinear optimal algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A lot of {{development}} {{has been made in}} the area of sensorless speed measurement in Induction Motor (IM) where the tachometer is discarded and the speed is measured from the magnetic characteristics of the machine itself. In IM there are slots of the surface of the stator and rotor iron cores. When the rotor rotates, harmonics are produced in the air-gap flux that induces slot harmonic voltages in the stator windings. By measuring either the magnitude or frequency of the slot harmonics the rotor speed can be determined. A method of improving the performance of a system using the rotor slot harmonic technique is investigated. This involves the use of an empirical formula to estimate the rotor speed, based on current and frequency readings. This is used in the speed range where the rotor slot harmonics become difficult to detect. Key-Words:- Induction motor, sensorless <b>control,</b> <b>slot</b> harmonic...|$|E

The airfoil was a 20 percent thick ellipse, modified with circular {{leading and trailing edges}} of 4 percent radius, and had a 25. 4 cm constant chord.

Work, thus far, under the current NASA Research Announcement (NRA) project has revolved around an unstructured near-body volume mesh due to its robustness for complicated geometries. However, {{it has been found}} that this technique does a poor job capturing detailed flow features such as the boundary layer, shear layer, and wake of large velocity-gradient regions. Its hindrance is primarily due to the limitations of current computational resources, thus new techniques are investigated to improve the quallty of CFD solutions while not impeding on resources. High quality hybrid near-body volume meshes that combine structured and unstructured meshing have been utilized to meet the goals of the project.
