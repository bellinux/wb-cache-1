Orchidectomy caused involution of the above organs, and both MT mRNA and MT were considerably decreased or become undetectable. An injection of testosterone propionate into orchidectomized rats restored not only the size of these organs, but also MT mRNA and MT concentrations, particularly in the dorsolateral lobe and <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland.</b> In the dorsolateral lobe, no selective uptake of Zn 2 + preceding the increase in MT was observed, suggesting that Zn 2 + ions are not associated with the increased expression of the MT gene.

40|$|The {{comparative}} localisation of renin in the genital organs, {{especially in}} the <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> of male mice of the strains C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c, was investigated using immunocytochemical, immunoelectron microscopical and Northern blot techniques. Dot-like reactions for renin, of varying diameters, were detected immunocytochemically in the epithelial cells of <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, but not in those of Balb/c mice. In both strains, many electron dense granules differing in content and morphology were observed in the epithelial cells of the <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands.</b> Crystalline materials were sometimes contained in these granules. Colloidal gold particles indicating the presence of renin were detected in the electron dense granules of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, in which they showed a heterogeneous distribution and were especially located on the crystalline structure. No positive reaction was detected in these crystalline structures in Balb/c mice. Renin mRNA was detected in the <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> of both C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c mice by Northern blot analysis. However, the expression in C 57 BL/ 6 <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> was stronger than that in Balb/c.

40|$|Myométrial {{activity}} was analysed by video-laparoscopy in unmated and mated oestrous female rats. In the former, most contractions propagated caudally and were predominantly longitudinal, with circular contractions limited to weak peristalsis. Mating had dramatic effects on activity, inducing a high frequency of strong peristaltic and non-peristaltic circular contractions propagating both cranially and caudally. Activity remained elevated {{for up to}} 10 h, decreasing to control levels as uterine contents were lost when the vaginal plug disintegrated. Mechanical stimulation of the cervix, sufficient to induce pseudopregnancy, increased the frequency of weak peristalsis but did not induce myométrial activity comparable to that seen after mating. Treatment of mated females with indomethacin returned myo­métrial activity towards control levels, suggesting that myométrial stimulation involved prostanoid production. After mating to intact males the uterus took on a characteristic blue colour suggestive of hypoxia. This too was abolished by indomethacin treatment. Removal of accessory reproductive glands from males showed that induction of myométrial activity and the colour change both required constituents from the vas deferens, seminal vesicles and <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands.</b> Males lacking seminal vesicles or <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> were infertile. The prolonged myométrial activity and putative hypoxia induced by seminal constituents may be important in survival and selection of sperm...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{can lead}} to reproductive disorders that in turn result in weakened fertility brought about by morphofunctional changes in the testes and accessory sex glands. However, doubts persist concerning the basic biology of the secretory epithelial cells and the stroma of the <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> of diabetic mice. Thus, {{the objective of the}} present study was to analyze the histological and ultrastructural changes associated with stereology of the <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> of mice with alloxan-induced diabetes, and of spontaneously diabetic mice. Sixteen mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 J strain, and eight non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were used. The animals were divided into three groups: 1) control (C), 2) alloxan diabetic (AD), and 3) NOD. Thirty days after the detection of diabetic status in group 2, all of the animals were killed and then perfused with Karnovsky's solution through the left cardiac ventricle. The <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> was then removed and processed for morphometric study by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The results showed thickening of the stroma, atrophy of secretory epithelial cells, and disorganization of the organelles involved in the secretory process in both NOD and alloxan-induced mice.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{gossypol}} acetic acid on the prostate gland of the guinea pig was assessed ultrastructurally. The three lobes of the gland showed differences in sensitivity and reacted differently to gossypol treatment.

40|$|Summary. In a large {{percentage}} of male Schneider mice taken from breeding stock at approximately 1 year of age, the bladder was observed to be grossly distended with urine. The condition was attributable to urethral obstruction by secretory material originating in the vesicular and <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands.</b> The affected animals recovered spontaneously in a period of days, and subsequently proved fertile. Restriction of mating activity while the glands are secreting freely is thought to be the cause of this condition, which did not occur in females and younger males of the same stock nor in other rodents examined...|$|R

The ampullary gland secreted predominantly citric acid, sodium and acid phosphatase. Zinc was secreted only by the prostatic complex, with the largest quantity coming from the <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland.</b> The highest concentrations of potassium, calcium and magnesium were found in secretions of the ventral prostate.

Both lateral prostatic groups had a ductal-acinar organization. The adult structure of the other rat prostatic lobes was also ex-amined, and closely resembled their mouse counterparts. The ventral prostate, which had 2 - 3 paIrs of slender main ducts per side, and the <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland,</b> which had 1 main duct per side, was completely ductal in structure.

40|$|Male {{germ cells}} are unique because they lose a {{bulk of their}} {{cytoplasm}} as cytoplasmic droplets when they develop, leading to a decrease in endogenous antioxidant and hence a dependence on extracellular antioxidant system to overcome oxidative stress. Spermatozoa are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because their plasma membrane is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and membrane-bound NADPH oxidase. To protect spermatozoa from oxidative attack, an optimal amount of reactive oxygen species is maintained by balancing the reactive oxygen species generated during sperm maturation in the epididymidis and antioxidants in secretions of the male reproductive tract. The male accessory sex glands secretions {{have been shown to}} be the major source of antioxidant enzymes in the ejaculate and have the important function of preserving sperm DNA integrity from oxidative stress experienced in the uterine environment.

Amino acid analysis of the basic protein showed that the molecule {{is characterized by a}} high lysine and gluta-mate content, a low tryptophan and methionine content, and by the absence of proline, hydroxyproline, and cysteine.

An analysis of the washed coagulum formed by the acetone extract of Cowper’s gland secretion yielded an entirely similar amino acid pattern and molecular weight when the clotted protein was compared to substrate. In a series of experiments, the secretion of the <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> was shown to potentiate the coagulating reaction between Cowper’s gland secretion extract and the basic substrate from the seminal vesicles. It was concluded that (a) both Cowper’s and <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> secretion clot the same seminal vesicle substrate and (b) that this substrate is the basic protein fraction of seminal vesicle secretion. In the rat, a substrate extracted from the secretion of the seminal vesicles, which co-agulates under the action of vesiculase, an enzyme secreted by the coagulating glands, has been isolated and identified chemically as a basic protein (M#{ 225 }nyai, 1964).

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that DBI/ACBP transcripts were expressed in male accessory sex organs such as ventral prostate, dorsolateral prostate, seminal vesicles and <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands.</b> Castration caused a 1. 7 - to 2. 7 -fold reduction in the levels of DBI/ACBP transcripts {{over a period of}} 6 days.

In situ hybridization revealed that in the ventral prostate, DBI/ACBP transcripts were expressed predominantly in epithelial cells and that the observed effects of androgens were due both to modulation of gene expression per cell and to changes in cell composition. Androgen regulation of DBI/ACBP mRNA expression was also observed in the lacrimal glands, the adrenals, and the submandibular glands, but not in the liver and the kidney.

Fast atom bombardment mapping and automated Edman degradation experiments {{allowed us to}} verify that at least 85 % of the entire transglutaminase amino acid sequence is identical to that derived from the cDNA of the major androgen-dependent rat prostate protein called DP 1, The enzyme was found NH 2 terminally blocked and largely posttranslationally modified, since the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides, {{as well as of}} complex lipidic structures, was observed, Mass spectral analysis showed that Asn- 408 and - 488 are the glycosylated sites, the N-linked structures identified belonging to both high-mannose and complex type glycans. The presence of myo-inositol, of glycerol bound fatty acids, and the high content of mannose residues, are in agreement with previous observations suggesting, that a Lipid anchor is bound to <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> secretion transglutaminase, Furthermore, two tightly bound calcium ions per molecule of enzyme were detected, Finally, a strong stimulation of the enzyme activity in vitro by both SDS and a variety of phosphatidic acids was observed. The reported structural and functional peculiarities should definitively lead to consider She prostate enzyme as a new member (type IV) of the transglutaminase family...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} {{chemically}} induced male accessory sex gland tumors was studied in Lobund-Wistar rats. Rats were treated {{at the age}} of 3 months with a single intravenous injection of 30 mg N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) /kg body weight and given subcutaneous silastic implants filled with 40 mg testosterone propionate. Previous reports described a high incidence of prostate carcinomas in these rats with this treatment protocol. Additional animal groups included untreated controls, rats that received only an injection of 30 mg NMU/kg, and rats that were subjected to ablation of the seminal vesicle lobes prior to the treatment with NMU and testosterone. Three to 14 rats per group were sacrificed 4 to 10 months after NMU treatment and all remaining rats after 12 months. Twenty-four additional rats died or became moribund during the study. All rats were necropsied and the dorsolateral and ventral prostate and seminal vesicles with <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland</b> (anterior prostate) were examined histologically according to a standardized protocol. Lesions detected included atypical hyperplasia in all glands (resembling prostate intraepithelial neoplasia of human beings), adenomas in seminal vesicles only, and early carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in seminal vesicles and <b>coagulating</b> <b>gland.</b> Early carcinomas of the seminal vesicle, microscopically small and with invasion of the lamina propria and/or tunica muscularis, were detected as rapidly as 4 months after treatment. The vast majority (> 95 %) of the grossly visible nodules/masses originated from the seminal vesicles. Testosterone treatment enhanced occurrence an...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} anti-androgenic {{properties of}} xylopic acid (XA) and to elucidate the possible mech-anism of the antifertility activity of XA, XA {{was administered to}} orchidectomized rats following the Hershberger assay protocol. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were orchidectomized or sham oper-ated at 42 days of age. At 11 days post-castration the rats were weighed and assign to five treatment groups as follows; Group 1 received 0. 4 mg kg- 1 day- 1 of testosterone propionate (s. c.), group 2 re-ceived 0. 4 mg kg- 1 day- 1 of testosterone propionate (s. c.) plus 10 mg kg- 1 of XA orally, group 3 re-ceived 0. 4 mg kg- 1 day- 1 of testosterone propionate (s. c.) plus 30 mg kg- 1 of XA orally, group 4 re-ceived 0. 4 mg kg- 1 day- 1 of testosterone propionate (s. c.) plus 100 mg kg- 1 of XA orally, group 5 re-ceived only distilled water. The animals were treated daily for 10 days {{and the weight of}} the animals taken daily. On the day after the last treatment the rats were necropsied to isolate organs and tis-sues for study of androgenic or anti-androgenic effects. The endpoints evaluated were the growth/ body weight, and weight of the seminal vesicles plus <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> with fluid, ventral prostate, levator ani plus bulbocavernosus muscle, glans penis, Cowper’s glands (bulbourethral glands), and liver all without fixation. XA exhibited anti-androgenic activity by decreasing the weight of these androgen dependent organs...|$|R
40|$|The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has {{completed}} phase 1 of the Hershberger validation intended to identify in vivo activity of suspected androgens and anti-androgens. Seventeen laboratories from 7 countries participated in phase 1, and results were collated and {{evaluated by the}} OECD {{with the support of}} an international committee of experts. Five androgen-responsive tissues (ventral prostate, paired seminal vesicles and <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands,</b> levator ani and bulbocavernosus muscles, glans penis, and paired Cowper’s or bulbourethral glands) were evaluated. The standardized protocols used selected doses of a reference androgen, testosterone propionate (TP), and an antiandrogen, flutamide (FLU). All laboratories successfully detected TP-stimulated increases in androgen-responsive tissue weight and decreases in TP-stimulated tissue weights when FLU was co-administered. The standardized protocols performed well under a variety of conditions (e. g., strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding). There was good agreement among laboratories with regard to the TP doses inducing significant increases in tissue weights and the FLU doses decreasing TP-stimulated tissue weights. Several additional procedures (e. g., weighing of the dorsolateral prostate and fixation of tissues before weighing) and serum component measurements (e. g., luteinizing hormone) were also included by some laboratories to assess their potential utility. The results indicated that the OECD Hershberger protocol was robust, reproducible, and transferable across laboratories. Based on this phase 1 validation study, the protocols have been refined, and the next phase of the OECD validation program will test the protocol with selected doses of weak androgen agonists, androgen antagonists, a 5 α-reductase inhibitor, and chemicals having no androgenic activity...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that male accessory sex gland (ASG) secretions protect sperm genomic integrity by demonstrating that DNA damage was more extensive in sperm {{not exposed to}} the secretions. The present {{study was conducted to}} find out if ASGs secrete the main antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx or GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) and if the most abundant one, SOD, can protect those sperm that were not exposed to ASG secretions against NADPH-induced oxidative stress. Four experimental groups of male golden hamsters were used: intact animals with proven fertility, animals with all major ASGs removed (TX), animals that were bilaterally vasectomized, and sham-operated controls. SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were measured in secretions from all 5 ASGs and sperm-free uterine flushing from virgin females and those mated with the experimental males. The alkaline comet assay was used to analyze DNA integrity of the TX group sperm after incubation in a medium containing 50 U/mL of SOD along with 0 to 20 mmol/L NADPH. The main antioxidant enzyme in ASGs was SOD from <b>coagulating</b> <b>glands</b> (P. 05). Addition of SOD in vitro dose dependently decreased the incidence of single-strand DNA damage in sperm not exposed to ASG secretions incubated in the presence of 0 to 20 mmol/L NADPH (P <. 001). These results indicated that, in terms of abundance, SOD was the main antioxidant enzyme secreted by male ASGs, whereas CAT was the second one. The GPx activity came from both epididymis and ASGs. We conclude that ASG secretions {{play a significant role in}} protecting sperm against oxidative stress. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
