In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was [...] "turning a bit into Ken Barlow" [...] and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was [...] "still learning" [...] and did not take his role for granted. He stated, [...] "I’m not ignorant enough to think I <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> off and be a Hollywood star! I’d like to take on some more challenges for Darren".|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} films were highly praised {{due to their}} [...] tone. However, when {{director}} Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt [...] "Singer's sensitivity to [...] made the first two X-Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups." [...] James Berardinelli felt, [...] "X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as taut or satisfying as X-Men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original X-Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, {{there seems to be}} a single vision." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker praised [...] "the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work", but called Ratner's film [...] "a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes." [...] Singer's third film in the series, X-Men: Days of Future Past was also highly praised. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that [...] "Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down".|$|E

500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E

Hamilton stated, [...] "The Lab (FDA's studio) means so much to me, because when I literally didn't have anywhere else {{to go in the}} world, I <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> into my beloved alma mater and purge myself creatively." [...] The studio in the Frederick Douglass Academy is where most of Charles Hamilton's music is made. Hamilton has also stated, regarding FDA's studio, that [...] " [...] can do my thing in other studios. It's just something about home that makes my music breathe." [...] Hamilton attended Rice High School in Harlem, we're he would also participate in freestyle rap battles.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{more than}} I can tell. I must see first how the cargo {{is to be}} {{disposed}} of; after that, it will be time enough to concoct plans for the future.

5000|$|Buzo said {{making a}} telemovie was tough. [...] "It is so silent, {{it is like}} {{swimming}} underwater. When I saw the rough cut I was a bit shocked because the film medium seems unsubstantial compared to the stage... I think the stage is more malleable; if something doesn't work you can change it immediately.

[...] She noted, [...] "We’re starting small, but much chaos is promised." [...] Isabella Biedenharn gave the episode an A-, also commenting, [...] "So here we are, {{at the start of}} the final season. I’ll be honest, some days I didn’t think we’d ever get here."

6000|$|... "Oh! {{you mean}} the Deluge. Well, no doubt there was a deluge, but I am sure that Oro had no {{more to do with}} it than you or I, as I think I have said already. Anyhow it is {{impossible}} to leave you to descend into that hole alone. I suggest, therefore, that we should go into the sepulchre at the time which you believe Oro appointed, and see what happens.

When I get bigger, nobody will call my father names, I can tell you. I'll fight them if they do, yes, sir, I will. My father and I are going to stand by each other like bricks. Aunt Beatrice has lots of {{children}} of her own and I don't believe she'll be a bit sorry when I go away. She's ashamed of my father 'cause he did a bad thing. But I'm not, no, sir.

5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A and wrote, [...] "The climactic {{visit to the}} flower {{wholesalers}} market is a wonderful bit of Bob’s Burgers silliness, with a setup that feels simultaneously ridiculously and deeply plausible, if only because the whole thing works because all those flower sellers take the whole black-market carnation-selling thing so seriously. It even all culminates in the perfect little romantic note, as Bob and Linda admit they have been far too busy helping the kids to get anything for each other. But hey, they <b>can</b> always <b>just</b> <b>go</b> make out. And if that’s not a Valentine’s Day sentiment for all to get behind, I don’t know what is." [...] Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a positive review by saying, [...] "Those perks, coupled with the tiny advances in Gene's maturation and Tina's love life, made [...] "The Gene & Courtney Show" [...] another triumph in this series' already-strong repertoire of holiday material. And for what it's worth, after Gene pours his heart out to Courtney, he's also rewarded with a kiss — a strategically placed wrench in their story line." ...|$|R

5000|$|In this {{alternate}} reality, everyone remembers {{all their}} past lives; {{being able to}} remember past grudges, stressful times, and everyday problems from each life. To remember so much can drive anyone insane. And not only that, knowing that they <b>can</b> <b>just</b> die and <b>go</b> on, one can become lethargic and just kill themselves, so they can go on to another life. They want her to help them and others quit trying to avenge or yearn for joys {{from the past and}} make this life, the present life, much more desirable. They know she has a drive to help others.

6000|$|The {{old man was}} in a {{great state}} of {{distress}} about his other son, and {{early in the morning}} went to examine the ground where the fight had been. It was only too easily found; the sod was trampled down and branches broken as though a score of men had been engaged. Then he found his eldest son's cap, and a little farther away a sleeve of his coat; shreds and rags were numerous on the bramble bushes, and by and by he came on a pool of blood. [...] "They've kill 'n!" [...] he cried in despair, [...] "they've killed my poor boy!" [...] and straight to Rollston House he went to inquire, and was met by Harbutt himself, who came out limping, one boot on, the other foot bound up with rags, one arm in a sling and a cloth tied round his head. He was told that his son was alive and safe indoors and that he would be taken to Salisbury later in the day. [...] "His clothes be all torn to pieces," [...] added the keeper. [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> home at once and git him others before the constable comes to take him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good; let {{him come}} immediately, then. Tell him just the facts. If I am not mistaken, he will pooh-pooh the whole thing; tell you to keep quiet, not to worry, and so on. My dear fellow, if we realised, say, typhoid, who'd dare to face it? That will give us time; to wait a while, to recover our breath, {{to see what happens}} next. And if--as I don't believe for a moment--Why, in that case I heard the other day of a most {{excellent}} man--Grosser, of Wimpole Street; nerves. He would be absorbed. He'll bottle you in spirit, Lawford. We'll have him down quietly. You see? But there won't be any necessity. Oh no. By then light will have come. We shall remember. What I mean is this.' He crossed his legs and pushed out his lips. 'We are on quaky ground; and it's absolutely essential that you keep cool, and trust. I am yours, heart and soul--you know that. I own frankly, at first I was shaken. And I have, I confess, been very cunning. But first, faith, then evidence to bolster it up. The faith was absolute'--he placed one firm hand on Lawford's knee--'why, I cannot explain; but it was. The evidence is convincing. But there are others to think of. The shock, the incredibleness, the consequences; we must not scan too closely. Think WITH; never against: and bang go all the arguments. Your wife, poor dear, believes; but of course, of course, she is horribly--' he broke off; 'of course she is SHAKEN, you old simpleton! Time will heal all that. Time will wear out the mask. Time will tire out this detestable physical witchcraft. The mind, the self's the thing. Old fogey though I may seem for saying it--that must be kept unsmirched. We won't go wearily over the painful subject again. You told me last night, dear old friend, that you were absolutely alone at Widderstone. That is enough. But here we have visible facts, tangible effects, and {{there must have been a}} definite reason and a cause for them. I believe in the devil, in the Powers of Darkness, Lawford, as firmly as I believe he and they are powerless--in the long run. They--what shall we say?--have surrendered their intrinsicality. You <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> through evil, as you can go through a sewer, and come out on the other side too. A loathsome process too. But there--we are not speaking of any such monstrosities, and even if we were, you and I with God's help would just tire them out.

3000|$|The {{students}} also described {{several aspects of}} Studio STEM that they considered boring, with more responses concerning the presentations being boring than the activities. Two excerpts (3 %) explained that sometimes it was boring when the presentations or activities were difficult or confusing, suggesting a connection between success beliefs and perceived interest (e.g., “Solar cells are kind of confusing and the solar panel things are kind of confusing, and when I get confused, I get bored.”). Inversely, five additional responses (8 %) suggested that the presentations and activities were boring when the students felt like the material was reviewed too extensively (e.g., “Usually the stuff I already know [is boring] . [...]. [...]. and sometimes I just think, ‘I know all of this stuff, <b>can</b> we <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on?’”). Finally, several responses (11 %) indicated that some topics and tasks were boring. Most of the responses concerned the presentations (five out of seven responses; e.g., presentations about solar cells, electricity, voltage, current, motors and engines). One student attributed the problem to the instructional methods: “Sometimes it would get a little boring because they just didn’t explain {{it in a very}} exciting way, it was just very dull.” Further, two students said that an activity was boring (working on the computers and creating a device to lift a basket).|$|R

What’s so fun about the show at this point in its comedic evolution is that it can do an unabashed Belcher episode that also heavily features two of the show’s weirdest characters and two previously unseen people, one of whom is intentionally an incredibly boring non-entity, for all that Bob loves Steve so. At the end of the day, Bob’s Burgers <b>can</b> always <b>just</b> <b>go</b> back home to the Belcher household and get laughs from having the characters bounce off of one another, especially when Louise and Bob are making fools of themselves in pursuit of what they want and the other three family members are content to just wisecrack. Well, at least until Tina had her climactic filibuster at the end there. Never before has the show been so eloquent." [...] Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a positive review by saying, [...] "It was, overall, the best welcome-back present viewers could ask for from Bob's, a tried-and-true premise that traipses into hilarious new territory. Love is at the forefront and all of the show's other strengths (wordplay, slightly blue humor, and timing) serve as strong reinforcement pillars." ...|$|R
