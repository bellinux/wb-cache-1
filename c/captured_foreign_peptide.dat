40|$|SummaryT cell {{receptor}} (TCR) cross-reactivity between {{major histocompatibility complex}} II (MHCII) -binding self and <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> could influence the naive CD 4 + T cell repertoire and autoimmunity. We found that nonamer peptides that bind to the same MHCII molecule only need to share five amino acids to cross-react on the same TCR. This property was biologically relevant because systemic expression of a self peptide reduced {{the size of a}} naive cell population specific for a related <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide</b> by deletion of cells with cross-reactive TCRs. Reciprocally, an incompletely deleted naive T cell population specific for a tissue-restricted self peptide could be triggered by related microbial peptides to cause autoimmunity. Thus, TCR cross-reactivity between similar self and <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> can reduce the size of certain foreign peptide-specific T cell populations and might allow T cell populations specific for tissue-restricted self peptides to cause autoimmunity after infection...|$|R
40|$|The T cell αβ {{receptor}} (TCR) recognizes <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide</b> antigens {{bound to}} proteins encoded in the MHC. The MHC {{portion of this}} complex contributes much to the footprint of the TCR on the ligand, yet T cells are usually very specific for individual <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides.</b> Here, we show {{that the development of}} peptide-specific T cells is not intrinsic to thymocytes that undergo thymic-positive selection but is an outcome of eliminating, through negative selection, thymocytes bearing TCRs with extensive peptide cross-reactivity. Hence, thymic-negative selection imposes peptide specificity on the mature T cell repertoire...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{dissimilar}} {{sequence homology}} {{between self and}} <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide,</b> weak electrostatic interactions between <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide</b> and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges {{on the floor of}} peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between <b>foreign</b> and self <b>peptide</b> on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur {{in the absence of any}} true sequence homology.|$|R
40|$|Self {{peptides}} shape T-cell {{development through}} selectional {{processes in the}} thymus and secondary lymphoid organs to promote a diverse and balanced repertoire of conventional and regulatory T cells. Foreign proteins and their derivative peptides permeate our mucosal tissues to constitute another diverse array of peptides that may specify and diversify the mucosal T-cell repertoire. Indeed, the distinction between self <b>peptides</b> and environmental <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> may be academic if both are present constantly within the body. The premise {{here is that the}} plethora of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides,</b> present ubiquitously in our environment and body, form homeostatic niches to foster highly diversified repertoires of conventional and regulatory T cells that recognize persistent environmental peptides as self. Highly diversified repertoires that recognize myriads of self and environmental <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> as homeostatic ligands may be critical for adaptive distinctions of friend or foe in mucosal tissues. The change from our agrarian past to the highly sterile environments of today may adversely impact the diversity and concentrations of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> that shape the mucosal T-cell repertoire. Various hygiene hypotheses postulate that the lack of factors such as infectious pathogens, innate receptor engagement or Th 1 bias is key to the marked increase in immunological disease in modern society. In this version of the hygiene hypothesis, highly diverse constellations of innocuous environmental peptides are postulated to be the critical factor for immune balance and homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|A {{straightforward}} {{argument is}} presented to calculate the number of different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in an individual that maximizes the probability of mounting immune responses against {{a large number of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides.</b> It is assumed that increasing the number of MHC molecules per individual, n, has three different effects: (i) it increases the number of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> that can be presented; (ii) it increases the number of different T-cell receptors (TCRs) positively selected in the thymus; but (iii) it reduces the number of TCRs by negative selection. The mathematical analysis shows that n = 1 /f maximizes the number of different TCRs that pass through positive and negative selection and that n = 2 /f maximizes the probability to mount immune responses against a large fraction of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides.</b> Here f is the fraction of TCRs deleted by one MHC molecule. Both results depend on approximations that are discussed in the paper. The model presented has implications for our understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on the MHC...|$|R

Enforcing the restriction that T cells are activated by peptide antigens only when the antigens are bound to self-MHC molecules, MHC restriction adds another dimension to the specificity of T cell receptors so that an antigen is recognized only as peptide-MHC complexes.|$|R

40|$|Auto-vaccination is a {{procedure}} that recently attracted the interest {{of a growing number}} of investigators as an alternative to gene inactivation for functional studies of cytokines or other mediators. It is based on the observation that autologous cytokines cross-linked to a <b>foreign</b> protein or <b>peptide</b> are recognized by self-reactive B cells that present <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides,</b> and by doing so attract illicit help from helper T cells that recognize the <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide</b> on the self-reactive B cell MHC Class II complex.

Here, we summarize the different techniques that were successful in breaking this self-tolerance and provide several examples of the functional consequences of these auto-vaccines. An additional output of auto-vaccination is the production of mouse monoclonal antibodies against mouse factors. Such antibodies have obvious advantages for long-term use in vivo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractExpression of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> on {{the surface}} of cowpea mosaic virus {{particles}} leads to the creation of chimaeras with a variety of phenotypes and yields. Two factors were shown to be particularly significant in determining the properties of a given chimaera: the length of the inserted sequence and its isoelectric point. The deleterious effect of high isoelectric point on the ability of chimeras to produce a systemic infection occurs irrespective of the site of insertion of the peptide. Ultrastructural analysis of tissue infected with chimaeras with different phenotypes showed that all produced particles with a tendency to aggregate, irrespective of the size or isoelectric point of the insert. Host range and transmission studies revealed that the expression of a <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide</b> did not (1) alter the virus host range, (2) increase the rate of transmission by beetles or through seed, or (3) change the insect vector specificity.

40|$|During T cell development, thymocytes {{which are}} {{tolerant}} to self-peptides but reactive to <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> are selected. The current model for thymocyte selection proposes that self-peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes that bind the T cell receptor with low affinity will promote positive selection while {{those with high}} affinity will result in negative selection. Upon thymocyte maturation, such low affinity self-peptide–MHC ligands no longer provoke a response, but <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> can incidentally be high affinity ligands and can therefore stimulate T cells. For this model to work, thymocytes must {{be more sensitive to}} ligand than mature T cells. Contrary to this expectation, several groups have shown that thymocytes are less responsive than mature T cells to anti-T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) /CD 3 mAb stimulation. Additionally, the lower TCR levels on thymocytes, compared with T cells, would potentially correlate with decreased thymocyte sensitivity. Here we compared preselection thymocytes and mature T cells for early activation events in response to peptide–MHC ligands. Remarkably, the preselection thymocytes were more responsive than mature T cells when stimulated with low affinity peptide variants, while both populations responded equally well to the antigenic peptide. This directly demonstrates the increased sensitivity of thymocytes compare...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPositive {{selection}} to self-MHC/peptide complexes {{has long been}} viewed as a device for skewing the T cell repertoire toward recognition of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> presented by self-MHC molecules. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative possibility, namely, that the self-peptides controlling positive selection in the thymus serve to maintain the longevity of mature T cells in the periphery.

40|$|Binding of the T cell antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) to peptides presented on molecules encoded by {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) genes is the key event driving T cell development and activation. Selection of the T cell repertoire in the thymus involves two steps. First, positive selection promotes the survival of cells binding thymic self-MHC}peptide complexes with su$cient a$nity. The resulting repertoire is self-MHC restricted: it recognizes <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> presented on self, but not foreign MHC. Second, negative selection deletes cells which may be potentially harmful because their receptors interact with self-MHC}peptide complexes with too high an a$nity. The mature repertoire is also highly alloreactive: a large fraction of T cells respond to tissues harboring foreign MHC. We derive mathematical expressions giving the frequency of alloreactivity, the level of self-MHC restriction, and the fraction of the repertoire activated by a <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide,</b> {{as a function of}} the parameters driving the generation and selection of the repertoire: self-MHC and self-peptide diversity, the stringencies of positive and negative selection, and the number of peptide and MHC polymorphic residues that contribute to T cell receptor binding.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of foreign epitopes by a replicating nonpathogenic avian {{infectious bursal disease}} virus (IBDV) was explored. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify regions in the IBDV genome that are amenable to the introduction of a sequence encoding a <b>foreign</b> <b>peptide.</b> By using a cDNA-based reverse genetics system, insertions or substitutions of sequences encoding epitope tags (FLAG, c-Myc, or hepatitis C virus epitopes) were engineered in the open reading frames of a nonstructural protein (VP 5) and the capsid protein (VP 2). Attempts were also made to generate recombinant IBDV that displayed foreign epitopes in the exposed loops (PBC and PHI) of the VP 2 trimer. We successfully recovered recombinant IBDVs expressing c-Myc and two different virus-neutralizing epitopes of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoprotein E in the VP 5 region. Western blot analyses with anti-c-Myc and anti-HCV antibodies provided positive identification of both the c-Myc and HCV epitopes that were fused to the N terminus of VP 5. Genetic analysis showed that the recombinants carrying the c-Myc/HCV epitopes maintained the foreign gene sequences and were stable after several passages in Vero and 293 T cells.

40|$|Strains of Caulobacter crescentus {{elaborate}} an S-layer, {{a two-dimensional}} protein latticework which covers the cell surface. The S-layer protein (RsaA) is secreted by a type I mechanism (relying on a C-terminal signal) and is unusual among type I secreted proteins because {{high levels of}} protein are produced continuously. In efforts to adapt the S-layer for display of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> and proteins, we noted a proteolytic activity that affected S-layer monomers with foreign inserts. The cleavage was precise, resulting in fragments with an unambiguous N-terminal sequence. We developed an assay to screen for loss of this activity (i. e., presentation of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> without degradation), using transposon and traditional mutagenesis. A metalloprotease gene designated sap (S-layer-associated protease) was identified which could complement the protease-negative mutants. The N-terminal half of Sap possessed significant similarity to other type I secreted proteases (e. g., alkaline protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), including the characteristic RTX repeat sequences, but the C-terminal half which normally includes the type I secretion signal exhibited no such similarity. Instead, there was a region of significant similarity to the N-terminal region of RsaA. We hypothesize that Sap evolved by combining the catalytic portion of a type I secreted protease with an S-layer-like protein, perhaps to associate with nascent S-layer monomers to “scan” for modifications...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{assemblies}} with a {{high degree}} of repetitiveness and organization are known to induce strong immune responses. For that reason they have been postulated for the design of subunit vaccines by means of protein engineering. The enzyme lumazine synthase from Brucella spp. (BLS) is highly immunogenic, presumably owing to its homodecameric arrangement and remarkable thermodynamic stability. Structural analysis has shown that it is possible to insert <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides</b> at the ten amino terminus of BLS without disrupting its general folding. These peptides would be displayed to the immune system in a highly symmetric three-dimensional array. In the present work, BLS has been used as a protein carrier of <b>foreign</b> <b>peptides.</b> We have established a modular system to produce chimeric proteins decorated with ten copies of a desired peptide as long as 27 residues and have shown that their folding and stability is similar to that of the wild-type protein.

Moreover, the reassembly of mixtures of chimeras at different steps of the unfolding process was used to control the stoichiometry and spatial arrangement for the simultaneous display of different peptides on BLS. This strategy would be useful for vaccine development and other biomedical applications. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
