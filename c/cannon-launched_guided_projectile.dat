50|$|<b>Cannon-{{launched}}</b> <b>guided</b> <b>projectiles</b> are precision-guided munitions {{launched by}} conventional tube artillery and guns. Cannon Launched <b>Guided</b> <b>Projectiles</b> {{commonly referred to}} by the abbreviation CLGP are intended to supplement and not supplant conventional rounds, providing additional accuracy when needed.|$|R
50|$|Technology of {{the guns}} {{themselves}} has {{had only a few}} innovations. Throughout the history of tank guns, they have almost exclusively been rifled weapons, however most modern tanks now use smoothbore guns. Rifling of the barrel imparts spin on the projectile, improving ballistic accuracy. The best traditional antitank weapons have been kinetic energy rounds, whose penetrating power and accuracy decrease with range. For longer ranges high explosive anti-tank rounds are more effective, but accuracy is limited; for extremely long ranges <b>cannon-launched</b> <b>guided</b> <b>projectiles</b> (CLGPs) are considered more accurate.|$|R
5000|$|... 155mm has {{not found}} {{widespread}} use among naval forces despite its ubiquity on land, with most NATO and aligned navies using 76 mm (3"), 100 mm (3.9"), 113 mm (4.5"), or 127 mm (5") guns on modern warships. At {{one point the}} British Ministry of Defence studied [...] "up-gunning" [...] the Royal Navy's 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun to give increased firepower and a common calibre between the Royal Navy and the British Army. However, despite superficially appearing to be superior due to a comparison of round diameters, when firing conventional ammunition the smaller 4.5" [...] naval gun {{is comparable to the}} standard 155 mm gun-howitzer of the British Army. The standard shell from a 4.5" [...] naval gun has the same, if not better, range and carries twice the HE payload of a standard 155 mm round; only by using rocket-assisted projectiles (RAP) can most 155 mm guns better the range of the 4.5", doing so by sacrificing payload. This is because naval guns can be built much more strongly than land based self propelled gun-howitzers, and have much longer barrels in relation to calibre (for example the Mark 8 has a barrel length of 55 calibres, while the standard AS-90 self propelled gun has a barrel length of 39 calibres). This allows naval guns to fire heavier shells in comparison to shell diameter and to use larger propellant charges in relation to shell weight leading to greater projectile velocities. In addition, even without active cooling, the heavier naval gun barrels allow for a superior sustained rate of fire compared to field guns, and this is exploited with an autoloading system with a capacity of several hundred rounds. The 155 mm is superior to the 4.5" [...] in relation to <b>cannon-launched</b> <b>guided</b> <b>projectiles</b> (CLGP); because the 155 mm round is fired at a lower velocity it is much easier for their internal electronic guidance systems to survive being fired.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} of the electronic components inside a <b>guided</b> <b>projectile</b> is highly affected by the launch dynamics of <b>guided</b> <b>projectile.</b> The engraving process {{plays a crucial role}} on determining the ballistic performance and projectile stability. This paper analyzes the dynamic response of a <b>guided</b> <b>projectile</b> during the engraving process. By considering the projectile center of gravity moving during the engraving process, a dynamics model is established with the coupling of interior ballistic equations. The results detail the stress situation of a <b>guided</b> <b>projectile</b> band during its engraving process. Meanwhile, the axial dynamic response of projectile in the several milliseconds following the engraving process is also researched. To further explore how the different performance of the engraving band can affect the dynamics of <b>guided</b> <b>projectile,</b> this paper focuses on these two aspects: (a) the effects caused by the different band geometry; and (b) the effects caused by different band materials. The time domain and frequency domain responses show that the dynamics of the projectile are quite sensitive to the engraving band width. A material with a small modulus of elasticity is more stable than one with a high modulus of elasticity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{estimate}} the flight attitude angles of <b>Guided</b> <b>Projectile</b> rapidly and accurately {{to realize the}} precise control, angular motion equations and MEMS gyroscope measurements were used to build the state equation and the measurement equationcombined withthe ballistic priori knowledge. Based on the unscented kalman filter for nonlinear system, an approach of estimating the attitude angles of <b>Guided</b> <b>Projectile</b> was proposed. Taking {{a certain type of}} <b>Guided</b> <b>Projectile</b> as an example, the data of triaxial angular velocities with the measurement noise was considered as the output signal of MEMS gyros, and considered the calculated ballistic data as the ballistic priori knowledge. Through the approach proposed in this paper, the above were used to obtain the estimates for attitude angles. The results indicate that, it’s feasible to obtain the attitude angles by angular motion equations and gyros. On account of the actual random noise signal of gyros, the accuracy of the estimated attitude angles can meet the requirement of trajectory control system for <b>Guided</b> <b>Projectile...</b>|$|R

50|$|Leading targets is the {{practice}} of aiming one's weapon ahead of the target so that the projectile will hit its mark.

50|$|On 9 May 2014, the U.S. Navy {{released}} {{a request for}} information (RFI) for a guided 127 mm (5-inch) round that could be fired from Mark 45 guns on Navy destroyers and cruisers.

This RFI comes six years after the cancellation of the Raytheon Extended Range Guided Munition. The shell must have at least double the range of unguided shells for missions including Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS)/Land Attack, and increasing anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities against fast attack craft (FAC) and fast inshore attack craft (FIAC); the main purpose is to destroy incoming small boats at a greater range with a proximity fuse airburst blast fragmentation warhead to spray shrapnel over swarms.
