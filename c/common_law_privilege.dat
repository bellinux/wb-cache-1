25|$|The states secrets {{privilege}} is a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> originating {{with the}} judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases {{going back to}} the 19th century but more recently highlighted in United States v. Reynolds. In the criminal area, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides a relevant model for alternatives to full disclosure of classified information which allow a prosecution to continue while affording a defendant his or her due process rights. The time is now ripe for such legislation in the civil arena; litigants and their counsel are confused and unsure as to how to proceed in cases where the government raises the privilege; the courts themselves are confronted with precedent going in many different directions as to the scope of their authority and the requirements exercising it.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the French Revolution was the abolition of privilege. This meant the removal of separate laws for different social classes (nobility, clergy, and ordinary people), instead subjecting everyone to the same <b>common</b> <b>law.</b> <b>Privileges</b> were abolished by the National Constituent Assembly on August 4, 1789.|$|R

50|$|Today, the {{majority}} of American states have construed their statutes of forcible entry, both penal and civil, {{in such a manner}} as to abrogate (i.e. abolish) the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> to use force in the recovery of possession of land.|$|E
50|$|Miller and Cooper, {{in their}} {{appeal to the}} appellate court pleaded several {{defenses}} including a First Amendment reporter’s <b>privilege</b> and a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> reporter’s <b>privilege.</b> The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and <b>common</b> <b>law</b> claims for <b>privilege.</b> The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending {{an appeal to the}} U.S. Supreme Court.|$|R

50|$|There is an {{absolute}} <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> for papers circulated among MPs by order of the House (Lake v. King (1667) 1 Saunders 131). This is extended to all papers published under the House's authority, and to correct copies by the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840. The Act also extends qualified privilege to extracts.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) {{has adopted}} the {{terminology}} 'client legal privilege', {{as opposed to}} 'legal professional privilege', {{on the basis that}} the privilege is held by the client and not the lawyer. 'Client legal privilege' is the terminology used in Commonwealth and state evidence statutes. However, the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> remains almost universally described by courts as being 'legal professional privilege'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{privilege}} for {{the most}} part {{is to be able to}} return the stolen goods by determining ownership. The shopkeeper may not force a confession. The shopkeeper's privilege does not include the power of search. [...] Some courts, however, have expanded this original <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> to also include the detention of criminal trespassers: [...] "the detention and removal of a criminal trespasser is an essential power of any shopkeeper or other property owner." ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{scholars}} want to codify {{the federal}} <b>law</b> of <b>privilege</b> but {{the history of}} the many governmental privileges suggests that converting <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privileges</b> to statutory form may not do much to reform <b>privilege</b> <b>law.</b> After restating the conventional view of privileges, the author argues that both Congress and the courts can claim legitimate power to control them. He next outlines the political economy of the government secrecy that the privileges aim to protect and provides an econometric model to explain why our socio-political structure fosters bureaucratic secrecy. The author then uses the notorious “Quackgate” case [Cheney v. U. S. District Court, 124 S. Ct. 2576 (2004) ] to illustrate how the secrecy-privilege system operates. The article concludes with thumbnail sketches of privilege cases to show that neither Congress nor the courts have the will to restrict government demands for privileged secrecy...|$|R

5000|$|Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board was a {{decision}} of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand concerning the right to silence and implied statutory repeal of the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination. The decision, about [...] "constitutional principles as well as eggs", is important because of an obiter dictum by New Zealand's pre-eminent judge, Justice Cooke, later Lord Cooke, {{on the relationship between}} the judiciary and Parliament. Cooke forcefully states that there are some parts of the common law so fundamental that courts will not enforce laws of Parliament that seek to abrogate them.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} presented {{was whether}} a university enjoys a special privilege, grounded {{either in the}} common law or the First Amendment, against disclosure of peer review materials {{that are relevant to}} charge or racial or sexual discrimination in tenure decisions. The University argued for recognition of a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> against disclosure of confidential peer review materials, and for a First Amendment right of academic freedom against disclosure of the documents. In either case, the University sought a requirement of judicial finding of particularized necessity of access, beyond showing of mere relevance, before peer review materials could be disclosed to the EEOC.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>law</b> shopkeeper's <b>privilege</b> {{has been}} {{superseded}} {{in most states}} by so-called shoplifting statutes, or merchant's statutes, that allow merchants, their employees, and their agents to detain suspected shoplifters for: the investigation of merchandise or property ownership, the recovery of unpurchased merchandise or property, and the summoning of a police officer.|$|R
25|$|In a January 31, 2014, {{letter to}} Reid Schar, {{general counsel for}} the {{legislative}} committee, Kevin Marino, the attorney for Stepien, said that he would not submit anything in response to their subpoena and requested its withdrawal, citing his client's Fifth Amendment right and New Jersey <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privileges</b> against self-incrimination, with regard to the criminal inquiry underway by the U.S. Attorney, and Fourth Amendment and New Jersey Constitution (Article I, paragraph 7) rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Wisniewski said the subpoena was perfectly sound, and that Schar would review the attorney's objections and consider the committee's legal options. Michael Critchley, the attorney for Kelly, submitted a letter that his client would not comply with the subpoena based on similar claims.|$|R

5000|$|A {{privilege}} is {{a certain}} entitlement to immunity granted by the state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. Land-titles and taxi medallions are pronounced examples of transferable privilege. These can be revoked in certain circumstances. In modern democratic states, a privilege is conditional and granted only after birth. By contrast, a right is an inherent, irrevocable entitlement held by all citizens or all human beings {{from the moment of}} birth. Various examples of old <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> still exist, to title deeds, for example. Etymologically, a privilege (privilegium) means a [...] "private law", or rule relating to a specific individual or institution.|$|E
50|$|The states secrets {{privilege}} is a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> originating {{with the}} judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases {{going back to}} the 19th century but more recently highlighted in United States v.

50|$|Using {{his article}} {{as a basis}} for {{protecting}} reporters’ sources, he persuaded other media companies, such as Time, NBC, CBS, and The Washington Post to refuse to comply with government subpoenas. He argued using the power of contempt to resist requests for sources would cause state and federal courts, as well as state legislatures, to recognize a qualified reporters’ privilege. This strategy succeeded, as over 1000 reporters privilege cases have been brought before state and federal court since his Hastings Law Review article, while only two or three were brought before. As of 2013, thirty nine states and the District of Columbia have some form of a reporter’s shield law, ten other states have a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege,</b> and most federal circuits recognize a reporter's privilege as well—many using the language proposed in Goodale’s law review article.|$|E
50|$|The Federal {{prosecutor}} {{argued that}} Wolf {{does not meet}} the statutory definition of a journalist (under California <b>law)</b> or a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> journalist's <b>privilege</b> based on the Federal Rules of Evidence. Further, they argued that even if he did, the protections afforded to journalists would not cover his activities in this case because he merely observed the incidents he recorded in a public place. He did not prompt them, nor did he offer anyone anonymity or confidentiality.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions of the United States, {{the courts}} {{recognize}} a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> shopkeeper's <b>privilege,</b> under which a shopkeeper {{is allowed to}} detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time, {{so long as the}} shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>common</b> <b>law,</b> public-interest <b>privilege</b> {{prevents}} the compulsory disclosure of documents or information which {{is against the}} public interest. There is a balance between public interests- if the public interest in secrecy {{is greater than the}} public interest in disclosure, it will be privileged. The public interest in disclosure is the principle that a court of justice ought not be denied access to relevant information, and that the opposing party should have access to all relevant information to make their case.|$|R
50|$|The {{privilege}} to detain, although recognized in many jurisdictions, {{is not as}} broad as a police officer's {{privilege to}} arrest. If the shopkeeper exceeds the bounds of this privilege and makes an arrest, the lawfulness of his action {{will be determined by}} the jurisdiction's rules governing arrest by a private citizen. The shopkeeper's privilege is for the purpose of investigation only; if, after reasonable detention and investigation, the shopkeeper mistakenly concludes that the suspect is guilty and has him arrested, he presumably becomes liable for these acts just as he would have been had he committed them without undertaking a prior detention and investigation. Statutes in many states have broadened the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> by expressly permitting detention of the suspect until the police arrive. In other cases, case precedent has provided shopkeepers with similar tools. The practical effect of these extensions is to give the shopkeeper the same privilege as a police officer to make an arrest on reasonable grounds.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015, {{shortly after}} leaving office, Flowers and the Archives of The Honorable Chip Flowers, Jr. (the Archives) filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Office of Governor Jack Markell seeking all {{electronic}} and other correspondence from Governor Markell and his cabinet officials involving Flowers, the Cash Management Policy Board, Flowers' former Deputy State Treasurer Erika MacZuba Benner (Erika Benner) and Flowers' primary opponent, Sean Barney (who worked for Governor Markell) during the Flowers' term. [...] Governor Markell denied providing the documents to Flowers and the Archives claiming <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege,</b> executive privilege and legislative privilege and only provided Flowers and the Archives press clippings {{given to the}} Governor by his Press Secretary during Flowers' term. [...] In September 2015, the legal team for Flowers and the Archives appealed to the Office of the Attorney General, providing specific evidence that Governor Markell and his administration had failed to provide key correspondence not subject to privilege.|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of the privilege against self-incrimination - the guaranty that no person 2 ̆ 2 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself 2 ̆ 2 - was a landmark event {{in the history of}} Anglo-American criminal procedure. Prior historical scholarship has located the origins of the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century, as part of the aftermath of the constitutional struggles that resulted in the abolition of the courts of Star Chamber and High Commission. This essay explains that the true origins of the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>privilege</b> are to be found not in the high politics of the English revolutions, but in the rise of adversary criminal procedure at the end of the eighteenth century. The privilege against self-incrimination at common law was the work of defense counsel...|$|E
50|$|Legislators in {{countries}} using the Westminster system, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, are protected from civil action for slander and libel by parliamentary immunity whilst {{they are in the}} House. This protection is part of the privileges afforded the Houses of Parliament under the <b>Common</b> <b>Law</b> (parliamentary <b>privilege).</b> Parliamentary immunity from criminal prosecution is not enjoyed by Members of Parliament under the Westminster system. This lack of criminal immunity is derived from the key tenet of the British Constitution that all are equal before the law.|$|R

5000|$|The Court {{found that}} the University {{did not meet the}} high burden needed to create a new <b>common</b> <b>law</b> evidentiary <b>{{privilege}},</b> as the privilege sought did not promote sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence. The Court was satisfied that Congress, in granting power to the EEOC, considered academic freedom and declined to carve out an evidentiary privilege for it. And that, while [...] "confidentiality is important to the proper function of the peer review process," [...] the [...] "costs associated with racial and sexual discrimination in institutions of higher learning are very substantial." ...|$|R
