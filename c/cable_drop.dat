5000|$|Cable Internet {{provides}} access using a {{cable modem}} on hybrid fiber coaxial wiring originally developed to carry television signals. Either fiber-optic or coaxial copper cable may connect a node to a customer's location at a connection known as a <b>cable</b> <b>drop.</b> In {{a cable modem}} termination system, all nodes for cable subscribers in a neighborhood connect to a cable company's central office, known as the [...] "head end."

50|$|Post Spacing: Intermediate posts are posts {{which provide}} {{mounting}} {{for the top}} rail and have a vertical row of holes to support the cable as it passes through them. Since the post to post spacing is a primary driver of cable rigidity, the post to post spacing is very important. It is generally recommended that post spacing {{be no more than}} 5 ft on center Some manufacturers require as little as no more than 3 ft on center. The reason for post spacing is more about the cable end fittings' machine thread loading capacity (how much tension can be put on the threads before they fail), than anything else. The more <b>cable</b> <b>drop</b> in the middle, the more weight on the tensioning device, ergo the more load on the threads. Proof strength must be greater than load.|$|E
