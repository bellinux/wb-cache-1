40|$|Reliable {{strength}} {{assessment of}} the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system under the sloshing impact load is very difficult task due {{to the complexity of}} the physics involved in, both in terms of the hydrodynamics and structural mechanics. Out of all those complexities, the proper selection of the design sloshing load which is applied to the structural model of the LNG <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system, {{is one of the most}} challenging one due to its inherent randomness as well as the statistical analysis which is tightly linked to the design sloshing load selection. In this study, the response based strength assessment procedure of LNG <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system has been developed and proposed as an alternative design methodology. Sloshing pressure time history, measured from the model test, is decomposed into wavelet basis function targeting the minimization of the number of the basis function together with the maximization of the numerical efficiency. Then the response of the structure is obtained using the finite element method under each wavelet basis function of different scale. Finally, the response of the structure under entire sloshing impact time history is rapidly calculated by synthesizing the structural response under wavelet basis function. Through this analysis, more realistic response of the system under sloshing impact pressure can be obtained without missing the details of pressure time history such as rising pattern, oscillation due to air entrapment and decay pattern and so on. The strength {{assessment of the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system is then performed based on the statistical analysis of the stress peaks selected out of the obtained stress time history...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{vaporizing}} flow of {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) through porous or penetrable media has received very little attention despite its importance in assessing the performance and risk-based safety of large membrane tank LNG ships under barrier leakages. In this work, a fluid flow model is proposed and used to analyse the vaporizing flow behaviour of LNG through soil and glass wool porous materials. Furthermore, a modified vaporizing liquid pool model is implemented and {{used to examine the}} problem of vaporizing LNG pool on non-penetrable solid substrates. We employed an explicit, finite difference and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithms coded in FORTRAN to respectively solve the flow and pool models. Both models were successfully verified and validated by comparisons to experimental data, analytical solutions, and to predictions of a commercial software (TOUGH 2). Results from the vaporizing flow and pool analyses demonstrate that, for some of the applications considered, the liquid is expected to reach considered threshold depths, seep through the porous layer and contact, contaminate and/or embrittle surrounding natural or engineered systems. For the specific application to LNG <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> systems (or cargo tanks), this work has shown that there are safety risks associated with LNG leakage, which are ultra-low temperature of the inner hull, cryogenic damage and subsequent failure of the <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system. Thus, for any LNG membrane <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system to continue to be safe and secure, the various structural members of the insulation system should be designed and equipped with new and improved materials that possesses the necessary mechanical and thermophysical properties to maintain and/or improve the critical temperature standard and low-temperature performance of these systems. Further work should consider additional experimental evidence in order to fully validate and establish that solution predictions by the proposed models are describing the actual physical effects.

40|$|AbstractLately, high {{production}} rate welding processes for Al alloys, {{which are used}} as LNG FPSO <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system material, {{have been developed to}} overcome the limit of installation and high rework rates. In particular, plasma-metal inert gas (MIG) hybrid (PMH) welding can be used to obtain a higher deposition rate and lower porosity, while facilitating a cleaning effect by preheating and post heating the wire and the base metal. However, an asymmetric undercut and a black-colored deposit are created on the surface of PMH weld in Al alloys. For controlling the surface defect formation, the wire feeding speed and nozzle diameter in the PMH weld was investigated through arc phenomena with high-speed imaging and metallurgical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Ship-ice {{interaction}} scenarios {{have been}} investigated for possible operation routes in Arctic areas and six scenarios were selected to study the structural response of <b>Cargo</b> <b>Containment</b> Systems (CCS) in both membrane and spherical types of LNG ships. For selected ship-ice interaction scenarios, ice loads and loading areas in the hull structure were determined based on the energy theory. For membrane-type LNG carriers, CCS is made of very different materials such as plywood, foam and mastic. A local FE model including the partial hull structure with one panel of individual CCS has been developed for analysis purposes. For Moss-type LNG carriers, the tank system consists of a spherical tank and a cylindrical supporting skirt structure. A local FE model including the partial hull structure with the skirt structure has also been developed for structural analysis. One critical loading location, where the ice load is applied t...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbstract This study {{proposed}} {{a concept of}} the cargo handling system to load the pressurized liquid CO 2 into the CO 2 carrier and to offload the cargo out of the carrier with the piston fluid in a controlled way. The carrier was designed to transport {{a large amount of}} the captured CO 2 in liquid phase. The <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system consisted of pressure vessels to withstand the elevated pressure condition. Employment of the piston fluid enabled the pressurized liquid CO 2 to enter and leave the cargo vessels without phase change or evaporation of the cargo. An increased loading and offloading rate seemed to cause generation of emulsion droplets in the interface of the piston liquid and the cargo. The droplets were separated into the cargo and the piston liquid by a conventional separator. Fresh water was considered excellent piston liquid since it was easily available and immiscible with the liquid CO 2. As the cargo temperature decreased, CO 2 gas was found to serve as the piston gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} of ship-iceberg impacts are increasing due to increasing production {{and due to}} more transportation routes near arctic areas. The {{first part of this}} thesis is an introduction to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and the LNG carriers, particularly LNG carriers with membrane type <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system. Some theory regarding the principles of Non Linear Finite Element Analysis (NLFEA) and ship-iceberg collision is briefly described. A detailed finite element model of the cargo tank is created. For Finite Element Modelling MSC Patran is used. Choice of element and element size is described. Boundary conditions are introduced to compensate for the non-analysed part of the structure. Two different iceberg models are included and the explicit NLFEA solver LS-DYNA is used for the integrated analysis. Seven different collision points are checked for the two different iceberg models. Deformation of the inner hull is explored and checked against design criteria. Figures and graphs are included to illustrate this. Accelerations, velocity and deflection is found for some critical nodes in inner and outer hull and checked for critical values. </p...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{polyurethane}} foam (RPUF) {{is one of}} the important materials of Mark III type insulation systems used in liquefied natural gas (LNG) <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> systems. However, RPUF is the most difficult material to use with regard to its safety assessment, because there is little public and reliable data on its mechanical proper-ties, and even some public data show relatively large differences. In this study, to investigate the structural response of the system under compressive loads such as sloshing ac-tion, time-dependent characteristics of RPUF were examined. A series of compressive load tests of the insulation system including RPUF under various temperature conditions was carried out using specimens with rectangular section. As a result, the relationship between deformation of RPUF and time is linear and dependent on the load-ing rate, so the concept of strain rate could be applied to the analysis of the insulation system. Also, we found that the spring constant tends to converge to a value as the loading rate increases and that the convergence level is dependent on temperature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the safety of}} two-row tank design by performing the extensive sloshing model tests. Owing to the uncertainties entangled with the scale law transforming the measured impact pressure up to the full scale one, so called comparative approach was taken to derive the design sloshing load. The target design vessel was chosen as 230  K LNG-FPSO with tow-row tank arrangement and the reference vessel as 138  K conventional LNG carrier, which has past track record without any significant failure due to sloshing loads. Starting with the site-specific metocean data, ship motion analysis was carried out with 3 D diffraction-radiation program, then the obtained ship motion data was used as 6 DOF tank excitation for subsequent sloshing model test and analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out with obtained peak data and the long-term sloshing load was determined out of it. It was concluded that the normalized sloshing impact pressure on 230  K LNG-FPSO with two-row tank arrangement is {{higher than that of}} convectional LNG carrier, hence requires the use of reinforced <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system for the sake of failure-free operation without filling limitation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} influence of raised invar edges on wet drop tests pressures. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the capabilities of the CFD software Open- FOAM ([6]) to deal with fluid structure impact problems in the context of sloshing inside membrane tanks. More precisely, the objective is to evaluate OpenFOAM capabilities for water drop tests simulations for a smooth wedge on one hand and a wedge equipped with invar edges (like these which equip the <b>Cargo</b> <b>Containment</b> System NO 96 produced by GTT) on the other hand, both falling into calm water without inclination. The obtained numerical results are then compared to Wagner's solution for the smooth wedge and to experimental measurements for the wedge with edges presented in ([2]). Numerical simulations are in very good agreement with Wagner's solution and experimental results ([2]) showing the OpenFOAM capability to deal with fluid structure impact problems in the context of sloshing inside membrane tanks. The agreement between numerical and experimental results confirms also that raised invar edges tend to enhance the magnitude of sloshing pressures. This confirmation emphasizes the importance of considering the physics of invar edge effects in defining the design pressure to be used in assessing the integrity of membrane LNG tanks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{stage of}} {{incompressible}} liquid impact onto a corrugated elastic panel with account for compressible gas trapping between the corrugations is studied. The liquid free surface is flat and {{parallel to the}} panel before impact. The impact velocity is constant in this study. The corrugations are modelled as identical rigid short structures {{on the surface of}} the flat panel. The panel is either of infinite or finite length. There are only two corrugations which are placed symmetrically on the panel. Only a part of the panel between these two corrugations is elastic. The liquid free surface closes the gas cavity between the two corrugations at the initial instant of impact and compresses the gas before the fluid comes in contact with the elastic part of the panel. The elastic deflections of the panel are caused by gas pressure in the cavity. The elastic deflections modify both the pressure in the cavity and the hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the wetted part of the panel. The hydroelastic problem is solved within the Wagner approach. The effect of gas compressibility on the elastic behaviour of the corrugated elastic panel is investigated. It is shown that the pressure in the gas cavity and elastic deflections grow beyond all bounds for the panel of infinite length and are finite if the panel is of finite length. The present model is relevant for the strength assessment of the <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system (CCS) in the tanks of LNG carriers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThree {{materials}} SUS 304, 9 % Ni {{steel and}} Al 5083 -O alloy, which are considered possible candidate for International Maritime Organization (IMO) type B <b>Cargo</b> <b>Containment</b> System, were studied. Monotonic tensile, fatigue, fatigue {{crack growth rate}} and Crack Tip Opening Displacement tests were carried out at room, intermediate low (- 100 °C) and cryogenic (- 163 °C) temperatures. The initial yield and tensile strengths of all materials tended to increase with decreasing temperature, whereas the change in elastic modulus was not as remarkable. The largest and smallest improvement ratio of the initial yield strengths due to a temperature reduction were observed in the SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy, respectively. The fatigue strengths of the three materials increased with decreasing temperature. The largest increase in fatigue strength was observed in the Al 5083 -O alloy, whereas the 9 % Ni steel sample showed the smallest increase. In the fatigue crack growth rate test, SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy showed {{a decrease in the}} crack propagation rate, due to decrease in temperature, but no visible improvement in da/dN was observed in the case of 9 % Ni steel. In the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) test, CTOD values were converted to critical crack length for the comparison with different thickness specimens. The critical crack length tended to decrease in the case of SUS 304 and increase for the Al 5083 -O alloy with decreasing temperature. In case of 9 % Ni steel, change of critical crack length was not observed due to temperature decrease. In addition, the changing material properties according to the temperature of the LNG tank were analyzed according to the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk (IGC code) and the rules of classifications...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is {{accidental}} iceberg collision with the bow shoulder area of a 150000 ton membrane-type LNG carrier. It is expected that the traffic of LNG-carriers will increase in the arctic areas {{in the years to}} come, and ice collisions are considered to be a real hazard. A finite element model of the ship side have been developed, where the area in question is the foremost tank of the ship. The collision point is assumed to be in the forward part of the tank, close to the collision bulkhead. However in the FE-analyses the collision point is moved to the centre of the tank, to avoid interference from the boundary conditions. A maximum size criterion for icebergs is used, where it is assumed that all icebergs with less than 2 meter sailing height are hazardous. This means that the ship is assumed to hit these iceberg at its cruising speed of 19. 5 knots. 2 meter sail height corresponds to 5 meter radius for a spherical iceberg. The steel material used is based on power-law formulations. This allows the material model to take into account increase in stress due to reduction in cross-section area. The ice material uses the elliptical Tsai-Wu yield surface. Elements are deleted when they violate the fracture criterion. The FE-analyses are carried out to find the critical energy levels. The analyses were done with spherically shaped icebergs, with radii of 1, 2, 5 and 10 meter. Failure of the ship structure is based on preventing the gas from leaking out due to fracture of the membranes in the <b>cargo</b> <b>containment</b> system. The criterion which is used is 700 mm deection of the inner hull {{in the middle of the}} tank. The internal energy for the ship structure when the failure criterion is reached is found to be approximately 70 MJ. The actual collision energy levels are found using a 3 D external mechanics model. The results indicate that the critical energy levels are not reached. The levels for 1 and 2 meter radius icebergs are negligible. For the 5 meter radius the level is 8 MJ, or 11 % of the critical value. For the 10 meter iceberg the margin is quite small, with 57 MJ or 81 % of critical value. The critical size is found to be 11 meter radius, although it is very conservative since icebergs larger than 5 meter radius will probably be detected before impact. In previous studies of ship-iceberg impacts, inner hull accelerations are found to be very high, up to 2000 g. There has also been concern about accelerations causing problems far from the impact zone. The accelerations have been investigated on several location on the inner hull, and none show higher levels than 200 g. Displacements corresponding to these accelerations show no rapid jumps or fluctuations in the curves. This should indicate that the accelerations cause no serious problems for the membrane and are more of a numerical issue than a real life problem.  </p...|$|E
