500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was on the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies, and in the subsequent press conference. Button felt the win {{was the best of}} his career so far, and stated that he had to fight hard to win the race: [...] "It was really a fight. I got a drive-through for speeding behind the safety <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to fight my way through about three times. Eventually, on the last lap I was chasing down Seb. He ran a little bit wide onto the wet part of the circuit and I was able to take the opportunity and take the win." [...] Button also praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory, in particular the moves to intermediate tyres. Vettel expressed his disappointment of making a mistake on the final lap, after driving a faultless race up to that point. Nevertheless, he was happy with second place, as he had increased his championship lead. Webber said he was happy to finish third after his incident {{at the beginning of the}} race, putting his recovery from fourteenth place down to correct tyre choices.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in my <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E

That's what I thought when Lily first told me about his {{speaking}} {{to her in the}} <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was very much prejudiced against him; but when I saw him to-day, I must say that I felt that I had been wrong. He is a gentleman; but--he is desperate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't belong here," [...] was the answer. [...] "One of them lives {{down the}} beach and does some fishing with his boat. The other man {{came in from the}} South {{yesterday}} on the <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know what he's after. I told him I could put him on to a job and he said he didn't want it." ...|$|R

No doubt, it's a matter of prejudice, but I've been used to more room for taking my clothes off than they give you behind the {{flapping}} curtain." ...|$|R
2500|$|Growing up, Kripke {{connected}} to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This {{prompted him to}} include one in Supernatural. [...] "We say it's a modern American Western— two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show." ...|$|E

While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it. My speed was too high, I lost control, and crashed into a tree... And {{how did you get}} here?"

So I opened the door and stepped out..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June in {{a speech}} {{promoting}} the government's handling of the economy, Treasurer Peter Costello recalled the [...] of the 2004 election: [...] "This [...] is like a highly engineered racing <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> tell you what, I wouldn't be putting an L-plate driver in the cockpit at the moment". August 2007 saw, {{for the first time}} during an election campaign, a 0.25-point interest-rate rise to 6.5 per cent by the Reserve Bank, the sixth rise since the last election in 2004. Labor used the news to argue that the Coalition could not be trusted to keep interest rates low, while Costello argued that interest rates would be higher under Labor. In November 2007 interest rates were raised for the sixth time since the 2004 election, to a 10-year high of 6.75 per cent. In response to Labor criticism of the government on the rate rises, Howard stated in August 2007 [...] " [...] can scour every transcript, and I will make them available, of every interview that I gave during that election campaign and he will find no such commitment. [...] During October 2007 Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews's decision to cut Australia's refugee intake and expressing public concern about Sudanese migrants was branded as racist.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{incidents}} occurred {{following the}} lengthy cleanup. During the yellow for a spinout by rookie Richie Panch ABC Sports, which filmed {{the race for}} air later that year, recorded and aired radio conversation between Petty and crew chief Dale Inman about the incident; this caused commentator Chris Economaki to quip that [...] "I don't drive stock <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish Richard Petty wouldn't do expert commentary." ...|$|R

5000|$|His father, {{speaking}} {{of the fact that}} he has two sons playing in the National Football League, said: [...] "I just kvell." [...] His mother, commenting on having two sons play football, said: I started out worrying that they were going to get hurt—but then I realized it was the other players I should be worrying about. They were like trucks hitting small <b>cars.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> started to kind of feel like maybe this was their destiny.|$|R
2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. We got in the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E

6000|$|Cartwright smiled. [...] "It's {{plain that}} her escapade {{must not be}} talked about but we can trust these Canadians <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know Barbara. In a sense, Lister's {{narrative}} wasn't necessary. The girl is headstrong, but I was persuaded she would find the rascal out. Looks {{as if she did}} so soon after they got on board the <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> imagine Shillito had an awkward few moments; Barbara's temper is not mild. Then it's important that she was desperately anxious to escape from him. There's no more to be said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] He hoisted {{it on to}} the vehicle, {{which was}} a sort of <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.|$|R
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast <b>cars.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think he would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies <b>I</b> did. <b>And</b> my mother came, too." ...|$|R

[...] He signalled me to come forward with the <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> strove not to be privy to what followed; but I saw the girl's face, blotched and frozen with grief, and I felt the hand without a ring clutching at my knees when we moved away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{gave you}} a scare," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't mean to be so late, but those {{business}} matters took longer than <b>I</b> intended, <b>and</b> {{then there was a}} blockade of street <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to walk it. But we're all right now, I reckon," [...] he added, gazing around. [...] "Good-by to San Francisco! When we see her again may our pockets be lined with gold!" [...] And he took off his soft felt hat and waved it at the crowd on shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right. I'll go {{with you}} to the <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> must go to my desk for six hours of hard work. Put this behind you," [...] he said tenderly. [...] "It does no good to suffer over the inevitable. Forget those men!" ...|$|R

60|$|Hartman and I {{had breakfast}} {{together}} in the dining <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> forced myself to eat. The sky had clouded, and the train rushed on like a sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day. The very negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending. Oppression sat heavily upon them; the lightness of their natures had ebbed out of them; they were slack and absent-minded in their service, and they whispered gloomily {{to one another in}} {{the far end of the}} car next to the kitchen. Hartman was hopeless over the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "I {{could not}} do that. There were too many of them--they are too heavy, and there are piles of pamphlets--revolutionary pamphlets, I am afraid--all in French, which I do not understand. No, I could not bring them to you.

We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband.

60|$|Farrar and I are not imaginative; {{we did not}} {{picture to}} {{ourselves}} any particular type for the girl {{we were going to}} meet, we were simply doing our best to get to the station before the train. We jumped from the wagon and were watching the people file out of the <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> noticed that more than one paused to look back over their shoulders as they reached the door. Then came a maid with hand-bag and shawls, and after her a tall young lady. She stood for a moment holding her skirt above the grimy steps, with something of the stately pose which Richter has given his Queen Louise on the stairway, and the light of the reflector fell full upon her. She looked around expectantly, and recognizing Mrs. Cooke's maid, who had stepped forward to relieve hers of the shawls, Miss Thorn greeted her with a smile which greatly prepossessed us in her favor.|$|E

500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> decided right then that was what I wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|R
