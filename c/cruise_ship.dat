5|$|In 2004 the 36-year-old QE2 was {{replaced}} on the North Atlantic by Queen Mary 2. Caronia was sold and QE2 continued to cruise {{until she was}} retired in 2008. In 2007 Cunard added a large <b>cruise</b> <b>ship,</b> Queen Victoria. She is not a sister for the QM2, being ordered by Carnival as a Vista class <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> for the Holland America Line. To reinforce Cunard traditions, the QV has a small museum on board. Cunard commissioned a second Vista class <b>cruise</b> <b>ship,</b> Queen Elizabeth, in 2010.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> {{industry}} {{used to be}} {{the second-largest}} in California. Numerous cruise lines operate out of San Diego. However, <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> business has been in decline since 2008, when the Port hosted over 250 ship calls and more than 900,000 passengers. By 2011 the number of ship calls had fallen to 103 (estimated).|$|E
5|$|Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have {{traditionally}} been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk {{and the construction of}} a <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> terminal alongside the pier. Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.|$|E

5|$|The Glacier Bay {{has many}} branches, inlets, lagoons, islands, and {{channels}} that holds prospects for scientific exploration and visual treat. Thus, {{the area is}} popular as a <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> destination during summer season. However, there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships, 3 tour boats, 6 charter vessels, and 25 private vessels. According to National Park Service statistics for calendar year 2009, 444,653 people visited Glacier Bay, with 422,919 of those being <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> passengers.|$|E
5|$|The port {{also serves}} as a {{passenger}} <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> terminal for cruise ships operating in the Caribbean. The terminal was home port to two Carnival Cruise Lines vessels, the Carnival Conquest and the Carnival Ecstasy. In November 2011 the company made Galveston home port to its 3,960-passenger mega-ships Carnival Magic and Carnival Triumph, as well. Carnival Magic sails a seven-day Caribbean cruise from Galveston, and it is the largest <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> based at the Port year-round. Galveston is the home port to Royal Caribbean International's, MS Liberty of the Seas, which is the largest <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> ever based here and one of the largest ships in the world. In September 2012 Disney Cruise Line's Disney Magic also became based in Galveston, offering four-, six-, seven-, and eight-day cruises to the Caribbean and the Bahamas.|$|E

Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there.

Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|Although Carnival Cruise Lines did {{not operate}} from Mobile after the Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the Carnival Triumph was towed into the port {{following}} a crippling engine room fire. It {{was the largest}} <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> ever to dock at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the Carnival Conquest, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism {{as well as the}} film's setting on a slow-moving <b>cruise</b> <b>ship,</b> which was much less thrilling than Speed setting on a fast-moving bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million. It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, and won the award for Worst Re-Make or Sequel.|$|E

Some former ocean liners operate as <b>cruise</b> <b>ships,</b> such as Marco Polo. This number is diminishing. The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner of December 2013 is Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard fleet.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, managed to make landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls on Cuba and the U.S. states of Florida and North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> in open waters.|$|E
