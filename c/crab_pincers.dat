50|$|With {{precision}} and subtlety, Wetzel draws organic and vegetable forms {{at about the}} scale of cabbages and squashes, while emphasizing the prehensile aspect of vegetation. Tendrils and claws reach out to grapple in these imagined encounters {{in the land of}} chlorophyll. Just as vegetable claws resemble beatle sic and <b>crab</b> <b>pincers</b> in Wetzel's drawings, so flying seeds acquire monarch-butterfly and other insect wings. These drawings transmit the essence of a quiet, desperate struggle from existence.|$|E
40|$|Transgressive shallow-marine {{strata of}} the Súa Member are well exposed along the sea-cliffs of Súa (northwest Ecuador) {{and include a}} basal shellbed {{bracketed}} by a Glossifungites-demarcated ravinement surface produced in the upper shoreface by wave processes below and bioturbated lower shoreface deposits above. The shellbed, up to 70 cm thick, is largely dominated by mollusk remains but also includes <b>crab</b> <b>pincers,</b> solitary corals, bryozoans, fragments of echinoids and barnacles, selachian teeth and abundant fish otoliths. In cross-sectional view the bioclastic components are densely- or loosely-packed in the lower part and pass rapidly upward into a dispersed biofabric. Poorly-preserved specimens largely dominate the mollusk assemblage making it difficult taxa identification. Bivalves are mostly disarticulated and the rare conjoined specimens are preserved out of life position. Valves are randomly oriented even if the concave-up position seems to prevail in some places. Most specimens are fragmented and display signs of intense abrasion and bioerosion, whereas encrustation is very scarce. Visually, the fossil concentration appears {{to be dominated by}} Atrina cf. maura, Oliva cf. splendidula, Turritella abrupta and T. altilira, some of which are not present in the bulk samples within which the most abundant taxa include Anadara cf. reinharti, Ostrea iridescens, Undulostrea megodon, Polinices spp. and Turritella altilira. Some groups of species contrast for substrate preference so that taxa requiring hard substrata for support (O. iridescens, U. megodon, Chama pellucida, Crucibulum scutellatum, Serpulorbis sp.) coexist with soft-sediment loving taxa including seminfauna (A. cf. maura, scaphopods) and shallow infauna (Chione mariae, C. squamosa, Polinices hepaticus) whereas deep-infaunal elements are lacking. Known depth ranges of extant species lead us to infer a shoreface setting no more than 20 - 30 m in water depth. The fish otoliths are relatively well-preserved. Slightly less than 2000 specimens have been examined, among which representatives of 31 taxa belonging to 16 families have been recognized. The assemblage is dominated by six families (Batrachoididae, Congridae, Engraulidae, Ophidiidae, Paralichthyidae, Pleuronectidae), which include more than 95...|$|E

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{covered a}} period of three years (financed by AMS) and involved the chrono-strategraphic analysis of the artifacts, revealing that field's occupation {{during the course of a}} century. There were no indications that the spaces were occupied prior to this period. The excavations revealed a traditional indigenous architecture, using circular dwellings generally completed with a vestibule in the form of a <b>crab's</b> <b>pincer</b> and oblong-shaped barns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Mercury", {{directed}} by Ace Norton, was simultaneously unveiled {{along with the}} song. It portrays monkey scientists placing an assortment of body parts into a body. The resulting creature, which has a bull's horned head, a <b>crab's</b> <b>pincer,</b> and a hairy human body then rises in popularity, eventually becoming the President of the United States. The entire time, the scientists are controlling it. Eventually, the creature (named Smith) goes to war with other countries to get bananas for the monkey scientists. It was made available to view on Bloc Party's website.|$|R
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were referred}} to as [...] "Crabs". Several authors have claimed that this refers to the resemblance to a <b>crab's</b> <b>pincers</b> of the outside cylinders and valve motion. Another suggestion is that the nickname refers to the [...] "" [...] motion felt on the footplate when the engine is being worked hard, due largely to the inclined cylinders, producing a sensation that it is walking along the track. In some areas they also received the nickname [...] "frothblowers" [...] from their tendency to prime easily when the boiler was overfilled, or the feedwater contaminated.|$|R

50|$|Crabs {{are mostly}} active animals with complex {{behaviour}} patterns. They can communicate by drumming or waving their <b>pincers.</b> <b>Crabs</b> {{tend to be}} aggressive towards one another, and males often fight {{to gain access to}} females. On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes. Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and mating, and to defend against intruders.|$|R
5000|$|The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs {{official}} {{colors are}} Columbia blue, navy blue, and red. The primary logo depicts a navy blue crab outlined and detailed in khaki. The <b>crab</b> possesses red <b>pincers</b> and red eyes, with a scowl of determination. Centered above the crab is the [...] "Blue Crabs" [...] wordmark in white {{with the words}} [...] "Southern Maryland" [...] centered above in red. Columbia blue and red ribbon-like lines underline the wordmark. The entire logo is outlined in khaki.|$|R
5000|$|Some other {{intriguing}} {{attributes and}} behaviour of the C.lavauxi {{is the ability}} to live successfully under large amounts of sediment. Bacon [...] found that Cyclograpsus insularum was only able to tolerate 18% of sediment underneath boulders. When comparing this to C.lavauxi there is a stark discrepancy as C.lavauxi can withstand up to 63% of sediment which is sand and silt. There {{are a number of other}} unique behavioural traits associated with C.lavauxi including its aggressiveness when cornered which is rather unusual for a <b>crab,</b> with its <b>pincers</b> raised to accentuate their size along with showing the paleness of their pincers. Their major body postures include being flat with their pincers folded and laying on the ground with their walking legs close and side-by-side. When in a raised position they place their body at a 45 degree angle with their back part still laying on the ground with their pincers resting still either flat or poised at the midway mark. Their final position is the tiptoe position with their body angled and lifted off the ground and in the air, pincers still folded but held off the ground with their walking legs fully extended.|$|R
