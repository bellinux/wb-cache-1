25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient <b>combustion</b> <b>stroke,</b> especially at lower rpm.

40|$|The {{conventional}} Diesel cycles {{engine is}} now approaching the practical limits of efficiency. The recuperated split cycle engine {{is an alternative}} cycle {{with the potential to}} achieve higher efficiencies than could be achieved using a conventional engine cycle. In a split cycle engine, the compression and <b>combustion</b> <b>strokes</b> are performed in separate chambers. This enables direct cooling of the compression cylinder reducing compression work, intra cycle heat recovery and low heat rejection expansion. Previously reported analysis has shown that brake efficiencies approaching 60 % are attainable, representing a 33 % improvement over current advanced heavy duty diesel engine. However, the achievement of complete, stable, compression ignited combustion has remained elusive to date. The challenge is to induct hot high pressure charge air close to top dead centre into the combustion cylinder and then inject and burn the fuel before the piston has travelled significantly down the expansion stroke. In this paper, we report results from a single cylinder split cycle combustion research engine. Stable, rapid combustion was achieved at 800 rpm and 1200 rpm at the retarded timings required for a split cycle engine. The calculated rate of heat release was more rapid than typically observed on conventional compression ignition engine suggesting good mixing of the fuel and air during induction. One dimensional cycle analysis was used to calculate the implications of the test results on the full engine cycle which indicated class leading brake efficiencies approaching and possibly exceeding, 60 % are possible from a split cycle engine...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2014 SAE International. The free-piston engine {{generator}} (FPEG) {{is a novel}} type of energy conversion device; it integrates a two <b>stroke</b> <b>combustion</b> engine and a linear electric machine into a single unit. As an alternative to conventional engines, the FPEG is a promising power generation system due to its simplicity and high thermal efficiency and has attracted considerable research interests recently. This paper presents the development for a spark-ignited free-piston {{engine generator}} prototype, and the design of major sub-systems is introduced. The electrical linear machine is operated as a motor to start the engine and switched to a generator after successful ignition. Ignition {{is one of the}} most crucial problems for the generating process, thus a unique control sub-system to generate ignition signals at the correct ignition timing based on the piston position was completed. Then experiments of the starting process were carried out with the prototype. The results indicate that with a fixed motor force of 110 N, the maximum in-cylinder gas pressure can reach 12 bar and the compression ratio can reach 8 : 1. Moreover, the experiment results show a good agreement with the simulation prediction. According to the performance of the starting process, the development of the prototype is acceptable and further research on the generating process will be undertaken soon...|$|R
40|$|A very {{stringent}} {{problem in}} most of European cities is the individual mobility. This problem is mainly caused by traffic jam and arising from this are two particularly interesting environmental issues: pollution and noise [1]. Use of two wheeler vehicles does not represent the final solution to these problems, nevertheless they can supply a useful aid to ease them. Recently, two stroke engines are being replaced with four stroke engines. For small capacity engines this means a true reduction in exhaust emissions, especially unburned hydrocarbons (HC), but, {{on the other hand}} it involves a performance reduction, particularly for sudden accelerations, which constitute an essential requirement for these vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. Hybridisation can help to fill the gap between two stroke engines and cleaner, but less performing four stroke engines [6]. At the same time, it can help to lower fuel consumption, by means of a reduction in the revolution speed [2, 5]. This paper presents a study on a parallel hybrid scooter prototype {{from the point of view}} of a better matching between the characteristics of the internal four <b>stroke</b> <b>combustion</b> engine and of the electric motor. Wave fluid-dynamic 1 D code was used in order to create a model of the internal combustion engine. The model validation was carried out by the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data obtained with the roller test bench. Then, some modifications were analysed in order to optimise the behaviour of the engine at a lower revolution speed of the engine, thus diminishing the specific fuel consumption of the vehicle. Finally, such modifications were introduced in a Simulink (Matlab) model to evaluate their influence on the behaviour of the whole hybrid vehicle when running on different road cycle tests...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{introduces}} the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) - a compact electricity generation unit, {{which is being}} developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It is designed as a free-piston combustion engine with integrated linear generator. This combination allows for highly efficient conversion of the chemical energy stored in a fuel to electrical energy. By combining a two <b>stroke</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber, a linear alternator and an adjustable gas spring the engine design results in a compact package. In comparison to conventional combustion engines, additional degrees of freedom are available for controlling the combustion process. In this context efficiency advantages are expected due to the missing mechanical link to a crank which leads to flexibility in terms of stroke and compression ratio. Applied as a range-extender-unit, the system provides additional electric energy to electric vehicles in case of discharged batteries. In addition to this automotive application, the FPLG {{can be used as}} an auxiliary power unit for example in aircrafts as well as in decentralized combined heat and power plants (CHP). A step-by-step development strategy leading to the first overall FPLG system has been pursued. In the past years, the DLR has developed and experimentally verified several demonstrator prototypes for all necessary subsystems. Development systems comprising of several of the subsystems and (in some cases) of an auxiliary hydraulic actuator have been investigated. Free piston specific challenges have to be addressed, e. g. increased requirements concerning steadiness of the combustion process. In addition to the hardware development, active control of piston motion is a major technological challenge. Model based algorithms for this purpose have been developed and implemented on a real time system. Applied to one of the development systems, their performance is evaluated in experiments...|$|R
