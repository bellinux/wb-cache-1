5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills</b> training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills.</b> This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills,</b> and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

In one study conducted by Julia Simner of the University of Edinburgh it was found that spatial sequence synesthetes have a built-in and automatic mnemonic reference. So the nonsynesthete will need to create a mnemonic device to remember a sequence (like dates in a diary), but the synesthete can simply reference their spatial visualizations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how {{measurements of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> differ based on survey mode, from a face-to-face interview to a self-completed survey, using the Wordsum vocabulary test {{found in the}} General Social Survey. The Wordsum acts {{as a proxy for}} general <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill,</b> and it has been used to predict a variety of political variables. Therefore, knowing differences in <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> by mode are important for political science research because of the proliferation of self-completed Internet surveys. I leverage a large-scale mode experiment that randomizes a general population sample into a face-to-face or self-completed interview. Results show that historically easy questions are more likely to yield correct answers in the face-to-face treatment, but modest-to-difficult test questions have a higher rate of correct answers in the self-completed treatment (marginal distributions). A <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> scale using item response theory, however, does not differ by mode because the ordering of ideal points does not change from a face-to-face interview to a self-completed survey. When applying the scale to a well-established model of party identification, I show no difference by mode, suggesting that a transition from face-to-face interviews to self-completed surveys may not alter conclusion drawn from models that use the Wordsum test...|$|R

A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of executive functions, that is, <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills</b> that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour, which are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex.

Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills.</b> In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E

At the person level, {{we tested the}} effects of educational attainment, language, gender, age, and <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> on individual test-taking disengagement in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving. Given previous research, we expected that educational attainment, fluency in the test language, being female and <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> would be negatively related to test-taking disengagement. We had no hypothesis with regard to age. We further investigated how item characteristics affect disengagement. Given previous findings, we expected items completed {{in the second part}} of the PIAAC assessment to be associated with significantly greater disengagement than the same items completed in the first part. Furthermore, in accordance the informed disengagement hypothesis presented above, we assumed that disengagement would increase with item difficulty across all three domains. This effect was hypothesized to be moderated by individual <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> such that the negative effect of item difficulty on disengagement would be smaller for stronger participants. Put simply, strong test-takers stay engaged when they encounter difficult items, whereas poor test-takers give up quickly.|$|R
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) {{have been}} shown to be {{impaired}} on some nondeclarative memory tasks that require <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> learning (perceptual-motor sequence learning, probabilistic classification). To determine what other skill-based tasks are impaired, 13 patients with PD were tested on artificial grammar learning, artificial grammar learning with transfer to novel lettersets, and prototype learning. Patients with PD performed similarly to controls on all 3 tests. The intact learning exhibited by PD patients on these tests suggests that nondeclarative <b>cognitive</b> <b>skill</b> learning is not a single entity supported by the neostriatum. If learning the regularities among visual stimuli is the principal feature of artificial grammar learning and prototype learning, then these forms of skill learning may be examples of perceptual learning, and they may occur in early visual cortical processing areas.

25|$|Nitrazepam is not {{recommended}} for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with tuberous sclerosis treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills</b> in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, {{as well as several}} deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of <b>cognitive</b> <b>skills</b> necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E
