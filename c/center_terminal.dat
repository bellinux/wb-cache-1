50|$|See drawing. Many {{inexpensive}} potentiometers {{are constructed}} with a resistive element (B) formed into an arc {{of a circle}} usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the <b>center</b> <b>terminal</b> of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.|$|E

50|$|This {{ignition}} system uses an ignition coil wound as an autotransformer {{to step up}} the voltage from the 12 volts supplied by the battery (itself supplied, once the engine starts, by the alternator or dynamo in older vehicles). When the points close, current flows through the primary (input) side of the coil, which has a few hundred turns of wire, creating a magnetic field. When the points open, interrupting the current, this field collapses and as it does the lines of flux cut across the secondary (output) coil which has several thousand turns of very fine wire, inducing an open-circuit voltage {{in the range of}} 15 to 30 thousand volts at the coil output terminal. This high voltage pulse is carried by the coil wire to the <b>center</b> <b>terminal</b> of the distributor cap.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to maintaining the current bus services, the new Transbay Transit <b>Center</b> <b>terminal</b> will {{also include a}} tunnel that extends the terminus of the Caltrain commuter rail line from its current location at Fourth and King Streets; the downtown Caltrain extension is projected to alleviate roadway traffic and Caltrain rider delays, resulting in an estimated $20 million savings per year. The Caltrain extension depends on the electrification of its rolling stock, as the current diesel engines are not appropriate for tunnel service. When this project is completed, Caltrain riders would {{no longer need to}} transfer to Muni in order to reach the downtown financial district. Additionally, the heavy rail portion of the terminal would be designed to accommodate the planned High Speed Rail from Los Angeles, which shares the right-of-way (Peninsula Corridor) with Caltrain between San Francisco and San Jose. Like the original Transbay Terminal, the new Transbay Transit Center would span both First and Fremont streets.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{attached}} {{to the top of the}} distributor shaft which is driven by the engine's camshaft and thus synchronized to it. Synchronization to the camshaft is required as the rotor must turn at exactly half the speed of the main crankshaft in the 4-stroke cycle. Often, the rotor and distributor are attached directly to the end of the one of (or the only) camshaft, at the opposite end to the timing drive belt. This rotor is pressed against a carbon brush on the <b>center</b> <b>terminal</b> of the distributor cap which connects to the ignition coil. The rotor is constructed such that the center tab is electrically connected to its outer edge so the current coming in to the center post travels through the carbon point to the outer edge of the rotor. As the camshaft rotates, the rotor spins and its outer edge passes each of the internal plug terminals to fire each spark plug in sequence.|$|E

40|$|Amiodarone {{is a drug}} used in the {{treatment}} of cardiac arrhythmias and is believed to have a persistent interaction with cellular membranes. This study sought to examine the structure and location of amiodarone in a membrane bilayer. Amiodarone has a high membrane partition coefficient on the order of 10 (6). Small angle x-ray diffraction was used to determine the position of the iodine atoms of amiodarone in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayers under conditions of low temperature and hydration where the DPPC bilayer is in the gel state. The time-averaged position of the iodine atoms was determined to be approximately 6 A from the <b>center</b> (<b>terminal</b> methyl region) of the lipid bilayer. A dielectric constant of kappa = 2, which approximates that of the bilayer hydrocarbon core region, was used in calculating a minimum energy structure for membrane-bound amiodarone. This calculated structure when compared with the crystal structure of amiodarone demonstrated that amiodarone could assume a conformation in the bilayer significantly different from that in the crystal. The results reported here are an attempt to correlate the position of a membrane-active drug in a lipid bilayer with its time-averaged conformation. This type of analysis promises to be of great use in the design of drugs with greater potency and higher specificity...|$|E
40|$|The LORAN {{program is}} stored in CMS disk files for use by Avionics Engineering <b>Center</b> <b>terminal</b> users. A CMS EXEC file named LORAN {{controls}} program operation. The user types LORAN and the program then prompts for data input and produces output on the terminal. The FORTRAN program refers to a disk file of LORAN master data giving station locations, coding delays, repetition rate and station pair identification letters. For Geographic-to-LORAN conversion, no iterative computations are required; the program is a straightforward coordinate conversion based upon the techniques described by the Navy. For LORAN-to-Geographic conversion, the original Navy program required a dead-reckoned position, near the actual unknown fix, to begin computations. No iteration was performed to obtain the LORAN fix, but internal program errors occurred at execution time if the dead-reckoned fix were displaced from the actual fix {{by more than a}} few minutes of latitude or longitude. In order to enhance usefulness of the program for the terminal user, an iterative routine was added which allows a single dead-reckoned position to be entered from the master data file for each LORAN chain. The results compare exactly with the LORAN-C navigation chart, and provide adequate benchmark data for general aviation flight planning and data analysis...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years, the {{application}} of automation to the U. S. air traffic control (ATC) system has grown enormously to meet significant increases in air traffic volume. The next ten years will witness a dramatic overhaul of computer hardware and software in enroute and terminal facilities to accommodate future growth in air traffic activities. From a human factors perspective, notable changes are the new controller workstations or sector-suites which will provide such new features as adjustable consoles, graphic situation displays, and electronic flight strips. This modernization will {{provide the basis for}} introducing automated functions that will transition the controller from tactical control to strategic traffic management. The U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognizes the importance of an effective human-system interface to successful operations (Kloster and Zellweger, 1987). Because various phases of test and evaluation are just around the corner for these new system upgrades, questions arise concerning what aspects of the human-system component must be addressed to verify system safety and efficiency. Such questions are not trivial. They strike {{at the heart of the}} &quot;omnipresent criterion problem &quot; (Christensen, 1958), that is, the difficulty of defining criterion measures for verifying and validating complex systems. This paper first discusses the criterion problem, focusing on the unique constraints within ATC. The central argument is that before criteria and measures can be specified, humancentered issues associated with ATC technology upgrades must be carefully determined. An approach is discussed for disclosing such issues drawing on techniques and philosophies from traditional human factors engineering, cognitive systems engineering, and ethnography. The approach is illustrated for the <b>Center</b> <b>Terminal</b> Automation System (CTAS), a set of automation tools, currently under development and evaluation by NASA-Ames in partnership with the FAA. CTAS will assist air traffic personnel in managing arrival traffic flow in the center and terminal environments...|$|E
