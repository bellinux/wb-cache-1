50|$|In telecommunication, an {{isochronous}} signal is a signal {{in which the}} time interval separating any two <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> {{is equal to the}} unit interval or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.|$|R
50|$|In binary {{signaling}} such as FSK, distortion is {{the shifting}} of the <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> {{of the signal}} pulses from their proper positions relative {{to the beginning of}} the start pulse. The magnitude of the distortion is expressed in percent of an ideal unit pulse length. This is sometimes called 'bias' distortion.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{isochronous}} distortion, in data transmission, is {{the ratio of}} the absolute value of the maximum measured difference between the actual and the theoretical intervals separating any two <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> of modulation (or demodulation), to the unit interval. These instants are not necessarily consecutive. This value is usually expressed as a percentage.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{conditions}} are recognized by an appropriate device called a receiver, demodulator, or decoder. The decoder translates the actual signal received into its intended logical value {{such as a}} binary digit (0 or 1), an alphabetic character, a mark, or a space. Each <b>significant</b> <b>instant</b> is determined when the appropriate device assumes a condition or state usable for performing a specific function, such as recording, processing, or gating.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} condition {{could be an}} electric current (voltage, or power level), an optical power level, a phase value, or a particular frequency or wavelength. The duration of a {{significant condition}} is the time interval between successive <b>significant</b> <b>instants.</b> A change from one significant condition to another is called a signal transition. Information can be transmitted either during the given time interval, or encoded as {{the presence or absence}} of a change in the received signal.|$|R
40|$|Synchronization {{means the}} {{aligning}} of the <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> of one {{signal to the}} <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> of another. In digital systems, where timing transfer between systems is required, synchronization is an important function. In this thesis new results on the performance and design of synchronization processes are presented. An inescapable consequence of the synchronization of external autonomous inputs in digital systems {{is the possibility of}} failure of digital devices used to capture the external signal. The anomalous behaviour of these devices is referred to as metastability. The most commonly used approach to controlling the problem of metastability is the use of synchronizers. A synchronizer can be designed to reduce the probability of metastable: failure but cannot eliminate it altogether. New high performance synchronizer designs are presented and analysed in this thesis. Another consequence of synchronization is the resulting disturbance of the significant epochs of timing signals. This disturbance is referred to as jitter. The characterization of jitter produced in synchronization processes is important in the design of digital systems. In this thesis, jitter characteristics are derived for two important applications that arise in digital communications systems. The characterization provides new insight into the dependence of the jitter on system parameters...|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, a {{plesiochronous}} {{system is}} one where {{different parts of the}} system are almost, but not quite, perfectly synchronised. According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are plesiochronous if their <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal frequency but may have a slight frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase. The mismatch between the two systems' clocks is known as the plesiochronous difference.|$|R
30|$|With the TOSC, {{in order}} to obtain the optimal {{throughput}} region, the scheduling decision maximizes the weighted sum of queue lengths and continues to transmit new packets regardless of whether there are old packets queueing at the RS. Multiple packets queueing at the RS causes a packet re-ordering problem and may introduce a <b>significant</b> <b>instant</b> delay at the MS. This effect may be harmful for the real-time applications, e.g., video streaming. We design a scheduling policy that allows only one packet of each flow to be buffered at the RS. This policy guarantees that there is no effect of packet re-ordering. The complexity of the policy is identical to that of TOSC due to the similarity in computation of the link weights. We refer to this policy as TOSC-wo.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{for the investigation}} of the space-time relations between public services and individual mobility, by checking the space-time efficiency of the allocation of public and private parking areas. The methodology has been applied to the case study of Brescia, in northern Italy. The spatial distribution of car parking has been assessed as well as the usage variations during the day. First of all, the location and the density of parking areas within the city has been taken into account, and represented to show the spatial coverage of car parking supply. Then, the temporal issue has been considered, since the degree of use of each parking area varies within the time of the day. Therefore, the degree of use of each parking area has been mapped at three <b>significant</b> <b>instant</b> of the day (10. 00 a. m.; 01. 00 p. m. and 04. 00 p. m.). This kind of analysis is particularly helpful to highlight the availability of parking areas during the day.

40|$|Phytoplankton {{communities}} {{are recognized as}} important indicators for environmental changes since they usually respond rapidly to a changing environment in aquatic systems. To evaluate how changes in the climate and atmospheric deposition might impact phytoplankton communities, we examined a complete 14 -year time series of different physical, chemical and biological variables from 13 nutrient-poor Swedish reference lakes along a latitudinal gradient. We found numerous significant changes in physical and chemical lake conditions that were highly coherent among the lakes, in particular for sulfate concentrations, surface water temperatures and intensity of thermal stratification. The phytoplankton biomass and species richness of six phytoplankton groups, measured at the same occasions as the water chemical variables, showed only few and weak significant changes over time. The only <b>coherent</b> <b>significant</b> change over Sweden, occurring in seven lakes, was observed in the species richness of chlorophytes. We claim that {{the response of the}} phytoplankton biomass and species richness to strong physical and chemical changes is comparatively weak and lake-specific. While many studies deal with the loss of species as a response to global change, we were able to show that some species can clearly profit from global changes. Analyzing long-term data and carrying out laboratory experiments we were able to detect a direct temperature effect on the growth rates of the nuisance alga Gonyostomum semen, which could explain the increases in the occurrence and abundance of this species over Sweden. From the results we predict that Gonyostomum semen will further increase in its distribution and abundance along with increasing temperatures. The findings of this thesis give new insights into the impact of global changes on phytoplankton community structures in nutrient-poor lakes...|$|R

Moreover, behind the formality of this calendrically <b>significant</b> <b>instant,</b> there is also our timeless expression of great affection and thanks to Sergio: affection for his sympathetic character and thanks for his activities in our profession, both within the scientific framework and in the broader social context. But {{for those of us}} from MIT there is a special feeling of gratitude towards Sergio, and that is because in the late sixties and early seventies he was with us and helped shape what can now be seen as the most recent golden age of physics, thereby establishing at MIT a tradition that still flourishes today. You have to appreciate the moment: Steven Weinberg was on the faculty completing the standard model, while Garbriele Veneziano and Sergio were inventing what proved to be the physics of the future — string theory. These people have since departed from our University, but Sergio has kept the legacy vital by visiting us — not as frequently as we would have liked — and by encouraging continuing contact with his wonderful and talented Italian compatriot physicists. The people who came from Italy to enrich our department are too numerous to list, but theirs is an ongoing presence, formalized recently by an agreement with the INFN, and the well-spring of all this good fortune is Sergio Fubini, whom we all thank. Sergio is now gone from MIT, but I am certain he wants to be informed of activity there, so I shall describe one project, with the hope that it meets his criteria of simplicity and symmetry. These days, as high energy particle colliders become unavailable for testing speculative theoretical ideas, physicists are looking to other environments that may provide extreme conditions where theory confronts physical reality.

The MJO composites are based on 4 years of gridded Argo float data from 2003 to 2006, and extend from the surface to 1, 400 m depth in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. The MJO surface salinity anomalies are consistent with precipitation minus evaporation fluxes in the Indian Ocean, and with anomalous zonal advection in the Pacific. The Argo sea surface temperature and thermocline depth anomalies are consistent with previous studies using other data sets. The near-surface density changes due to salinity are comparable to, and partially offset, those due to temperature, emphasising the importance of including salinity as well as temperature changes in mixed-layer modelling of tropical intraseasonal processes.

40|$|Abstract—A {{microwave}} scattering formulation {{is presented}} for grassland and other short vegetation canopies. The {{fact that the}} constituent elements of these targets can be {{as large as the}} vegetation layer make this formulation problematic. For example, a grass element may extend from the soil surface {{to the top of the}} canopy, and thus the upper portion of the element can be illuminated with far greater energy than the bottom. By modeling the long, thin elements of this type of vegetation as line dipole elements, this nonuniform illumination can be accounted for. Additionally, the stature and structure of grass plants can result in situations where the average inner-product or <b>coherent</b> terms are <b>significant</b> at lower frequencies. As a result, the backscattering coefficient cannot be modeled simply as the incoherent addition of the power from each element and scattering mechanism. To determine these coherent terms, a coherent model that considers scattered fields, and not power, is provided. This formulation is then used to provide a solution to the multiple coherent scattering terms, terms which include the correlation of the scattering between both dissimilar constituent elements and dissimilar scattering mechanisms. Finally, a major component of the grass family are cultural grasses, such as wheat and barley. This vegetation is often planted in row structures, a periodic organization that can likewise result in <b>significant</b> <b>coherent</b> scattering effects, depending on the frequency and illumination pattern. Therefore, a formulation is also provided that accounts for the unique scattering of these structures. Index Terms—Coherent scattering, extinction in random media, vegetation scattering models.
