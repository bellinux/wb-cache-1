40|$|We {{distinguish}} between local problems of biodiversity loss and global ones, where international cooperation is required. Global biodiversity regulation involves choosing the optimal stopping rule regarding global land conversions, {{in order to}} ensure that some areas of unconverted natural reserves remain to support the production sector that exists on converted lands. The basic difficulty with implementing a solution to this global problem lies in the asymmetry in endowments between those states that have previously converted, and those that have not. We demonstrate that the fundamental problem of global biodiversity regulation is similar to the bargaining problem analysed by Nash, Rubinstein and others. There are benefits from global land conversion, and there must be agreement on their distribution before the conversion process can be halted. Since the institutions addressing global biodiversity problems are either highly ineffectual (benefit sharing agreements, prior informed <b>consent</b> <b>clauses)</b> or very extreme (incremental cost contracts), the biodiversity bargaining problem remains unresolved. For this reason we anticipate that suboptimal conversions will continue to occur, as a way of protesting the ineffective and unfair approaches employed in addressing this problem to date.

Nominees should be filibustered only under extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist.B. Rules Changes. In light of the spirit and continuing commitments made in this agreement, we commit to oppose the rules changes in the 109th Congress, which we understand to be any amendment to or interpretation of the Rules of the Senate that would force a vote on a judicial nomination by means other than unanimous consent or Rule XXII.We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United States Constitution, the word [...] "Advice" [...] speaks to consultation between the Senate and the President with regard {{to the use of the}} President's power to make nominations. We encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for consideration.Such a return to the early practices of our government may well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators seek to uphold.|$|E

It also considers other regulatory responses to date. Due to the lack of industry specific regulation it argues that the use of wrap contracts {{can be viewed as a}} means of industry self-regulation and a form of private legislation. This means that governance is skewed heavily in favour of companies and it creates an imbalance in the respective rights and obligations of the parties â company and consumer â which is likely to result in consumer detriment. It is argued that certain types of terms commonly include in DTCGT contracts, including: unilateral variation clauses; some exclusion clauses; choice of law clauses; indemnity; and <b>consent</b> <b>clauses</b> are likely to be deemed unfair and unenforceable under UK law. It recommends that in the short-term the Competition and Markets Authority should undertake a compliance review of DTCGT contracts in order to improving contracts for consumers. In the long term, companies should also be complying with data protection law, as well as legislation on medical devices and the provisions of the Human Tissue Act and there may be a need for industry specific legislation...|$|R

40|$|When the New South Wales Rugby League ("NSWRL") {{implemented}} a draft system in 1990 it was successfully {{challenged by the}} players in Adamson v NSWRL. This article examines this decision, though {{it should be noted}} that the rules of the NSWRL draft are no longer in operation. The Australian Football League ("AFL"), however, has continued to use ils draft system and it is argued that the AFL draft rules are much fairer on the players than the rules previously used by the NSWRL. This is because while the AFL draft does initially restrict a player's choice of employer, this is only true for the first two years. At the end of that period the rules provide players with some genuine bargaining power to help them choose the employer of their choice. It is suggested therefore that the AFL draft is distinguishable from the draft system once used by the NSWRL that was declared invalid by the courts. There are still problems with the AFL draft in that clubs are able to initiate the trade of players without the player's consent, but it is suggested that this can be solved by the introduction of a <b>consent</b> <b>clause.</b> It is also suggested that the restrictive nature of the draft can be reduced by the introduction of a limited form of free agency for players who have been playing for a certain period of time and/or played a certain number of games...|$|E

It then addresses three key areas of concern including: (a) {{the purpose of the}} Bill; (b) the test for granting marine <b>consents</b> under <b>clause</b> 61 (2); and (c) the precautionary approach. The writers consider that the Bill largely succeeds, in a drafting sense, in what it sets out to do (i. e. provide an effects based statutory regime for balancing environmental protection with economic development). However, the writers consider that the Bill fails to provide an adequate degree of clarity in respect of our three areas of concern. Lack of clarity in turn contributes to an overall failure to achieve a desirable level of integration with the Resource Management Act 1991 (“RMA”).

The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to determine if}} a spouse has the right to take a deceased spouse’s sex cells and use them for assisted fertilization. For this purpose, we presented and analyzed problematic aspects of assisted fertilization using a deceased person’s sex cells. To reach the set aim, we analyzed legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania on assisted fertilization, reviewed legal acts of the European Union on sex cell donation, foreign legal acts regulating assisted fertilization, and court practice. Based on the analysis of Lithuanian and foreign scientific literature and the conducted research, we revealed the positive and negative aspects of assisted fertilization with a deceased donor’s sex cells as well as the issue of the priority of the future child’s interests in the context of assisted fertilization. Legalization of postmortem sex cell donation for assisted fertilization is a relevant issue in every constitutional state. Various countries have differing approaches to postmortem sex cell donation, and this is the object of much ethical and legal discussion. In some countries, like Great Britain, Belgium, India and some states of the US, the law permits harvesting sex cells of a deceased person, while in other countries, such as Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, and some states of Australia, this practice is prohibited. In Lithuania, the Law on Assisted Fertilization prohibits postmortem sex cell donation except for cases where the advance consent of the deceased person is available for the use of his or her sex cells for a concrete person. Sex cells may be obtained only with the donor’s written informed <b>consent.</b> <b>Clause</b> 8. 2 of the Republic of Lithuania Law on Assisted Fertilization prohibits harvesting and (or) use of a deceased person’s sex cells. If a person whose sex cells are stored in a cell bank dies, the sex cells are destroyed. A deceased person’s sex cells may be used for the assisted fertilization of a concrete person if the donor had granted consent for such use of the cells prior to his or her death. The legal regulation of assisted fertilization in European countries differs and is influenced by cultural, religious, and other differences between the countries. The European Union (EU) does not legally regulate assisted fertilization because of the aforementioned differences between European countries. In the EU and its member stated, questions of reproductive health are mostly analyzed from a specific, medical perspective. The EU encourages the development of a single system for ensuring high standards for the quality and safety of supply, examination, processing, storage, and distribution of human cells and tissues throughout the EU. The member states are encouraged to facilitate the exchange of human cells and tissues for patients who need such treatment on the yearly basis. For this reason, the EU, through Community regulations, tries to ensure similar quality and the same safety of human cells and tissues irrespectively of the location of their use. The rapid development of medicine results in the emergence of an increasing number of opinions concerning postmortem sex cell donation. When the cells have already been harvested before the death of one of the spouses and are stored in a cell bank, {{the answer to the question}} of whether the surviving spouse can use those cells is clear. The fact that a person decided to store his or her sex cells suggests that he or she intended to use those cells for assisted fertilization in the future. More discussions arise when the surviving spouse seeks to obtain the deceased spouse’s sex cells for assisted fertilization with the aim of having offspring in the absence of the donor’s written consent. Such situation may occur if the spouse or partner dies unexpectedly due to an accident or an acute illness. In such situations, appropriate use of the deceased spouse’s sex cells by the surviving spouse cannot be ensured, and thus the decision should be well-considered and stable. Taking into account the psychological condition of the deceased person’s family is important, as in such situation, they may make an unadvised decision. There is no unified global regulation of the harvesting or use of female or male sex cells. The donation of male sex cells is simpler and does not require any significant medical intervention. Freezing of male sex cells became available back in 1949. Meanwhile, harvesting and preservation of female sex cells is a relatively new and unexplored area, but biotechnologies have made this procedure available. It was first performed in 1970. Pre-implantation genetic diagnostics is another important aspect in assisted fertilization. Pre-implantation genetic diagnostics may have both positive and negative aspects. The embryo’s examination prior to the transfer to the uterus may help detect genetic diseases (such as Down’s syndrome, hemophilia, etc.), yet it may also be applied for non-medical purposes, such as the determination of the child’s sex and other characteristics, which violates the principles of ethics. The concept of a family is not well-defined in legislation, and there are a number of various definitions of a family member and other terms in the regulation of different legal relationships. The rapid development of the society causes changes in the concept of the family in legislation because the law has to react to changes in the society. Every person has the right to have a family and children. The introduction of new biotechnologies is changing the model of a family. Even though both national and international legal acts defend the right to a family, the right to use a deceased spouse’s sex cells has to be carefully evaluated, including the assessment of all its possible positive and negative aspects. The principle of the priority of a child’s interests was first formulated on the international scale in 1959 in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In 1989, it was included in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child where it became one of the main legal principles of the Convention. The principle of the priority of a child’s interests is an imperative international norm of the human rights. Assisted fertilization is related to the interests of the child conceived via this method. A child in a family is a creation of two people, yet in case of children conceived via assisted fertilization after the demise of one of the parents, the main negative aspect that may affect the child’s well-being is the fact that that the child is born in a family with only one of the parents alive. This may cause the child to be perceived in the society as “different”. In the majority of countries that allow assisted fertilization using a deceased donor’s sex cells, parenthood of a child conceived via this method may be recognized if the following requirements are met: a written consent of the deceased parent, and a registered marriage. The court of law always demands proof that the wish to conceive via such method was mutual. The hypothesis raised in this work was confirmed: a spouse has the right to use a deceased spouse’s sex cells for assisted fertilization. The right to have a family is recognized as the basic human right both in national and international legal acts, but the child’s and the future parents’ interests have to be ensured irrespective of the mode in which the child was conceived...|$|E
