50|$|Amphenol's world {{headquarters}} {{is located in}} Wallingford, Connecticut. The largest division of Amphenol is Amphenol Aerospace (formerly Bendix Corporation) in Sidney, New York. This is {{the birthplace of the}} MIL-DTL-38999 <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connector.</b> Amphenol engineers also invented the commonly used BNC connector ("Bayonet Neill-Concelman").|$|E
50|$|The {{connectors}} come in four current ratings 16, 32, 63 or 125 A per pin. All {{consist of}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connector</b> pins {{arranged in a}} circle, with the earth pin 2 mm larger than the others. This {{is surrounded by a}} circular shroud on the male connector, which fits into a matching recess on the female connector.|$|E
5000|$|Small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connectors</b> come in {{a variety}} of sizes. They may be known as [...] "coaxial power connectors", [...] "barrel connectors", [...] "concentric barrel connectors" [...] or [...] "tip connectors".|$|R
50|$|A coaxial power {{connector}} is an electrical {{power connector}} used for attaching extra-low voltage {{devices such as}} consumer electronics to external electricity. Also known as barrel connectors, concentric barrel connectors or tip <b>connectors,</b> these small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connectors</b> come in an enormous variety of sizes.|$|R
50|$|Contact {{refers to}} the {{conductive}} element in a connector that mate mechanically and electrically to transmit signals and/or power across a connector interface. Crimp style contacts {{are the most common}} type found in high-reliability <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connectors.</b> Male contacts are sometimes referred to as leads, posts or pins, while Female contacts are universally known as sockets.|$|R
40|$|A sleeve {{combined}} with grout is a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connector</b> used to join two discontinuous steel reinforcement bars without complying {{to the conventional}} lap length. It acts as the connection for joining steel reinforcement bars to safely transfer the tensile force from one reinforcement bar to the other to ensure the integrity of a structural frame system. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the behavior and the feasibility of fifteen new proposed grouted sleeve connectors for the connection of precast concrete components. The connectors were tested to failure under incremental tensile load. The configurations of the grouted sleeve connectors were varied and their tensile performances were evaluated in terms of the ultimate tensile resistance, stiffness, yield strength, ductility and failure modes. The results show that the grouted splice sleeve connectors could provide comparable ultimate tensile strength of the connected steel bars. It is seen that the bond between bar-and-grout,and also between grout-and-sleeve are essential {{to the success of the}} tensile load transfer between the steel bars. It is also seen that the confinement provided by the sleeve enhances the bar-and-grout bond dramatically by controlling the splitting cracks...|$|E
50|$|Since MIL-STD-1553B {{does not}} specify {{the type of}} {{connector}} to be employed in data bus applications, the connectors must be compatible with cable delineated in the specification. However, specific military connector specifications are relevant or have evolved {{as a result of}} data bus applications. The primary applicable specifications are MIL-C-39012 (relative to RF coaxial connectors such as BNC, N, etc.), MIL-C-49142 (related to concentric twinax/triax connectors) and MIL-DTL-38999 (related to military type <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connectors).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) {{derivative}} circular connectors {{exist that}} intermate {{with the military}} versions designed to MIL-C-5015/MIL-DTL-5015. Both COTS and military-style connectors are sometimes called [...] "Type AN" [...] connectors, [...] "MS connectors" [...] "Cannon connectors", or [...] "Amphenol connectors". Amphenol Corporation, Glenair Inc., and ITT Interconnect Solutions (Cannon) are notable manufacturers {{of this type of}} connectors. Amphenol Corporation (Industrial Global Operations) provides a [...] "5015 series". 5015 series connectors are medium to heavy weight <b>cylindrical</b> <b>connectors</b> with 5 shell styles, 19 shell sizes and 5 service classes. The 5015 offers 305 contact arrangements from 1-to-104 circuits. ITT Corporation (ITT Interconnect Solutions) business portfolio includes the brands Cannon, VEAM, and BIW, and is the foremost manufacturer of Type [...] "AN", MS and MS-type connectors.|$|R
50|$|In such a <b>connector,</b> <b>{{cylindrical}}</b> spring-metal pins {{fit into}} cylindrical spring-metal sockets. The pins and sockets {{are held in}} a rectangular matrix in a nylon shell. The connector typically has two to 24 contacts and is polarized or keyed to ensure correct orientation. Pins and sockets can be arranged in any combination in a single housing, and each housing can be either male or female.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The goal {{of every}} {{prosthetic}} management is to simulate nature {{and be in}} harmony with nature within the physiological limits. The occlusal forces on a fixed dental prosthesis are transmitted to the surrounding structures through pontics, connectors and retainers and more stresses are seen at the connector region. To analyze the stress patterns in cast and soldered connectors between the two pontics and between the retainer and pontic of a four unit fixed dental prosthesis on axial and non axial loading and also to observe and ascertain the need to modify {{the design of the}} rigid connectors. Materials and Methods: Subsequently four models each of cast and soldered <b>connectors</b> with <b>cylindrical</b> and triangular design, of dimension 3 Ã— 4 mm and thickness 0. 5 mm was designed for the study. The first premolar and second molar were considered as the abutments and 2 nd premolar and 1 st molar as the pontics. The analysis was done using ANSYS version 8. 0 software and by placing axial and non-axial load of 40 Newtons each. Results: Von Misses stresses were observed at the connector region between the two pontics, especially in the cervical region. Conclusion: The <b>cylindrical</b> cast <b>connectors</b> showed less stress in comparison to triangular design and the difference in the stress distribution of cast and soldered connectors were marginal. Clinical Significance: The occlusal forces on a fixed dental prosthesis are transmitted to the surrounding structures through pontics, connectors and retainers with maximum stresses concentrated at the connectors. Hence this three-dimensional finite element analysis study investigated stress distribution in a four unit posterior fixed dental prosthesis, having <b>cylindrical</b> and triangular <b>connector</b> designs...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MII) {{released}} a new China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) standard, [...] "Technical Requirements and Test Method of Charger and Interface for Mobile Telecommunication Terminal Equipment". This standard describes the electromechanical requirements {{for a common}} mobile device battery charger equipped with a USB type-A socket providing power at 5 V DC. All new mobile phones requesting network access approval in China from June 2007 are required to support charging from the new common chargers. The original 2006 regulation is flexible regarding the interface on the mobile phone itself, allowing {{for the use of}} adapter cables if the mobile device is not equipped with a standard USB connector. Among other things, the 2009 update adds references to USB On-The-Go (OTG) support and the use of USB micro-B, micro-AB, mini-B; and Mini-10-pin and <b>cylindrical</b> ("barrel") type <b>connectors</b> on the terminal (phone) for charging.|$|R
40|$|The Goddard Space Flight Center's thermal vacuum {{laboratory}} {{has developed}} a high-speed automated system for testing the integrity of 37 -pin MIL-C- 5015 <b>cylindrical</b> electrical feedthrough <b>connectors</b> used on penetration plates of thermal vacuum chambers. The system consists of a desktop PC driving a data acquisition front end. The latter measures the resistance through each pin of the connector and the resistance from each pin to all other pins and the connector shell. In addition to identifying unacceptable feedthroughs, the system is also used for testing cables. In the special case of Type T thermocouples (used almost exclusively at the lab), the difference in resistance between the copper and constantan wires provides positive proof of accidentally reversed connector wiring. Data acquisition time to completely test a cable or feedthrough connector is less than thirty seconds. The system provides a hardcopy printout of the resistance readings. Connectors or cables with fewer wires are tested using simple adapter cables. Initial tests indicate that {{the performance of a}} given feedthrough connector can be predicted on the basis of measured resistance readings, reducing ongoing cost of connector replacement. The opportunity to positively certify the integrity of cables, cable connectors and feedthroughs before the start of a thermal vacuum test minimizes the likelihood of a circuit problem that would require returning the chamber to ambient conditions for repair. This system has two principal advantages for the Goddard thermal vacuum laboratory. Its only significant cost was the labor to fabricate the test cable and shorting cable [...] about 40 man-hours total. The system was built around a computer and data acquisition unit that were already on hand. The second advantage is that it very quickly tests both of the parameters that are essential...|$|R
