The long storage and shipping times, low temperature (~ 0 °C) and high humidity (> 70 %RH) conditions require boxes manufactured from high performance <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard.</b> As the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes are a significant expense, improvements to reduce the weight and therefore {{the cost of the}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> while maintaining their vertical compression strength, would increase the apple and kiwifruit industries profitability Through analysis of the literature it was established that the greatest contributor to box compression strength was the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> edgewise compression strength, which is significantly affected by moisture. The strength of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> decreases with increasing moisture content, which tends to be high in low-temperature high-humidity cool-stores. The literature also indicated that temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium could be optimised to reduce the damage caused during the fluting process. The objectives of this study included improving box compression strength predictions by measuring the effect of moisture and temperature on the strength of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and measuring the relationship between temperature, humidity and <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> moisture content. The objectives also included developing a mathematical model to optimise the operations preceding the fluting process by predicting the fluting medium moisture content and temperature just prior to the fluting process. The measurements of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> properties enabled the widely known McKee’s equation to be modified to enable the prediction of box compression strength over a range of moisture contents (7 to 30 %db), the valves of which could be estimated using the moisture sorption isotherms developed in this study over the temperature and relative humidity range of 0 to 20 °C and 40 to 90 %RH. A mathematical model was developed to predict how the operation of the corrugator would affect the temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium just prior to the fluting process. The model was tested by running the corrugator at normal and extreme settings based on the model’s predictions, and measuring the strength properties of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> produced. The measured strength properties indicated that the machine speed and steam shower could have an effect but the too were inconsistent to established firm conclusions...|$|E

40|$|Packaging {{of fresh}} fruit for export {{is a major}} use for <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> {{manufactured}} in New Zealand. However the cold and humid conditions used to preserve fruit quality are particularly detrimental {{to the strength of}} corrugated packaging. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a method to measure the performance of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> in high and cycling relative humidity environments. This method was then used to compare the performance of three corrugated fibre-boards 1 For commercial reasons these will be referred to as 'CB 1 ', 'CB 2 'and 'CB 3 ' The creep performance of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> was measured by subjecting samples to four point bending stress under controlled cyclic relative humidity conditions using a computer controlled testing apparatus. A mathematical model by Urbanik (1995) and an empirical exponential model were reviewed before selecting a three term model developed by Pecht (1985) to describe the deflection of the corrugated board. Cyclic relative humidity accelerated the rate of creep compared to a static high humidity environment. The rate of creep in the machine direction was found to be considerably lower than that in the cross machine direction. It was also found that increasing the peak relative humidity from 80 % to 90 % RH dramatically changed the deflection response. This provides a solution to conflicting data in the literature on relative humidity cycling effects. Isochronous deflection curves were used to compare the creep performance of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> samples in an environment cycling between 50 % and 90 % RH. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> sample CB 1 had a slightly lower creep stiffness than corrugated boards CB 2 (p= 0. 0580, n= 8) and CB 3 (p= 0. 0398, n= 8). However a greater number of tests would be required on a wider range of samples to conclusively determine if there were differences in board performance...|$|E
40|$|Multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> has {{in recent}} years been gaining {{attention}} {{as a replacement for}} polymeric materials for protective packaging for environmental reasons. The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, and the properties of air-flow through the flutes becomes a more predominant, they behave more like a soft spring. Artificially restricting the exiting airflow or prudently choosing the direction of flutes in the case of rectangular cushions, allows for the differing design situations that may be required. A mathematical model is developed, to describe the pre-compressing process. Mathematical models and software are developed, based on the airflow characteristics, that allow for the prediction of peak acceleration for differing end conditions or sizes providing the friction component can be estimated using iterative methods. The models were verified by a static compression test for the pre-compression and by dropping a mass, or platen and recording the resistive acceleration, or dynamic behaviour, over a time range. There exists an acceleration component prior to platen contact, which is also modelled and should be considered in the interpretation of test results. The study has presented three models to allow for the prediction of the behaviour of multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> for the use as protective cushions. The main thrust has been the behaviour of the airflow during and prior to impact whilst testing. The models developed will assist in the design of protective packaging and produce predictive tools for the use in the packaging industry...|$|E

The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, they behave more like a soft spring. The performance of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> as a protective cushion is influenced by the amount of moisture present. The material stiffness is also dependent on the amount of moisture present. Static compression testing can be carried out to obtain stiffness data by measuring load versus controlled deflection, with stiffness being the load required to deflect a specified distance. The creep properties can be obtained by measuring deflection with a controlled force over a period of time, that is, creep is a measure of deflection per time under a constant force. Models can be developed to simulate creep data, the Voigt model of Visco-elasticity, a spring – damper model makes a reasonable choice of model. This model is an exponentially decaying expression that can be adapted with respect to static strain, stress or stiffness and can be fitted to creep data. Curve fitting with a non-linear optimisation technique shows the model has a reasonable fit with experimental data. Creep data and curve fitting shows an unexpected trend in that as the humidity level is raised the creep strain levels reduce. The effect of this is offset by higher static strains occurring at higher humidity levels. At higher humidity levels when using the exponential model the creep strain reaches the 63...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was a collaborative project funded by Visy Research and Development Pty.

The primary objective of the project involved an investigation of how to increase the flexibility of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> (CFB) tray forming equipment by developing a flexible (size changing) mandrel and well system which folds the trays from a flat blank. This type of equipment is produced by Visy PSD and installed at customer sites. This objective was achieved, and a working, innovative prototype was developed and manually tested.

40|$|The use of {{loosely packed}} items in rigid or {{semi-rigid}} containers is widespread. These packages are very often handled by high speed equipment {{and put in}} different environmental conditions which includes the possibility of mechanical damage, due to shock, impact and compression. So {{care must be taken}} that damage does not occur to both package and contents. The development of analytical and simulation techniques for investigating the dynamic behaviour of a package subject to handling and distribution hazards is becoming more possible by the use {{of a wide range of}} available software. The modelling of the dynamic behaviour of packaging systems during handling and transport is achieved by mathematical analysis where possible and supported by computer simulation. The analysis was carried out for a range of body properties in order to test the results against experimental data. Investigations into the applied package force/motion and subsequent package impact and deformation were carried out with a view to gaining an understanding of the forces involved. The dynamic analysis was undertaken using commercially available software but it is necessary to develop special techniques to enable it to be applied to this type of problem. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> containers subjected to internal and external loading will be subjected to stress, strain, deflection, and buckling to side panels. A Finite Element method of analysis of the panel was developed. The reaction of the panel to loading can be observed by means of this method. The failure of the container due to the loading can be predicted and the variability of the material and the panel can be changed arbitrarily to test and analyze different packaging designs. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and container elements were treated as engineering structures so the engineering concepts of stress, stain, equilibrium and compatibility could be applied. A Finite Element method using the ANSYS code made it possible to analyze the structure behaviour and helps to partly solve the design optimization process for a corrugated container. The project includes four main aspects: Finite Element analysis of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and container elements subjected to internal and external load. 2 <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> material tests. 3 Modelling of a package-contents system 4 Simulation of the products-cushion-package system The main area of research that is described in this thesis is concerned with developing the analytical and experimental methods to model and analyze the behaviour of packaging. This enables the size of the cushioning structure to be minimized and the cushioning and package material to be selected appropriately. The final stage of this project was to develop the techniques for the prediction of the susceptibility to damage to packaging systems particularly during the design stage, and to develop a comprehensive technique for the design and justification of the package system...|$|E

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} the {{performance}} testing of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes use some static or quasi-static characteristic of the box as the performance indicator. The aim of this project {{was to develop a}} performance-based test method for corrugated boxes for fresh horticultural produce, using a dynamic fatigue-type approach. It was hypothesised that a dynamic test is more appropriate for produce packaging due to the relatively dynamic nature of the produce distribution environment. Measurements were made of vibration, shock, temperature, relative humidity, and handling impacts in a typical produce distribution environment, and a dynamic performance test method was developed. It was concluded that this dynamic test method is more sensitive to performance differences between boxes than standard quasi-static methods. The dynamic tests, however, take considerably more time to conduct than standard quasi-static methods and are not suitable for automation. This dynamic test method may have uses in developing a database for the comparison of different box types, however for routine performance testing the quasistatic methods are more appropriate...|$|E

40|$|The {{compression}} strength and creep responses of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes after exposure to high and cyclic relative humidity conditions were studied and compared between boxes made from virgin and recycled liners and mediums {{which had the}} same ring crush values. The effect of moisture absorption rate by materials on the creep rate was investigated also. The results revealed that exposure to the high and cyclic relative humidity conditions {{used in this study}} caused significant reduction in {{compression strength}} for both box types. The cyclic condition was more detrimental. Recycled boxes experienced greater losses in compression strength than virgin boxes. Significant differences in final compression strength also existed between virgin and recycled boxes for three different humidities. The final compression strength was not only related to moisture content, but also related to the moisture content history of the boxes. It was found that there were significant differences in creep rate and survival time between virgin and recycled boxes. The cyclic conditions did not cause either a higher creep rate nor an earlier failure for either box type within the testing range...|$|E
40|$|The {{fresh food}} {{industry}} is increasingly {{more interested in}} developing efficient and innovative solutions to guarantee quality and distribution sustainability; {{one of the main}} factors that influences such crucial aspects is packaging.

The analysis features different economic assessments and models with different environmental impacts, taking into account the characteristics of packaging solutions predominantly within two supply chain types: the traditional food supply chain and the short food supply chain. The economic and environmental models are applied to understand the limitations of existing packaging solutions, to develop two alternative solutions and finally to perform an overall analysis of all fresh food containers, allowing the definition of the most suitable container for each of the proposed supply chain scenarios, from both an economic and environmental perspective.

40|$|Cooling {{of freshly}} {{harvested}} produce {{is crucial for}} maintaining a high product quality for a prolonged storage period and to reduce postharvest losses. Modelling the cooling process of packed horticultural produce provides a means for improving package designs and cooling operations. In this work, a methodology to more accurately model the cooling process of randomly stacked produce in packages is presented. First, a validated geometrical 3 D shape model generator of apple fruit is used to create realistic CAD models. The generator also considers the biological variability of the produce shape to create a database of more than 100 representative fruits of each cultivar. A discrete element model (DEM) then randomly selects surface meshed bodies from the database to simulate the gravitational packing of produce in a designated box or bin. The resulting stacking pattern of the produce is used to generate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model solves the airflow, heat and mass transfer through the packages to evaluate the aerodynamic and cooling performance of packages under different conditions and configurations. The difference between using actual 3 D fruit shapes and an approach using equivalent spheres is demonstrated in a simulation study of forced airflow cooling of apple fruit (cv. Braeburn) packed in a “Supervent” telescopic <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> package under typical precooling conditions. The results are analysed in terms of pressure drop characteristics, velocity profiles and distribution of cooling rates expressed by local surface heat transfer coefficients. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Egg {{packaging}} {{was tested}} {{to determine the}} relative protective ability of some presently available types and to identify and develop possible standard test procedures. Seven types of 12 -egg cartons underwent laboratory tests simulating transportation, handling, and storage conditions individually and in two different arrangements in 15 -carton packs (<b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes). In packs, crossed tiers of cartons protected eggs better than cartons all aligned in the same direction. One of {{the two types of}} moulded pulp cartons and one of the three types of expanded polystyrene cartons appeared very effective in preventing damage. One moulded pulp carton and one of the two other polystyrene cartons gave comparable, good protection inside the packs. The two types of chipboard cartons tested allowed a lot of damage to occur with the packs. In tests on individual cartons, one chipboard carton proved extremely ineffective and one polystyrene carton, not very effective, in preventing damage successfully prevented by the five other types of cartons. A simple, 12 -inch, flat drop of the packs on the bottom appeared to be the most effective single test to distinguish the protective abilities of the 14 different carton-and-pack combinations tested. Tests in which one end of an individual carton was raised and allowed to drop 6 inches onto its bottom or 3 inches onto its side effectively indicated the cartons ' relative protective abilities. There was a strong indication that—for moulded pulp and polystyrene cartons at least—carton design was more important than material in determining relative protective ability...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{strength}} and low density, the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> (CFB) box {{is one of}} the most popular types of packaging all over the world. This packaging device is able to fulfil a huge number of requirements of the logistic process, during the phases of handling, shipping and storage. In addition to this, corrugated packaging is easily machinable, so it is also suitable for special supply chains and products. These special needs include the requirement to fit to the inner measurements of the shipping device, e. g. the shipping container. This is particularly expected in case of less than container-load (LTL) shipments, where the shipping cost is usually based on the required area (m 2) or cubic capacity (m 3) of the container, so the useful filling of the shipping device is a very strong advantage. Naturally, this is easily solvable with different CFB boxes which have different heights, but this way the user needs to stock a high variety of boxes, requires a good relationship and cooperation between the parties and also a proper knowledge of product organisation in each box version. The multi-depth corrugated boxes are a suitable solution for resolving this problem. These boxes are creased at multiple intervals, so they are easily cuttable to the desired various heights. But the pre-scored lines can cause a loss of the compression strength capability of the box and thereby can lead to damages. The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of multiple creasing lines on the compression strength of the CFB box. This paper does not focus on the effect of either different creasing parameter, such as depth and width, nor on the distances between each creasing. Based on the test results, the compression strengths are decreased nearly significantly due to the additional creasing line(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{consumption}} and transportation gears {{the use of}} transport utilities which cause environmental effects over the globe. Environmental performance of three different types of pallets such as Re-load, plastic and <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> pallets are evaluated in this project. LCA tool is used to assess and compare their environmental performance in all phase of their life cycle but more focusing on end of life phase.   This study gives more emphasis to waste treatment options such as incineration, landfilling and recycling. Three different end of life scenarios {{have been used in}} this study such as 100 % incineration, 100 % landfilling and 100 % recycling.   This study includes results of all the phases of all three types of pallets which are analysed in this report. More detailed results could be seen in excel sheets. Results of impact analysis tells that landfilling contributes to 14793 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential in case of corrugated pallets. Incineration contributes to 12148. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling contributes to 7136 Kg CO 2 of global warming. Re-load pallets show the major contribution of global warming is from landfilling approx 813. 2 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling and incineration contribute to 438 Kg CO 2 and 726. 7 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. In plastic case incineration contributes the most to global warming approximate 1183. 8 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Landfilling and recycling contribute almost the same approximate 932. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential and 924. 5 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. Acidification impact show corrugated pallets cause high emissions when they are treat with landfilling and give negative values of incineration. In Eutriphication impact corrugated pallets are considered better in a sence they are inbetween 150 and 100 kg of PO- 4. Re-load pallets give the least values when they are applied to different end of life scenarios.   According to the results recycling could be replace other waste treatment options because of less impact through out the end of life. Secondly, Reload pallets represent a environmental friendly product which can be improved more after this study. Lack of LCI data is the major problem in this study because it is not easily accessible and it is very time consuming part of this study. Results might be different if more data is available.   This study can be helpful for further study, for instance more replaceable scenarios will show different results for all three types of pallets. Moreover, it helps to compare more pallet types which are already in the market or propose to come in the market...|$|E
