40|$|Designing for a {{wider range}} of {{population}} has recently been propagated by new design philosophies and approaches such as Universal Design, Design for All and Inclusive Design.

40|$|Over recent years, Unmanned Air Vehicles or UAVs {{have become}} a {{powerful}} tool for reconnaissance and surveillance tasks. These vehicles are now available in a broad size and <b>capability</b> <b>range</b> and are intended to fly in regions where the presence of onboard human pilots is either too risky or unnecessary. This paper describes the formulation and application of a design framework that supports the complex task of multidisciplinary design optimisation of UAVs systems via evolutionary computation. The framework includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a robust Evolutionary Algorithm optimiser named HAPEA, several design modules, mesh generators and post-processing capabilities in an integrated platform. These population –based algorithms such as EAs are good for cases problems where the search space can be multi-modal, non-convex or discontinuous, with multiple local minima and with noise, and also problems where we look for multiple solutions via Game Theory, namely a Nash equilibrium point or a Pareto set of non-dominated solutions. The application of the methodology is illustrated on conceptual and detailed multi-criteria and multidisciplinary shape design problems. Results indicate the practicality and robustness of the framework to find optimal shapes and trade—offs between the disciplinary analyses and to produce a set of non dominated solutions of an optimal Pareto front to the designer...|$|E

ISS enabling capability for research in cellular and molecular biology includes equipment for in situ, on-orbit analysis of biomolecules. Applications of this growing <b>capability</b> <b>range</b> from biomedicine and biotechnology to the emerging field of Omics. For example, Biomolecule Sequencer is a space-based miniature DNA sequencer that provides nucleotide sequence data for entire samples, which may be used for purposes such as microorganism identification and astrobiology. It complements the use of WetLab- 2 SmartCycler"TradeMark", which extracts RNA and provides real-time quantitative gene expression data analysis from biospecimens sampled or cultured onboard the ISS, for downlink to ground investigators, with applications ranging from clinical tissue evaluation to multigenerational assessment of organismal alterations. And the Genes in Space- 1 investigation, aimed at examining epigenetic changes, employs polymerase chain reaction to detect immune system alterations. In addition, an increasing assortment of tools to visualize the subcellular distribution of tagged macromolecules is becoming available onboard the ISS. For instance, the NASA LMM (Light Microscopy Module) is a flexible light microscopy imaging facility that enables imaging of physical and biological microscopic phenomena in microgravity. Another light microscopy system modified for use in space to image life sciences payloads is initially used by the Heart Cells investigation ("Effects of Microgravity on Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes for Human Cardiovascular Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery"). Also, the JAXA Microscope system can perform remotely controllable light, phase-contrast, and fluorescent observations. And upcoming confocal microscopy capability will allow for optical sectioning of biological tissues to determine microanatomical localization of biomarkers. Furthermore, NASA's geneLAB effort addresses integration of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets, by applying an innovative open source science platform for multi-investigator high throughput utilization of the ISS. In sum, the expanding ISS capability for analysis of biomolecules is enabling innovative research in a broad spectrum of areas such as cellular and molecular biology, biotechnology, tissue engineering, biomedicine, and Omics, providing manifold benefits for humanity...|$|E

40|$|Flexibility {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a key competitive advantage for any manufacturing firm. It is particularly important in the current manufacturing environment with growing dominance of high mix and low volume production. The characterization and measurement of the flexibility {{is the focus of}} this dissertation. The goal is to enable manufacturing professionals to plan, monitor and manage the flexibility of their manufacturing resources, particularly in situations when response is critical, the future demands are difficult to forecast and error tolerance is relatively small. To accomplish this goal, initially, attempts were made to understand the notion behind the flexibility. By departing from approaches accepted by contemporary researchers who view flexibility as directly linked with changes in the operating environment, or performance criteria, or both, this thesis considers flexibility as an independent measure. Taking the viewpoint that flexibility is an intrinsic nature of a manufacturing system, efforts have been made to characterize flexibility in the form of four flexibility descriptors, namely: capacity range, capacity response, <b>capability</b> <b>range,</b> and capability response. Based on the flexibility characterization, an approach to the measurement of flexibility at a given system level is defined. The discussion is mainly confined to the quantification of the descriptors at the workstation and at the work system level. The critical aspect is to identify the distinct capability regions based on critical capability drivers, and to model the relationship of capacity among the regions. This relationship is captured in the form of system of equations. The research results are validated by conducting several case studies in the garment industry. An application in the area of capacity planning is also presented. The comparisons were made with the traditional way of performing capacity planning in MRP systems. The results show that in most of the cases the traditional approach of capacity planning does not take advantage of the inherent flexibility resulted from the similarity of the resources leading to either under utilization or over utilization of resources. The approach of capability representation, which incorporates the flexibility offered by the resources into the resource planning, can overcome these limitations...|$|E
