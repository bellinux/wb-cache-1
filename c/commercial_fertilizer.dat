This {{study was designed to}} determine if switching to from inorganic to organic fertilizer could be profitable. We took a case study of users of <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> (UCOF) and users of inorganic fertilizer (UIF) in vegetable production. Nested sampling technique was used in selecting UCOF and UIF. Primary data on quantities and prices of vegetable production inputs and output were collected and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, partial budgetary technique and importance ranking. Results indicated both the UCOF and UIF used less than the recommended quantities of fertilizer and obtained less than the optimal yield. However, the UCOF on the average used more level of organic fertilizer that supply more soil nutrient though at higher cost. Yet they obtained higher vegetable yield (9169 kg?ha- 1) and a marginal rate of return of 229 %. However, either a marginal 2. 6 % decrease in each of yield or price of vegetable or a 32. 4 % increase in price of <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> will make <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> technology not superior to inorganic fertilizer.

This study determined the change in net income of users of <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> (UCOF) relative to non-users of fertilizers (NUF) in vegetable crop production in Osun State of Nigeria to fi nd out if its use should be encouraged based on economic reason only.

Analyses indicated that UCOF applied 610 kg ha- 1 of <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> resulting in additional yield (3, 375 kg ha- 1) and rate of returns (401 %) over and above the NUF, making the use of organic fertilizer technology economically superior to non-use of fertilizers.
