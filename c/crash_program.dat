5|$|After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{came into}} being in 1947 as a {{civilian}} agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised {{on a number of}} nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop an atomic weapon based on nuclear fusion—the hydrogen bomb—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.|$|E
5|$|Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean {{appointed}} Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{on the recommendation of}} Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him a truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, {{he was one of the}} few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, von Neumann {{became a}} {{commissioner}} of the AEC. He accepted this position {{and used it to}} further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, {{which turned out to be}} the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, October 26, Kennedy {{informed}} the EXCOMM {{that he believed}} only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. However, he was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure.

25|$|In the end, President Truman {{made the}} final decision, {{looking for a}} proper {{response}} to the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. On January 31, 1950, Truman announced a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop the hydrogen (fusion) bomb. At this point, however, the exact mechanism was still not known: the classical hydrogen bomb, whereby {{the heat of the}} fission bomb would be used to ignite the fusion material, seemed highly unworkable. However, an insight by Los Alamos mathematician Stanislaw Ulam showed that the fission bomb and the fusion fuel could be in separate parts of the bomb, and that radiation of the fission bomb could first work in a way to compress the fusion material before igniting it.|$|E
25|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1979, the LaRouche {{movement}} conducted most of its U.S. electoral activities as the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee. The name drew complaints from the Democratic Party's Democratic National Committee. Democratic Party leaders refused to recognize LaRouche as a party member, or to seat the few delegates he received in his seven primary campaigns as a Democrat. His campaign platforms included {{a return to the}} Bretton Woods system, including a gold-based national and world monetary system; fixed exchange rates; and ending the IMF. He supported the replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a national bank; a war on drug trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering; building a tunnel under the Bering Strait; the building of nuclear power plants; and a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to build particle beam weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). He opposed the Soviet Union and supported a military build-up to prepare for imminent war; supported the screening and quarantine of AIDS patients; and opposed environmentalism, deregulation, outcome-based education, and abortion.|$|E
500|$|Strauss found {{allies in}} Lawrence and Edward Teller, who had headed the [...] "Super" [...] group at Los Alamos during the war.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau decided to focus on a design that used something more mature than the jet engine, which was still at an experimental stage in the Soviet Union, and chose a mixed-power solution with the VRDK (Vozdushno-Reaktivny Dvigatel Kompressornyi – air reaction compressor jet) motorjet powered by the Klimov VK-107 V12 engine.

One of these projects was the [...] "Super", a nuclear weapon using nuclear fusion, which Edward Teller's F-1 group had worked on under Fermi's direction. The technical problem was figuring out a way to get a fusion reaction to initiate and propagate, which required temperatures attainable only with a fission bomb. The hydrodynamic calculations involved were daunting, and ENIAC was used to run a computer simulation of the Super in December 1945 and January 1946.|$|E

500|$|On October 9, 1941, {{shortly before}} the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{approved}} a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop an atomic bomb.

He was given the title [...] "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture", specifically referring to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory at his building in Berkeley.

On 1 November 1949, he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Following the revelation of the espionage activities of Klaus Fuchs in 1950, Loper and the Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, were asked to write {{a report on the}} impact of Klaus' activities. Their pessimistic report pessimistically concluded that Soviet Union's nuclear stockpile and production capacity could well be [...] "equal or actually superior to our own, both as to yields and numbers." [...] They added that the Soviets might develop, or had already developed, thermonuclear weapon. The Loper Memorandum, as it became known, was influential in persuading the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense, and ultimately the President to authorize a <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> to develop thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|Ulam {{still only}} gave the design a [...] "50–50 chance" [...] {{of success in}} February 1950. At the end of March, he {{reported}} {{that it would not}} work at all. Scientists like Hans Bethe and George Gamow felt that Teller had committed the nation to an expensive <b>crash</b> <b>program</b> {{on the basis of a}} model that he knew was flawed. However, in February 1951, Ulam had a new idea, in which the shock wave from an atomic bomb [...] "primary" [...] stage, through an arrangement he called [...] "hydrodynamic lensing", would compress a [...] "secondary" [...] stage of deuterium fusion fuel wrapped around a plutonium rod or [...] "spark plug". On being informed, Teller immediately grasped the potential for using the X-rays produced by the primary explosion for hydrodynamic lensing. This arrangement, which made thermonuclear weapons possible, is now known as the Teller-Ulam design. Although it was not what Truman had approved, the design did work, and was capable of producing multi-megaton explosions.
