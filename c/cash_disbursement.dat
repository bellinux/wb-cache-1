The chairmen are Bode George, Amb. Yerima Abdullahi; Peter Odili; Attahiru Bafarawa; Jim Nwobodo; Ahmadu Ali. The sum of ₦100million was given to each chairman. I gave the money in company of Prof. Alkali, who was Political Adviser to former president. The zonal chairmen are for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). I also instructed Jabbama Limited to transfer the sum of N100m to Dalhatu Limited on the request of Attahiru Bafarawa. I also remember that Bello Sarkin Yaki was among the people that the then NSA instructed that I send the sum of N200million to. He was the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kebbi State. I knew the chairman of Stallion Limited whose second name I cannot remember. Between December 2014 to June 2015, on the instruction of the then NSA, I introduced Jabbama Limited to a staff of the company on the instruction of the chairman.

He described the claim by Yuguda as “mischievous and deliberately fraudulent.”Bode's statement reads “My attention has been drawn to another mischievous and deliberately fraudulent claim that I collected N100 million from Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. This is another blatant falsehood, stripped of any iota of truth. This is yet again a depraved continuation of lynch mob journalism orchestrated by an online newspaper. The salient fact is that very early this year, long before the election period, the party set up Contact and Mobilization Committee for each zone to reconcile various factions and ensure a firm unity of purpose within the zones before the election. I was elected as the Chairman for the South-West zone. The committee which was made up of 18 senior members of the party with distinguished history of honour and exemplary leadership, met at least 10 times in my office in Lagos. These people travelled all the way from every corner of the South-West, with three members representing each state. All of them are very much alive to testify to my assertions. Sometime in the middle of these deliberations, Yuguda {{came to me and said}} the party was reimbursing the 18 elders of the committee for their transportation, accommodation and feeding allowance for the work that was done. The committee later submitted the report of its deliberations to the party and then wound up. For all these efforts Yuguda gave the committee only $30,000. That was less than N6 million at that time. Yuguda can never claim that he gave the Committee N100 million. That is the figment of the imagination of rascally scribblers purporting to be journalists. Again, facts are sacred.” ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: For better {{outcomes}} in {{mother and child}} health, Government of India launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005 with a major objective of providing accessible, affordable and quality health care to the rural population; especially the vulnerable. Reduction in MMR to 100 / 100, 000 {{is one of its}} goals and the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is the key strategy of NRHM to achieve this reduction. The JSY, as a safe motherhood intervention and modified alternative of the National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS), has been implemented in all states and Union territories with special focus on low performing states. The main objective and vision of JSY is to reduce maternal, neo-natal mortality and promote institutional delivery among the poor pregnant women of rural and urban areas. This scheme is 100 % centrally sponsored and has an integrated delivery and post delivery care {{with the help of a}} key person i. e. ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist), followed by cash monetary help to the women. Objectives: 1) To evaluate cash benefit service provided under JSY at different health care settings. 2) To know the perception and elicit suggestions of beneficiaries on quality of cash benefit scheme of JSY. Methodology: This is a health care institute based observational cross sectional study including randomly selected 200 JSY beneficiary mothers from the different health care settings i. e., Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, District Hospital and Medical College Hospital of Rewa District of Madhya Pradesh state. Data was collected with the help of set pro forma and then analysed with Epi Info 2000. Chi square test was applied appropriately.

The following econometric methods are employed: (1) Tobit, {{given the nature of}} the dividend data, and (2) the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to control for endogenous regressors. Significant positive variables found include size, return on assets (ROA), market to book, liquidity and profit growth. It can thus be inferred that larger firm size, profitability, market value, liquidity and profit growth correlate with greater firm pro pensity to distribute money to shareholders, thus supporting the theory of corporate finance. Significant negative variables found include leverage, liquidity squared, capex, beta and tag along 100 %. It is thus inferred that more significantly leveraged companies that invest more heavily in fixed assets and that exhibit high liquidity, higher risk and less conflict between controlling and minority shareholders will be less likely to pay dividends to shareholders. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{formulate}} a model prescribing optimal policy for <b>cash</b> <b>disbursements</b> and seasoned equity offerings {{taking into account}} the principal-agent problems inherent in these decisions. In order to discipline managers, stockholders demand that excess free cash flow be disbursed either as cash dividends or through stock repurchases.

However, as a consequence of withholding <b>cash</b> <b>disbursements,</b> managers incur disutility due to the possibility that their control of the firm could be threatened by the market for corporate control.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} a new theoretical explanation for stock repurchases. Investors may {{disagree with the}} manager about the firm’s investment projects. A repurchase causes {{a change in the}} investor base as investors {{who are most likely to}} disagree with the manager tender their shares. Therefore, a firm is more likely to buy back shares when the level of investor-management agreement is lower, and agreement improves as a consequence. Moreover, dispersion of opinion among investors cannot explain repurchase activity once the stock price and investor-management agreement are controlled for. Overall, the evidence is consistent with firms strategically using repurchases to improve alignment between management and shareholders. (JEL G 30, G 35) The past two decades have seen dramatic changes in corporate payout policy. In particular, stock repurchases have increased in popularity, while the proportion of dividend-paying firms has declined (Fama and French 2001; Grullon and Michaely 2002; Skinner 2008). 1 Although in a Modigliani and Miller (1958) world, a firm’s payout mix does not matter for firm value, an interesting question is what sort of frictions would cause a firm to prefer <b>cash</b> <b>disbursement</b> throug...|$|E

In depth interviews, focus group discussions and household surveys were done for data collection. Results: Lack of awareness about ACI scheme amongst general population and beneficiaries, cumbersome <b>cash</b> <b>disbursement</b> procedure, intricate eligibility criteria, extensive paper work, and insufficient focus on community involvement were the major implementation challenges. There were anecdotal reports of political interference and possible scope for corruption.

No cause and effect association could be proven by this study. Conclusions: Poor planning and coordination, and lack of public awareness about the scheme resulted in low utilization. Thus, proper IEC and training, detailed implementation plan, orientation training for implementer, sufficient budgetary allocation, and community participation should be an integral part for successful implementation of any such scheme.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to extend}} the work by Vafeas and Lie and Lie by {{developing}} an empirical model of choice among four alternative mechanisms for distributing cash from corporations to shareholders: a fixed-price self-tender offer, a Dutch auction self-tender offer, an open market share repurchase, and a special dividend. Design/methodology/approach – A multinomial logit (MNL) model adapted for choice-based sampling is {{used to examine the}} factors that influence a firm's choice among the four methods. Findings – Firms {{with a high degree of}} heterogeneity in shareholder valuations tend to select an open market repurchase, while firms with low levels of heterogeneity choose a special dividend. Firms already paying high dividends are more likely to issue a special dividend than institute an open market repurchase. A firm with poor stock performance prior to the announcement is more likely to choose a fixed-price self-tender offer or open market share repurchase. On the other hand, firms are more likely to follow strong performance with a special dividend. Contrary to Persons' model, it is found that firms facing a takeover threat are more likely to choose a fixed-price tender offer than a Dutch auction. Practical implications – It is shown that the ownership structure, current payout level; the size of the distribution, and the degree of stock undervaluation are among the most important determinants of a firm's choice among alternative payout methods.
