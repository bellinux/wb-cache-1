5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
25|$|The ducks, geese, and swans are small- to large-sized {{birds with}} a broad and {{elongated}} general body plan. Diving species vary from this in being rounder. Extant species {{range in size from}} the cotton pygmy goose, at as little as 26.5cm (10.5in) and 164g (5.8oz), to the trumpeter swan, at as much as 183cm (6ft) and 17.2kg (38lb). The wings are short and pointed, and supported by strong wing muscles that generate rapid beats in flight. They typically have long necks, although this varies in degree between species. The legs are short, strong, and set far {{to the back of the}} body (more so in the more aquatic species), and have a leathery feel with a scaly texture. Combined with their body shape, this <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> species awkward on land, but they are stronger walkers than other marine and water birds such as grebes or petrels. They typically have webbed feet, though a few species such as the Nene have secondarily lost their webbing. The bills are made of soft keratin with a thin and sensitive layer of skin on top (which has a leathery feel when touched). For most species, the shape of the bill tends to be more flattened to a greater or lesser extent. These contain serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species.|$|E

500|$|As {{the album}} was not {{released}} outside of Sweden, it attracted little attention from overseas music critics. However, John Lucas did review the album on behalf of AllMusic, writing that [...] "there are no truly weak moments" [...] and praised it for being [...] "much more organic and mature" [...] than Robyn Is Here. On the other hand, he felt it lacked [...] "instant" [...] and [...] "irresistible" [...] hooks and criticised the [...] "uniformity of sound that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> songs drift in and out without really making any impression". He concluded, [...] "Not a commercial blockbuster then, nor a perfect listen, but this album does mark an important step forward for Robyn as an artist." [...] A negative opinion came from music critic Robert Christgau, who considered My Truth [...] "as strained as you might fear", and used it {{as an example of}} Robyn's [...] "awkward stage that hits teenpop stars like clockwork".|$|E
500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game, playable from either a first or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam {{over the land}} of Skyrim, which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which allows them to warp to previously discovered locations. The game's main quest can be completed or ignored at the player's preference after {{the first stage of}} the quest is finished. However, some quests rely on the main storyline being at least partially completed. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways; the player may engage them in conversation, marry an eligible NPC, kill them, or engage in a nonlethal [...] "brawl". As in previous The Elder Scrolls games, killing certain NPCs <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> quests or items unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be killed due to their importance in later storylines. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is tracked independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Should the player be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist arrest which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. NPCs may offer the player additional side-quests, and some side-quests have parameters adjusted based on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. Some NPCs who are befriended or hired by the player may act as companions, who will accompany the player and aid them in combat. The player may choose to join factions, which are organized groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Each of the factions has an associated quest path to progress through. Each city and town in the game world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as farming.|$|E

Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just takes a while to get used to– still allowing that the extra clarity <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E

He said, [...] "I reveled in the sheer {{brilliance}} of how much energy and gameplay mileage Nintendo has packed into every world." [...] Otero's only complaint was that [...] "the camera becomes a slight obstacle in four-player multiplayer". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.5, praising its gameplay and presentation, while criticizing camera issues and some odd control choices. GamesRadar gave the game a score of 4.5/5, praising improved multiplayer and some moments so brilliant that they <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> other levels seem dull by comparison. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game [...] "a terrific Mario game... just {{not a very good}} Wii U game", praising the game itself, but lamenting that it doesn't do much to show off the Wii U's capabilities.

[...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record!

We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
