The compound VLX 600 was recently identified to target quiescent tumor cells and to inhibit mitochondrial respiration. We here performed gene expression analysis in order to characterize the cellular response to VLX 600. The compound-specific signature of VLX 600 revealed a striking similarity to signatures generated by compounds known to <b>chelate</b> <b>iron.</b> Validation experiments including addition of ferrous and ferric iron in excess, EXAFS measurements, and structure activity relationship analyses showed that VLX 600 <b>chelates</b> <b>iron</b> and supported {{the hypothesis that the}} biological effects of this compound is due to iron chelation. Compounds that <b>chelate</b> <b>iron</b> possess anti-cancer activity, an effect largely attributed to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase in proliferating cells. Here we show that iron chelators decrease mitochondrial energy production, an effect poorly tolerated by metabolically stressed tumor cells. These pleiotropic features make iron chelators an attractive option for the treatment of solid tumors containing heterogeneous populations of proliferating and quiescent cells.

However, when mixed with iron (II), {{it is capable of}} forming the sulfate radical (SO 4 -.) that has an even higher redox potential (E-o = 2. 6 V). In these studies the sulfate radical was investigated to determine if it was a feasible oxidant for the destruction of BTEX and PAH compounds found in MGP contaminated soil. The sulfate radical was generated by either the sequential addition of iron (II) solutions or by a single addition of a citric acid <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> (II) solution. The sequentially added iron destroyed 86 % of the total BTEX concentration and 56 % of the total PAH concentration in the soil.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> supplementation on gestating and lactating sows and on their suckling and weaned piglets. Reproductive traits, piglet performance, hematological parameters, and the iron concentrations in colostrum, milk, and stillborn livers were measured. Ninety-six sows were subjected to one of three treatment groups. Group T 1 comprised pregnant and lactating sows treated with diets supplemented with inorganic iron (551 mg Fe/kg) and suckling piglets administered 200 mg of injectable iron dextran. Group T 2 was the same as T 1, except that sows after 84 days of gestation, lactating sows, and suckling piglets were fed a diet supplemented with 150 mg Fe/kg of <b>chelated</b> <b>iron,</b> and suckling piglets were administered injectable iron dextran. Group T 3 was the same as T 2 but without injectable iron dextran for suckling piglets. During the nursery phase, all of the weaned piglets were penned with their original groups or treatments and received isonutritive and isocaloric feeds. Piglets from the T 2 and T 3 groups also received an additional 150 mg Fe/kg of <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> via their feed. There were no differences among the treatments for reproductive traits or the iron concentrations in the colostrum, milk, or liver. The piglets that did not receive the injectable iron dextran showed the poorest performance during the pre-and post-weaning phases and showed the poorest hematological parameters of the suckling piglets. The <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> supplementation is insufficient to meet piglet demand. The iron dextran supply is necessary for suckling and weaned piglets...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the type of solvent and time on efficiency of the extraction of polyphenols and antioxidant properties extracts obtained from green tea. Extraction was conducted at room temperature using four solvents: water and 80 % ethanol, 80 % methanol and 80 % acetone (water solutions, v/v) at 15, 30 and 60 minutes.

The current study used two laboratory based biological assay techniques {{to test whether}} the addition of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen enhanced L. majuscula growth. A three-way analysis of variance showed all nutrients stimulated L. majuscula filament growth and biomass under laboratory conditions, with organically <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> (FeEDTA) >> phosphorus > nitrogen.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that iron {{plays an important role}} in tissue damage both during chronic iron overload diseases (i. e., hemochromatosis) and when, in the absence of actual tissue iron overload, iron is delocalised from specific carriers or intracellular sites (inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, post-ischaemic reperfusion, etc.). In order to be used for therapeutical purposes in vivo, a reliable iron chelator should be capable of preventing the undesired effects that follow the electrochemical activation of iron (see below). Bearing in mind the molecular structure of some flavonols that are able to <b>chelate</b> <b>iron,</b> we synthesised a new oral iron-chelator, 2 -methyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 H-benzopyran- 4 -one (MCOH). We demonstrate that MCOH <b>chelates</b> <b>iron</b> in a 2 : 1 ratio showing a stability constant of similar to 10 (10). MCOH is able to cross cell membranes (erythrocytes, ascite tumour cells) in both directions. Following intraperitoneal administration to rats, it is quickly taken up by the liver and excreted in the urine within 24 h. A similar behaviour has been documented after oral administration. We propose that MCOH may represent the prototype of a new class of <b>iron</b> <b>chelating</b> agents to be developed for iron-removal therapy in vivo with the goal of preventing tissue damage caused by the iron redox cycle.

Over the past decade, nuisance blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula have increased in frequency and severity in south-east Queensland, Australia, with blooms in Moreton Bay hypothesised to be linked to increased inputs of dissolved nutrients and organic carbon from land-based sources. An in situ field experiment was conducted in northern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay), Australia, to determine the growth response of L. majuscula to phosphorus, nitrogen and organically <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> additions to the water column. A three-way analysis of variance showed each of these nutrients stimulated L. majuscula biomass under field conditions, with organically <b>chelated</b> <b>iron</b> (FeEDTA) > phosphorus > nitrogen. Concurrent addition of all three nutrients [FeEDTA + P + N] caused the greatest response being 18 times the control after 49 days; this resulted in an additional 928 g m of L. majuscula biomass over the control (54 g m). These results show that water borne nutrients, particularly organically <b>chelated</b> <b>iron,</b> phosphorus and nitrogen can promote prolific growth of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium L. majuscula. It is also likely that the addition of iron and/or phosphorus stimulated nitrogen fixation in L. majuscula, based on the large L. majuscula biomass and higher tissue nitrogen content in the iron and phosphorus treatments. Enrichment with poultry litter (sourced from the adjacent catchment) also substantially enhanced L. majuscula biomass. The experiment shows that a precautionary approach to limit or reduce nutrient additions to streams, estuaries and coastal waters is justified; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay in the future...|$|E
