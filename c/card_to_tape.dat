50|$|The UNIVAC <b>Card</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tape</b> {{converter}} read {{punched cards}} at 240 cards per minute and wrote their data on metal UNIVAC magnetic tape using a UNISERVO tape drive.|$|E
5000|$|The UNIVAC I was {{the first}} American {{computer}} designed at the outset for business and administrative use with fast execution of relatively simple arithmetic and data transport operations, {{as opposed to the}} complex numerical calculations required of scientific computers. As such the UNIVAC competed directly against punch-card machines, though the UNIVAC originally could neither read nor punch cards. That shortcoming hindered sales to companies concerned about the high cost of manually converting large quantities of existing data stored on cards. This was corrected by adding offline card processing equipment, the UNIVAC <b>Card</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tape</b> converter and the UNIVAC Tape to Card converter, to transfer data between cards and UNIVAC magnetic tapes. [...] However, the early market share of the UNIVAC I was lower than the Remington Rand Company wished.|$|E
50|$|Keypunches {{and punched}} cards were still {{commonly}} used for both data and program entry through the 1970s but were rapidly made obsolete {{by changes in}} the entry paradigm and by the availability of inexpensive CRT computer terminals. Eliminating the step of transferring punched <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> <b>tape</b> or disk (with {{the added benefit of}} saving the cost of the cards themselves) allowed for improved checking and correction during the entry process. The development of video display terminals, interactive timeshared systems and, later, personal computers allowed those who originated the data or program to enter it directly instead of writing it on forms to be entered by keypunch operators.|$|R
40|$|Report {{issued by}} the University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory {{discussing}} a method of updating library circulation records on an IBM 1401 computer. The report describes the methods of generating and updating the records using transaction <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> create computer <b>tapes</b> that are sorted and updated to prepare current reports of circulation information...|$|R
5000|$|Commonly used {{by small}} {{businesses}} {{as their primary}} data processing machines, the 1401 was also frequently used as an off-line peripheral controller for mainframe computers. In such installations, with an IBM 7090 for example, the mainframe computers used only magnetic tape for input-output. It was the 1401 that transferred input data from slow peripherals (such as the IBM 1402 <b>Card</b> Read-Punch) <b>to</b> <b>tape,</b> and transferred output data from <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> the <b>card</b> punch, the IBM 1403 Printer, or other peripherals. This allowed the mainframe's throughput to not be limited by {{the speed of a}} card reader or printer. (For more information, see Spooling.) ...|$|R
50|$|A typical UNIVAC I {{installation}} {{had several}} ancillary devices. There were, typically: a printer that read a magnetic tape and printed output on continuous-form paper; a card-to-tape converter, that read punched cards and recorded their images on magnetic tape; and a tape-to-card converter, that read a magnetic tape and produced punched cards. There was no UNIVAC provided operating system. Operators loaded on a UNISERVO a program tape {{which could be}} loaded automatically by processor logic. The appropriate source and output data tapes would be mounted and the program started. Results tapes {{then went to the}} offline printer or typically for data processing into short term storage to be updated with the next set of data produced on the offline <b>card</b> <b>to</b> <b>tape</b> unit. The mercury delay line memory tank temperature was very closely controlled as the speed of sound in mercury varies with temperature. In the event of a power failure, many hours could elapse before the temperature stabilized.|$|E
50|$|Besides the operator's console, {{the only}} I/O devices {{connected}} to the UNIVAC I were up to 10 UNISERVO tape drives, a Remington Standard electric typewriter and a Tektronix oscilloscope. The UNISERVO was the first commercial computer tape drive commercially sold. It used data density 128 bits per inch (with real transfer rate 7,200 characters per second) on magnetically plated phosphor bronze tapes. The UNISERVO could also read and write UNITYPER created tapes at 20 bits per inch. The UNITYPER was an offline typewriter to tape device, used by programmers and for minor data editing. Backward and forward tape read and write operations were possible on the UNIVAC and were fully overlapped with instruction execution, permitting high system throughput in typical sort/merge data processing applications. Large volumes of data could be submitted as input via magnetic tapes created on offline <b>card</b> <b>to</b> <b>tape</b> system and made as output via a separate offline tape to printer system. The operators console had three columns of decimal coded switches that allowed any of the 1000 memory locations to be displayed on the oscilloscope. Since the mercury delay line memory stored bits in a serial format, a programmer or operator could monitor any memory location continuously and with sufficient patience, decode its contents as displayed on the scope. The on-line typewriter was typically used for announcing program breakpoints, checkpoints, and for memory dumps.|$|E
50|$|The Climatic Center at Andrews AFB {{continued}} to provide climatological data applications under various designations throughout the decade, with {{particular emphasis on}} the war in Korea and the strategic buildup necessitated by the Cold War. Detachment 3, Headquarters Air Weather Service (the Postweather Analysis Division) was organized on 1 May 1954 at Andrews. On 18 December 1957 the AWS merged the Climatic Analysis Division and the Data Integration Branch with Detachment 3 in spaces at Suitland, Maryland formerly occupied by the USAF Weather Central. On 1 April 1959, Detachment 3 (the Climatic Center) moved from Suitland to the Washington Navy Yard (Annex 2, at 225 D. Street, Southeast) on the Potomac River. At this time, IBM electronic accounting equipment installed at the Climatic Center allowed data processing directly from punched <b>card</b> <b>to</b> <b>tape.</b> Physical space necessary to store the growing punched card libraries was dwindling. As a result, the Statistical Services Division in New Orleans moved to Asheville, North Carolina in 1952 and was renamed the Data Control Division. In 1956, the first electronic computer became operational at Asheville, signaling the end for the high-speed electronic accounting machines (mostly IBM) used since World War II to process climatological data. Starting on 11 December 1957 the Climatic Center, USAF became a function within the 2150th Air Weather Squadron.|$|E
5000|$|Peripherals device {{have always}} been much slower than core {{processing}} units. This was an especially severe problem for early mainframes. For example, a job which read punched cards or generated printed output directly was forced to run {{at the speed of}} the slow mechanical devices. The first spooling programs, such as IBM's [...] "SPOOL System" [...] (7070-IO-076) copied data from punched <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> magnetic <b>tape,</b> and from <b>tape</b> back <b>to</b> punched <b>cards</b> and printers. Hard disks, which are even faster and support random access, started to replace this use of magnetic tape in the middle 1960s, and by the 1970s had eliminated this use of tape.|$|R

These have been standardised into a format which is uniform across companies and across years. The data for the early years originate with the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) : subsequent years come from the Board of Trade/Department of Trade and Industry. DTI's main objective in assembling these accounts has been to provide figures for short-run analyses of particular industries or of the company sector as a whole. The Cambridge version makes these data more suitable for longer-term analysis. This has involved, for example, transferring data for early years in the series from punched <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> magnetic <b>tape,</b> converting the accounting schemes of different periods into a single format and adding information to the computerised records. The series begins in 1948 with the new disclosure requirements of the 1948 Companies Act, and ends in 1990 when the Government discontinued their analysis of company accounts...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{suggested that this}} usage dates {{from the days when}} punched cards and/or punched tape were common. Card and paper-tape punches each had a receptacle for the 'chips' punched from the <b>cards</b> or <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> create the holes (rectangular in a card, round in a paper tape), which often looked like a bucket and was known by this name. By analogy it was jokingly suggested that the CPU, which in those days was an equipment rack of similar size to a large peripheral unit, contained a similar receptacle for lost data.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "Data Management" [...] {{arose in the}} 1980s as {{technology}} moved from sequential processing (first <b>cards,</b> then <b>tape)</b> <b>to</b> random access processing. Since it was now technically possible to store a single fact in a single place and access that using random access disk, those suggesting that [...] "Data Management" [...] {{was more important than}} [...] "Process Management" [...] used arguments such as [...] "a customer's home address is stored in 75 (or some other large number) places in our computer systems." [...] During this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting [...] "Process Management" [...] was more important than [...] "Data Management" [...] used batch processing time as their primary argument. As applications moved into real-time, interactive applications, it became obvious to most practitioners that both management processes were important. If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process wasn't well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} of magnetic recording, which {{is involved in}} most aspects of modem life from credit <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> video <b>tapes,</b> is evolving at an ever quickening pace. As the industry strives to produce greater recording capacity and increased information density the demands {{on the development of}} improved magnetic storage and recording head materials cannot always keep up with the pace of change. The materials being considered are not only required to have the desired magnetic properties but also to have the necessary corrosion resistance in the operating environment. It is often the latter which can limit the rate of development of new devices since many of the new materials considered for magnetic storage applications consist of very reactive metals with low corrosion resistances. In establishing how research on the corrosion properties of new magnetic materials should be approached, two different experimental routes are explored in this thesis. These studies were a) a combined electrochemical and surface analysis study and b) a novel 'in-situ' SIMS study. The electrochemical study proved to be a very valuable route in obtaining information on the corrosion properties of the magnetically-active alloy FeMn and such a study can be highly recommended for the application to other magnetic materials. The complete electrochemical properties (anodic and cathodic) of FeMn were determined. A region of passivity was revealed through the application of the very sensitive solution analysis technique of ICPMS. The passive layer is associated with a manganese hydroxide rich surface layer. Passivity in the alloy is very vulnerable to corrosion attack by sodium sulphate active ions. The influence of temperature and pH was investigated. Only under low values of pH with the conditions investigated was the corrosion attack increased compared to neutral conditions. The application of sodium chromate inhibitor was found to enhance the passive layer formed. Using the second route the application of a novel 'in-situ' SIMS technique to look at the oxidation properties of magnetic metals and alloys was explored. The interpretation of the SIMS data for the oxidised and unoxidised components of cobalt was achieved and a model for the reaction of cobalt with oxygen at the initial stages of oxidation was successfully produced. At this present stage {{it is not possible to}} model the oxidation of more reactive metals than cobalt...|$|R
