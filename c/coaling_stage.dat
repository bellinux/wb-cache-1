25|$|In 2011, {{a purpose}} built railway works {{was built on}} the site of the old GWR <b>coaling</b> <b>stage.</b> This now allows the railway to carry out hevy {{maintenance}} and restorations on its stock. It also allows contract workto be undertaken. The works has an apprentice school.|$|E
25|$|For steam-hauled trains, the Llanberis shunt {{movement}} {{includes a}} trip to the water crane and <b>coaling</b> <b>stage</b> outside the locomotive shed. At Halfway Station steam locomotives also take water from a water crane, fed from a large tank located just above the station. For emergency use another large water tank is situated near Clogwyn Station which can feed two water cranes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{engine shed}} was closed in 1893, {{and a new}} eight-road standard GWR pattern shed {{along the lines of}} those at Salisbury and Exeter—with northlight pattern roof—was constructed under the initial code NA. The <b>coaling</b> <b>stage</b> was a non-standard wooden trussed lean-to affair, with the coaling ramp level with the yard, while the approach roads where the locomotives were refueled some [...] below yard level. This made adding an ash shelter later during World War II especially easy. The single [...] standard over-girder pattern turntable was installed in 1926.|$|E
2500|$|There {{had been}} a {{locomotive}} depot at Westbourne Park since 1855, which {{was replaced by the}} Old Oak Common depot in 1906. To avoid the need for locomotives to make the [...] round trip from Paddington just to be turned, coaled and watered, a small maintenance facility for locomotives was constructed on the southern side of the line, directly opposite Royal Oak station, which occupied part of the site of Westbourne Lodge and its grounds. It was known as Ranelagh Bridge depot, and opened in 1907. There was a turntable, a water tower, a <b>coaling</b> <b>stage</b> and sidings where about 15 locomotives could be held awaiting their next trip west. The turntable was removed in April 1964, and the depot facilities were altered to suit Diesel locomotives; the depot closed in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|A coal {{storage shed}} was {{attached}} to the locomotive shed, which was extended in 1882 using materials from the dismantled Kaitoke goods shed. [...] In 1889, the locomotive shed was extended, but by 1899 operational requirements meant that further storage space was required. [...] With insufficient room to extend the locomotive shed on its existing site, a new four-road depot was constructed – with a fitter’s workshop attached to the western side – {{at the north end of}} the yard. [...] The Locomotive Foreman’s office was built in 1914 on a bank above the engine shed. [...] A <b>coaling</b> <b>stage</b> was provided alongside one of the roads to the engine shed, from which coal was shovelled into the Fell locomotives. [...] A shelter and pit were installed on a nearby siding which was used for changing the brake blocks on the Fell brake vans.|$|E

50|$|The name Emerald {{was taken}} from a nearby property, Emerald Downs. In 1880 a goods shed and sheepyards were erected, and a <b>coal</b> <b>stage</b> in 1881. In 1882 an engine shed, fitting shop and smithy were erected. By 1885, with the {{building}} of the Clermont branch, a small repair shop and a new <b>coal</b> <b>stage</b> had also been built. In 1895 a contract was let for extension of the engine shed. Nothing is known of the original station building except that its removal to Raglan and Bajool was approved in 1903.|$|R

50|$|A <b>coaling</b> tower, <b>coal</b> <b>stage</b> or <b>coaling</b> {{station is}} a {{facility}} used to load coal as fuel into railway steam locomotives. Coaling towers were often sited at motive power depots or locomotive maintenance shops.|$|R

50|$|A wooden {{water tank}} was {{positioned}} outside the locomotive shed from the station's opening, {{being replaced by}} a standard GWR water tank with decorative supports and <b>coaling</b> <b>stage</b> underneath in 1899; this itself {{was replaced by a}} Braithwaite tank in the mid-1950s.|$|E
50|$|Designated by the GWR as the divisional shed of the Cardiff Valleys Division, {{under the}} Loans and Guarantees Act (1929): the track layout was improved; a new {{corrugated}} roof installed; {{and a new}} ramp added to the GWR standard-pattern single-road <b>coaling</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1951, the ex-LNWR shed {{was reduced}} in scale by half its width, {{to allow the}} {{construction}} of a new 2-road straight diesel shed in its place. The LNWR <b>coal</b> <b>stage</b> was removed, meaning all coaling moved to the southern GWR coalstage. A new diesel fueling stage was built on the entrance throat to the new diesel depot.|$|R
50|$|A modern concrete-fabricated {{motive power}} depot was opened by the Southern Railway on 10 September 1933 to service its new {{marshalling}} yard at Hither Green.
