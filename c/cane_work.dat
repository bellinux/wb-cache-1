40|$|The sugar {{production}} {{in the state of}} Alagoas (Brazil) has been sustained fundamentally by the sugar cane`s manual cutting. Given the growing mechanization introduced in this activity, the present article has the objective to annotate its effects on the morphology of sugar <b>cane</b> <b>work,</b> {{as well as on the}} (re) configuration of that labour market. Under both aspects, we elaborate on the labour movement through a significant number of rural workers, occulted until then, by the sociological visibility and constituted by the informal sugarcane workers under the social reproduction of sugar cane planters. Under the current restructuring process of the sugar production, the analysis also seeks to point out the complexity and heterogeneity of the universe of sugar cane labour through the permanence of traditional forms of activity as specificities that are combined with the universalizing characteristics of precarization and flexibilization that affect the wage relationship contemporarily. A produção açucareira em Alagoas se sustenta fundamentalmente no corte manual da cana. Face a crescente mecanização dessa atividade, o artigo visa anotar seus efeitos na morfologia do trabalho canavieiro, bem como na (re) configuração deste mercado laboral. Sob ambos os aspectos, apresentamos ainda o movimento laboral de uma significativa parcela de trabalhadores/as até então submersa à visibilidade sociológica e constituída pelos canavieiros/as informalmente assalariados/as sob a reprodução social dos fornecedores de cana. Sob o recente processo de reestruturação da produção açucareira, a análise procura apontar a complexidade e a heterogeneidade do universo laboral canavieiro mediante a permanência de formas tradicionais como especificidades que se combinam com as características universalizantes da precarização e da flexibilização que atingem a relação salarial contemporaneamente...|$|E

Essas características pressupõem a necessidade de ações que preservem a saúde. Algumas medidas são obrigatórias, como as citadas na Norma Regulamentadora- 31, e outras, de livre adesão, como as mencionadas no Compromisso Nacional para Aperfeiçoar as Condições do Trabalho na Cana-de-açúcar.

30|$|TAP communities’ {{persistence}} in retaining transhumant cattle, albeit in decline, {{could also be}} because cattle can be moved to safer places where resources are available, thus offering a flexibility which is not possible with crops. Relying solely on crops increases peoples’ vulnerability at times of bad weather such as droughts or frosts, and such events are indicated to be occurring with increased frequency (BBS 2012 a, b;Penjor 2001;Tenzin 2012). In addition, TAP communities seem to have realised the environmental, technological and market limitations of becoming a settled economy or being solely dependent on their TAP cattle. Therefore, these herders have diversified their income sources by engaging in the orange transport business, taking up various forms of petty trades, <b>cane</b> <b>works</b> and tourist services, {{as a means of}} spreading risk. This trend of seeking diversification in livelihood activities amongst pastoralists is common in other countries. Pastoralists in Africa, for example, often diversify and take up trades in the construction industry, business and petty trade. While some diversification may be out of necessity for destitute pastoralists, the better-off herders do it to spread risk and increase income sources (Homewood et al. 2012).|$|R
