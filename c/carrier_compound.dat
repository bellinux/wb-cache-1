40|$|Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is {{a binary}} cancer therapy {{particularly}} well-suited to treating aggressive tumours that exhibit {{a high degree}} of infiltration of the surrounding healthy tissue. Such tumours, for example of the brain and lung, provide some of the most challenging problems in oncology. The first element of the therapy is boron- 10 which is preferentially introduced into the cancerous cells using a <b>carrier</b> <b>compound.</b> Boron- 10 has a very high capture cross-section with the other element of the therapy, thermal neutrons, resulting in the production of a lithium nucleus and an alpha particle which destroy the cell they are created in. However, a large flux of neutrons is required and until recently the only source used was a nuclear reactor. In Birmingham, studies of an existing BNCT facility using a 2. 8 MeV proton beam and a solid lithium target {{have found a way to}} increase the beam power to a sufficient level to allow clinical trials, while maintaining the target solid. In this paper, we will introduce BNCT, describe the work in Birmingham and compare with other accelerator-driven BNCT projects around the World...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} review {{progress}} on {{two aspects of}} the Birmingham BNCT project. Firstly on evaluation {{of the effects of}} high and low LET radiations when delivered simultaneously, and secondly on attempts to optimise delivery of the boron <b>carrier</b> <b>compound</b> BPA through pharmacokinetic studies. Simultaneous or non-simultaneous irradiations of V 79 cells with alpha-particle and X-ray irradiations were performed. Alpha doses of 2 and 2. 5 Gy were chosen and the impact on survival when delivered separately or simultaneously with variable doses of X-rays was evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of the delivery of a new formulation of BPA (BPA-mannitol) are being investigated in brain tumour patients through a study with 2 × 2 design featuring intravenous and intracarotid artery infusion of BPA, with or without a mannitol bolus. On the combined effect of low and high LET radiations, a synergistic effect was observed when alpha and X-ray doses are delivered simultaneously. The effect is only present at the 2. 5 Gy alpha dose and is a very substantial effect on both the shape of the survival curve and the level of cell killing. This indicates that the alpha component may have the effect of inhibiting the repair of damage from the low LET radiation dose delivered simultaneously. On the pharmacokinetics of BPA, data on the first three cohorts indicate that bioavailability of BPA in brain ECF is increased substantially through the addition of a mannitol bolus, {{as well as by the}} use of intracarotid artery route of infusion. In both cases, for some patients the levels after infusion approach those seen in blood, whereas the ECF levels for intravenous infusion without mannitol are typically less than 10 % of the blood values...|$|E

Dyeing - adsorption is conducted under different conditions, and the concentration of dyes, mass of the substrate, recipes and time of dyeing were being varied.

There is the continuity of growth of the amount of bound dye to the mass of the absorbent.

Methods In exp. 1, 24 male lambs of about 15 ± 2. 6 d age and initial body weight (BW) of 5. 52 ± 0. 6 kg were randomly allocated into three groups. One group received control diet without additives, and remainders received control diet supplemented with 0. 5 or 1 g PRO/lamb/d. Daily feed intake and biweekly BW were recorded. In exp. 2, five lambs, (initial BW = 29. 72 ± 1. 15 kg, age = 6. 54 ± 0. 32 mo) were used as experimental animals in a digestion trial. They were fed the same diets as in Exp. 1. Results The supplementation of PRO {{did not result in}} any significant differences in milk intake, average daily gain (ADG), or total gain between treatments during the pre-weaning period. Total dry matter intake tended to be greater (p = 0. 07) with addition of PRO in the post-weaning diets. During post-weaning phase, the final BW, ADG, total gain, and feed conversion ratio of the lambs receiving PRO treatments tended to be greater (p≤ 0. 10) than the control group. Addition of PRO in post-weaning diet decreased (p≤ 0. 01) blood urea and cholesterol concentrations. With the exception of ether extract digestibility, all nutrients digestibility were improved with inclusion PRO in the post-weaning diets. Conclusion Lambs that received PRO in post-weaning diet appeared to show a better performance than lambs in pre-weaning period.

40|$|Facioscapulohumeral muscular {{dystrophy}} (FSHD) {{is the third}} most common myopathy. The disease has been causally related to deletion of tandemly arrayed 3. 3 kb repeat units (D 4 Z 4) on chromosome 4 q 35. The number of D 4 Z 4 repeats varies from 11 to 150 in the general population, whereas less than 11 repeats are present in sporadic and familial FSHD patients. The number of D 4 Z 4 repeats is thus considered diagnostic for the disease. However, since molecular analysis has become a widely used tool for FSHD diagnosis, several observations have emerged to complicate the evaluation of FSHD patients and genotype-phenotype correlation. The great variability of FSHD clinical outcome {{appears to be more}} pronounced than expected with the presence of non-penetrant gene <b>carrier.</b> <b>Compound</b> heterozygous patients for the FSHD-sized alleles have also been described as well as FSHD subjects carrying D 4 Z 4 alleles of 38 – 45 kb in size, considered a borderline D 4 Z 4 allele present also in the normal population. Moreover, analysis of a bi-allelic polymorphism telomeric to D 4 Z 4, 4 qA/ 4 qB, revealed that all FSHD patients carry exclusively the 4 qA allele. Collectively, these observations indicate that the prevalence of D 4 Z 4 deletions might be higher than expected and several factors might influence the clinical outcome in FSHD patients. Our specific aims are: 1. To define the clinical and molecular features of a large Italian population of subjects affected by FSHD and investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation in FSHD. 2. To examine and characterize FSHD-like myopathic patients not carrying the D 4 Z 4 pathognomonic mutation.

40|$|AbstractRadionuclides {{reach the}} {{environment}} from natural or anthropogenic sources and are equilibrating over time with different phases through sorption and precipitation reactions onto inorganic phases and macromolecular natural organic matter (NOM). Strong binding to NOM can occur by chelation of clustered binding sites (i. e., binding sites from different branches in the macromolecule) {{in the absence}} of conventional chelating sites. Despite many years of research and strong evidence of its significance, transport of many radionuclides is still modeled without taking into consideration NOM as a redox regulator and a sorbent or chelating agent. Microbially mediated chelation and incorporation reactions can control a number of radionuclides, e. g., plutonium (Pu) and iodine (I) isotopes, leading to retardation or mobilization, depending on whether the <b>carrier</b> <b>compound</b> is in solution or particle-bound. The presence of NOM in contaminated soils complicates conventional remediation techniques for I, where base has been added to either increase the cation exchange capacity of soils or to promote direct co-precipitation of the cationic radionuclide in the waste stream. Even though Pu at waste sites {{did not have to be}} remediated, base addition would likely also bring surprises. This addition may then have unexpected consequences; while promoting the immobilization of inorganic Pu, it has been shown to also remobilize inorganic-I and low-molecular weight organic compounds that are bound to I and Pu. Iodine occurs in multiple oxidation states in aquatic systems, existing not only as inorganic species (iodide (I−) and iodate (IO 3 −)), but also as organic species where I is covalently bound to aromatic moieties. Thus, stable iodine, 127 I, and its long-lived isotope, 129 I, a major by-product of nuclear fission, undergo complex biogeochemical cycling in the environment, which renders them less mobile than when assuming that all I is in the form of the highly mobile form of iodide. In the laboratory and the field, plutonium strongly associates with NOM, when present, and is strongly chelated by specific moieties such as hydroxamate siderophores and other N-containing compounds. As a consequence, its mobility is controlled by the transport behavior of the anionic organic forms rather than the much more strongly sorbing cationic form of Pu(IV). NOM, even at trace levels, can play a significant role in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides...|$|E

40|$|Recently fluoroalcohols {{have been}} {{suggested}} as substitutes for CFCs. These fluid compounds {{have been developed to}} replace CFCs in applications such as the cleaning of electronic components, refrigeration and <b>carrier</b> <b>compounds</b> for lubricants. Since fluoroalcohols contain an abstractable hydrogen atom, they can react with hydroxyl radicals, initiating their atmospheric degradation. In order to determine the environmental impact of releases of fluoroalcohols, their rates of reaction with the OH radical and their oxidation products are required. This study involves an investigation on the kinetics and mechanisms for the reaction of OH radicals and Cl atoms with 3, 3, 3 trifluoropropanol. The atmospheric lifetime of this fluorinated alcohol with respect to reaction with OH is around 11 days and hence its contribution to radiative forcing will be small. The major primary oxidation product was the aldehyde CF 3 CH 2 CHO, which was fairly rapidly removed from the system in secondary reactions to produce trifluoroacetaldehyde. At longer reaction times, CF 3 CHO was also consumed to generate the eventual oxidation product CF 2 O which is relatively soluble and will be removed from the atmosphere by uptake in cloud or rainwater...|$|R
40|$|Zeolites and {{molecular}} sieves are finding applications {{in many areas}} of catalysis due to appreciable acid activity, shape selectivity, and ion-exchange capacity, as they possess an unbalanced framework charge. For catalytic applications, zeolites become more valuable as the ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 increases. Acid resistance and thermal stability of zeolite are both improved with increasing SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3. This part of the thesis deals with the control of morphology focused on decreasing the crystal diameter of mordenite zeolite and to increase the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio by changing synthesis conditions. A high SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio (SAR 15) of mordenite was prepared in a very short reaction time. We studied the role of hydroxide in the crystallization of the mordenite as a structure director, nucleation time modifier, and crystallite aggregate enhancer. The formation of nano-aggregates of mordenites was greatly enhanced using a combination of alcohol additives and conventional heating. Mordenite nucleation was also increased without using alcohols when microwave heating was employed, but the alcohols further accelerated the nucleation process. The different heating techniques affected the morphology; microwave heating produced crystallites of ∼ 40 nm, while the conventional hydrothermal method formed larger size crystallites of ∼ 88 nm. We controlled {{the size and shape of}} the mordenite crystals because they have important implications in hydrocarbon conversion and separation processes. Mordenite synthesized showed jellyfish, acicular, flower, and wheat grain like structures. ^ In the second part of this thesis, a phase transition was successfully achieved from TiO 2 particles to titanate nanotubes by the breakage of Ti-O bonds and the creation of oxygen vacancies without using expensive precursors, high temperatures, high chemical concentrations of alkaline solutions, and long synthesis times. A combination of anatase nano-particles/titanate nano-tubes was synthesized using TiO 2 (anatase) and a temperature of only 100 °C. When TiO 2 (P- 25) was used with the same concentration of alkaline solution (1 molar NaOH), the same processing time of 12 hours, and a higher temperature at 110 °C, only titanate nano-tubes were observed. The linkages of 2 ̆ 7 Ti-O 2 ̆ 7 play a very important role in the structural features of different phases. Two crystalline phases (tetragonal and monoclinic) were synthesized as products in the case of TiO 2 (anatase) and one crystalline phase (monoclinic) for products of TiO 2 (P- 25). ^ The third part of the thesis concerns surface modification of hydrophobic fluoropolymers that have low surface energies and are very difficult to metallize. Surface modification was done to enhance surface roughness and hence to boost surface energy for metallization processes. We used low impact, environmentally friendly non-thermal plasmas at atmospheric pressure to strip off F - ions and replace them with reactive unsaturated hydrocarbon functionalities such as CH=CH 2 on the surface of a polymer. As these hydrocarbon functionalities are reactive with metals, they form composites that have good adhesion between layers of polymer. Due to surface modification, polymeric chains were broken by the loss of fluorine atoms (F/C = 0. 33) and the gain of oxygen atoms (O/C = 0. 17) using methane/argon plasmas. Methane/hydrogen/argon plasmas on the other hand produced extensive loss of fluorine atoms (F/C = 0. 07 - 0. 33) and gain of oxygen atoms (O/C = 0. 08 - 0. 16) that was far better than pristine PFA. The surface of PFA was modified by defluorination and oxidation. Further enhancement of COF and COO groups revealed that the surface was modified to a hydrophilic membrane that can further be easily hydrolyzed to COOH in the presence of atmospheric humidity. ^ The last part of the thesis deals with ammonia borane which was studied as a potential source of hydrogen for fuel cells. We analyzed the viability of ammonia borane as a hydrogen <b>carrier</b> <b>compound</b> for fuel cell applications using a thermolysis method.

When the density of available receptors is low, the demand of the radiotracer MA increased, in order to avoid partial saturation of the receptor population (i.e., mass effect or deviation from the tracer concept).

Forty-seven analogs of the carbacephalosporin loracarbef and the cephalosporin cephalexin were prepared to evaluate the structural features necessary for uptake by this transport <b>carrier.</b> <b>Compounds</b> were evaluated for their antibacterial activities and for their ability to inhibit 1 mM cephalexin uptake and, subsequently, uptake into Caco- 2 cells. Three clinically evaluated orally absorbed carbacephems were taken up by Caco- 2 cells, consistent with their excellent bioavailability in humans. Although the carrier preferred the L stereoisomer, these compounds lacked antibacterial activity and were hydrolyzed intracellularly in Caco- 2 cells. Compounds modified at the 3 position of cephalexin and loracarbef with a cyclopropyl or a trifluoromethyl group inhibited cephalexin uptake. Analogs with lipophilic groups on the primary amine of the side chain inhibited cephalexin uptake, retained activity against gram-positive bacteria but lost activity against gram-negative bacteria. Substitution of the phenylglycl side chain with phenylacetyl side chains gave similar results. Compounds which lacked an aromatic ring in the side chain inhibited cephalexin uptake but lost all antibacterial activity. Thus, the phenylglycl side chain is not absolutely required for uptake. Different structural features are required for antibacterial activity and for being a substrate of the transporter. Competition studies with cephalexin indicate that human intestinal Caco- 2 cells may be a useful model system for initially guiding structure-activity relationships for the rational design of new oral agents...|$|R
30|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a biologically and {{physically}} targeted radiation therapy for tumors with the nuclear capture reaction of boron- 10 (10 B) specifically accumulating in tumor cells. The irradiation of low-energy thermal neutrons to 10 B produces high-energy α (4 He) particles and lithium ions (7 Li), leading to cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. Due to the shorter track ranges of these particles (9 and 4  μm for α particles and 7 Li ions, respectively) than {{the diameter of}} tumor cells, adjacent normal cells are expected to remain unaffected when these particles are emitted from tumor cells (for a review, see [1]). Two low molecular weight 10 B <b>carrier</b> <b>compounds,</b> sodium sulfhydryl borane (BSH) [2] and L- 4 -boronophenylalanine conjugated with fructose (L-BPA-Fr) [3], have been clinically applied. BSH enters tumor cells by passive diffusion through the cell membrane [4 – 6]. L-BPA and its F- 18 -labeled PET probe L- 18 F-FBPA [7 – 12] are transported into tumor cells through L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT 1) [11 – 13] and amino acid transporter B 0,+ (ATB 0,+) [13], {{both of which are}} strongly upregulated in tumor cells [13, 14]. Since L-BPA accumulates in tumor cells with a low target tumor to non-target normal brain tissue ratio (TBR) [6], L- 18 F-FBPA was developed to predict the exact concentration of 10 B-BPA in tumor cells prior to BNCT [7 – 12]. The combined use of PET and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry confirmed that L- 18 F-FBPA-PET has the ability to estimate 10 B concentrations delivered by L-BPA in the tumor and normal tissues of rats [10, 15] and humans [8].|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{interest in}} {{high energy density}} batteries has increased due {{to the development of}} electrical vehicles. The current state-of-art batteries can hardly provide sufficient energy {{to meet the challenges of}} the next generation technologies, including transportation. Lithium–air battery chemistry offers the highest energy density among other chemistries. However, several obstacles need to be overcome before the Li–air battery can be considered feasible. One of the challenges is low oxygen availability at the cathode of the cell. The ability of aprotic polar solvents to transport oxygen is a crucial parameter, which determines the energy and power capacities of the cell 1. Specifically, the organic electrolyte precludes the occurrence of three-phase gas/electrolyte/catalyst interface and since oxygen solubility is low in most of organic electrolytes, and non-availability of the reagent (oxygen) makes it impossible to use all cathode surface and volume. This circumstance substantially reduces the Li-air cell discharge and current performance. PFCs (Perfluorocarbons), added directly to the non-aqueous electrolyte, has been shown to enhance the O 2 solubility in the electrolyte and significantly improving the rate capability of the air electrode for Li–air batteries 2. Based on the "two phase reaction zone " model 3, we hereby introduce a new approach for providing high oxygen solubility and diffusivity in the Li-air system using PFC. We successfully demonstrate that air cathode impregnated with oxygen <b>carriers</b> <b>compounds,</b> PFC, substantially increases the cathode discharge capacity and improves the Li-air overvoltage.

The change of variables in this study were the concentration of the feed phase at various dilution i. e., 100 x, 50 x and 10 x, the thickness of the membrane i. e., 25 μm, 20 μm and 10 μm, and the time of membrane using i. e., 1, 2 and 3 times. The concentration of chromium (VI) diffused after separation process was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The stability of membrane was observed by analyzing the presence of membrane’s component in the feed phase and in the receiver phase. The analysis was conducted by UV-Vis spectrophotometry.

30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, liposomes have {{received}} widespread attention as <b>carrier</b> <b>compounds</b> for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes. Liposomes, first described by Bangham and co-workers, are spherical vesicles which form when phospholipids are exposed to an aqueous environment [28, 29]. The lipid components of liposomes are predominantly phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine). However, other compounds {{can be added to}} liposomal preparation to provide more stability to the vesicles, such as cholesterol [30]. Because of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core volume, liposomes are suitable for encapsulating hydrophobic agents in the lipid shell, hydrophilic agents in the aqueous core, and amphiphilic agents distributed through the hydrophobic/hydrophilic domains. Typically, liposomes can be classified according to their size, charge, and lipid composition. In regard to size, liposomes can be divided into three categories: small unilamellar vesicles or SUV (25 to 100 nm), large unilamellar vesicles or LUV (> 100 nm), and multilamellar vesicles or MLV (100 to 1, 000 nm) [31]. When superficial charge is considered, liposomes can be neutral or charged. Liposomes that are negatively or positively charged have been reported to have shorter half-lives, some toxicity, and rapid blood clearance [32, 33]. At least three different classes of liposomal composition are described: (1) Conventional liposomes or the first generation of liposomes are composed of natural phospholipids or lipids. Addition of cholesterol to conventional liposomes has been attempted in order to improve bilayer stability. However, these kinds of liposomes have encountered several challenges, including high instability in plasma, which results in short blood circulation half-life [9, 34]. (2) Stealth liposomes or long-circulanting liposomes were synthesized by conjugating hydrophilic polymers, which increase their circulation half-life [9 – 11]. (3) Targeted liposomes have been engineered with different types of target moieties, such as antibodies, peptides, folic acid, and carbohydrate. Indeed, targeted liposomes are able to increase the concentration of the therapeutic or diagnostic agent in specific tissues/cells that overexpress the target receptors, antigens, or unregulated selectins [35 – 38]. A new generation of liposomes (e.g., stimuli-sensitive) has been developed in order to improve drug delivery. One example is a pH-sensitive liposome used to improve the endosomal release of a drug-loaded liposome into the cytoplasm [39, 40].|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{continuing}} interest in identifying low-penetrance genes which {{are associated with}} an increased susceptibility to common types of cancer, including malignant melanoma. Methods: We sought to examine the association between four VDR common variants (rs 1544410, rs 731236, rs 10735810, rs 4516035) and the risk of melanoma in the Polish population. We also determined the prevalence of <b>compound</b> <b>carriers</b> of VDR and known MM genetic risk factors MC 1 R and CDKN 2 A (A 148 T) variants. We examined 763 unselected melanoma cases, 763 healthy adults matched for sex and age with the melanoma cases and 777 newborns. Results: None of the VDR variants alone or as <b>compound</b> <b>carriers</b> of two or more of the VDR genotypes were associated with MM risk. There were no major differences between the prevalences of the examined variants among patients with MM on UV-exposed and UV-non exposed skin areas, as well as among early-onset and late-onset cases. We found no association between VDR and MC 1 R or between VDR and CDKN 2 A common variants. A statistically significant over-representation of one VDR haplotype: rs 731236 _A + rs 1544410 _T (OR = 3. 2, p = 0. 02) was detected. Linkage disequilibrium of rs 1544410 and rs 731236 was confirmed. Conclusion: To answer the question, whether VDR can be regarded as melanoma susceptibility gene, additional, large multi-center association studies have to be performed...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: [61 Cu]TATS {{was prepared}} using copper- 61 acetate and in-house made ligand (TATS) in one step. 61 Cu was produced via the natZn(p,x) 61 Cu nuclear reaction (180 µA, 22 MeV, 3. 2 h) followed by a two-step chromatography method (222 GBq of 61 Cu 2 +). [61 Cu]TATS preparation was opti-mized for reaction conditions (buffer concentration and temper-ature). The tracer was finally administered to normal rats for bio-distribution studies. RESULTS: Total radiolabelling of the tracer took 30 minutes with a radiochemical purity of more than 90 % (using HPLC and RTLC) and specific activity of about 250 – 300 Ci/mmol. The complex was stable {{in the presence of}} human serum for an hour. The biodistribution of copper cation and the tracer was checked in wild-type rats for up to 2 hours with significant spleen and lung uptake of the tracer.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} protein p 53, the "guardian of the genome", is inactivated {{in nearly}} all cancer types by mutations in the TP 53 gene or by overexpression of its negative regulators, oncoproteins MDM 2 /MDMX. Recovery of p 53 function by disrupting the p 53 -MDM 2 /MDMX interaction using small-molecule antagonists could provide an efficient nongenotoxic anticancer therapy. Here we present the syntheses, activities, and crystal structures of the p 53 -MDM 2 /MDMX inhibitors based on the 1, 4, 5 -trisubstituted imidazole scaffold which are appended with aliphatic linkers that enable coupling to bioactive <b>carriers.</b> The <b>compounds</b> have favorable properties at both biochemical and cellular levels. The most effective compound 19 is a tight binder of MDM 2 and activates p 53 in cancer cells that express the wild-type p 53, leading to cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. Crystal structures reveal that compound 19 induces MDM 2 dimerization via the aliphatic linker. This unique dimerization-binding mode opens new prospects for the optimization of the p 53 -MDM 2 /MDMX inhibitors and conjugation with bioactive carriers...|$|R
40|$|We report {{thermoelectric}} {{measurements of}} the low <b>carrier</b> heavy fermion <b>compound</b> URu 2 Si 2 at high fields up to 34 T and at low temperatures down to 500 mK. The field dependence of the thermoelectric power (TEP) and the Nernst signal shows successive anomalies deep inside the hidden order (HO) phase. The field position of these anomalies correspond to different changes in the Shubnikov-de Haas frequencies and effective masses around 12 T, 17 T, 23 T and 30 T. These results indicate successive reconstructions of the Fermi surface, which imply electronic phase transitions well within the HO phase. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Natural polysaccharides {{alginate}} and chitosan {{have been}} used extensively, separately or in mixtures (systems), in manufacturing of pharmaceutical products (antimicrobial) and not only. Alginates usually serve as basis for antimicrobial systems, while chitosan, in certain proportions, enhances their physicochemical and antimicrobial properties. Focusing on the recent literature (mostly since 2000), this review outlines the main synthetic approaches for the preparation of systems based on both polymers as well as identify potential areas of their application as antimicrobial agents. Various techniques used for systems preparation like microparticles, films, fibers, nanoparticles, sponges, applications and usefulness of these systems as <b>carriers</b> of antimicrobial <b>compounds</b> will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMembers of the {{mitochondrial}} <b>carrier</b> family transport <b>compounds</b> {{over the}} inner mitochondrial membrane {{to link the}} biochemical pathways in the cytosol {{with those in the}} mitochondrial matrix. X-ray crystallography has recently provided us with the first atomic model of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier, which is a member of this family. The structure explains the typical three-fold sequence repeats and signature motif of mitochondrial carriers. However, the carrier was crystallised as a monomer in detergent, which is inconsistent with the consensus that mitochondrial carriers exist as homo-dimers. The projection structure of the yeast ADP/ATP carrier by electron crystallography shows that carriers could form homo-dimers in the membrane...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{drastically}} reduce CO$_{ 2 }$ emissions {{will lead}} to the transformation of our current, carbon-based energy system to a more sustainable, renewable-based one. In this process, hydrogen will gain increasing importance as secondary energy vector. Energy storage requirements on the TWh scale (to bridge extended times of low wind and sun harvest) and global logistics of renewable energy equivalents will create additional driving forces toward a future hydrogen economy. However, the nature of hydrogen requires dedicated infrastructures, and this has prevented so far the introduction of elemental hydrogen into the energy sector to a large extent. Recent scientific and technological progress in handling hydrogen in chemically bound form as liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) supports the technological vision that a future hydrogen economy may work without handling large amounts of elemental hydrogen. LOHC systems are composed of pairs of hydrogen-lean and hydrogen-rich organic compounds that store hydrogen by repeated catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation cycles. While hydrogen handling in the form of LOHCs allows for using the existing infrastructure for fuels, it also builds on the existing public confidence in dealing with liquid energy carriers. In contrast to hydrogen storage by hydrogenation of gases, such as CO$_{ 2 }$ or N$_{ 2 }$, hydrogen release from LOHC systems produces pure hydrogen after condensation of the high-boiling <b>carrier</b> <b>compounds.</b> This Account highlights the current state-of-the-art in hydrogen storage using LOHC systems. It first introduces fundamental aspects of a future hydrogen economy and derives therefrom requirements for suitable LOHC compounds. Molecular structures that have been successfully applied in the literature are presented, and their property profiles are discussed. Fundamental and applied aspects of the involved hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis are discussed, characteristic differences for the catalytic conversion of pure hydrocarbon and nitrogen-containing LOHC compounds are derived from the literature, and attractive future research directions are highlighted. Finally, applications of the LOHC technology are presented. This part covers stationary energy storage (on-grid and off-grid), hydrogen logistics, and on-board hydrogen production for mobile applications. Technology readiness of these fields is very different. For stationary energy storage systems, the feasibility of the LOHC technology has been recently proven in commercial demonstrators, and cost aspects will decide on their further commercial success. For other highly attractive options, such as, hydrogen delivery to hydrogen filling stations or direct-LOHC-fuel cell applications, significant efforts in fundamental and applied research are still needed and, hopefully, encouraged by this Account...|$|R
40|$|Direct and {{efficient}} thermoelectric conversion of solar or geothermal waste heat into electricity requires {{the development of}} p- and n-type thermoelectrics with similar materials properties. Perovskite-type transition metal-oxides and oxynitrides are investigated as potential candidates for thermoelectric devices operating at high temperatures as they can possess large positive as well as large negative thermopower depending on their composition. Cobaltates, ferrates and nickelates with p-type conductivity and n-type titanates, molybdates and manganates are considered {{for the development of}} an ceramic thermoelectric converter. Nitridation of perovskite-type titanates and molybdates offers an alternative route to control the carrier concentration, band structure and mobility of charge <b>carriers</b> of the <b>compounds</b> which leads to further possibi-lities to tune the thermoelectric properties...|$|R

The chemoattractant secreted from the cumulus cells is the steroid progesterone, shown to be effective at the picomolar range. The chemoattractant secreted from the oocyte is even more potent. It is a hydrophobic non-peptide molecule which, when secreted from the oocyte, is in complex with a <b>carrier</b> protein Additional <b>compounds</b> have been shown to act as chemoattractants for mammalian spermatozoa.
