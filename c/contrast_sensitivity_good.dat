40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions in <b>good</b> eyes of strabismic and anisometropic amblyopic subjects. Material and methods: <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was assessed on both eyes of 20 strabismic, 20 anisometropic amblyopic and 10 normal control patients. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{was measured with}} Functional Acuity Contrast Test. Correlation analysis and student t test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Mean age was 8, 9 in strabismic ambliyopes 8, 7 in anisometropic ambliyopes and 12, 3 in control group (p> 0, 05). Mean corrected visual acuity for amblyopic eyes was 0, 46 in strabismic ambliyopes and 0, 41 in anisometropic ambliyopes (p> 0, 05). <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions from <b>good</b> eyes demonstrated lower values compared with control patients (p> 0, 05). While normal <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function in low spatial frequencies on good eyes was measured, decreased <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values in high spatial frequencies on good eyes were measured in 50 % (10 cases) of strabismic amblyopes and 70 % (14 cases) of anisometropic amblyopes (p> 0, 05). Conclusion: We conclude that the good eye is not normal {{and there was no}} statistically significant difference in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values between strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes. We believe in that the assessment of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions can provide important information on the visual function and can be useful in follow-up of amblyopic patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a psychophysical paradigm for the clinical {{assessment of the}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (CS) mediated by the ON- and OFF-systems of the Magnocellular and Parvocellular pathways. We designed a stimulus considering two dimensions: two spatial frequencies (0. 5 and 4. 5 cpd) and two temporal rates of flicker (33 ms and 1500 ms). To evidence the ON- and OFF responses, the CS was measured for two polarities of light with luminance changes of 0. 6 dB steps {{above and below the}} medium luminance grey background. We tested 38 healthy volunteers. The results shows that Magnocellular <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was higher than Parvocellular for the 33 ms flickering stimulus and the Parvocellular <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was higher than Magnocellular for 1500 ms stimuli. The reliability of the test was checked and confirmed. We concluded that the test performs a rapid measurement of the CS mediated by the ON and OFF systems of Magnocellular and Parvocellular pathways. It is useful in clinical protocols due to its high <b>sensitivity</b> and <b>good</b> reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{luminance}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function {{has been}} investigated using behavioral and electrophysiological methods in many vertebrate species. Some features are conserved across species as a shape of the function, but other features, such as the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> peak value, spatial frequency <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> peak, and visual acuity have changed. Here, we review <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> across different classes of vertebrates, {{with an emphasis on}} the frequency <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> peak and visual acuity. We also correlate the data obtained from the literature to test the power of the association between visual acuity and the spatial frequency of the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function peak...|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is {{determined}} {{by his or her}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person's <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function is <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is at about 4 cycles per degree of visual angle. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the results}} of a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> exam, a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve can be plotted, with angular {{frequency}} on the horizontal, and contrast threshold on the vertical axis. Also known as <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function (CSF), the plot demonstrates the normal range of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and will indicate diminished <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in patients who fall below the normal curve. Some graphs contain “contrast sensitivity acuity equivalents”, with lower acuity values falling in the area under the curve. In patients with normal visual acuity and concomitant reduced <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> the area under the curve serves as a graphical representation of the visual deficit. It can be because of this impairment in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that patients have difficulty driving at night, climbing stairs and other activities of daily living in which contrast is reduced.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} defocus on <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{as a function of}} age in healthy subjects, the through focus <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was measured in 100 healthy subjects aged 20 - 69. Defocus-specific changes in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> reflect age-related changes in the optics of the eye. Tests were performed in cycloplegic eyes varying artificial pupil size (2, 4 and 6 mm), defocus (- 1 to + 2 D), and spatial frequency (1 - 16 cpd). Integrated <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was taken as a measure for the total amount of Visual information transferred by the optical media. At optimal focus, integrated <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and log <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 8 cpd showed a significant age-related decline. The log <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 1 cpd appeared to be independent of age. The depth of focus for a 4 -mm pupil increased significantly with age, even though <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at + 2 D defocus decreases with age too, {{but not as much as}} the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at optimal focus. Our study indicates that the effect of defocus on <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> decreases with age; this was attributed to age-related changes in the optical media.

40|$|The <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 19 healthy normal {{subjects}} was measured before {{and immediately after}} 10 minutes of controlled exercise on an exercise bicycle. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was measured with an adaptive procedure, which is relatively free of decision criteria effects {{and the rate of}} false positive responses was recorded. Ten of these 19 subjects then formed a control group, where <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was measured before and after a 10 -minute period of rest.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is impaired in patients with clinical depression and that depression is correlated with high neuroticism. This study investigated the effect of depression and personality types on <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in non-clinical participants. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> thresholds were obtained for 22 participants via a 2 -alternative forced choice task. A median split based on depression scores measured through the BDI-II revealed a significant difference of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> between participants with high and low depression scores, where participants with higher scores in the BDI-II showed higher <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> thresholds (p= 0. 014). No significant difference in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was found based on personality measures, despite finding a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and depression scores (p= 0. 0458).

40|$|Objectives: To compare LASIK and LASEK for the {{correction}} of myopia and myopic astigmatism {{in terms of}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Materials and Methods: Sixty eyes of 30 patients who underwent LASIK and 60 eyes of 30 patients who underwent LASEK for myopia and myopic astigmatism at the Excimer Laser Center of Dokuz Eylül University, Faculty of Medicine, were included in this study. Mean best-corrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values were noted before surgery. Mean uncorrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values were evaluated 1 month and 6 months after surgery {{as well as at}} the last exam. Complications were noted. The results of LASIK and LASEK groups were compared. Results: The two groups were similar in terms of age and gender. No significant difference was noted between the mean preoperative best-corrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values of the two groups. Mean uncorrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values were not significantly different at the first and sixth months. Mean last exam time was 13. 4 (9 - 36) months. Also at the last exam, mean uncorrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values were not significantly different. Mean uncorrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values at the last exam were higher than the preoperative mean best-corrected <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values in both LASIK and LASEK groups. Conclusion: Both LASIK and LASEK for {{the correction}} of myopia and myopic astigmatism seem to be safe procedures in terms of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> when performed to appropriate patients.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} {{relationships among}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function, ocular higher-order aberration, and myopic correction in eyes undergoing overnight orthokeratology for myopia. METHODS. A prospective {{study was conducted}} in 46 eyes of 23 patients undergoing orthokeratology. Inclusion criteria were spherical equivalent refraction between – 1. 00 and – 4. 00 diopters (D), refractive astigmatism up to 1. 00 D, and best-corrected visual acuity of 20 / 20 or better. Ocular higher-order aberrations and <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function were determined before and 3 months after initiation of the procedure. We measured three indices of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function: <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> low-contrast visual acuity, and letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with the CSV- 1000 charts (Vector Vision Co., Greenville, OH). Area under the log <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function (AULCSF) was calculated from the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> data. RESULTS. Orthokeratology significantly improved logMAR uncorrected visual acuity (P � 0. 0001; paired t-test) but significantly increased ocular higher-order aberrations (P � 0. 0001) and decreased <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function, including AULCSF (P � 0. 0001), low-contrast visual acuity (P � 0. 0025), and letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (P � 0. 0001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

For all four observers, transient covert attention had both a benefit and a cost: it enhanced <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at the cued location and impaired <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at the uncued location at both parafoveal and peripheral positions. These results are consistent with the idea of limited resources, and indicate that transient attention helps control the expenditure of cortical computation...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} was studied between spatial <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function {{and type of}} pathology of the visual system. Two characteristics {{were found to be}} typical for amblyopia: there is a discrepancy between the high-frequency cut-off ('grating acuity') and the Snellen acuity; the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is strongly dependent on the width of the stimulus. In optic nerve degeneration a decrease in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is found at low spatial frequencies. Decreased <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at high spatial frequencies is atypical but occurs in those disorders associated with decreased Snellen visual acuity. From these findings a relationship is defined which enables spatial <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> tests to be used to differentiate between amblyopia and optic nerve degeneration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} visual function and ocular surface regularity in dry eye. Methods: We enrolled 52 eyes of 52 dry eye patients (34 dry eyes with superficial punctate keratopathy [SPK] in the central corneal region [central SPK] and 18 dry eyes without central SPK) and 20 eyes of 20 normal control subjects. All eyes had a best-corrected distance visual acuity better than 20 / 20. We measured two indices of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function under photopic conditions: <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The area under the log <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function (AULCSF) was calculated from the obtained <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> data.

Results: Dry eyes with central SPK had significantly decreased <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function, including AULCSF and letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than those without central SPK and normal eyes (P < 0. 05 for each). While the straylight values in both dry eye groups did not differ, straylight values were greater than those in normal eyes (P < 0. 05 for both).

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effect of lens induced defocus on the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function in myopes and non-myopes. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for up to 20 spatial frequencies ranging from 1 to 20 c/deg was measured with vertical sine wave gratings under cycloplegia {{at different levels of}} positive and negative defocus in myopes and non-myopes. In non-myopes the reduction in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> increased in a systematic fashion as the amount of defocus increased. This reduction was similar for positive and negative lenses of the same power (p= 0. 474). Myopes showed a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> loss that was significantly greater with positive defocus compared to negative defocus (p= 0. 001). The magnitude of the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> loss was also dependent on the spatial frequency tested for both positive and negative defocus. There was significantly greater <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> loss in non-myopes than in myopes at low-medium spatial frequencies (1 – 8 c/deg) with negative defocus. Latent accommodation was ruled out as a contributor to this difference in myopes and non-myopes. In another experiment, ocular aberrations were measured under cycloplegia using a Shack–Hartmann aberrometer. Modulation transfer functions were calculated using the second order term for defocus as well as the fourth order Zernike term for spherical aberration. The theoretical maximal <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> based on aberration data predicted the measured asymmetry in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to positive and negative defocus that was observed in myopic subjects. The observed asymmetry in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with positive and negative defocus in myopes may be linked to the altered accommodative response observed in this group...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPerceptual {{learning}} {{has been documented}} in adult humans {{over a wide range}} of tasks. Although the often-observed specificity of learning is generally interpreted as evidence for training-induced plasticity in early cortical areas, physiological evidence for training-induced changes in early visual cortical areas is modest, despite reports of learning-induced changes of cortical activities in fMRI studies. To reveal the physiological bases of perceptual learning, we combined psychophysical measurements with extracellular single-unit recording under anesthetized preparations and examined the effects of training in grating orientation identification on both perceptual and neuronal <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions of cats. ResultsWe have found that training significantly improved perceptual <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the cats to gratings with spatial frequencies near the “trained” spatial frequency, with stronger effects in the trained eye. Consistent with behavioral assessments, the mean <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of neurons recorded from V 1 of the trained cats was significantly higher than that of neurons recorded from the untrained cats. Furthermore, in the trained cats, the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of V 1 neurons responding preferentially to stimuli presented via the trained eyes was significantly greater than that of neurons responding preferentially to stimuli presented via the “untrained” eyes. The effect was confined to the trained spatial frequencies. In both trained and untrained cats, the neuronal <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions derived from the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the individual neurons were highly correlated with behaviorally determined perceptual <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions. ConclusionsWe suggest that training-induced neuronal contrast gain in area V 1 underlies behaviorally determined perceptual <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> improvements...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} cataract type and severity in eyes with pure types of age-related lens opacities on visual acuity (VA) and <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the presence and absence of glare conditions. Methods: Sixty patients with senile cataracts aged 40 years or older with no other ocular pathologies were evaluated for VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with and without glare. Lens opacities were classified according to the Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) III. VA was measured using the Snellen chart. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was measured with the Vector Vision CSV- 1000 E chart in the presence and absence of glare by calculating the area under log <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (log CS) function (AULCSF). Results: Cataracts were posterior subcapsular in 26 eyes, cortical in 19 eyes and nuclear in 15 eyes. VA significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity and there was significant loss of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at all spatial frequencies with increasing cataract severity. AULCSF significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity in the presence and absence of glare conditions. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was significantly reduced at high spatial frequency (18 cpd) in cortical cataracts in th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the quantitative relationship between foveal visual acuity and <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for large-letter optotypes {{in a group of}} patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), in order to asses more completely the extent of foveal vision loss in this group of hereditary retinal dystrophies. High-contrast visual acuity and large-letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were measured with a computer-based testing system and with commercially available letter charts (Lighthouse Distance Visual Acuity Test; Pelli-Robson <b>Contrast</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> Chart). Findings from 20 patients with typical RP or Usher syndrome were compared with those from 15 age-similar control subjects with normal vision. On both the computer-based test and the chart tests, the patients with RP showed approximately equal reductions in visual acuity and large-letter <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> However, intersubject variability among the normal controls was greater for <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than for visual acuity on both test protocols. As a result, the patients with RP required a greater reduction in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than in acuity to exceed the normal range, indicating that visual acuity was the more sensitive index of the loss of foveal visual function...|$|R
