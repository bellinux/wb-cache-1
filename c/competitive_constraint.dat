An interesting guiding principle provided by Bishop and Darcey (1995) states that a {{relevant market}} is something worth monopolising, {{in the sense}} that the relevant market includes all the substitute products and therefore control of that market would allow the monopoliser to profitably increase the prices of the products to the monopoly level.

[...] It aims not to trade goods and services of equivalent value, but instead to make money from the trade (this is called capital accumulation). The aim is to buy as cheaply as possible, and sell as dear as possible, under the <b>competitive</b> <b>constraint</b> that everybody has the same objective. The effect is that the whole cost-structure of production permanently includes profit as an additional impost—which, according to medieval Christian theologians, should never be more than one-sixth (16-17%) {{of the value of the}} traded object. [...] In an overall sense, Marx argues the substance of this impost is the unpaid surplus labour performed by the working class; part of society can live off the labour of others due to their ownership of property.|$|E

In this study, we analysed and compared variability of tactical performance indices in players within complex I at two different competitive levels in volleyball. We also examined whether variability was influenced by set type and period. Eight matches from the 2012 Olympics competition and from the Portuguese national league in the 2014 – 2015 season were analysed (1496 rallies). Variability of setting conditions, attack zone, attack tempo and block opposition was assessed using Shannon entropy measures. Magnitude-based inferences were used to analyse the practical significance of compared values of selected variables. Results showed differences between elite and national teams for all variables, which were co-adapted to the <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints</b> of set type and set periods. Elite teams exploited system stability in setting conditions and block opposition, but greater unpredictability in zone and tempo of attack. These findings suggest that uncertainty in attacking actions was a key factor that could only be achieved with greater performance stability in other game actions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} bundling and tying when the threat of entry provides the primary <b>competitive</b> <b>constraint</b> but entrants have a disadvantage {{with respect to the}} incumbent, i. e., in a “nearly contestable ” market. The entrant’s disadvantage can be with respect to marginal costs, the fixed cost of a good, or the fixed cost of an offering (which can be interpreted as a product differentiation advantage). The incumbent’s profits depend on both the nature of its cost advantage and the set of offerings. With an advantage in the fixed cost of an offering, the incumbent prefers mixed bundling if it is sustainable. With a marginal cost advantage, the incumbent prefers pure bundling, in which all customers buy both components. While the latter result might appear to formalize a commonly-alleged rationale for tying, the practice can be a Pareto improvement over mixed bundling and can cause total consumer surplus to increase relative to only selling the products separately. Mixed bundling can lower consumer surplus and be a form of product proliferation. Contact Information...|$|E

We have developed a code to take the pixels belonging to any given image and generate counter-images with full resolution, so that multiple systems are convincingly and exhaustively identified. Over 130 images of 35 multiply lensed galaxies are found behind A 1689, including many radial arcs and also tiny counter-images projected on the center of mass. The derived mass profile is found to flatten steadily towards the center, like an NFW profile, with a mean slope d(log(Sigma)) /d(log(r)) ~ - 0. 55 +/- 0. 1, over the range r< 250 kpc/h, which is somewhat steeper than predicted for such a massive halo.

40|$|Primordial non-Gaussianity {{of local}} type is {{predicted}} to lead to enhanced halo clustering on very large scales. Photometric quasars, which {{can be seen from}} cosmological redshifts z > 2 even in wide-shallow optical surveys, are promising tracers for constraining non-Gaussianity using this effect. However, large-scale systematics can also mimic this signature of non-Gaussianity. In order to assess the contribution of systematic effects, we cross-correlate overdensity maps of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR 6) in different redshift ranges. We find that the maps are significantly correlated on large scales, even though we expect the angular distributions of quasars at different redshifts to be uncorrelated. This implies that the quasar maps are contaminated with systematic errors. We investigate the use of external templates that provide information on the spatial dependence of potential systematic errors to reduce the level of spurious clustering in the quasar data. We find that templates associated with stellar density, the stellar color locus, airmass, and seeing are major contaminants of the quasar maps, with seeing having the largest effect. Using template projection, we are able to decrease the significance of the cross-correlation measurement on the largest scales from 9. 2 σ to 5. 4 σ. Although this is an improvement, the remaining cross-correlation suggests the contamination in this quasar sample is too great to allow a <b>competitive</b> <b>constraint</b> on f_NL by correlations internal to this sample. The SDSS quasar catalog exhibits spurious number density fluctuations of approximately 2 % rms, and we need a contamination level less than 1 % (0. 6 %) in order to measure values of f_NL less than 100 (10). Properly dealing with these systematics will be paramount for future large scale structure surveys that seek to constrain non-Gaussianity...|$|E

40|$|Telephones {{have changed}} {{dramatically}} from their introduction to their current form, and done so most significantly since {{the introduction of}} cell phones in the 1980 s. This has impacted competition in the telephony market. I study this competitive impact of cell phones on the landline market through demand analysis {{in the first two}} essays; I turn my attention to the smartphone market in the final essay. In the first essay, I examine the effect of cell phones on telephony demand using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I develop and estimate a model of household choice using a mixed logit as a function of consumer characteristics, unobserved alternative-specific attributes, and prices. My focus is on the evolution through time. I construct market segments and track adoptions. Evidence suggests that the move to cell phones is driven by young and and large housholds. I develop and apply a decomposition of substitutability and find that substitutability differs through time. Cell phone technologies and consumer culture have changed dramatically since 1983, affecting the level of competition in the regulated telephony market. In the second essay, I develop an empirical strategy to estimate changing demand that addresses changing technologies and preferences. I develop a flexible methodology that allows for likelihood-based estimation of a broad class of latent-dependent-variable models with time-varying parameters. Applying my methodology with a logit model and Bayesian methods, I study the evolution of preferences. Consumers have become more price-sensitive, indicating that improvements to cell phones have provided an increasing <b>competitive</b> <b>constraint</b> on landline pricing. In the third essay, I develop a model of the US smartphone industry; consumers demand products according to a random utility model; firms compete in a dynamic oligopoly model; I incorporate supply-side learning. Firms learn demand through time inspired by recursive least squares adaptive learning. Firms choose whether to release new devices and when to remove devices from the market according to expected future profits.

As re-colonising populations are often freed from spatial and <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints,</b> documenting the sex-ratio of offspring may provide insights in sex-allocation theory. We studied a re-establishing population of Black-winged Petrels (Pterodroma nigripennis) on Raoul Island, in the Kermadec Group, New Zealand, where all predators have recently been removed. Wemeasured, and took DNA samples from 20 chicks in four new colonies in 2007, when the colonies first re-established, 25 chicks from seven colonies in 2008, and 25 adults captured across both years, including seven that were caught nearby at sea, and two adults caught at a colony where no chicks were sampled. We found the developmental stage of chicks to have no differences between sexes, and recorded no sexual differences in the morphometrics of chicks or adults. We report a significantly biased sex-ratio towards male offspring {{in the first year of}} re-colonisation. In contrast, the sex-ratios of offspring in the second year of re-colonisation and of adults in both years were even.

Continued monitoring of the populations of Black-winged Petrels re-establishing on Raoul Island, as well as comparable data from adjacent islets with long-established breeding colonies of Black-winged Petrels will be critical to identify the realised ecological role of variation in offspring sex-ratio and of sex-biased natal philopatry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm called C 4 – Clustering with Cooperative and <b>Competitive</b> <b>Constraints</b> for computing multiple solutions from posterior probabilities defined on graphical models, including Markov random fields (MRF), conditional random fields (CRF) and hierarchical models. The graphs may have {{both positive and}} negative edges for cooperative and <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints.</b> C 4 is a probabilistic clustering algorithm in the spirit of Swendsen-Wang [34]. By turning the positive edges on/off probabilistically, C 4 partitions the graph into a number of connected components (ccp’s) and each ccp is a coupled sub-solution with nodes connected by positive edges. Then by turning the negative edges on/off probabilistically, C 4 obtains composite ccp’s (called cccp’s) with competing ccp’s connected by negative edges. At each step C 4 flips the labels of all nodes in a cccp so that nodes in each ccp keep the same label while different ccp’s are assigned different labels to observe {{both positive and negative}} constraints. Thus the algorithm can jump between multiple competing solutions (or modes of the posterior probability) in a single or a few steps. It computes multiple distinct solutions to preserve the intrinsic ambiguities and avoids premature commitments to a single solution that may not be valid given later context. C 4 achieves a mixing rate faster than existing MCMC methods, such as various Gibbs samplers [15], [26] and Swendsen-Wang cuts [2], [34]. It is also more “dynamic ” than common optimization method such as ICM [3], LBP [21], [37], and graph cuts [4], [20].

40|$|Gravitational {{waves are}} {{excellent}} tools {{to probe the}} foundations of General Relativity in the strongly dynamical and non-linear regime. One such foundation is Lorentz symmetry, {{which can be broken}} in the gravitational sector by the existence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at each spacetime point. This leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate of binary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associated gravitational waves. We here study whether waves emitted in the late, quasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can place <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints</b> on two proxies of gravitational Lorentz-violation: Einstein-Æther theory and khronometric gravity. We model the waves in the small-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-Newtonian approximation, by perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations from General Relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. We assume a gravitational wave consistent with General Relativity has been detected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and with the proposed space-based mission, DECIGO, with and without coincident electromagnetic counterparts. Without a counterpart, a detection consistent with General Relativity of neutron star binaries can only place <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints</b> on gravitational Lorentz violation when using future, third-generation or space-based instruments. On the other hand, a single counterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude more stringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generation detectors. This is because Lorentz violation forces the group velocity of gravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference can be very accurately constrained with coincident observations.

Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimates provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{industry}} is vertically integrated with Internet Backbone Providers (IBPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs.) Although {{there are many}} ISPs and IBPs in each stream, both markets are considered independent oligopolies in {{that there are a}} few dominant competitors in each market. It is generally accepted that the Internet industry structure has evolved into a four-tier hierarchical structure. The synergistic and codependent nature of the Internet {{industry is}} the key element in understanding the competitive environment in which both IBP’s and ISP’s cooperate. Peering is an efficient way to exchange traffic freely within the access tier, nevertheless <b>competitive</b> <b>constraints</b> limit within tier exchanges. This paper combines the value chain model, competitive force model and a game model to illustrate the interconnection competitive perspective between IBP and ISPs and demonstrate why peering is difficult in the local access market...|$|R
