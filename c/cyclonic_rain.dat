50|$|They have annual lifecycles, {{with adults}} predominating during the {{breeding}} season and juveniles predominating in other seasons. Juveniles typically attain sexual maturity after winter at 5-6 mo of age.

It may also breed in spring in the latter region, but only if winter rain has been substantial. Rainfall appears to be tied to enhanced survival, growth, and possibly clutch size and hatching success.|$|R
50|$|Every November, Velachery is flooded by <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rains.</b> The {{major areas}} that are usually flooded are the low-lying areas around the Velachery Lake. A flood water {{drainage}} canal was constructed along the Velachery 100-feet (30 m) road. Due to encroachments, {{some part of the}} canal in the Velachery-Tambaram high road is not constructed completely. Generally it is felt that, after the canal was built; to a major extent, the flooding problem in many areas along the 100-feet road has decreased substantially. All the residential colonies that are lying south of Taramani link road got submerged in rain water during the floods in 2008 which was of moderate intensity. A major storm water drain project running all through the Taramani link road from Vijayanagar bus stand in Velachery connecting South Buckingham canal is in progress. This project which is funded by the World Bank, is expected to bring much relief to the residents of flood prone Velachery.|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{steadily}} declined as the 1920s advanced, {{and although}} the tramway continued to provide an economic benefit to the Aramac district, Council struggled to break even financially in most years. The service was never again as popular or as successful {{as it had been}} at the outset, and drought and rural depression continued to keep business down. There was increasing competition from road transport as private motor cars and trucks became cheaper and more popular in the 1920s. Operating perilously close to the edge of viability, the tramway faced a catastrophe in 1928 when <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rains</b> flooded the district. The damage to the line stopped all traffic for weeks, and the lost revenue combined with the cost of repairs sent the accounts for the year heavily into the red. Council had to levy a special rate to pay the tramway's expenses, and was unable to meet its loan repayments that year; there was no option but to go to State Treasury and negotiate a three-year suspension of payments.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} two interrelated sections. The {{first is}} a Piece of creative writing, a period novel, The Back 2 ̆ 7 Flats, which {{is set in the}} coastal hamlet of Greenough in Western Australia in the years 1887 - 1888. The twin themes of the novel are the resolution of maternal grief and Irish settlement in Western Australia. The second section is an essay concerned with the arrival of Irish people to Australia in the nineteenth century and, the influence they exerted on the culture of the developing nation, demonstrated through history and contemporary novels. The Back Flats is about a group of Irish Catholic settlers in a rural area as they experience the effects of the death of their baby girl from pneumonia on the mother, Kate O 2 ̆ 7 Brien. The close-knit community has a superstitious fear of madness, which they believe can result if a woman withdraws from family and friends as part of her mourning process. An old woman whose baby died many years previously, and who was incapacitated by the death for years afterwards, now suffers from dementia. The Villagers think that the old woman’s condition is proof of what may happen to Kate. During a major flood caused by <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rains</b> at the source of the Greenough River, Kate and the old woman are thrown into close proximity. While she comforts the old Woman, Kate recognises that the other woman is not a threat to her or to her sanity. Irish convicts and freed immigrants accounted for a third of all immigration to Australia in the first century following the arrival of the First Fleet and the beginning of white settlement. The essay describes the settlement of the Greenough region from the early 1850 s and the immigration of Irish people to Australia with particular reference to Irish women. It also places The Back FIats in a context of Australian literature about Irish convicts, immigrants, settlers and wanderers...|$|R

40|$|In {{the vast}} region of East and {{southern}} Africa the alternating glacial and interglacial periods of the Quaternarv {{were characterized by}} considerable changes in temperature and precipitation. During the last glacial maximum {{the influence of the}} ITCZ was limited, while the circulation systems were strengthened. The ocean surface waters were cooler and the Benguela Current was activated. In the montane areas of East Africa and also in southern Africa the temperature dropped by about 6 °C. During this hypothermal period, rainfall on the east African plateau and mountains diminished. Summer precipitation could still penetrate the eastern half of southern Africa from the Indian Ocean, while the western half was arid to semi-arid. <b>Cyclonic</b> winter <b>rain</b> migrated further north beyond the latitude of the Orange River. The consequences of these climatic changes during the last glacial maximum were that the woodlands of East Africa opened up. On the plateau of South Africa austro-afroalpine vegetation dominated.

30|$|Incidences of {{flooding}} have been increased {{in recent years}} due to the extreme weather events such as unexpected <b>cyclonic</b> heavy <b>rains</b> and outflows of rivers that have inundated wider areas across many regions in Asia. Rice is the only cereal crop that is well adapted to the conditions of waterlogging or partial flooding or complete submergence. However, phenotypic requirements differ depending upon the situation to withstand the excess water stress. The genotypes identified in this investigation have been provided to National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems’ through All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Programme and Eastern India Rainfed Lowland Shuttle Breeding Network Programme (ICAR-IRRI Collaborative Programme). Important traits for flash flooding are survival of the plant due to complete submergence, reduced under water elongation and greater regeneration capacity at de-submergence. Employment of genotypes such as AC 37887, IC 258990, IC 258830 and AC 20431 -W in plant breeding programme might further improve the submergence tolerance and plant productivity in rainfed lowland flash flood areas. In different rainfed lowland sites plant experience both complete submergence and waterlogging. In such a condition a perfect blend of elongation and tolerance is required. The genotypes such as INGR 08109, INGR 08111, INGR 08113 and AC 42091 could be employed for developing varieties for the locations where both submergence and waterlogging tolerance are required. To identify new QTL/s for submergence tolerance and regeneration capacity development of mapping population is in progress at CRRI using the genotype INGR 08109 (vernacular name Atiranga), INGR 04001 (vernacular name Khoda) and INGR 08110 (vernacular name Kalaputia). The genotypes and physiological traits identified in this investigation could be employed in greater extent to develop high yielding rice cultivars adapted to wide range of rainfed lowland ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|Events {{occurring}} {{during the}} larval phase of marine fishes have important ramifications for the demographic structure of marine fish populations. Differential larval survival may drive recruitment variability and ultimately determine stock biomass. While considerable scientific {{attention has been}} devoted to larval fishes in temperate regions, studies of fish larvae in tropical environments have been rare and of uneven quality. This dissertation aimed to present detailed descriptions of the distribution patterns of small fishes, along with concurrent measurements of environmental variability, in the central Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Larval fish were collected using both conventional plankton nets and light traps during the spring-summer periods of 1988 - 89, 1989 - 90 and 1990 - 91. Light traps have not been used to sample fish in open water before this study; they collected numerous fishes at sizes larger than those routinely captured in plankton nets. Data from both techniques were analysed to examine spatio-temporal variability in the distribution patterns of small fishes. Plankton nets revealed relatively stable cross-shelf patterns, with a distinctive nearshore component characterised by gobiids, callionymids, leiognathids and teraponids; a cross-shelf group including nemipterids, carangids, platycephalids and scorpaenids; and an offshore group dominated by clupeids, lutjanids, scombrids, and pomacentrids. Significant temporal coherence, across spatial scales up to 50 km, in abundance of a number of taxa with cross-shelf and offshore affinities was also found. This coherence could be generated by synchronous spawning, or by a hydrographic event acting over synoptic scales of at least 50 km in both cross-shelf and long shore directions. Light trap catches in both years were dominated by a catches at a single station in one month. In 1988, a multi-specific 'patch' of larvae were found 24 km off the coast on the CB transect, while in 1989 a similar 'patch' was located 16 km off the coast on the LR transect. Remote sensing, utilising NOAA's AVHRR polar-orbiting satellite, was used to synoptically assess sea-surface temperatures and visible reflectance of water masses across the central Great Barrier Reef lagoon. While there was little evidence of significant thermal structure across the sampling transects, more structure was noted in false-water colour images. Turbid, coastal water was found along the coast, although the the offshore extent of this water mass varied through time. This appeared to be related to wind strength acting to determine the depth at which wave action led to resuspension of bottom sediments. The offshore extent of this nearshore water mass also appeared to delineate the approximate boundary between nearshore and offshore ichthyoplankton groupings from the net samples. Zooplankton distributions across the inner shelf did not coincide with that of the larval fish community. Given that zooplankton are more accurate tracers of water movement than larval fish, hydrography alone could not explain the maintenance of larval fish assemblages through time. It is suggested that larval fish may be actively maintaining their positions within water masses. An alternative hypothesis that differential survival between masses was responsible for the patterns could not, however, be rejected. Both zooplankton abundance and egg production rates of Acrocalanus gibber, a common copepod species, were significantly higher within a low-salinity plume derived from terrestrial runoff associated with <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rains.</b> Larval fish with cross-shelf affinities were also concentrated in the plume during the initial two days of a total of five sampling occasions. Offshore larvae became abundant at the plume front on the final two days of sampling. This accumulation may have been caused by the swathe effect of the plume front as it moved progressively offshore. Episodic events such as cyclonic rainfall and resuspension of nutrients resulting from strong winds may be of critical importance to planktonic communities, and hence larval fish survival, in this region. Such events are impossible to predict, and therefore will only be elucidated by long-term, meso-scale monitoring of larval abundance within the pelagic environment and concurrent measurements of biological oceanography at similar scales. This study demonstrates that new developments in both biological sampling methods and satellite technology make programs eminently feasible. The renewed presence in space of a satellite (SeaWiFS) capable of determining ocean colour will further enhance the prospects of considerable advancements in determining the causes of variable survival and subsequent recruitment of tropical fish larvae...|$|R
40|$|The {{scatterometer}} wind {{retrieval process}} produces several pos-sible wind vector choices or ambiguities at each resolution cell. Ambiguity selection routines are generally ad hoc and often re-sult in ambiguity selection errors. It {{is important to}} locate areas of ambiguity selection error to assess the quality of scatterom-eter wind data. A quality assurance algorithm is presented based on comparing ambiguity-selected winds from SeaWinds on QuikSCAT to a low order wind field model fit. Regions exceeding error thresholds are rated and flagged as possible ambiguity selection errors. Appropriate error thresholds and additional flagging criteria are set through an analysis of false alarms versus missed detections on a manually-inspected train-ing data set. The algorithm correctly identifies 97 % of the regions manually flagged as ambiguity selection errors in the training set with a false alarm rate of less than 2 %. Applying the algorithm to the entire QuikSCAT data set, we conclude that the ambiguity selection is over 95 % effective on regions of rms wind speed greater than 3. 5 m/s. The algorithm validates that higher noise occurs at nadir and in low wind speed regions. Additionally, fewer estimated ambiguity selection errors occur at nadir and on the swath edges due to a larger ambiguity set in those regions. The percentage of ambiguity selection errors {{are found to be}} highly correlated with <b>cyclonic</b> storm and <b>rain</b> occurences. ...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] ASCAT data are produced by Remote Sensing Systems and sponsored by the NASA Ocean Vector Winds Science Team. The JPL version 3 QuikSCAT dataset ([URL] was obtained via the PO. DAAC web portal and was processed by the SeaWinds Processing and Analysis Center (SeaPAC). Two methods of computing the time-mean divergence and vorticity from satellite vector winds in rain-free (RF) and all-weather (AW) conditions are investigated. Consequences of removing rain-contaminated winds on the mean divergence and vorticity depend strongly on the order in which the time-average and spatial derivative operations are applied. Taking derivatives first and averages second (DFAS_RF) incorporates only those RF winds measured at the same time into the spatial derivatives. While preferable mathematically, this produces mean fields biased relative to their AW counterparts because of the exclusion of convergence and cyclonic vorticity often associated with rain. Conversely, taking averages first and derivatives second (AFDS_RF) incorporates all RF winds into the time-mean spatial derivatives, even those not measured coincidentally. While questionable, the AFDS_RF divergence and vorticity surprisingly appears qualitatively consistent with the AW means, despite using only RF winds. The analysis addresses whether the AFDS_RF method accurately estimates the AW mean divergence and vorticity. Model simulations indicate that the critical distinction between these two methods is the inclusion of typically convergent and <b>cyclonic</b> winds bordering <b>rain</b> patches in the AFDS_RF method. While this additional information removes some of the sampling bias in the DFAS_RF method, it is shown that the AFDS_RF method nonetheless provides only marginal estimates of the mean AW divergence and vorticity given sufficient time averaging and spatial smoothing. Use of the AFDS_RF method is thus not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Sediment volumes {{retained}} by landslide-dams of the Waipaoa are small at 1. 85 x 10 ⁶m³ {{compared to the}} 24. 5 km³ (Marden et al., 2008 b) of sediment eroded in the landscape since the last glacial maximum. Landslide-dams do however represent a major perturbation to sediment transport, although due to their mainly short life span this disruption is discontinuous representing a pulsing in the transport network. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the sedimentary dynamics of the Waipaoa catchment by providing insights into the role that deep-seated landslides play and asks the questions: What is the impact on sediment transport imposed by the landslide-dams of the Waipaoa catchment? and; What do the sediments impounded in landslide-dammed lakes tell us about catchment sediment dynamics through time? The Waipaoa River on the East Cape of New Zealand‘s North Island delivers volumes of sediment to the coast which are considered high by global standards. Catchment erosion is controlled by soft marine sediments, combined with a history of tectonic fracturing and frequent intense rain storms. Erosion events are driven by intense <b>cyclonic</b> systems <b>rain</b> storms which deliver ≥ 200 mm/ 24 hr rainfall and induce catchment wide gully erosion as well as shallow surficial landslides. Under current land covers gully erosion provides the dominant source of sediments, with high degrees of slope channel coupling and steep gradient river profiles providing for efficient delivery to the coast. Offshore in the Poverty Bay, sediments delivered by the Waipaoa River show considerable variability over a range of temporal scales. Valley slopes within the Waipaoa catchment are also susceptible to large deep-seated landslide failures, with movement depths greater than 5 metres often on internal structural failure planes. These large slope movements can be produced by both extreme storm events (≥ 300 mm/ 24 hr) which occur on a return periods of 1 in 5 years and seismic ground shaking of 1 in 1000 - 2000 years. Where these large events block channels and are able to persist for long periods, sediments accumulated upstream to provide a unique record of the catchments sedimentary history. There have been some 1100 historic large scale features which have been identified within the Waipaoa region, with this study selecting seven that have shown evidence of channel blockage. The project aims to provide insights into the age of a sample of deep-seated landslides that have dammed channels to determine how long landslide-dams survive in the landscape and quantify the volumes of sediment they have trapped. Further, the project aims to determine what the spatial and temporal distribution of these blockages has meant to sediment delivery and whether there have been changes in sediment dynamics in their upper catchments over time. The project uses the detailed mapping of the trapped body of sediments, GIS modelling of the palaeo and present landscapes and age control determinations provided by tephra and 14 C dating to provide both volumes and rates of sediment delivery...|$|R
40|$|On {{the western}} coast of Madagascar, the dry {{tropical}} forest of Kirindy may {{disappear in the}} next 50 years because of its rapid conversion into agricultural land by slash-and-burn cultivation. The slash-and-burn fields are cultivated during 3 years in average and are further abandoned because of soil depletion, weed invasion and finally lower crop yields. As a consequence, new forest areas are regularly cleared from the primary forest, causing deforestation. In addition, Madagascar is situated in a region with high cyclonic activity. Violent storms hit the western coast every 3 - 4 years, leading to intense rainfalls and floods. These events may enhance soil physical degradation and nutrient leaching, thereby accentuating the soil depletion by slash-and-burn agriculture and with it, the forest conversion rate. Focusing on the combined effects of historic land management and prevailing climatic conditions, this paper investigates: (1) the temporal evolution of soil fertility along with crop performance from cultivation up to field abandonment, and (2) the relative effects of land use (crop cultivation) and extreme climatic events (heavy <b>rain,</b> <b>cyclonic</b> storms) on soil and crop properties. We used a space-for-time substitution approach in slash-and-burn corn (Zea mays L.) fields to describe dynamics of soil fertility and crop performance. We sampled soils and plants during two seasons: (a) a normal rainy season, in 2014, and (b) a cyclonic rainy season, in 2015. We found that under the cyclonic storm, soil becomes not only N and P deficient, but the K concentration also steeply drops. Overall, {{this leads to a}} dramatic reduction of corn performance. While a decrease in grain yield due to slash-and-burn agriculture reaches about 37. 5 % after three years of cultivation on the same field (from 4 to 2. 5 t ha- 1), it decreases up to 75 % after a single cyclonic rainy season (from 4 to 1 t ha- 1). On the sidelines of the study, a locust pest also damaged half of the corn fields in 2014, driving the corn yield down to zero on those particular fields. Given what precedes, the study points out the fragility of traditional agricultural techniques against natural hazards. Along with global warming, the frequency and intensification of natural disasters are expected to increase, impacting negatively and strongly the livelihoods of rural farmers. This raises the urgent need to increase farmer&# 8217;s awareness to alternative and more sustainable agricultural practices...|$|R
