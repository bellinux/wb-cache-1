500|$|From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree</b> debuted and {{peaked at}} number nine on the Billboard 200 upon its May 2005 release. It was spearheaded by the band's {{breakthrough}} single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin' Down," [...] reached number {{eight in the}} US Billboard Hot 100 in September 2005, and in the UK chart in February 2006, crossing over from Alternative to Pop radio. [...] "Dance, Dance," [...] the album's second single, also was a top ten hit in the United States and was certified 3x Platinum in 2014. The record's success led to stardom among teenagers in North America, and the band's first arena tour had the group playing to 10,000 people per night. Rolling Stone wrote that the band's [...] "anthems," [...] distributed and marketed through their MySpace, connected with [...] "skinny-jeans-wearing teen girls." [...] In support of From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree,</b> the band toured exhaustively with international tours, TRL visits, late-night television appearances and music award shows. The band performed at music festivals in 2005 and 2006, including the third Nintendo Fusion Tour {{in the fall of}} 2005, joining The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, and Panic! at the Disco on a 31 city tour. The album earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, and has sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States, becoming the group's best-selling album.

500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree</b> {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree.</b> It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} two-month-long break {{following}} the band’s Black Clouds and Underdogs tour in {{promotion of the}} band's 2005 album From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree,</b> Fall Out Boy returned to the studio to begin work on a follow-up effort. [...] The band began writing songs for the new album while touring, and intended to quickly make a new album {{in order to keep}} momentum in the wake of its breakthrough success. In early 2007, the group released its third studio album, Infinity on High, which was the band's second release on major label Island. The album marked a departure in Fall Out Boy’s sound in which the band implemented a diverse array of musical styles including funk, R, and flamenco. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound predominant on their 2003 effort, Take This to Your Grave.|$|E
500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what I imagine people are going through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree</b> include narcissism and megalomania, while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E

500|$|Fall Out Boy's albums Take This to Your Grave and From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree</b> {{are both}} {{said to have}} pop punk as well as punk rock sounds and influences, and Infinity on High {{features}} {{a wide range of}} styles and instrumentation, including orchestral arrangements ("Thnks fr th Mmrs") and a slower piano ballad ("Golden"). R influences on Infinity on High are on songs such as [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] and two of the album's tracks are produced by R singer/producer Babyface. On Folie à Deux, the group continues to evolve its sound, with less of a pop punk sound and increasing the use of piano (such as [...] "What a Catch, Donnie", [...] "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet", and [...] "20 Dollar Nose Bleed"), synthesizers, and guest artists. The band also shows a number of influences, with [...] "Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes" [...] borrowing a chord sequence from The Who song [...] "Baba O'Riley". [...] The group has worked with many producers and artists, including The Neptunes, Timbaland, Ryan Adams, Lil Wayne and Kanye West, the latter of which Patrick Stump described as [...] "the Prince of his generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} for Infinity on High was quite positive, with many praising Stump's vocals and the album's new musical direction. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commended the band's [...] "new sense of swing" [...] on its R songs {{and noted that}} Stump [...] "has evolved into a superb frontman." [...] Dave de Silva of Sputnikmusic agreed about Stump's new vocal style, saying that [...] "his tone is smoother and more well-rounded, he’s cut out the borderline screechy high-end which made parts of the previous album unlistenable and, though occasionally still nasally, his tones are far more varied and adaptable to different styles" [...] as well as calling Wentz' lyrics [...] "as sharp as ever". Andrew Blackie of PopMatters called the album [...] "wildly exciting and experimental" [...] and felt it greatly improved upon From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree.</b> Aaron Burgess of The A.V. Club enjoyed the disc's new pop direction and felt that the songs that were more typical of Fall Out Boy's original sound, such as [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] undermined the album's potential. Sven Philipp of Billboard called Infinity on High a [...] "shamelessly melodic, wild and powerful pop record" [...] and referred to Stump as the album's [...] "true surprise". The album was ranked No. 38 on Qs 50 Best Albums of 2007.|$|E
500|$|With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as {{the primary}} composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree,</b> {{produced}} two hit singles, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down" [...] and [...] "Dance, Dance," [...] and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture.

It produced two worldwide hit singles, [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs." [...] Folie à Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to [...] "decompress," [...] exploring various side projects. The band regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), which gave the band its second career number one and produced the top 20 single [...] "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)." [...] The group's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the top 10 hit [...] "Centuries" [...] and also spawned the single [...] "Uma Thurman" [...] which peaked at 22 on Hot 100. The album peaked at No. 1, making it the band's third No. 1 album and the group's fifth consecutive top 10 album.|$|E

Devon Maloney of MTV News wrote: [...] "While many pop punk fans adamantly deny any association between their favorite acts and those labeled “emo,” crossover bands who melded the two have gradually put both genres in the same scene-boat." [...] Fall Out Boy achieved mainstream success with its 2005 album From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree,</b> which was certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in January 2006. During the mid–late 2000s, three Fall Out Boy songs were on the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.

Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time {{with the rest of}} Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under the <b>Cork</b> <b>Tree,</b> drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing [...] "two to three" [...] songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group.
