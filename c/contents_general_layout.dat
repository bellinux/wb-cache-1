2500|$|Spatial {{memory recall}} is built upon a {{hierarchical}} structure. That {{is to say}} that people remember the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of a particular space and then [...] "cue target locations" [...] located within that spatial set. This paradigm includes an ordinal scale of features that an individual must attend to in order to inform his or her cognitive map. Recollection of spatial details is a top-down procedure that requires an individual to recall the superordinate features of a cognitive map, followed by the ordinate and subordinate features. Thus, two spatial features are prominent in navigating a path: <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> and landmark orienting (Kahana et al., 2006).|$|R
