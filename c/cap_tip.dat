40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) product development {{case study is}} presented {{to address some of}} the issues faced during developing a pre-filled syringe (PFS) product for a biotherapeutic. In particular, issues involving incompatibility with silicone oil and a stability-based approach for selection of PFS barrel and <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> components have been discussed. Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as syringe barrel processing methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process. The <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> comparability study resulted in one <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> material having superior compatibility among the three that were tested. The quality attribute that was most impacted by the <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> materials was mAb oxidation.

Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of the scratching speed, the scratching depth and the face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At the same scratching depth, the normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different scratching directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions.

In a previous study we demonstrated with a radioimmunoassay that the lectin is present in wheat embryos and adult plants both in the roots and {{at the base of}} the stem. We have now found, using rhodamine, peroxidase, and ferritin-labeled secondary antibodies, that WGA is located in cells and tissues that establish direct contact with the soil during germination and growth of the plant. In the embryo, WGA is found in the surface layer of the radicle, the first adventitious roots, the coleoptile, and the scutellum. Although found throughout the coleorhiza and epiblast, it is at its highest levels within the cells at the surface of these organs. In adult plants, WGA is located only in the <b>caps</b> and <b>tips</b> of adventitious roots. Reaction product for WGA was not visualized in embryonic or adult leaves or in other tissues of adult plants. At the subcellular level, WGA is located at the periphery of protein bodies, within electron-translucent regions of the cytoplasm, and at the cell wall-protoplast interface. Since WGA is found at potential infection sites and is known to have fungicidal properties, it may function in the defense against fungal pathogens...|$|R
