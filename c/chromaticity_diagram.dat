25|$|The {{figure on}} the right shows the related <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b> The outer curved {{boundary}} is the spectral locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram</b> is a tool to specify how the human eye will experience light with a given spectrum. It cannot specify colors of objects (or printing inks), since the chromaticity observed while looking at an object depends on the light source as well.|$|E
25|$|If one chooses any {{two points}} of {{color on the}} <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram,</b> then all the colors that lie in a {{straight}} line between the two points can be formed by mixing these two colors. It follows that the gamut of colors must be convex in shape. All colors that can be formed by mixing three sources are found inside the triangle formed by the source points on the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram</b> (and so on for multiple sources).|$|E
40|$|<b>Chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> for tri- and tetrachromatic animals (with {{three and}} four cone classes in their retina, respectively, {{contributing}} to colour perception) are widely used in studies of animal colour vision. These diagrams not only allow the graphical representation of perceived colours, but the coordinates of colours plotted within these diagrams {{can be used to}} extract colour metrics, such as hue and chroma, or can be used directly in statistical analyses, and therefore aid our understanding of vision-mediated behaviour. However, many invertebrate species have more than four cone classes in their retina, and may therefore have pentachromatic or hexachromatic (or greater) vision. This paper describes an extension to the triangular and tetrahedral <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> commonly used for tri- and tetrachromats, respectively, that allows colour coordinates (and hence colour metrics) to be calculated for animals with more than four cone classes. Because the resulting <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> have more than three dimensions, meaningful ways to visualise the spatial position of plotted colours are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chromaticity diagrams-Cartesian plots that {{depict the}} multidimensional {{subjective}} relationship between perceived colors, independent of intensity-are {{widely used in}} studies of animal color vision, as they allow direct links to be made between color discrimination and color vision-mediated behaviors. However, because these diagrams are invariant to the differences in noise levels between photoreceptor classes that underlie some models of color discrimination thresholds, the distance between colors in chromaticity space is not necessarily related to their perceptual distance. The geometric interpretation of color data from <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> may therefore lead to misleading conclusions. This paper describes a method of plotting visual perceptual distances derived from the noise-corrected model of Vorobyev and Osorio (Vorobyev M, Osorio D. 1998. Receptor noise as a determinant of color thresholds. Proc R Soc B. 265 : 351 - 358) such that the perceptual distance between them is exactly preserved. It also describes how both chromatic (color) and achromatic (brightness) contrasts can be visualized within the same diagram. The potential benefits of this approach over commonly used triangular and tetrahedral <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> are discussed {{with regards to the}} study of animal visual ecology...|$|R
50|$|After the {{development}} of the CIE system, color triangles were used as <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams,</b> including briefly with the trilinear coordinates representing the chromaticity values. Since the sum of the three chromaticity values has a fixed value, it suffices to depict only two of the three values, using Cartesian co-ordinates. In the modern x,y diagram, the large triangle bounded by the imaginary primaries X, Y, and Z has corners (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0), respectively; colour triangles with real primaries are often shown within this space.|$|R

The results are presented in tables and <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> and {{it is found that}} each crop has an identifiable time-variant spectral characteristic permitting determination of seasonal growth patterns.

Errors were greater with aids than without. Using spectral measurements of test reflectance, aid transmittance and lighting, chromaticities of the 100 -hue caps were calculated with and without aids in the uniform <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> for protanomaly and protanomaly [Ophthalmol. Physiol. Opt. 30, 685 (2010). ]. Errors were modeled from chromatic spacing on a smoothed 100 -hue locus together with a distractor term, derived from the distances of raw data from that locus.

40|$|For two {{well-known}} modulation methods, stepwise current modulation (SCM) {{and pulse}} width modulation (PWM), the effects of driving current modulation conditions on chromaticity were experimentally investigated in a white LED lighting system. For the experimental implementation of both SCM and PWM, a white LED lighting was fabricated using phosphor converted (PC) white light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a driving circuit module was developed. By using them, the variations of illuminance, color coordinates, and spectrum were evaluated under various forward current conditions. Through the analysis in color coordinates, yellow shift in SCM and blue shift in PWM were observed on <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> with increasing average driving current. In addition, in order to analyze color deviation quantitatively, color distance before and after current increase, and the correlated color temperature (CCT) were calculated. As a result, for the white LED lighting in both modulation conditions, the maximum difference in the calculated CCT was obtained close to 1000 K. It means that careful consideration is required {{to be taken in}} the design of illumination systems to avoid serious problems such industrial accidents...|$|R
25|$|The third {{depicted}} {{the locus of}} the isothermal chromaticities on the CIE 1931 x,y <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b> Since the isothermal points formed normals on his UCS diagram, transformation back into the xy plane revealed them still to be lines, but no longer perpendicular to the locus.|$|E
25|$|The Abney {{effect can}} be {{illustrated}} on chromaticity diagrams as well. If one adds white light to a monochromatic light, one will obtain a straight line on the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b> We might imagine that the colors along such a line are all perceived as having the same hue. In reality, this does not hold true, and a hue shift is perceived. Correspondingly, if we plot colors that are perceived as having the same hue (and only differing in purity) we will obtain a curved line.|$|E
25|$|In {{chromaticity}} diagrams, a {{line that}} has constant perceived hue must be curved, so that the Abney effect is accounted for. The chromaticity diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on chromaticity diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights and not see a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture would be appropriate on a <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E

40|$|Lanthanide orthoantimonates {{represented}} by the chemical formula LnSbO(4) (Ln are all the lanthanides elements with exception of cerium and promethium) were synthesized via solid-state reactions. The crystalline structures of LnSbO(4) were determined by high-resolution Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld method. The samples exhibited monoclinic structures with two different arrangements {{as a function of}} the ionic radius of the lanthanide metal. For compounds with the largest ionic radii (Ln = La and Pr), the P 21 /n space group was determined, while compounds with intermediate and smallest ionic radii (Ln = NdLu) were described under the P 2 (1) /c setting. Raman spectroscopy was employed to study the vibrational features of all compounds, allowing us to determine the characteristic phonons for each structure and, consequently, to establish the relationship between chemical environment and vibrational properties. Optical features of typical SmSbO 4 and TbSbO 4 were thoroughly investigated, and the results indicate that the orthoantimonates are promising luminescent inorganic materials. The photoluminescence spectra (emission and excitation) of both compounds were obtained as a function of temperature under ultraviolet radiation, showing strong orange (Sm) and green (Tb) emissions, respectively. <b>Chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> (CIE) were also determined for all LnSbO(4) series, aiming to bring forward the color coordinates for these emitters tuned by the chemical environment and temperature...|$|R
40|$|Different oxide host {{matrices}} of ABO(4) with A(3 +) (Eu) and B 5 + (Nb, Ta, and Sb) {{were prepared}} to investigate the solid state luminescence behavior of Eu 3 + as a self-activated emitter in orthoceramics. Crystal structures, phonon modes, metal valence states, optical excitation, and emission luminescence properties including emission decay curves, colorimetry, and nonstoichiometry defects were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Classical intraconfigurational (f-f transitions), interconfigurational (4 f(n- 1) 5 d -> 4 f(n)), and charge transfer bands (X 5 +-O 2 -) were observed, besides split Stark levels indicating low local symmetry. The influence of host matrices on the optical behavior of orthocompounds was noticed by changes in {{the energy of the}} typical Eu 3 + transitions. In this case, the larger blue-shifted peaks were observed for EuSbO 4 and the larger red-shifted positions for EuNbO 4, with respect to emission spectra of orthocompounds studied here. These results were correlated to the respective fifth ionization energies and covalent fraction {{as well as to the}} crystal structures exhibited by the different host matrices (I 2 /a: Nb, Ta; P(2) 1 /c: Sb). The presence of more than one component for the D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (0) transition in each compound was observed at low temperature, and it could be justified by nonstoichiometric defects like the oxygen vacancy and Eu 2 +. These typical defects are observed in nonstoichiometric oxide materials, and they were analyzed in the orthoceramics by EPR and XPS spectroscopy. Finally, the lifetime of the D- 5 (0) state and <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> confirmed our orthoceramics as good optical emitters in the red-end region...|$|R
25|$|Han purple in its pure form is {{actually}} a dark blue, that is close to electric indigo. It is a purple {{in the way the}} term is used in colloquial English, i.e., it is a color between red and blue. It is not, however, a purple in the way the term is used in color theory, i.e. a nonspectral color between red and violet on the 'line of purples' on the CIE <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b> Perhaps the most accurate designation for the color would be to call it 'Han indigo', although it could also be regarded as a bright shade of ultramarine (classifying ultramarine as a color and not a pigment).|$|E
25|$|An equal {{mixture of}} two equally bright colors will not {{generally}} {{lie on the}} midpoint of that line segment. In more general terms, a distance on the CIE xy <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram</b> does not correspond {{to the degree of}} difference between two colors. In the early 1940s, David MacAdam studied the nature of visual sensitivity to color differences, and summarized his results in the concept of a MacAdam ellipse. Based on the work of MacAdam, the CIE 1960, CIE 1964, and CIE 1976 color spaces were developed, with the goal of achieving perceptual uniformity (have an equal distance in the color space correspond to equal differences in color). Although they were a distinct improvement over the CIE 1931 system, they were not completely free of distortion.|$|E

Intense white light emission has been observed when the samples are excited with 350 nm light. Yellow to blue emission intensity ratios and chromaticity color coordinates have been determined from the visible luminescence spectra.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a color inter layer prediction (ILP) method for scalable coding of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video content with a Low Dynamic Range (LDR) base layer. Relying {{on the assumption}} of hue preservation between the colors of an HDR image and its LDR tone mapped version, we derived equations for predicting the chromatic components of the HDR layer given the decoded LDR layer. Two color representations are studied. In a first encoding scheme, the HDR image is represented in the classical Y'CbCr format. In addition, a second scheme is proposed using a colorspace based on the CIE u'v' uniform <b>chromaticity</b> scale <b>diagram.</b> In each case, different prediction equations are derived based on a color model ensuring the hue preservation. Our experiments highlight several advantages of using a CIE u'v' based colorspace for the compression of HDR content, especially in a scalable context. In addition, our inter-layer prediction scheme using this color representation improves {{on the state of}} the art ILP method which directly predicts the HDR layer u'v' components by computing the LDR layers u'v' values of each pixel...|$|R
40|$|Everybody {{views and}} uses color from early {{childhood}} onwards. But this magnificent property of all objects around us {{turns out to}} be elusive if you try to specify it and communicate it to another person. Also, people often donâ€™t know what effects color may have under different conditions. However, color is so important and omnipresent, that people can hardly avoid to 'rely on it' â€“ so they do, in particular on its predictability. Thus, there is a discrepancy between the seeming self-evidence of color and the difficulty in specifying it accurately, for the prevailing circumstances. In order to analyze this situation, and possibly remedy it, a short historic perspective of the utilization and specification of color is given. The 'utilization' includes the emotional effects of color, which are important in, for instance, interior decorating but also play a role in literature and religion. 'Specification' begins with the early efforts by scientists, philosophers and artists to bring some order and understanding in what was observed with and while using color. Color has a number of basic functions: embellishment; attracting attention; coding; and bringing order in text by causing text parts presented in the same color to be judged as belonging together. People with a profession that involves color choices for many others, such as designers and manufacturers of products, including electronic visual displays, should have a fairly thorough knowledge of colorimetry and color perception. Unfortunately, they often donâ€™t, simply because for 'practitioners' whose work involves different aspects, applying color being only one of those, the available tools for specifying and applying color turn out to be too difficult to use. Two consequences of an insufficient knowledge of the effects color may have are given here. The first of these consequences, on color blindness, relates to 8 % of the population, but the second one, on reading colored text, bears on everyone. Practical guidance is given, especially on color and legibility. Anyway, the available tools mentioned, such as <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagrams</b> and color spaces, are mainly the responsibility of the CIE. It would therefore be a laudable initiative if the CIE would not only refine their present systems, but devote some time and energy {{to the development of a}} simpler color specification and measurement system. With that it would be worth trying ergonomics research principles, to begin with end-user involvement: investigating what color science practitioners really want and need...|$|R

2500|$|This system {{implies that}} for any hue or non-spectral color {{not on the}} {{boundary}} of the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram,</b> there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general {{there is no such}} thing as the combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the [...] "line of purples" [...] can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.|$|E
2500|$|By {{considering}} all the resulting combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) as {{a subset of}} 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of S, M, L had {{to be added to}} the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the S, M, L lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of [...] "chromaticities" [...] (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross section, corresponding to constant X+Y+Z of the CIE 1931 color space, gives the CIE <b>chromaticity</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chromaticity {{diagrams}} are two-dimensional diagrams that plot {{the projection}} of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) XYZ color space onto the (x, y) plane.
