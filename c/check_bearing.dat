50|$|Rice was {{the victim}} of one of the {{earliest}} sensational crimes of the 1900s. On September 23, 1900, Rice was found dead by his valet, Charles F. Jones. He was presumed to have died in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, a bank teller noticed a suspiciously large <b>check</b> <b>bearing</b> the late Rice's signature and made out to Rice's New York City lawyer, Albert T. Patrick, but with Rice's name misspelled. Soon, Patrick made an announcement that Rice had changed his will right before his death, leaving the bulk of his fortune to Patrick rather than to his Institute. A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Rice's butler and valet Charles F. Jones, who had been persuaded to administer chloroform to Rice while he slept.|$|E

40|$|The non-existence {{of texts}} {{enabling}} the philological approach, the particular structures of certain languages and- {{last but not}} least- the paucity of our knowledge have often complicated the situation of linguists in certain areas. Hence, <b>checking</b> hypotheses <b>bearing</b> on genetic relationships of languages in such disputed areas by traditional methods has remained fraught with risk if not impossible, so far. J. Greenberg's (1966) attempt at a substantially new approach advocated focusing on an essential explanatory principle of language development, namely, continuous division. It attributes greater importance to lexical data as the basic evidence. His approach aims at efficiency {{in an area where}} the correspondences method was found to be wanting. However, can Greenberg's method be thought of as an improvement upon or extension of this latter method? Elsewhere (Nicolaï 1994), I expressed the view that the now extinct controversy between traditional comparative linguistics and the proponents of this renewed method was based on a "misunderstanding". In fact, {{we are not talking about}} the same thing here. The two viewpoints are distinguished not only by their differing approaches to the data but also by a qualitative difference in the way the observables are defined.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{foundations}} on soft ground reinforced by columns usually involves two important verifications, namely, <b>checking</b> for adequate <b>bearing</b> capacity and <b>checking</b> for acceptable settlement performance. This paper details a comprehensive methodology {{for determining the}} optimized portion of the ground area that should be improved by the installation of columns. The optimization is required to avoid an overly conservative design and, consequently, the use of uneconomical quantities of material to construct the columnar reinforcement. The basis of the suggested methodology consists of first estimating the minimum improvement area ratio (IAR) required to ensure attainment of the required design bearing capacity of the reinforced soil and then determining an upper-bound or maximum value of IAR by considering the issue of allowable settlement. Optimization is then performed on the IAR within the range defined by these bearing capacity and settlement limits. Analysis of three case studies provides an illustration of the implementation of this novel design methodology, which has been incorporated into software recently developed {{to assist in the}} design of soil foundations reinforced by columns and to provide cost-effective solutions for this type of foundation...|$|R
