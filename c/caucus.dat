5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan <b>caucus,</b> a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's <b>Caucus</b> is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's <b>Caucus,</b> officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The <b>caucus</b> is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the <b>caucus</b> meets again to vote.|$|E

He scheduled a Republican <b>caucus</b> non-binding vote for speaker on October 8, and a full floor vote on October 29. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the Speaker, was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom <b>Caucus,</b> McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8, and the <b>caucus</b> vote was postponed.|$|E

5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican <b>Caucus</b> on October 20, where he {{explained}} that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed an overwhelming majority of the Republican <b>caucus</b> would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom <b>Caucus,</b> Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom <b>Caucus</b> held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the <b>caucus</b> voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the <b>caucus</b> leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what has been the case historically. Since November 4, 2015, there has been no government <b>caucus</b> in the Senate because the Senate Liberal <b>Caucus</b> is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest <b>caucus</b> of senators with a partisan affiliation.|$|E
5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic <b>Caucus</b> and the Republican <b>Caucus,</b> each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their <b>caucus</b> is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican <b>caucus.</b> The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black <b>Caucus</b> of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E

However, while Heffron's movement was based on his personal stronghold in his BotanyMaroubra ALP branches and the left-wing trade unions, Lang maintained majority control of the <b>caucus,</b> party machine and the party newspaper, Labor Daily.|$|E

While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they would vote for the winner of the <b>caucus</b> vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E

5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851.

The <b>caucus</b> first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the <b>caucus.</b> Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry.

5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor <b>caucus</b> had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the <b>caucus</b> elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members. To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the <b>caucus)</b> and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic <b>caucus,</b> including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the <b>caucus</b> wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E
