40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In September 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommended closing Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, unless a new mission for the base could be identified by December 31, 2009. In June 2006, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced that Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) would establish a new mission at Cannon Air Force Base and the command would take ownership of the base on October 1, 2007. As a result, Cannon Air Force Base will remain open. While DOD has satisfied {{the intent of the}} recommendation by finding a new mission for the base, this BRAC recommendation was unusual because it contained a <b>contingency</b> <b>clause.</b> Therefore, we reviewed DOD's implementation of this recommendation under the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. This report (1) describes the factors underpinning the decision to house AFSOC at Cannon Air Force Base and (2) provides information on the cost estimate and timeline for the movement of personnel to establish the AFSOC mission. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{publicly}} traded European companies finally adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) {{at the start}} of 2005, there will surely be many benefits for investors. But it will also create numerous problems, and the complexity of the task should not be underestimated. The first set of problems is inherent to all large-scale changes. Information systems need time to adapt; staff at all levels have to be trained; financial reporting practices must be reviewed; and loan agreements with financial institutions have to be amended to take account of <b>contingency</b> <b>clauses.</b> In all probability, accounting based measurements of business performance will be modified by the introduction of new standards and may become dissociated from the performance measurement methods used by company managers and their staff. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine some of the changes that are under way or pending and to highlight the foreseeable consequences. JEL classifications : M 41 Danjou Philippe.

40|$|The {{sustained}} growth in corporate debt {{over the past}} decade has led to an increasingly widespread use of <b>contingency</b> <b>clauses.</b> These clauses, also known as “triggers”, are written into bond issue contracts or bank loan agreements, and aim to facilitate borrowers’ access to financing by offering a certain degree of protection to creditors. They result in a tightening of the company’s borrowing conditions (for example an increment in the coupon or an early repayment), should its financial situation deteriorate. These clauses may have significant effects on the functioning of financial markets. First, because they complicate both credit risk analysis and the valuation process of debt securities with such triggers embedded. Second, because they complicate credit rating agencies’ task of rating debt-security issuers. And lastly, because their triggering could result in the opposite effect to that sought, that is to say, instead of protecting the creditor, they may cause a sharp deterioration in the borrower’s financial position. At the same time, they may also result in a series of destabilising effects for financial markets, exacerbated by the fact that investors are often unaware of their existence. While these clauses must be used with caution by borrowers, adequate transparency is also essential so that rating agencies, analysts and investors might fully understand their potential effects. ...|$|R
