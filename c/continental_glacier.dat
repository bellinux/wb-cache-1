25|$|Indian Rock in Montebello, New York {{is a large}} glacial erratic boulder {{of granite}} gneiss, formed in the Proterozoic (Precambrian) era, 1.2 billion to 800 million years ago. It is {{estimated}} to weigh ≈17,300 tons. The source area for the boulder was nearby in the Ramapo Mountains-Hudson Highlands. The boulder rests upon glacial outwash which in turn lies atop Triassic sedimentary red beds (sandstone and shale) of the Newark Basin (circa 145 million years old). The rock was carried to its current location by the internal flow of the continental ice sheet during the last glacial maximum, circa 21,000 years ago. The base of the <b>continental</b> <b>glacier</b> scoured the bedrock terrain across which it moved, thus plucking large and small blocks of rock from {{their position in the}} Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands. Indian Rock got as far as Rockland County before being liberated by the ice and deposited along with gravels shifted by glacial meltwater.|$|E

50|$|During the Pleistocene (the {{last ice}} age), huge sheets of ice called <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers</b> {{advanced}} {{over much of}} the earth. The movement of these <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers</b> created many now-familiar glacial landforms. As the glaciers were expanded, due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice, they crushed and redistributed surface rocks, creating erosional landforms such as striations, cirques, and hanging valleys. Later, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand, depositional landforms were created, such as moraines, eskers, drumlins, and kames. The stone walls found in New England (northeastern United States) contain many glacial erratics, rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin.|$|R
50|$|A glacier is an {{extended}} mass of ice formed from snow falling and accumulating {{over a long}} period of time; glaciers move very slowly, either descending from high mountains, as in valley glaciers, or moving outward from centers of accumulation, as in <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} series of ice ages, {{the flow of}} the Missouri was {{diverted}} to its current riverbed. The Milk River now flows through part of the Missouri's ancient riverbed. The <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers</b> also deposited large amounts of rocks and sediment on the landscape.|$|R
2500|$|The park {{is located}} on the divide between the {{watersheds}} of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, both of which drain to the Atlantic Ocean. [...] The area is a low-relief plain which was once a glacial lakebed. [...] During the last phase of the Wisconsinan glaciation, the deteriorating <b>continental</b> <b>glacier</b> left behind connected lakes, known as Glacial Lakes Aitkin and Upham. [...] Formed by [...] the retreat of the Saint Louis Sublobe of the Superior Lobe of the glacier, Lake Upham drained through Lake Aitkin to the Mississippi River. [...] The retreating glacier and the lakes deposited sand and sediments in the lakebed. [...] As the lakes drained these sediments became the present plain.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{recession}} of the last <b>continental</b> <b>glacier,</b> Lake Upham formed from glacial meltwaters. [...] As the lake receded, its watershed at first was drained by the Mississippi River, which rose from the northeast at the present headwaters of the Saint Louis River, and flowed southwest to Sandy Lake along {{the course of the}} East Savanna. By the process of stream piracy, the smaller Saint Louis River captured the Cloquet River and then the Mississippi east of the present divide, diverting their waters southeast to Lake Superior. [...] In fact, the river now known as the East Savanna reversed its course; it once was the far upper Mississippi, flowing southwesterly here on its journey to the Gulf of Mexico, but after the Saint Louis River eroded its way upward to Floodwood, it became the present small, northeastward-flowing tributary of the Saint Louis in the Saint Lawrence watershed.|$|E

Immediately east of <b>Continental</b> <b>Glacier</b> lies East Torrey Glacier.|$|E
50|$|Overdeepening is {{exhibited}} {{across the}} range of glacially eroded geologic features.

50|$|As <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers</b> receded northward, a glacial moraine dammed the Connecticut River below Hartford, {{producing}} 200 mi Lake Hitchcock, with an arm extending northwest {{along the}} Westfield River.

25|$|Extensive {{evidence}} now {{shows that}} a number of periods of growth and retreat of <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers</b> occurred during the ice age, called glacials and interglacials.

50|$|About 18,000 years ago, {{during the}} Pleistocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period (Cenozoic Era), {{the level of}} the Pacific Ocean was {{considerably}} lower than it is now (because more water was in the polar ice-caps and <b>continental</b> <b>glaciers).</b> Deep submarine canyons were cut in the Monterey Bay area, {{as an extension of the}} Salinas River.|$|R
