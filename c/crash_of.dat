5|$|At that time, the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 663 was {{the fifth}} worst {{aviation}} accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States. It was and remains the third deadliest <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> a DC-7 (after Caledonian Airways Flight 153 and Northwest Airlines Flight 293), and is the 25th deadliest single-plane accident to have occurred in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The crash is {{the deadliest}} air {{disaster}} in France since the 1981 <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 1308 in which 180 people died, and the third-deadliest in France behind Flight 1308 and Turkish Airlines Flight 981. This {{was the first}} major <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> a civil airliner in France since the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Air France Flight 4590 on takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2000. It was also the third highest death toll of any accident involving an Airbus A320 after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 and TAM Airlines Flight 3054.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, Crossair was a {{majority}} owned subsidiary of SAirGroup. The <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Crossair Flight LX498 {{was the first time in}} Crossair's 25-year history that the regional airline had lost an aircraft, and was the deadliest accident to hit the SAirGroup since the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 flying from New York to Geneva that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia on 2 September 1998, killing all 229 aboard.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation {{seemed to be}} at least partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|In a flyer {{distributed}} in 1983, Gottlieb claimed over 125 licensed products. However, the North American video game <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> 1983 depressed the market, and the game's popularity {{began to decline}} by 1984.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he {{compared it to}} the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E

5|$|The <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> National Airlines Flight 2511 came {{shortly after}} the <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 {{exploded}} over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959. The cause of the explosion {{was believed to be}} a bomb in the luggage of one of the passengers, Dr. Robert Spears, who enlisted a substitute to board the plane in his place. Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> another DC-10 {{at the end}} of November, Air New Zealand Flight 901, exactly {{six months}} after Flight 191, added to the DC-10's {{negative}} reputation. The <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 901, an Antarctic sightseeing flight which hit a mountain, was caused by several human and environmental factors not related to the airworthiness of the DC-10, and the aircraft was later completely exonerated in that accident.|$|E
