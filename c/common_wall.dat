5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} two row houses, {{joined by}} a <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> and constructed of brick laid in a Flemish bond, near the city square in 1817. These houses lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented these houses until 1850, but after he sold them they were used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the row houses, before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E

5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
25|$|The two {{remaining}} original {{buildings on the}} Phoenix Block, {{one of which is}} the Kersey H. Fell building, are done in the Greek Revival style of architecture. They share a <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> and use simple stone lentils and sills in the windows. The storefronts are accented by columns. The <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> helped to increase the speed which the Phoenix Block was constructed at. So eager were merchants to occupy the storefronts that several stores opened for business while workers were still constructing the second and third floors of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{prominent}} {{example of}} an introduced species that became invasive is the European rabbit in Australia. Thomas Austin, a British landowner had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them.

25|$|Extensive housing {{construction}} {{occurred in the}} 1920s. The houses featured enclosed front porches, open back porches and stained-glass windows in the living rooms. Most of the houses were detached or semi-detached (very close to the neighboring house, but not sharing a <b>common</b> <b>wall)</b> built to roughly the same plan, with the living room, dining room and kitchen all in line and three bedrooms and a bath upstairs. The stairs were usually in the dining room. One of the builders was named Weyerman.|$|E
25|$|In {{thermodynamic}} terms, {{temperature is}} an intensive variable {{because it is}} equal to a differential coefficient of one extensive variable with respect to another, for a given body. It thus has the dimensions of a ratio of two extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a <b>common</b> <b>wall,</b> which has some specific permeability properties. Such specific permeability {{can be referred to}} a specific intensive variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state, the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal wall, this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Republic, under the KMT's {{political}} tutelage, the flag shared the same prominence as the KMT party flag. A <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War, the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the President and Vice President face to take the oath of office.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{approximate}} analytical {{solution of}} the integral equation concerning the equivalent magnetic current in the narrow slot, coupling two electrodynamic volumes, has been obtained by the averaging method. The formulas and the plots for currents and the coupling coefficients of longitudinal and transverse slots in the <b>common</b> <b>walls</b> of rectangular waveguides are represented. By means of the induced magnetomotive forces method using basis functions of current distribution, obtained by the averaging method, the following electrodynamic structures have been considered: the electrically long longitudinal slot in the <b>common</b> broad <b>wall</b> of rectangular waveguides; two symmetrical transverse slots in the <b>common</b> broad <b>wall</b> of rectangular waveguides; the transverse slots system in the <b>common</b> broad <b>wall</b> of rectangular waveguides. The problem about the resonant iris with the arbitrary oriented slot in the plane of cross-section of a rectangular waveguide has been solved by the averaging method. The problem about stepped junction of two semi-infinite rectangular waveguides with the impedance slotted iris has been solved by the induced magnetomotive forces method. The analytical formulas for the distributed surface impedance of homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetodielectric coatings of iris surface have been obtained. For {{a greater number of}} the considered electrodynamic structures the calculated values are compared with the results, obtained by numerical methods (also using commercial programs) and the experimental data. 80 Nesterenko et al...|$|R

2500|$|The {{harmonic}} oscillator and {{the systems}} it models {{have a single}} degree of freedom. [...] More complicated systems have more degrees of freedom, for example two masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed points and to each other). [...] In such cases, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others. [...] This leads to a coupling of the oscillations of the individual degrees of freedom. [...] For example, two pendulum clocks (of identical frequency) mounted on a <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> will tend to synchronise. This phenomenon was first observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665. [...] The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically appears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simpler and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into normal modes.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{predominantly}} {{not in a}} subtropical climate, some warmer-climate {{flora and}} fauna does reach well into Ohio. For instance, a number of trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio {{just north of the}} Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in {{much of the rest of}} the State.

Anderson's 13-year-old sister, who was shackled to a ball-and-chain inside the jail, suffered multiple injuries including two broken legs. Rumors circulated (later promulgated by Bingham who held a personal grudge against Ewing and who would seek financial compensation for the loss of the building) that the structure was undermined by the guards to cause its collapse.
