5|$|After the interval, Bradman {{continued}} with his strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, {{and set a}} defensive, well-spread field for Johnson's bowling. Edrich hit three consecutive boundaries from Johnson before lofting a fourth ball into the crowd for six. He then passed his half-centuryhis fourth consecutive Test score in excess of 50before Lindwall trapped him lbw for 51 to leave England at 232/3, ending a third-wicket partnership of 103. Crapp <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> added 18 before he was bowled by Lindwall, inside edging an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot. This left England at 260/4, and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley deliberately lifted Lindwall over the vacant slips region and reached seven before he fell to Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot. Johnston then had Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6, a lead of 316. Evans <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> edged his first ball through the slips at a catchable height for four. Compton drove Lindwall for a boundary but then fell to Johnston for 66, caught by Miller at cover. England were 293/7 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 {{at the close of}} the fourth day. Evansmainly through boundarieshad helped England to add 69 runs in the last 45 minutes of play.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E

5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris.

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit {{the ball into the}} ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side of}} the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> only managed five {{in his first}} Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{returned}} {{to lead the}} Australians in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London; Australia won the toss and batted first. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on 136, before Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 before the opener fell for 176. Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3/403. Hassett struck form and reached his first century for the English summer, posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test seamer Alec Bedser as Australia were bowled out for 632. Bedser pitched an outswinger on leg stump and it moved away to clip Hassett's off stump. Bradman’s men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{was given}} another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed. Harvey <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E
5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a stinger shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State. Snead <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> played {{the remainder of the}} game. The Longhorns fell behind by as much as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E

5|$|England {{set about}} {{extending}} their first innings lead {{for the remainder}} of the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. Johnston removed Washbrook for 65 before Johnson removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, leaving England at 129/2. Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off, adding 103 for the third wicket before Lindwall trapped Edrich for 54. Crapp <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> added 18 before Lindwall bowled him at 260/4 and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley made seven before Johnston removed him. Johnston then removed Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller, England were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining. They had lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker then helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 at the close of the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set {{a world record}} by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, all rounder Keith Miller came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a golden duck. Hamence <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with Sam Loxton. The partnership took only an hour, and Australia {{went on to win}} by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack of opportunities given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen. Batting at No. 5 in the next match against Oxford University, Hamence made only three as Australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth man before Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership.

He failed with the bat {{in the third and}} final match against India, scoring two and seven, but he took 2/60 in the first innings as India took the series 1–0. Overall, Miller had a disappointing series in the international matches, with 107 runs at 26.25 and four wickets at 40.50. Australia's final match was in Colombo against an All Ceylon team. Miller scored 132 as Australia won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Loxton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs {{before falling}} to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after {{the ball was}} hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
