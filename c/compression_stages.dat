50|$|In the {{high-temperature}} power stage, expanding {{high pressure}} hydrogen from the <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA. As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is ionized, producing protons and electrons. The protons {{pass through the}} membrane while the electrodes expel the electrons through a load. After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> From {{the perspective of the}} high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> In the <b>compression</b> <b>stage,</b> electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen. As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a heat exchanger that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool.|$|R

In doing so, it was hoped to study the VDP forming progress and manufacture “Steep-Flat ” VDP and “Flat ” VDP fiberboard. The results indicated that Closure phase of traditional hot-pressing curve failed to alter shape of mat thickness curve which control the shape of VDP. The mat manufactured by traditional hot-pressing curve was “Steep ” VDP and could not manufacture “Steep-Flat ” VDP and “Flat ” VDP; Closure phase of “high-low-high ” hot-pressing curve could be separated into rapid <b>compression</b> <b>stage,</b> thickness expansion <b>stage,</b> and second <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> The density of surface layer formed at rapid <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> and decided by first high-pressure.

If the normal analog method is used for a digital compressor, the signals traveling through the parallel pathways will arrive at the summing mixer at slightly different times, creating unpleasant comb-filtering and phasing effects. The digital compressor pathway takes a little more time to process the sound—on the order of 0.3 to 3 milliseconds longer. Instead, the two pathways must both have the same number of processing stages: the [...] "straight" [...] pathway is assigned a compression stage which is not given an aggressively high ratio. In this case, the two signals both go through <b>compression</b> <b>stages,</b> and both pathways are delayed the same amount of time, but one is set to do no dynamic range compression, or to do very little, and the other is set for high amounts of gain reduction.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} {{often have}} better unloading capabilities than scroll compressors. Reciprocating compressors operate efficiently in unloaded mode when flow {{to some of}} the cylinders is completely cut off by internal solenoid valves. Two-stage reciprocating compressors are also well suited for vapor injection (or what may be called economized operation) when partially expanded flow is injected {{between the first and second}} <b>compression</b> <b>stages</b> for increased capacity and improved efficiency. While scroll compressors can also rely on vapor injection to vary the capacity, their vapor injection operation is not as efficient as for the case of reciprocating compressors. This inefficiency is caused by continuously changing volume of the scroll compressor compression pocket during the vapor injection process. As the volume is continuously being changed the pressure within the compression pocket is also continuously changing which adds inefficiency to the vapor injection process. In case of a two-stage reciprocating compressor the vapor injection takes place between the two stages, where there is no changing volume. Both scroll and reciprocating compressors can be unloaded from mid-stage compression, however reciprocating compressors are also more efficient for this mode of unloading than scroll compressors, because the unloaded port dimensions in case of scroll is limited by the internal port size, which would not be the case for a reciprocating compressor where unloading again occurs from between the two stages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{algorithm}} for {{the compression}} of dynamic {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) data is presented. It consists of a temporal <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> based on the application of principal component analysis (PCA) directly to the PET sinograms to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This {{is followed by a}} spatial <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> using JPEG 2000 to each PCA channel weighted by the signal in each channel. By combining these temporal and spatial compression techniques we can achieve a compression ratio as high as 129 : 1 while simultaneously reducing noise and improving functional estimation compared with the uncompressed data, and preserving the sinogram data for later analysis. We validate our approach with a simulated phantom FDG brain study and clinical dynamic PET datasets. The results of performance evaluation suggest the new compression technique not only is able to reduce the original sinogram datasets by more than 95 %, but also improve the reconstructed image quality for the quantitative analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} varying the {{cross-sectional}} flow area of the passages of a wave rotor is examined {{by means of the}} method of characteristics. An idealized expansion wave, an idealized inlet port, and an idealized <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> are considered. It is found that area variation does not have a very significant effect on the expansion wave, nor on the <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> For the expansion wave, increasing the passage area in the flow direction has the same effect as a diffuser, so that the flow emerges at a lower velocity than it would for the constant area case. This could be advantageous. The inlet is strongly affected by the area variation, as it changes the strength of the hammer shock wave, thereby changing the pressure behind it. In this case, reduction in the passage area in the flow direction leads to increased pressure. However, this result is dependent {{on the assumption that the}} inlet conditions remain constant with area variation. This may not be the case...|$|R
