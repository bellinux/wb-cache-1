25|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} {{is also a}} form of <b>cellular</b> <b>regeneration.</b> For example, hippocampal neuron renewal {{occurs in}} normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons. Cardiac myocyte renewal {{has been found to}} occur in normal adult humans, and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction. Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.|$|E
25|$|However, {{humans are}} limited in their {{capacity}} for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered <b>cellular</b> <b>regeneration</b> (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.|$|E

Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in skates and rays. After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina. [...] White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver {{and this has been}} linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study two thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours {{more than half of the}} liver had undergone hypertrophy. [...] Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9–12 days [...] and this is an example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity. [...] It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. [...] Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding the mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.|$|E

25|$|In biology, {{regeneration}} is {{the process}} of renewal, restoration, and growth that makes genomes, cells, organisms, and ecosystems resilient to natural fluctuations or events that cause disturbance or damage. Every species is capable of regeneration, from bacteria to humans. Regeneration can either be complete where the new tissue {{is the same as the}} lost tissue, or incomplete where after the necrotic tissue comes fibrosis. At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of gene regulation. Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the morphogenic processes that characterize the phenotypic plasticity of traits allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual <b>cellular</b> processes. <b>Regeneration</b> is different from reproduction. For example, hydra perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of budding.|$|R

40|$|Control of the 3 D {{microenvironment}} for {{cultured cells}} {{is essential for}} understanding the complex relationships that biomolecular concentration gradients have on <b>cellular</b> growth, <b>regeneration,</b> and differentiation. This paper reports a microfluidic device for delivering gradients of soluble molecules to cells in an open reservoir without exposing the cells to flow. The cells are cultured on a polyester membrane that shields them from the flow that delivers the gradient. A novel “lid” design is implemented which prevents leakage from around the membrane without requiring sealing agents or adhesives. Once layers are molded, device fabrication can be performed within minutes while at room temperature. Surface gradients were characterized with epifluorescence microscopy; image analysis verified that sharp gradients (∼ 33 μm wide) can be reproducibly generated. We show that heterogeneous laminar flow patterns of Orange and Green Cell Tracker (CT) applied beneath the membrane can be localized to cells cultured on the other side; concentration profile scans show the extent of CT diffusion parallel to the membrane’s surface to be 10 – 20 μm. Our device is ideal for conventional cell culture because the cell culture surface is readily accessible to physical manipulation (e. g., micropipette access), the cell culture medium is {{in direct contact with}} the incubator atmosphere (i. e., no special protocols for ensuring proper equilibration of gas concentrations are required), and the cells are not subjected to flow-induced shear forces, which are advantageous attributes not commonly found in closed-channel microfluidic designs...|$|R
