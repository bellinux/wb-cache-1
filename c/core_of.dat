These meteorites are thus the only means of directly examining deep-interior materials and their processes.|$|R
50|$|In most {{original}} CSAs, a <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members existed. This <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members {{helped to}} make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions. CSAs with a <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members are most profitable and successful. However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members. CSAs with a <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group <b>of</b> <b>core</b> members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.|$|R

40|$|We use the {{information}} present in a bipartite network to detect <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> communities of each set of the bipartite system. <b>Cores</b> <b>of</b> communities are found by investigating statistically validated projected networks obtained using information present in the bipartite network. <b>Cores</b> <b>of</b> communities are highly informative and robust {{with respect to the}} presence of errors or missing entries in the bipartite network. We assess the statistical robustness <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> by investigating an artificial benchmark network, the co-authorship network, and the actor-movie network. The accuracy and precision of the partition obtained with respect to the reference partition are measured in terms of the adjusted Rand index and of the adjusted Wallace index respectively.
