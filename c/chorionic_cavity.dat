50|$|The <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> is {{enclosed}} by the chorionic plate, which {{is composed of}} an inner layer of somatopleuric mesoderm and an outer layer of trophoblast cells.|$|E
50|$|During embryogenesis, the extraembryonic coelom (or <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity)</b> that {{constitutes}} the gestational sac is {{a portion of}} the conceptus consisting of a cavity between Heuser's membrane and the Trophoblast.|$|E
50|$|The gestational sac is {{the large}} cavity of fluid {{surrounding}} the embryo. During early embryogenesis it consists of the extra-embryonic coelom, also called the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity.</b> The gestational sac is normally contained within the uterus. It is the only available structure {{that can be used}} to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy exists until the embryo is identified.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> (Extra-embryonic coelom) and the yolk sac (umbilical vesicle) is still up for debate. The thought of how the yolk sac membranes are formed begins {{with an increase in}} production of hypoblast cells, succeeded by different patterns of migration. On day 8, the first portion of hypoblast cells begin their migration and make {{what is known as the}} primary yolk sac, or Heuser's membrane (exocoelomic membrane). By day 12, the primary yolk sac has been disestablished by a new batch of migrating hypoblast cells that now contribute to the definitive yolk sac. While the primary yolk sac is forming, extraembryonic mesoderm makes its way into the blastocyst cavity to fill it with loosely packed cells. When the extraembryonic mesoderm is separated into two portions, a new gap arises called the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity,</b> or the extra-embryonic coelom. This new cavity is responsible for detaching the embryo and its amnion and yolk sac from the far wall of the blastocyst, which is now named the chorion. When the extraembryonic mesoderm splits into two layers, the amnion, yolk sac, and chorion follow its lead and also become double layered. The chorion and amnion are composed of extraembryonic ectoderm and mesoderm, where as the yolk sac is made of extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm. When day 13 rolls around, the connecting stalk, a dense portion of extraembryonic mesoderm, restrains the embryonic disc in the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mammalian embryos develop two cavities: the intraembryonic coelom and the extraembryonic coelom (or <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity).</b> The intraembryonic coelom {{is lined}} by somatic and splanchnic lateral plate mesoderm, while the extraembryonic coelom is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm. The intraembryonic coelom {{is the only}} cavity that {{persists}} in the mammal at term, which is why its name is often contracted to simply coelomic cavity. Subdividing the coelomic cavity into compartments, for example, the pericardial cavity / pericardium, where the heart develops, simplifies discussion of the anatomies of complex animals.|$|E
50|$|The embryoblast {{forms an}} {{embryonic}} disc, {{which is a}} bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the hypoblast (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the epiblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> or extraembryonic coelom.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner cell mass}} {{will give}} rise to the embryo proper, the amnion, yolk sac and allantois, while the fetal part of the {{placenta}} will form from the outer trophoblast layer. The embryo plus its membranes is called the conceptus, and by this stage the conceptus has reached the uterus. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, and the now exposed cells of the trophoblast allow the blastocyst to attach itself to the endometrium, where it will implant.The formation of the hypoblast and epiblast, which are the two main layers of the bilaminar germ disc, occurs {{at the beginning of}} the second week. Either the embryoblast or the trophoblast will turn into two sub-layers. The inner cells will turn into the hypoblast layer, which will surround the other layer, called the epiblast, and these layers will form the embryonic disc that will develop into the embryo. The trophoblast will also develop two sub-layers: the cytotrophoblast, which is front of the syncytiotrophoblast, which in turn lies within the endometrium. Next, another layer called the exocoelomic membrane or Heuser’s membrane will appear and surround the cytotrophoblast, as well as the primitive yolk sac. The syncytiotrophoblast will grow and will enter a phase called lacunar stage, in which some vacuoles will appear and be filled by blood in the following days. The development of the yolk sac starts with the hypoblastic flat cells that form the exocoelomic membrane, which will coat the inner part of the cytotrophoblast to form the primitive yolk sac. An erosion of the endothelial lining of the maternal capillaries by the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the sinusoids will form where the blood will begin to penetrate and flow through the trophoblast to give rise to the uteroplacental circulation. Subsequently new cells derived from yolk sac will be established between trophoblast and exocelomic membrane and will give rise to extra-embryonic mesoderm, which will form the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
30|$|Conservative medical {{management}} can {{be achieved}} using systemic intramuscular administration of methotrexate [13] or ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection into the <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> of patients with an intramyometrial pregnancy without a fetal heartbeat [12, 13]. Intra-amniotic injection of methotrexate can also be associated with intrafetal injection of potassium chloride in case of intramyometrial pregnancy {{with the presence of}} a fetal heartbeat [1].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Previous studies {{indicate}} that morphine consumption during pregnancy can inhibit embryonic development. The present study evaluated the effects of orally administered morphine {{on the development of}} embryonic cavities in nine day pregnant rats. Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing between 170 - 200 grams were used in the present study. Experimental group received morphine (0. 05 mg/ml of tap water) after one night coupling with male rats for mating. On the 9 th day of pregnancy, the pregnant animals were anesthetized with chloroform and the embryos were removed surgically and fixed in 10 % formalin for a week. The fixed embryos were processed and stained by H & E method and evaluated. The surface areas of amniotic and chorionic cavities and the whole body surface area of embryos were calculated using MOTIC software. Results: Findings indicated that both <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> and whole body surface areas of embryos were increased in the experimental group. In addition, surface area of amniotic cavity was reduced in experimental group. Conclusion: This study showed that oral morphine consumption caused a significant decrease in the embryonic amniotic cavity and furthermore, delay in natural embryonic amniotic cavity development can result in abnormal function and growth defect of the kidneys of infants of mothers addicted to morphine...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to use a linear {{regression}} model previously developed in a pilot study to calculate days before parturition (DbP) using inner <b>chorionic</b> <b>cavity</b> (ICC), biparietal diameter (BPD), crown-rump length (CRL), body diameter (BD) and deep portion of telencephalic vesicle (DPTV) in German shepherd dogs (GSD) with known ovulation day and then to test that model in bitches with unknown ovulation day. In our current study, a model for GSD bitches published in a previous report, proved satisfactory for ICC [DbP= 44. 76 -(4. 34 ×ICC) ] and BPD [DbP= 38. 65 -(12. 86 ×BPD) ]. We therefore used their model, but developed a new one for CRL, BD and DPTV. For ICC and BPD, we tested accuracy for more than 35 days before parturition (ICC) and more than 15 days before parturition (BPD). Measurements were taken {{on at least two}} fetuses during each ultrasound recording (US) of 22 GSD bitches with known (n= 16) and unknown (n= 6) ovulation days. The accuracy of the above model was 77 - 100 % for ICC and 83 - 96 % for BPD with a precision of ± 1 and ± 2 days, respectively. Accuracy increased significantly when US was performed more than 35 days before parturition for ICC and more than 15 days before parturition for BPD. BD and CRL were the most accurate parameters (R(2) = 0. 95 and 0. 85). In bitches with unknown ovulation day, BD accuracy was 71. 4 - 100 % with a precision of ± 1 day and ± 2 days, respectively. CRL and DPTV were less accurate (± 1 day, 60 %; ± 2 days, 80 % accuracy) ...|$|E
