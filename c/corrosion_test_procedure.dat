40|$|An {{accelerated}} corrosion test, {{known as}} proving ground accelerated test, is commonly performed by automotive manufacturers {{to evaluate the}} corrosion performance of a vehicle. The test combines corrosion and durability inputs to detect potential failures that may occur during in-service conditions. Currently, the test is conducted at an external test center overseas. Such test is aimed to simulate the effects of one year accelerated corrosion in severe corrosive environment of the north-east and south east of America. However, the test results obtained do not correlate with the actual corrosion conditions observed in the Malaysian market, which is likely attributed to the different test environment of the tropical climate of vehicles in service. Therefore, a vehicle accelerated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> that suits the Malaysian market is proposed and benchmarked with other global car manufacturers that have their own dedicated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure.</b> In the present work, a test track is used as the corrosion test ground and consists of various types of roads for structural durability exposures. Corrosion related facilities like salt trough, mud trough and gravel road are constructed as addition to the existing facilities. The establishment of accelerated corrosion test facilities {{has contributed to the}} development of initial accelerated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> for the national car manufacturer. The corrosion exposure is monitored by fitting test coupons at the underbody of test vehicle using mass loss technique so that the desired corrosion rate capable of simulating the real time corrosion effects for its target market...|$|E
40|$|The HVAC&R {{industry}} {{is looking to}} transition from copper-aluminum heat exchangers to all-aluminum microchannel technology. The want for the transition stemmed from seeing the performance improvement of all-aluminum microchannel radiators in the automotive industry. Applications differ between the two industries; therefore, applying this technology for HVAC&R use must be validated. Research towards operating modes of an all-aluminum heat exchanger in a defined corrosive environment will provide the industry with {{a better understanding of}} heat exchanger design and heat exchanger material selection. The worth in this is preventing overdesign and producing more efficient heat exchangers. Furthermore, ASHRAE members and the corrosion community will find value in a defined corrosion system and <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure.</b> The information gained through past research has progressed assessment of material performance; however, the methods improperly simulate and expedite natural weathering. The most common method being used is the ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) Sea Water Acetic Acid Test. The research discussed in this paper was focused on improving a standard corrosion system by implementing system modifications to simulate heat exchanger operation while performing a modified wet-dry cyclic test (e. g. ASTM G 85 Annex 5). The goal is to produce results that are more representative of natural corrosion behavior and its forms. Current results were gathered from five of ten samples that underwent initial testing. Finally, possible improvements towards the chamber system and the test method, including the salt solution, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of optical engineering in industrial processing is gaining greater acceptance. The range of surface treatment processes available {{goes all the}} way from transformation hardening, annealing, shock hardening and bending (as processes which do not involve melting) to processes which involve melting such as surface melting, surface alloying, surface cladding and those processes which involve some form of photochemistry such as laser chemical vapour deposition, laser physical vapour deposition and stereolithography. One of these processes, laser cladding, has been recently extended at University of Liverpool to provide a technique of rapid alloy scanning whereby variable composition laser clad tracks can be laid down by the laser thus giving the whole range of compositions in the alloy system in a single sample. Evaluation of specimens of this type can be carried out by a range of micro <b>testing</b> techniques including <b>corrosion</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Laser surface treatment processes available for the production of corrosion resistant surfaces are reviewed. These include surface melting, surface alloying and surface cladding procedures.

30|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} that new cleaning techniques are tested and evaluated on artificial corroded dummies. For pure silver, several corrosion procedures have been used because they all appear to produce Ag 2 S. However, for sterling silver the <b>tested</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>procedures</b> seem to generate variations in morphologies, compositions and voids below the surface. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} the cleaning performance might be affected by the corrosion procedure used. Moreover, several indications suggest that the natural corrosion state of sterling silver cannot be considered as a single corrosion state but merely a set of corrosion states. The variation between artificial corrosion procedures and within natural corrosion processes complicates the representativity of the cleaning tests for genuine historical objects.|$|R
