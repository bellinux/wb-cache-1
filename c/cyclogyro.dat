According to one the designers, Mr. Yu Hong-Ku (于宏坤), it took around four months to from the design first started and first successful maiden flight on September 16, 2011.

5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of the <b>cyclogyro</b> design {{from the}} company stationery. The image is inaccurate: the {{airfoils}} had a limited degree of rotation, and would face [...] "down" [...] on the front portion of the disk, whereas this image shows them facing forward.|$|E
5000|$|Jonathan Edward Caldwell {{appears to}} have been the first to patent the concept, and invent the term. He filed a patent on the concept that was granted in 1927, but {{immediately}} moved on to an ornithopter design and then an autogyro. Several attempts to build a working <b>cyclogyro</b> were made by other designers. The earliest full-sized example appears to be the Schroeder S1 from 1930, which used the <b>cyclogyro</b> [...] "wheels" [...] for forward thrust only. Adolf Rohrbach of Germany designed a full VTOL version in 1933, which was later developed in the US and featured a tall fish-like fuselage to keep the wings well clear of the ground. Another early example was by Rahn Aircraft in 1935, which used two much larger chord wings instead of a multi-blade wheel driven by a 240 hp supercharged Wright Whirlwind In 1935 NACA carried out a series of wind tunnel experiments on the <b>cyclogyro</b> concept, and found that the power required to turn the wheels was much higher than expected. Theoretical tools of the era simply weren't useful for prediction on the highly asymmetrical lift profiles and the greatly simplified models they used varied dramatically from real-world results. Early experiments then ended.|$|E
50|$|Caldwell {{then turned}} to an even more bizarre {{aircraft}} design, an ornithopter. The wings were equipped with flexible fabric valves which were supposed to open on the upstroke and close on the downstroke, allowing it to generate lift with no forward motion and thus provide VTOL service, like the <b>cyclogyro.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 a {{team at the}} University of Singapore built {{a working}} model of <b>cyclogyro,</b> {{although}} it has only flown in tethered flight. Their cycloidal model was a modified helicopter, with the rotor replaced with two sideways cycloidal rotors, each with three blades sticking out {{of them in the}} perpendicular.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cyclogyro,</b> or cyclocopter, is an {{aircraft}} design that uses cyclorotors {{as the principal}} source of lift, propulsion, and control. They are capable of vertical {{take off and landing}} and hovering performance like a helicopter, without the same disadvantages such as limited forward speed, very high noise and vibration levels, limited flight altitude etc. The biggest hope of Cyclocopter developers, which remains unrealised in any flying prototypes, is to achieve higher efficiency in terms of lift per engine horsepower (aka Power Loading) which would translate into higher lifting capability and longer flight range. Although a number of cyclogyros were built in the 1930s, none were known to have successfully flown until 2011. The <b>cyclogyro</b> should not be mistaken for Flettner airplanes, the aerodynamically different aircraft designs using cylindrical wings which attempted to harness the Magnus effect.|$|E
5000|$|Caldwell formed Gravity Aeroplane Company in Reno, Nevada (Caldwell {{was living}} in Santa Monica at the time) and issued stock in 1928. Their company {{stationary}} included an illustration showing the <b>cyclogyro,</b> a version with four airfoils per [...] "wing", attached on the fuselage end to a large disk and the outer end to a cross-like support.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of traditional rotors is severely deteriorated at low Reynolds Numbers by low angle-of-attack blade stall. Current hover-capable MAVs can stay aloft for only minutes. Cyclorotor MAVs (very small scale cyclogyros) could utilize unsteady lift to extend endurance. The smallest <b>cyclogyro</b> flown to date weighs only 29 grams and {{was developed by}} the advanced vertical flight laboratory at Texas A&M university.|$|E
5000|$|A team at Northwestern Polytechnical University in China built a free flying <b>Cyclogyro.</b> This design {{used two}} {{cycloidal}} rotors for the efficient generation of lift and small and noisy conventional head and tail rotors {{to stabilize the}} craft and provide control of its horizontal position and direction of flight. Video of the team's test flights can be found here. In September 2013 another Cyclocopter model was flight tested in China ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cyclogyro</b> wing {{resembles a}} paddle wheel, with {{airfoils}} replacing the paddles. The airfoils' pitch (angle of attack) is adjusted either collectively (by {{means of a}} control ring with links to all blades, which is located eccentrically and variably relative to the rotor's axis of rotation) or the blades are individually adjustable in pitch and are adjusted continually by the control system as they move around the rotor's axis. In normal forward flight the airfoils are given a slight positive pitch at the upper and forward portions of their arc, producing lift and forward thrust. They are given flat or negative pitch at the bottom, and are [...] "flat" [...] {{through the rest of}} the circle to produce little or no lift in other directions. The pitch can be adjusted to change the thrust profile, allowing the <b>cyclogyro</b> to travel in any direction. Differential thrust between the two wings (one on either side of the fuselage) can be used to turn the aircraft around its vertical axis, although conventional tail surfaces are generally used as well.|$|E

New Era made its public debut in 2012 at the Fifth Innovation Cup future aircraft design competition. New Era is a unique UAV in that it combines <b>cyclogyro</b> and fan wing designs.|$|E

The general designer of Fire Wheel is associate professor Mr. Hu Yu (胡峪), who led his team spend around a year to complete the design. Specification: ...|$|E
50|$|By 1931 {{there was}} still no working prototype, and Caldwell moved to Orangeburg, New York, and later to Madison, New Jersey. A January 14, 1932 {{newsreel}} film shows the ornithopter being readied for a test. This was apparently attempted without success, by the otherwise unknown Emile Harrier. Additional funds were then raised by another stock issue in order to build a full-sized prototype at Teterboro Airport. He also apparently restarted his <b>cyclogyro</b> work, and an article appeared in one of the Popular Mechanics-like magazines showing the design equipped with a V-8 engine mounted in an odd twin-fuselage with the pilot and passengers below.|$|E
50|$|Future developments, {{such as a}} {{variable}} cycloidal rotor, may improve the <b>cyclogyro</b> design. This technology allows the blades to travel about the horizontal axis along the most aerodynamically desirable orbit as continuously determined by the control system. This orbit will generally be non-circular and elongated, with that orbit shape dynamically modified by the control system as the flight regime and conditions change to keep the relative airflow about the blades optimized. The dynamic counterbalancing of the blades radial movements is used to keep the rotor balanced. This design would also allow their operation and the blade orbit shape to be optimized {{not only for the}} highest efficiency, but alternatively also for the highest flight speed or for the highest possible lifting capability or for the most silent operation. Presently this technology is being researched in Israel and in China.|$|E
50|$|A cyclorotor, {{cycloidal}} rotor, {{cycloidal propeller}} or cyclogiro, is a fluid propulsion device that converts shaft power into {{the acceleration of}} a fluid using a rotating axis perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. It uses several blades with a spanwise axis parallel to the axis of rotation and perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. These blades are cyclically pitched twice per revolution to produce force (thrust or lift) in any direction normal to the axis of rotation. Cyclorotors are used for propulsion, lift, and control on air and water vehicles. An aircraft using cyclorotors as {{the primary source of}} lift, propulsion, and control is known as a <b>cyclogyro.</b> The patented application, used on the ships with particular actuation mechanisms both mechanics or hydraulics is named from the name of the German company that produces them: Voith-Schneider cycloidal propellers.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclorotors {{can produce}} lift and thrust at high advance ratios, which, in theory, would enable a <b>cyclogyro</b> {{aircraft}} to fly at subsonic speeds well exceeding those of single rotor helicopters. Single rotor helicopters {{are limited in}} forward speed {{by a combination of}} retreating blade stall and sonic blade tip constraints. As helicopters fly forward, the tip of the advancing blade experiences a wind velocity that is the sum of the helicopter forward speed and rotor rotational speed. This value cannot exceed the speed of sound if the rotor is to be efficient and quiet. Slowing the rotor rotational speed avoids this problem, but presents another. In the traditional method of the composition of velocity it is easy to understand that the velocity experienced by the retreating blade has a value that is produced by the vector composition of the velocity of blade rotation and the freestream velocity. In this condition it is evident that in presence of a sufficiently high advance ratio the velocity of air on the retreating blade is low. The flapping movement of the blade changes the angle of attach. It is then possible for the blade to reach the stall condition. In this case it is necessary that the stalling blade increases the pitch angle to keep some lift capability. This risk puts constraints on the design of the system. An accurate choice of the wing profile is necessary and careful dimensioning of the radius of the rotor for the specified speed range. Slow speed cyclorotors bypass this problem through a horizontal axis of rotation and operating at a comparatively low blade tip speed. For higher speeds, which may become necessary for industrial applications, it seems necessary to adopt more sophisticated strategies and solutions. A solution is the independent actuation of the blades which have been recently patented and successfully tested for naval use [...] by use on hydraulic actuation system. In the aeronautic domain similar solutions appear difficult, because of the necessity of maintaining a low ratio between weight and thrust. One solution has been proposed by the Austrian inventor Meinhard Schwaiger with his turbomachine patent. The horizontal axis of rotation always provides an advancement of the upper blades, that produce always a positive lift by the full rotor. These characteristics could help overcome two issues of helicopters: their low energy efficiency and the advance ratio limitation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the rotocycloid {{propeller}} are Russian and relates to aeronautic domain. Sverchkov's Samoljot, St-Peterburg, 1909, or [...] "wheel orthopter" [...] has been the first vehicle expressly thought for using this propulsion. Its scheme came near to cyclogiro, but it's difficult to classify it precisely. It had three flat surfaces and a rudder; rear edge of one of surfaces could be bent, replacing the action of an elevator. Lift and thrust had to be created by paddle wheels consisting of 12 blades, established in pairs under a 120° angle. The blades of a concave shape were changing an angle of incidence by the means of eccentrics and springs. In a bottom of the craft 10 hp engine was arranged. Transmission was ensured by a belt. Empty weight was about 200 kg. [...] "Samoljot" [...] was constructed by the military engineer E.P.Sverchkov with the grants of the Main Engineering Agency in St.Petersburg in 1909, was demonstrated at the Newest Inventions Exhibition and won a medal. Otherwise, it could not pass the preliminary tests without flying. In 1914, Russian inventor and scientist A.N. Lodygin has addressed to Russian government with the project of the cyclogiro-like aircraft, which scheme wabs similar to Sverchkov's [...] "Samoljot". The project was not carried out. In 1933, experiments in Germany by Adolf Rohrbach resulted in a paddle-wheel wing arrangement. Oscillating winglets went from positive to negative angles of attack during each revolution to create lift, and their eccentric mounting would, in theory, produce nearly any combination of horizontal and vertical forces. The DVL evaluated Rohrbach’s design, but the foreign aviation journals of the time {{cast doubt on the}} soundness of the design which meant that funding for the project could not be raised, even with a latter proposal as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft.There appears to be no evidence that this design was ever built, let alone flown.Based on Rohrbach’s paddle-wheel research, however, Platt in the US designed by 1933 his own independent <b>Cyclogyro.</b> His paddle-wheel wing arrangement was awarded a US patent (which was only one of many similar patents on file), and underwent extensive wind-tunnel testing at MIT in 1927. Despite this, there is no evidence Platt’s aircraft was ever built.The first operative cycloid propulsion has been developed at Voight. Its origins date to the decision of the Voith company to focus on the business of transmission gear assemblies for turbines. The famous Voight propeller has, based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous turbine projects. It was invented by Ernst Schneider, and enhanced by Voith. It was launched with name of Voith-Schneider Propeller (VSP) for commercial vessels. This new marine drive could significantly improve the manoeuvrability of a ship as demonstrated in the successful sea trials on the test boat Torqueo, in 1937. The first Voith Schneider Propellers were put into operation in the narrow canals of Venice, Italy. During the 1937 World Fair in Paris, Voith was awarded the grand prize - three times - for its exhibition of Voith Schneider Propellers and Voith turbo-transmissions. A year later, two of Paris' fire-fighting boats started operating with the new VSP system.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{four key}} design {{parameters}} of cycloidal rotors, namely the airfoil section, number of blades, chord-to-radius ratio, and pitching axis location, are addressed. The four parameters, {{which have a}} strong effect on rotor aerodynamic efficiency, are analyzed with an analytical model and a numerical approach. The numerical method, {{which is based on}} a finite-volume discretization of two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a multiple sliding mesh, is proposed and validated against experimental data. A parametric analysis is then carried out considering a large-scale <b>cyclogyro,</b> suitable for payloads above 100 kg, in hovering conditions. Results demonstrate that the airfoil thickness significantly affects the rotor performance; such a result is partly in contrast with previous findings for small-scale and microscale configurations. Moreover, it will be shown that increasing the number of blades could result in a decrease of the rotor efficiency. The effect of chord-to-radius will demonstrate that values of around 0. 5 result in higher efficiency. Finally it is found out that for these large systems, in contrast with microscale cyclogyros, the generated thrust increases as the pitching axis is located away from the leading edge, up to 35 % of chord length. Furthermore, the shortcomings of using simplified analytical tools in the prediction of thrust and power in nonideal flow conditions are discussed...|$|E
