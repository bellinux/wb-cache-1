40|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} multiphase sheet steels in {{the automotive industry}} has led to considerable interest in the fatigue properties of these materials. The different microstructural phases within matelials such as TRIP steels can influence the fatigue behaviour due to {{the manner in which}} the cyclic strain is accommodated within these phases. In this study fully reversed straincontrolled fatigue tests were perfonnrmed on a commercially-produced uncoated TRIP 780 steel both in the as-received and 20 % prestrained condition. The pre-strained TRIP steel showed significant cyclic softening at higher strain amplitudes, whereas some initial work hardening was observed at lower strain amplitudes before cyclic softening. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>stabilised</b> strength of the pre-strained TRIP steel was independent of strain amplitude, while the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stabilised</b> strength of the as-received TRIP steel increased with strain amplitude. Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was used to examine the effect of the cyclic deformation on the microstructure of the different conditions, with the differences in fatigue behaviour explained based on the differences in the deformation structure formed within the steel (i. e. dislocation density and sub-structure and microband formation). <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinematics}} {{of upper}} limb movements and {{the coordination of}} eye and hand movements are affected by ageing. These age differences are exacerbated when task difficulty is increased, but {{the exact nature of}} these differences remains to be established. We examined the performance of 12 older adults (mean age = 74) and 11 younger adults (mean age = 20) on a multi-phase prehension task. Participants had to reach for a target ball with their preferred hand, pick it up and place it in a tray, then reach for a second target ball and place that in the same tray. On half the trials (<b>stabilising</b> <b>condition),</b> participants were required to hold the tray just above the surface of the table with their non-preferred hand and keep it as still as possible. Hand and eye movements were recorded. Older adults took longer to complete their movements and reached lower peak velocities than the younger adults. Group differences were most apparent in the <b>stabilising</b> <b>condition,</b> suggesting that the added complexity had a greater effect on the performance of the older adults than the young. During pickup, older adults preferred to make an eye movement to the next target as soon as possible, but spent longer fixating the current target during placement, when accuracy requirements were higher. These latter observations suggest that older adults employed a task-dependent eye movement strategy, looking quickly to the next target to allow more time for planning and execution when possible, but fixating on their hand and successful placement of the ball when necessary...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} about the {{physical}} understanding and a complete theoretical modelling of the sounding instrument called bullroarer and used by aboriginal tribesmen. The running of the bullroarer clearly involves aeromechanical aspects, {{closely related to the}} process of autorotation, as well as aeroacoustical aspects. Both are investigated here. The mechanical equations are solved in a first step, using a set of two–dimensional unsteady RANS computations as a way to deduce the instantaneous aerodynamic moment and forces. The kinematics and the unsteady forces are used in a second step to calculate the radiated sound field, according to the acoustic analogy. Preliminary theoretical results for the autorotation sound of a rectangular plate in <b>stabilised</b> <b>conditions</b> are found to agree well with measurements performed in an open-jet anechoic wind tunnel.

The fatigue response of the materials has been studied in both conditions by using a fatigue test machine working at 250 Hz.

The curve representing the stress amplitude fatigue life response of the material in the Zr <b>stabilised</b> <b>condition</b> showed a classical behaviour with increasing fatigue life as cyclic stress decreases. A fatigue life of 107 cycles at 110 MPa was recorded. The microstructure in the as-received and deformed conditions was characterised by optical and electron microscopy techniques; the crack growth and propagation were determined by scanning electron microscopy observations. The microstructure was characterised by very small equiaxed grains in the cross section respect to the extrusion direction; fracture surfaces showed distinct regions of stable crack growth and overload and the micromechanisms of damage initiation and propagation were clearly recognised...|$|R

40|$|Enterococci are {{significant}} agents of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) in the UK, including endocarditis, urinary tract infections and infections of surgical sites and indwelling foreign devices. These bacteria account for over 20 % of HAI {{cases in the}} UK, which in total cost the National Health Service an estimated £ 1 billion per annum. Two significant clinical features of these bacteria are: (1) their ability to adhere to host tissues such as heart valves and the urinary tract and to prosthetics such as catheters and to then establish biofilms (thick layers of bacterial cells {{that are difficult to}} treat with antibiotics); and (2) their ability to produce proteases that weaken heart valves and other tissues. One mechanism by which these bacteria activate production of these virulence features is through the Fsr signal transduction pathway, in which the first step is activation of the FsrC membrane sensory protein by a pheromone called gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP). Investigations of this important interaction and its potential inhibition have formerly been hampered by the technical challenges associated with obtaining and working with purified FsrC because it is a hydrophobic membrane protein. However, the facilities at the Circular Dichroism beamline (B 23) at Diamond Light Source allowed us to successfully investigate FsrC-GBAP and FsrC-inhibitor binding using relatively small amounts of purified intact protein, and to define <b>stabilising</b> <b>conditions</b> under which quantitative ligand binding data for FsrC and presumably other membrane proteins more generally can be obtained using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|The figure-ground {{distinction}} is particularly interesting where the same stimulus can {{give rise to}} more than the one interpretation of figure. The work presented here examines the role of eye movements in such figure perception. The figure-ground dichotomy is first elaborated and stimuli which can give different figural interpretations are classified as reversible perspective or ambiguous figures. Theories which have been proposed to account for such figure perception are then reviewed and {{it is argued that}} a schematic map theory offers a plausible explanation. The parameters which have been studied with regard to these stimuli are then considered and it is argued that the role of eye movements has not been adequately investigated. Stimuli are then proposed to be composed of elements which are differentially weighted towards each figural aspect. Figure perception is largely a result of an observer selectively attending to these elements as determined by the schematic map. Eye movements function to move such attention about the stimulus. A series of afterimage experiments then examines the existence of such elements in a line drawing of Boring's ambiguous figure. The response of figure was found to be governed by the elements to which the subject could attend. Two free-viewing experiments are then reported which demonstrated that in a non- <b>stabilised</b> <b>condition</b> the immediate response of figure was determined by the elements present in the stimulus. No age-related effects of such elements were found when children served as subjects. Eye movement types and recording techniques are then reviewed and an inconspicuous recording method developed. Subjects' eye movements were then recorded as they viewed versions of the ambiguous figure. The results are interpreted as supporting a schematic map explanation. A model is finally developed to account for the role of eye movements in figure perception...|$|R
40|$|Thauera selenatis is a {{bacterium}} that can respire using selenate {{as the sole}} electron acceptor and produce elemental selenium {{in the form of}} nanospheres. Analysis of the secreted protein profile from T. selenatis that was respiring using selenate, identified the selenium export factor protein, SefA. SefA was associated with the selenium nanospheres and is thought to stabilise the assembly of the nanospheres in T. selenatis. The N-terminus of SefA shows similarity to the N-terminal regions of other mineralin family proteins and is therefore speculated to be involved with SefA-selenium interactions. It has been suggested that other proteins may also {{play a role in the}} assembly of the selenium nanospheres and their exportation out of the T. selenatis cell, and they could interact with SefA. SefA has been expressed in Escherichia coli and two His-tagged recombinant forms of the protein (His-SefA-His and His-SefA) have been purified. A SefA construct was also produced, which had an exposed N-terminal region, by proteolytic cleavage of the His-tag from the N-terminus of His-SefA-His using thrombin. Interactions between the N-terminal of SefA and soluble proteins from T. selenatis grown in selenate were investigated and three potentially interacting proteins were identified using pull-down experiments. MALDI-MS analysis identified peptide sequences of fragments from each of the three proteins and BLASTp analysis found that the closest matches for these proteins were threonyl-tRNA synthetase, glucosamine-fructose- 6 phosphate aminotransferase, and the DNA protection during starvation proteins. Whilst attempts to crystallise the His-SefA-His protein were unsuccessful, the His-SefA-His protein was determined to be a tetramer and <b>stabilising</b> <b>conditions</b> for the His-SefA-His protein were determined for use in future crystallisation trials.

40|$|The N-terminally pyroglutamyl-modified Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) {{peptides}} {{are found}} in abundance in the pathological Alzheimer disease (AD) brain deposits. Such modification not only increases the hydrophobic properties of a given molecule, but also plays a protecting role against proteolytic degradation. This project involved {{the study of the}} human type I and type II pyroglutamyl peptidases and their involvement in AÎ² processing in AD. Human PcpI has been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain and purified to homogeneity. The protein displayed significant instability in vitro. To overcome this problem a number of methods were employed such as screening for an optimal protein expression system and buffer composition, site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of selected surface residues. This resulted in the selection of the HEPPS buffer system as providing the most <b>stabilising</b> <b>conditions</b> for human PcpI. Improvement in the protein stability enabled initial crystallisation experiments and the identification of favourable conditions for crystal production. Further optimization of this process is needed in order to obtain good quality crystals which are required for structural study. The study on human PcpII involved an extensive screening for optimal expression conditions in bacterial, baculovirus/insect and mammalian systems. The truncated PcpII isoform PcpII/S 62 -H 1024, which lacks the N-terminal transmembrane domain, was successfully expressed and secreted from the HEK 293 T cell line using three different pOPIN-based constructs. Moreover, homology modelling of human PcpII catalytic domain was performed, which helped to gain an insight into the three-dimensional structure of the protein and its mode of substrate binding. Lastly, immunohistochemical staining of the human AD brain tissue sections was performed to compare the level and distribution of PcpI and PcpII enzymes between diseased and control cases. The results confirmed that the neurodegenerative conditions lead to the increased synthesis of both enzymes in the cortical AD tissues. Additionally PcpI was shown to be able to participate in the degradation of pGlu-modified AÎ² peptides. Norman Family Trus...|$|R

It can be concluded that corneal cross-linking is an effective treatment method for keratoconus and has been shown to produce various beneficial effects in terms of ocular structure and function...|$|R

One approach has been to look at ways to cut back on the energy required to <b>stabilise</b> storage <b>conditions,</b> particularly relative humidity, through passive moisture control rather than mechanical systems of heating and air conditioning. To this end the Science Museum Group employed hemp in the form of hemp-lime concrete, to construct a new storage facility for its collections, drawing on research into the buffering ability of hygroscopic natural building materials. The objective was to reduce energy use, to decrease reliance on mechanical systems and to produce very stable levels of relative humidity, in order to ensure the preservation of significant heritage collections.

The results encourage further investigation into hygroscopic construction materials to design even more energy-saving ways of providing stable storage conditions for museums...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, miniaturised “lab-on-a-chip” (LOC) devices have {{attracted}} significant interest in academia and industry. LOC sensors for electrochemical analysis now commonly reach picomolar in sensitivities, using only microliter-sized samples. One {{of the major}} drawbacks of this platform is the diffusion layer that appears as a limiting factor for the sensitivity level. In this thesis, a new technique was developed to enhance the sensitivity of electroanalytical sensors by increasing the mass transfer in the medium. The final device design was {{to be used for}} early detection of cancer diseases which causes bleeding in the digestive system. The diagnostic device was proposed to give reliable and repeatable results by additional modifications on its design. The sensitivity enhanced-sensor model was achieved by combining the surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology with the electroanalytical sensing platform. The technique was practically tested on a diagnostic device model and a biosensing platform. A novel, substrate (TMB) based label-free Hb sensing method is developed and tested. Moreover, the technique was further developed by changing the sensing process. Instead of forming the sensitive layer on the electrodes it was localised on polystyrene wells by a rapid one-step process. Results showed that the use of acoustic streaming, generated by SAW, increases the current flow and improves the sensitivity of amperometric sensors by a factor of 6 while only requiring microliter scale sample volumes. The heating and streaming induced by the SAW removes the small random contributions made by the natural convection and temperature variation which complicate the measurements. Therefore, the method offers <b>stabilised</b> <b>conditions</b> for more reliable and repeatable measurements. The label-free detection technique proved to be giving relevant data, according to the hemoglobin concentration. It has fewer steps than ELISA and has only one antibody. Therefore, it is quick and the cross-reactivity of the second antibody is eliminated from the system. The additional modifications made on the technique decreased the time to prepare the sensing platform because the passivation steps (i. e., pegylation), prior to structuring a sensitive layer were ignored. This avoidance also increased the reliability and repeatability of the measurements...|$|R
