40|$|The {{evolving}} {{epidemic of}} cardiovascular disease in many newly industrialized societies will bankrupt their health care systems and reduce the available resources for other health priorities. Therefore, the prevention of this epidemic, or at least slowing the increase, is of the highest priority. The development of coronary heart disease (CHD) {{is an example of}} a <b>common</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic</b> due to increased consump-tion of saturated fat and cholesterol, low intakes of polyunsaturated fat, and increasing obesity. Hyper-tension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus con-tribute to risk of disease. The prevention of athero-sclerosis beginning in young adults is of paramount importance. Careful monitoring of the evolving epi-demic of CHD, including noninvasive evaluation of atherosclerosis, is important. A high-risk approach is very successful but expensive...|$|E
40|$|During the {{southern}} hemisphere winter of 2006 New Zealand experienced {{a significant increase in}} the number of reported cases of Campylobacter infection. In total, 112 Campylobacter isolates from eight district health boards (DHBs) located across New Zealand were submitted for PFGE, MLST and Penner serotyping analysis. Distinct clusters of Campylobacter isolates were identified, several of which were composed of isolates from up to five different DHBs located on both the North and South islands of New Zealand. One sequence type, ST- 474, was identified in 32 of the 112 isolates and may represent an endemic sequence type present in New Zealand. The spatial pattern of genotypes, combined with the generalized increase in notifications throughout the country is consistent with a <b>common</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic,</b> most likely from a source contaminated with the dominant sequence types ST- 474 and ST- 190 and may also represent widely distributed stable clones present in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} low dose {{environmental}} exposure {{is a major}} concern for epidemiologists. The problem is a special example of a <b>common</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic</b> with either single or continuous exposure. Usually the most common source investigations begin with an epidemic, cluster of cases. However, environmental studies often start with an exposure that is considered to be potentially hazardous and a search for cases. The relatively low attack rate and also relative risk requires large sample sizes for testing hypotheses. The incubation period from exposure to onset of the disease may be very long, and therefore the exposure dose is difficult to define. Many of the diseases of interest also have multiple etiologies, and the amount of disease attributed to the specific environmental exposure may be relatively small (the attributable risk). Many of the other potential etiological agents also share common host characteristics with the environmental agent of interest further confounding the analysis. The identification of specific, unusual characteristics of disease such as rare histological type or location, or host characteristic may be a valuable approach to the study of environmental agents. The cost of doing environmental studies are substantial. Various resources are currently being utilized. There are several problems associated with many of these nongovernmental resources. One possible solution to the availability of a large funding source for environmental research, independent of special interest groups, may be a consumer-oriented tax on adverse personal health behavior, such as alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis A is {{a disease}} of {{worldwide}} distribution which occurs in endemic and epidemic form and is transmitted primarily by person-to-person contact through the fecal-oral route. <b>Common</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemics</b> due to contamination of food are relatively common, and water-borne epidemics have been described less frequently. The presumed etiologic agent of hepatitis A has now been visualized by immune electron microscopic (IEM) techniques in early acute-illnessphase stools of humans with hepatitis A {{as well as in}} chimpanzees experimentally infected with material known to contain hepatitis A virus. In addition, several new serologic tests for the detection of antibody against hepatitis A virus have been described. These include complement fixation and immune adherence techniques. Current data suggest that hepatitis A is caused by a single viral agent lacking the morphologic heterogeneity of hepatitis B viral components and that there may be relative antigenic homogeneity between strains of virus recovered from various parts of the world. Serologic studies to date also indicate that hepatitis A virus is not a major contributing cause in post-transfusion hepatitis. BACKGROUND The historical roots of infectious hepatitis as a distinct clinical entity go back, i...|$|R
50|$|The {{mayor and}} a {{committee}} of two dozen organized a fever hospital at Bush Hill and other crisis measures. The assistance of the Free African Society was requested by the city and readily agreed to by the members, based on the mistaken assumption that native Africans {{would have the same}} partial immunity to the new disease as many had to malaria, the most <b>common</b> <b>source</b> of fever <b>epidemics</b> during the summer months. Black nurses aided the sick and the group's leaders hired additional men to take away corpses, which most people would not touch. Blacks in the city died {{at the same rate as}} whites, about 240 altogether. Some neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, for fear they were carrying the fever. Major port cities such as Baltimore and New York had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia although New York sent financial aid to the city.|$|R
40|$|Not for publication. For {{official}} use only. This {{report has}} been prepared {{primarily as a}} working document for the Expert Committee on Poliomyelitis of the Public Health Service. Those assisting {{in the preparation of}} this report were Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir, Dr. Neal Nathanson, and Mr. Earl Diamond. Material help was given in the statistical analyses by Dr. R. E. Serfling, Mrs. Ida L. Sherman, Mr. Jack Karush, and Dr. Jack Hall. The regular PSU Reports from May 1 to May 14, with the weekly summaries, present the current information available on poliomyelitis associated with polio vaccine. The PSU Special Report No. 1 (May 14, summarizes the data on cases occurring among parents and siblings of vaccinated children. In this report an attempt is made to interpret the national picture as fully as possible and to make a forecast of the extent of the problem as it appears from the present epidemiological data. The cumulated epidemiological information to date reveals a clear and marked association of poliomyelitis cases among persons receiving Cutter vaccine, and nothing but a purely coincidental relation with cases receiving either Wyeth or Lilly vaccine. No cases have been reported following inoculation of Pittman-Moore or Parke-Davis vaccine, although a few coincidental cases can surely be anticipated. The epidemiological data to date are wholly consistent with the pattern of a <b>common</b> <b>source</b> <b>epidemic,</b> with Cutter vaccine as the vehicle of infection. This report, therefore, will be concerned solely with what is termed the "Cutter Incident. " Three phases may be outlined: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 The first phase is the occurrence of cases among Cutter vaccinated children. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 The second phase is the occurrence of cases among familial associates of Cutter vaccinated children. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 The third phase is the possible occurrence of further spread in community from Cutter vaccinated sources...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWithin the {{paradigm}} of physical layer security, a physical layer characteristic {{is used as a}} <b>common</b> <b>source</b> of randomness to generate the secret key. This key is then used to encrypt the data to hide information from eavesdroppers. In this paper, we survey the most recent <b>common</b> <b>sources</b> of randomness used to generate the secret key. We present the steps used to extract the secret key from the estimated <b>common</b> <b>source</b> of randomness. We describe the metrics used to evaluate the strength of the generated key. We follow that with a qualitative comparison between different <b>common</b> <b>sources</b> of randomness along with a proposed new direction which capitalizes on hybridization of sources of randomness. We conclude by a discussion about current open research problems in secret key generation...|$|R
