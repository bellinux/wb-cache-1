5|$|Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809– April 15, 1865) was an American statesman {{and lawyer}} {{who served as}} the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his {{assassination}} in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, <b>constitutional,</b> <b>and</b> political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, paved the way to the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised, to {{end with}} a rally in Hyde Park, London on 26 July.

Twenty-eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches left from Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support and hostility. A further branch left Cardiff on 7 July.|$|E

5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson vetoed the bill for both <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany became <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> dropped the Austrian flag, with Austria–Lorraine great coat of arms, {{in favour of}} the defaced Italian tricolour with {{simplified}} arms. It is worthy of note, however, that the arms bear the red-white-red flag of Austria, the opponent of Italian unification. In 1859, the Granducato officially ceased to exist, being joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which used the undefaced tricolour until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were <b>constitutional,</b> <b>and</b> that the Alien and Sedition Acts were <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor {{was based on the}} consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{includes a}} Council of Ministers, {{headed by the}} prime minister and five deputy prime ministers. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and specialized courts such as the Constitutional Court, which deals with specific issues related to <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{independent}} judicial {{branch is}} based upon the English model and consists of a Supreme Court of Appeal, a High Court divided into three sections (general, <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> commercial), an Industrial Relations Court and Magistrates Courts, the last of which is divided into five grades and includes Child Justice Courts. The judicial system has been changed several times since Malawi gained independence in 1964. Conventional courts and traditional courts have been used in varying combinations, with varying degrees of success and corruption.|$|E

The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on Egyptian state television, Suleiman announced the formation of two independent committees for political and constitutional reforms, both starting work immediately. One committee would carry out <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> legislative amendments to enable a shift of power. The other would monitor the implementation of all proposed reforms. Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding committee would be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce a list of what was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful transfer of power. Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'état unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Learning that British {{troops were}} on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} that Governor Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, <b>constitutional,</b> <b>and</b> charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E

5|$|On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began {{presiding}} over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew {{to make it to}} court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine. This federal court decision with <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> war power issues made news around the country.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>and</b> Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert {{more control over their}} clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of the}} prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E

The Chief Minister, along with the council of ministers, drives the legislative agenda and exercises most of the executive powers. However, the <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> formal {{head of the state}} is the Governor who is appointed for a five-year term by the President of India on the advice of the Union government. The people of Karnataka also elect 28 members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. The members of the state Legislative Assembly elect 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{president}} of Slovenia is mainly ceremonial. One of {{the president}}'s duties is to nominate the Prime Minister, after consulting with political groups represented in the National Assembly. The president also proposes candidates for various state offices, as well as judicial appointments to the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>and</b> Supreme Court, which must be approved by the National Assembly. In rare circumstances, the president possesses the power to pass laws and dissolve the National Assembly. The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Unlike the majority of the government, which is chosen by the National Assembly and elected through proportional representation, the president is directly elected by the majority of Slovenian voters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, more {{administrative}} {{records from}} the period had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused {{on the development of the}} English <b>constitutional</b> <b>and</b> governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.|$|E

It provides a wide-ranging functional account {{of the reasons why}} modern societies require constitutions <b>and</b> <b>constitutional</b> norms, <b>and</b> it offers a distinctive socio-normative analysis of the constitutional preconditions of political legitimacy...|$|R
