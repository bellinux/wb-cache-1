To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

He {{turned down}} a knighthood in 1951 because {{he felt that the}} bestowal would lead to a {{perception}} of him as an establishment figure and that [...] "such a title might tend to <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> off from fellow artists whose work has aims similar to mine". He was, however, awarded the Companion of Honour in 1955, the Order of Merit in 1963 and Erasmus Prize in 1968.|$|E

Parcells often rode players {{in the hopes of}} driving them to better performance. Taylor did not appreciate this approach, and early on told Parcells, [...] "I've had enough. You either <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> or trade me but get the fuck off my back." [...] Parcells kept on Taylor, but privately told some veterans, [...] "I like that LT. That motherfucker's got a mean streak." ...|$|E

Yeller said, [...] "remember Kid, the night you <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> up with the two red fours?" [...] The Kid jocularly replied, [...] "I must have overplayed my hand." [...] Everyone laughed, but Howard sternly replied, [...] "that was a dangerous thing to do." [...] The Kid answered, [...] "that depends on whom you're sitting with, Lancey." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey's success {{seemed to}} have gone to his head and he became even more arrogant. He was abusive to the network's affiliates, advertisers, {{producers}}, and talent. Friends of Aubrey's such as producers Dick Dorso of United Artists, Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, and David Susskind, who had each sold several series to CBS, suddenly found themselves shut out. [...] "He's a friend of mine, but he <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> stone cold last year," [...] Susskind said. [...] "I was hanging there with my pants down, wondering what I'd tell the stockholders." [...] Gossip columnist Liz Smith, who worked as CBS during Aubrey's time there, called him a [...] "a mean, hateful, truly scary, bad, outré guy." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they {{put me in the}} tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close that I could get with someone smacking me in the chest.|$|E

500|$|In September 2005, {{the paper}} decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns {{in a program}} known as TimesSelect, which {{encompassed}} many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, {{and at least one}} site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{the author}} Jane Yolen {{released}} {{a book called}} Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards. At the school [...] "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard." [...] However, Yolen has stated that [...] "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," [...] attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes. In {{an interview with the}} magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, [...] "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> a very large check, I would cash it." [...] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it [...] "fantasy fast food".|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission. Although his {{military}} superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well".|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} the {{strength}} was estimated at 68,000 rifles and sabres and morale of the Ottoman defenders very strong, the harvest coming in and food abundant. While the EEF was defending its line with every available unit. As Allenby {{wrote in a letter}} to the War Office on 15 June 1918, [...] "all my goods are in the shop window." [...] The [...] EEF line stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River was strong, supported by roads and communications behind. However the line was wide in comparison with the size of the EEF it. Allenby saying, [...] "It is the best line I can hold. Any retirement would weaken it. My right flank is covered by the Jordan; my left by the Mediterranean Sea. The Jordan Valley must be held by me; it is vital. If the Turks regained control of the Jordan, I should lose control of the Dead Sea. This would <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> off from the Arabs on the Hedjaz railway; with the result that, shortly, the Turks would regain their power in the Hedjaz. The Arabs would make terms with them, and our prestige would be gone. My right flank would be turned, and my position in Palestine would be untenable. I might hold Rafa or El Arish; but you can imagine what effect such a withdrawal would have on the population of Egypt, and on the watching tribes of the Western Desert. You see, therefore, that I cannot modify my present dispositions. I must give up nothing of what I now hold. Anyhow, I must hold the Jordan Valley." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opening track [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] {{employs a}} church organ which is audible {{throughout}} the song until the bridge. Synthesized strings are also prominent throughout the song, which intermittently integrates wood block percussion throughout the track. A heavy, distorted marching band-like drum loop backs the song.

I was away from my girlfriend for four months at the time and I really wanted to [...] and fly home. I was so in love that it was painful. It was like bleeding, it <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> open." [...] The song refers to someone in a relationship who is extremely blinded by love. Regardless of the numerous warnings from her friends {{and the fact that she}} is emotionally hurt by her lover, she continues to love him and accepts the pain. Metaphorically, this is represented in his [...] "cutting her open"; however, all she can do is [...] "bleed love" [...] for him.

[...] "Yesterday" [...] has been described as [...] "a smoochy R slow jam". [...] "Better in Time" [...] is a pop and R song set in a moderate tempo. Lyrically the song talks about someone who cannot forget her ex-partner, and at the end the protagonist knows that [...] "it will all get better in time". [...] "Take a Bow" [...] has been described as starting with an [...] "ice-cool synth riff" [...] and having [...] "big, crunchy beats and powerhouse chorus". [...] "I'm You" [...] features [...] "delicate harps, echoey vocals and skittering beats". [...] "Footprints in the Sand", a [...] "massive power ballad", incorporates elements of pop and R genres, and contains a gospel production performed by the choir and features [...] "crashing drums". It incorporates keyboard instruments, guitar, bass and includes a choir performance by The Tuff Session Singers. The song is about [...] "standing by someone and being there for people who need your help." [...] "Forgive Me" [...] is an R, soul and dance-pop song written in A minor. The song refers to a protagonist in a one-sided relationship who leaves her boyfriend and eventually finds someone to reciprocate her love. Though she has found love from someone else, she defends herself and asks her ex-boyfriend for forgiveness.|$|E
