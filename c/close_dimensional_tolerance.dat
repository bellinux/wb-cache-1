40|$|Abstract. High {{pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) is {{a widely}} used production technique for metal components that are required to have <b>close</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> and smooth surface finishes. Approximately 50 % of the aluminium castings produced globally are manufactured by HPDC from secondary alloy and these are dominant in the automotive sector where they account {{for the majority of}} aluminium components present in each vehicle manufactured. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} industrially produced aluminium alloy high pressure diecastings (HPDC’s) can be successfully heat treated without encountering problems with surface blistering or dimensional instability. These processes may significantly improve the properties which develop from the alloys, thereby significantly increasing the scope of applications that may be realized. HPDC alloys however have not been developed specifically for heat treatment or the optimization of specific properties. In particular, recent work in Al-Si-Cu HPDC alloys has identified composition ranges of alloys for a) achieving yield strengths exceeding 400 MPa, b), rapid heat treatment that minimizes cost / cycle times, and c) high strength combined with elevated ductility levels.

40|$|Abstract. High {{pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) {{is widely}} used as a cost-effective way to mass-produce metal components that are required to have <b>close</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> and smooth surface finishes. Approximately 50 %, by mass, of the aluminium castings produced worldwide are made by this manufacturing route. However, HPDC components are relatively porous compared {{with other types of}} castings and so cannot usually be conventionally heat treated to improve mechanical properties. This follows because during solution treatment (e. g. at 540 °C for 8 h), the pores expand, resulting in unacceptable surface blisters, distortion and poor mechanical properties. Recent work within the CSIRO Light Metals Flagship has revealed a heat treatment procedure by which the problems of blistering and distortion can be avoided [1]. As a result, large improvements in strength have been achieved, as compared with the as-cast condition. One uncertainty is the behaviour of heat treated HPDCs under cyclic stress and this paper investigates the fatigue properties of a common high pressure die-casting alloy, A 380 (Al- 8. 5 Si- 3. 5 Cu). Comparisons are made between as-cast, T 4 and T 6 conditions. Fatigue strength is highest for the alloy aged to a T 6 temper and ratios of fatigue strength to tensile strength for the as-cast, T 4 and T 6 conditions are constant at a value of approximately 0. 6, which is particularly high for aluminium alloys...|$|R

These microparts {{play a vital}} role and are required to abide by stringent norms set forth by various quality control agencies. To maintain their functionality over a period of time, they are made of special engineering materials rather than silicon as commonly used in microelectronics.

40|$|The mold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of the continuous casting machine since the mold controls the shape and initial solidification of the steel product, where quality is either created or lost. During casting, the mold is submitted to heat flux from liquid steel on one side whereas the other side is water cooled, leading to the generation of large temperature gradients. It is also submitted to other stresses such as ferrostatic pressure and clamping forces. Casting can last several dozens of hours whereas the cooling step of the mold, when liquid steel is not poured anymore into the mold, can last only a few minutes. Maintaining a reliable, crack-free mold within <b>close</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> is crucial to safety and productivity. In order to withdraw the right amount of heat and to prevent mold distortion, mold is generally made of copper alloys that have the thermal and mechanical properties required for this function. The two copper alloys most widely used for casting mold are Cu-Ag and Cu-Cr-Zr. They present a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties due to the different treatments to which they can be submitted. The present master thesis aims to study the influence of thermomechanical properties of copper alloys on continuous casting mold behavior during casting and cooling, and more precisely on mold for continuous casting of steel slabs using realistic finite element models of heat transfer and stress. After realizing a literature review of the most widely used copper alloys, three finite elements models were developed in order to study the influence of three copper alloy grades on mold thermomechanical behavior. The three finite elements models were a 2 D simplistic transverse section of the mold model, a 2 D transverse section of the mold model that includes bolts and the backup plate and a 3 D quarter mold model. Simulations of casting and cooling step were performed with ABAQUS 6. 10 ® for the two most widely used copper alloys and a copper alloy that was previously submitted to a heat treatment. Simulations results show that the two copper alloys most widely used lead to similar mold behavior. Besides, the material submitted to a heat treatment does not lead to a critical behavior but can lead to a necessity of more frequent re-machining of the mold...|$|R

Pattern dies are used to create wax patterns by injecting wax into dies. The first part of the project involved preparation of reports {{on the state of the}} art at that time for all the areas under consideration (die-wax, wax-shell, and shell-alloy). The primary R&D focus during Phase I was on the wax material since the least was known about it. The main R&D accomplishments during this phase were determination of procedures for obtaining the thermal conductivity and viscoelastic properties of an unfilled wax and validating those procedures. Phase II focused on die-wax and shell-alloy systems. A wax material model was developed based on results obtained during the previous R&D phase, and a die-wax model was successfully incorporated into and used in commercial computer programs. Current computer simulation programs have complementary features. A viscoelastic module was available in ABAQUS but unavailable in ProCAST, while the mold-filling module was available in ProCAST but unavailable in ABAQUS. Thus, the numerical simulation results were only in good qualitative agreement with experimental results, the predicted shrinkage factors being approximately 2. 5 times larger than those measured. Significant progress was made, and results showed that the testing and modeling of wax material had great potential for industrial applications. Additional R&D focus was placed on one shell-alloy system. The fused-silica shell mold and A 356 aluminum alloy were considered. The experimental part of the program was conducted at ORNL and commercial foundries, where wax patterns were injected, molds were invested, and alloys were poured. It was very important to obtain accurate temperature data from actual castings, and significant effort was made to obtain temperature profiles in the shell mold. A model for thermal radiation within the shell mold was developed, and the thermal model was successfully validated using ProCAST. Since the fused silica shells had the lowest thermal expansion properties in the industry, the dewaxing phase, including the coupling between wax-shell systems, was neglected. The prefiring of the empty shell mold was considered in the model, and the shell mold was limited to a pure elastic material. The alloy dimensions were obtained from numerical simulations only with coupled shell-alloy systems. The alloy dimensions were in excellent quantitative agreement with experimental data, validating the deformation module. For actual parts, however, the creep properties of the shell molds must also be obtained, modeled, and validated...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this dissertation has been twofold: to develop a water-based system for tape casting and to build laminar structures from the tapes. A set of requirements on the binder was specified and latexes were identified as suitable for water-based tape casting, mainly owing to their low viscosity and high polymeric content. A systematic approach {{was used to evaluate}} different formulations throughout the processing chain to find possibilities and limitations. Rheological measurements were used to characterise stability and flow behaviour of the suspensions and to study interactions between constituents in the suspension. The effect of the dispersant concentration was studied. It was found that, below optimum dosage, i. e. monolayer coverage, bridging flocculation can occur and the dispersant can adsorb onto latex particles. Tape casting experiments were done to investigate possible casting rates, resulting thickness and the thickness at which spontaneous cracking occurs. The cast tapes were then evaluated with regard to their quality, green density and homogeneity. It has been shown in this work that very high solids loading (> 55 vol%) can be reached in alumina systems thanks to efficient dispersants and latex binders with a high polymeric content. This in combination with an efficient drying system of the tape caster enabled high casting rates to be reached. The lowest viscous formulations also gave tapes thicker than 0. 5 mm without cracking. Significant differences between binders were observed in this work. For example, in a comparison between anionic and nonionic latexes, the nonionic latex gave a more homogeneous packing of the green tape and higher final density. In the anionically stabilised latexes, phase separation between surfactant and polymer occurred, creating pore channels in the tape. The work on laminar structures focused mainly on ceramic laminates with crack deflecting ability. These types of structures {{have been shown to be}} more damage tolerant and to have superior thermal shock resistance. Examples of laminates of this type are SiC/graphite and dense/porous laminates of alumina or SiC using fugitive particles. A technique for fabricating the latter type of laminates was developed in this work. The composite is a laminate of alternating porous and dense layers of the same material. To be able to co-sinter these types of layers, it is necessary that the added fugitive particles do not affect the stability of the suspension, i. e. the packing of the ceramic matrix in the layers should be the same. Hereby the dense and porous layers sinter with the same total shrinkage, and the fugitive particles (mainly starch particles) leave voids too large to sinter themselves and will shrink only by the same amount as the surrounding matrix, leaving porosity. The advantage of such a composite is that no chemical reaction or thermal mismatch is present between the layers. During casting, when the suspension passes under the casting blade, the shearing can cause particles and polymer to be oriented in the direction of the flow. This can be used deliberately to enhance mechanical, electrical or thermal properties. However, it can also cause sintering anisotropy, making <b>close</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> difficult to control. The conditions that give rise to shrinkage anisotropy were studied. Water-based systems were shown to be on a par with or better than organic solvent-based systems. A desirable particle orientation benefits from a high volume fraction, elongated or plate-like particles and a high shear rate. This was exploited in making a laminate structure with alternating porous and dense layers from a coarse low sinterability powder and a fine plate-like powder for the respective layers...|$|R

Recently, the authors presented a numerical wear model of reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs), and its application for estimating the wear coefficient k from experimental data according to different wear laws. In this study, such model and k expressions are exploited to investigate the sensitivity of UHMWPE wear to implant size and <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance.</b> A set of 10 different geometries was analysed, considering nominal diameters in the range 36 - 42 mm, available on the market, and a cup <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of + 0. 2, - 0. 0 mm (resulting in a diametrical clearance ranging between 0. 04 - 0. 24 mm), estimated from measurements on RTSAs. Since the most reliable wear law and wear coefficient k for UHMWPE are still controversial in the literature, both the Archard law (AR) and the wear law of UHMWPE (PE), as well as four different k expressions were considered, carrying out a total of 40 simulations. Results showed that the wear volume increases with the implant size and decreases with the <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> for both the wear laws. Interestingly, different trends were obtained for the maximum wear depth vs. clearance: the best performing implants should have a high conformity according to the AR law but low conformity for the PE law. However, according to both laws, wear is highly affected by both implant size and <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance,</b> although {{it is much more}} sensitive to the latter, with up to a twofold variation of wear predicted.
