To {{clarify the}} {{relative biological effectiveness}} (RBE) values of carbon ion (C) beams in normal brain tissues, a rat organotypic slice culture system was used. The cerebellum was dissected from 10 -day-old Wistar rats, cut parasagittally into approximately 600 -μm-thick slices and cultivated using a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. Slices were irradiated with 140 kV X-rays and 18. 3 MeV/amu <b>C-beams</b> (linear energy transfer = 108 keV/μm). After irradiation, the slices were evaluated histopatholog-ically using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and apoptosis was quantified using the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Disorganization of the external granule cell layer (EGL) and apoptosis of the external granule cells (EGCs) were induced within 24 h after exposure to doses of more than 5 Gy from <b>C-beams</b> and X-rays.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the eVect of carbon-beam irradiation on adenovirus-mediated p 53 transfer in human cervix adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods The HeLa cells pre-exposed to carbon-beam or -ray, were infected with replication-deficient adenovirus recombinant vectors, containing human wild-type p 53 (AdCMV-p 53) and green Xuorescent protein (GFP) (AdCMV–GFP), respectively. The GFP transfer and p 53 expression were detected by Xow cytometric analysis. Results The GFP transfer frequency in <b>C-beam</b> with AdCMV-GFP groups was 38 – 50 % more than that inγ-ray with AdCMV–GFP groups. The percentage of p 53 positive cells in the <b>C-beam</b> with AdCMV–p 53 groups was 34 – 55. 6 % more than that in γ-ray with AdCMV-p 53 groups (p < 0. 05), suggesting that subclinical-dose <b>C-beam</b> irradiation could signiWcantly promote exogenous p 53 transfer and p 53 expression, and extend the duration of p 53 expression in the HeLa cells. The expression of p 21 increased with p 53 expression in HeLa cells.

40|$|Severe {{concrete}} cracking and ensuing deterioration {{caused by}} ASR/DEF expansion strains in bridge piers {{is a major}} concern for state transportation officials. A dual experimental and analytical modeling approach is used {{to determine the effects of}} severe ASR/DEF deterioration on concrete structures. A minimalist semi-empirical method is developed and validated to estimate ASR/DEF induced expansion strains in reinforced concrete structures. As part of the experimental study, expansion data are gathered from a large-scale <b>C-beam</b> specimen that is field conditioned for five years. The expansion model is then used to simulate the progression of ASR/DEF induced expansion strains in the <b>C-beam</b> specimens showing various degrees of deterioration. Considering the variability of the field recorded expansion data, the ASR/DEF expansion model simulates the expansion strains quite well. The severely damaged <b>C-beam</b> specimen is experimentally tested, and its overall and internal behavior are compared to previously tested <b>C-beam</b> specimens without and with ASR/DEF deterioration. Key improvements are made to the Compatibility Strut-and-Tie Method (C-STM) to better model the overall behavior of structures through failure. To incorporate the effects of ASR/DEF deterioration in the C-STM technique, cover and core concrete properties are modified. The expansion strains from the ASR/DEF model are inferred to estimate the prestressing forces to be applied to the C-STM to simulate the self-prestressing effects caused by the restraint offered by reinforcing steel to concrete core expansion. Although the appearance of the <b>C-beam</b> specimen was in poor condition, the experimental test did not show any reduction in the load carrying capacity of the structure, but compared to an undamaged benchmark specimen an overall increase in stiffness and decrease in ductility is evident. However, excessive cracking can cause accelerated hidden reinforcement corrosion which can be a cause of major concern, and in conjunction with ASR/DEF may affect the strength, stiffness and ductility of the structure. The displacement-based C-STM technique simulates the overall force-deformation and internal behavior of the concrete specimens without and with ASR/DEF deterioration well...|$|E

40|$|Renewable energy {{extracted}} from wind turbines is extensively {{used to reduce}} the dependence from fossil fuels. It {{has been shown that}} in order to carry on to the way of efficiency, it is necessary to increase the size of wind turbines. However, following this road, new challenges with major complexity are expected to show up. As wind turbine size increase, loads increase too, so it is critical to maintain the structural integrity of them, especially for the case of the blades. This research focuses explicitly on a particular aspect of structural design which is reported to be very critical in many designs of wind turbine blade wing box structures, namely the connection between the spar web and the spar cap. A pyramid structured approach is developed which links local phenomena of stress transfer and failure in the adhesive joint to overall loads on the entire machine. On the top of the pyramid where the wind turbine blade is analysed as such, a fully automated procedure is developed to model the relevant aspects of both structural design and load application in a comprehensive way and to propagate the effect of external loads to internal stresses in the critical components. Bonded joints in wind turbine blades have particular characteristics including unusually high thicknesses in the adhesive layers and a multi-axial stress state. On the second level, a subcomponent structure is designed as a <b>C-beam</b> and an experimental and numerical procedure is performed. At the lowest level of the pyramid, an extensive experimental campaign is performed in materials such as pure adhesive and bonded joint specimens which are developed specifically {{to take into account the}} particular requirements for application in wind turbine blades. Coupons are subjected both to quasi static and fatigue loads at different conditions. In order to take into account variability present in the experimental campaign, a probabilistic approach is used to identify the most appropriate failure criterion. The strength prediction method considers a statistical size effect in the strength of the material by considering not only the magnitude of the stress distributions, but also the volume over which they act. Both quasi-static and fatigue results are analysed using probabilistic tools, leading to a good correlation. status: publishe...|$|E
