The positions at which electrodes are placed can slightly change the tuning, as well. If the crystal is accurately shaped and positioned, it will oscillate at a desired frequency. In nearly all quartz watches, the frequency is 32,768 Hz,and the crystal is cut in a small tuning fork shape on a particular crystal plane.

40|$|Operating {{systems have}} {{historically}} been implemented as independent layers between hardware and applications. User programs communicate with the OS {{through a set of}} well defined system calls, and do not have direct access to the hardware. The OS, in turn, communicates with the underlying architecture via control registers. Except for these interfaces, the three layers are practically oblivious to each other. While this structure improves portability and transparency, it may not deliver optimal performance. This is especially true for High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, where modern parallel applications and multi-core architectures pose new challenges in terms of performance, power consumption, and system utilization. The hardware, the OS, and the applications can no longer remain isolated, and instead should cooperate to deliver high performance with minimal power consumption.

40|$|The {{application}} of fast wave power in DIII-D has proven effective for both electron heating and current drive. Since the last RIF Conference FW {{power has been}} applied to advanced confinement regimes in DIII-D; negative central shear (NCS), VH- and H-modes, high {beta}{sub p}, and high-{ell}i. Typically these regimes show enhanced confinement of toroidal momentum exhibited by increased toroidal rotation velocity. Indeed, layers of large shear in toroidal velocity are associated with transport barriers. A rather common occurrence in these experiments is that the toroidal rotation velocity is decreased when the FW power is turned on, to lowest order independent of whether the antennas are phased for co or <b>counter</b> current <b>drive.</b> At present all the data is for co-injected beams. The central toroidal rotation can be reduced to 1 / 2 of the non-FW level. Here the authors describe the effect in NCS discharges with co-beam injection...|$|R

The central plasma current was difficult to affect, even though the calculated current drive efficiency was fairly high, 0. 07 A per W absorbed by the electrons. The main reasons are: the strongly inductive nature of the plasma current; the interplay between the fast wave driven current and the bootstrap current, which, due to the dependence of the bootstrap current on the poloidal magnetic field, decreases the bootstrap current as the driven current increases; and parasitic absorption of the waves that decreased the power absorbed by the electrons. The measured difference in the central current density for co and <b>counter</b> current <b>drive</b> {{is larger than the}} response expected from current diffusion calculations, suggesting a faster current diffusion than that given by neoclassical resistivity.

40|$|Clock {{synchronisation}} is {{a widely}} studied problem. Most {{research has focused on}} real-time clock synchronisation algorithms, which run as background processes to maintain synchronisation between the clocks of a collection of computers. Research has also been done into off-line clock synchronisation algorithms. These algorithms can be used where time-stamped event records have been recorded on a collection of computers. In evaluating the effectiveness of a clock synchronisation algorithm, it is important to determine the offsets of clocks from each other or from an external reference. The reason that the clock synchronisation problem is a difficult one is because {{it is not possible to}} directly measure the offsets between two clocks without using special hardware. Consequently, in all of the clock synchronisation work with which we are familiar, effectiveness is assessed by indirect measures of clock offsets, or by simulation. We have developed hardware and software to enable us to directly determine clock offsets so the performance of clock synchronisation algorithms can be accurately assessed. The main hardware component is a "clockcard" that connects to any IBM PC compatible parallel port. On the clockcard are two logical 32 -bit binary counters that can be latched at exactly the same time. One of the counters is clocked from an on board oscillator that mimics the accuracy of modern day computer oscillators. The other <b>counter</b> is <b>driven</b> via an external clock. In a collection of computers under test, all the external <b>counters</b> are <b>driven</b> from the same external clock, so each clockcard has a notion of external global time. The local counter on the clockcard is used as a replacement for the local clock on the computer that the clockcard is attached to. The new local clock is the one synchronised by a clock synchronisation algorithm under test. Whenever timestamps are read from the clockcard, the values of both counters are returned. The global timestamps allow offsets between local clocks to be measured very accurately. We describe the design and construction of the test bed hardware, design and implementation of software to interface clock synchronisation programs to the test bed, and present results from initial experiments performed to check that the test bed works as intended...|$|R

40|$|Transport in ohmically heated plasmas in Alcator C-Mod was {{studied in}} both the linear (LOC) and {{saturated}} (SOC) ohmic L-mode confinement regimes {{and the importance of}} turbulent transport in the region r/a = 0. 5 – 0. 8 was established. After an extensive analysis with TGLF and GYRO, it is found that using an effective impurity ion species with Z[subscript i] = 8, and moderately high Z[subscript eff] (2. 0 – 5. 6), in the LOC regime electron transport becomes dominant due to TEM turbulence. The key ingredient in the present results is the observation that dilution of the main ion species (deuterium) by impurity species of moderate charge state reduces dominant ITG turbulence, in contrast to the SOC regime with little, if any dilution. The turbulent spectrum measured with the phase contrast imaging (PCI) diagnostic is in qualitative agreement with predictions of a synthetic PCI diagnostic adopted to Global GYRO.

40|$|The ideal {{magnetohydrodynamic}} stability {{properties of}} reactor-sized sphellamak and quasiaxisymmetric stellarator configurations with finite toroidal plasma current are investigated. In sphellamak systems, a peaked toroidal current profile yields maximum-B {{conditions in the}} central region of the plasma {{as a consequence of}} the paramagnetic enhancement of the magnetic field induced by the current. The resulting poloidally closed contours of the magnetic field strength prove instrumental in the favourable confinement predictions for a-particles. Under these conditions, the sphellamak is stable or weakly unstable to local Mercier and ballooning modes as well as low order kink instabilities for volume average B *- 8 Vo. Unfortunately, the bootstrap current calculated in the collisionless regime provides only a small fraction of the total plasma current that is required. In a two field-period quasiaxisymmetric reactor device, the bootstrap current in the collisionless limit can enhance the edge rotational transform when reactor-relevant values of F * < 5 Eo are approached.
