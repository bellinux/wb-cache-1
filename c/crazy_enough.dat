25|$|Chris is {{something}} of a weakling who often finds himself getting in difficult situations, usually over women. When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, a lie that causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> to kill them all.|$|E
500|$|... "Precipice" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad felt that Sharon Agathon {{coming to the}} fleet was a [...] "surprising development" [...] and the cliffhanger was [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "are the writers actually <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> to mass kill so many main characters to the series? Is it possible at all that they can actually get out of this?" [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, stating [...] "watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica is a great reminder that this is truly still the best show on television." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX reacted positively towards the episode, stating [...] "Although {{there are a couple}} of great surprises in this episode – Casey, the Great Escape-homaging finale – the highlights are a fistful of fabulous face-offs: Baltar discussing the bombing with Roslin; Roslin questioning Tigh's methods; Apollo telling Adama that his plan is madness. James Callis's performance as the haggard, tortured Baltar is outstanding." [...] Berriman rated the episode five stars out of five. Patrick Sauriol of UGO felt that although it was set a year since [...] "Lay Down Your Burdens", it [...] "hasn't lost a thing by jumping ahead," [...] and that the episode, along with [...] "Occupation", [...] "confirm that it's still the best show on television." [...] Sauriol graded both episodes an A-. Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+, a higher grade than the previous episode.|$|E

50|$|The Decreator {{started to}} erase things from {{existence}} slowly at first, giving Kipling and DP member <b>Crazy</b> Jane <b>enough</b> time to slow it down. Jane, or rather Jane's alternate persona Lucy Fugue, {{explained that the}} Decreator {{was nothing more than}} a vibration, a wavelength, created by God. Using the famous Sagrada Família as a spiritual tuning fork and a method of occult geometry, Jane sent out an opposing vibration which slowed down the Decreator so much that the speed of things disappearing wouldn't be noticed. Ironically, Nùrnheim itself was decreated at the last second but not before Cliff and the Book escaped. The Cult hasn't made any reappearances yet.|$|R
60|$|The {{walls of}} another room {{were covered with}} grotesquely and elaborately figured hand-wrought tapestry. The musty ancient beds {{remained}} in the chambers, and their quilts and curtains and canopies were decorated with curious handwork, and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical and mythological scenes in glaring colors. There was <b>enough</b> <b>crazy</b> and rotten rubbish in the building to make a true brick-a-bracker green with envy. A painting in the dining-hall verged upon the indelicate--but then the Margravine was herself a trifle indelicate.|$|R

Somehow, she would, at least, bring him off with honor, and that is, after all, the most any one with such notions could reasonably look for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the precise}} trouble. I'm too well known. So {{long as a}} man is a winner at this {{particular}} game and can make it worth while for interested folks to applaud him, or, at least, to keep their mouths shut, he can find a field for his talents when he wants it, but once he makes a false move or comes down with a bang, they get their claws in him and keep him from getting up again. Nobody has any sympathy with a broken company exploiter, especially when he has for once been <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> to believe in his own venture." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} shrewd and windy, and the chamber {{none of the}} warmest. An old, long-faced, long-bodied servant in quaint livery, who {{attended}} upon my uncle, threw down an armful of wood beside the fire-place, gave a queer look about the room, and then wished him bon repos, with a grimace and a shrug {{that would have been}} suspicious from any other than an old French servant. The chamber had indeed a wild, <b>crazy</b> look, <b>enough</b> to strike any one who had read romances with apprehension and foreboding. The windows were high and narrow, and had once been loop-holes, but had been rudely enlarged, as well as the extreme thickness of the walls would permit; and the ill-fitted casements rattled to every breeze. You would have thought, on a windy night, some of the old Leaguers were tramping and clanking about the apartment in their huge boots and rattling spurs. A door which stood ajar, and like a true French door would stand ajar, in spite of every reason and effort to the contrary, opened upon a long, dark corridor, that led the Lord knows whither, and seemed just made for ghosts to air themselves in, when they turned out of their graves at midnight. The wind would spring up into a hoarse murmur through this passage, and creak the door to and fro, as if some dubious ghost were balancing in its mind whether to come in or not. In a word, it was precisely the kind of comfortless apartment that a ghost, if ghost there were in the chateau, would single out for its favourite lounge.|$|R
5000|$|A {{couple days}} later, Curtis murders their teacher, Ms. Davis {{in her kitchen}} with the sheriff's revolver. Joyce stumbles upon the body in a closet and when Joyce returns home to find a note from Timmy, telling her {{he is in the}} junkyard, she goes looking for him there, only to be {{attacked}} by the two boys, by using a car. She avoids the car attack and the car goes over a small cliff. A police officer arrives and Joyce tells him what has happened. That night, Joyce is discussing astrology with Timmy. She says that the solar eclipse that occurred during the births of Debbie, Curtis and Steven would have blocked Saturn, the planet which controls the way a person treats other people. Curtis waits outside with the revolver, but instead kills a young couple in van with the revolver. At Curtis, Steven, and Debbie's birthday party, Curtis tricks Joyce into believing he poisoned the cake to make her look <b>crazy.</b> Soon <b>enough,</b> Debbie's sister, Beverly discovers Debbie's horrible secret with the newspaper clippings in the scrapbook as evidence and learns that she, Curtis and Steven were responsible for the murders, including their father. She realizes that Joyce and Timmy were telling the truth all along and confronts Debbie for it. Debbie blames the scrapbook on Curtis and Mrs. Brody forbids her from hanging out with Curtis. Debbie calls Curtis and tells him and Steven to come to her house. Despite being told to wait for them, Debbie kills her older sister with an arrow and when the boys arrive, they hide the body.|$|R
5000|$|... “When my {{turn came}} my dirty tin platter was {{served with the}} rear end and the backbone, with part of the tail poorly dressed attached. After looking that large and disgusting {{offering}} of high hospitality over carefully to see whether I could detach {{as much as a}} mouthful without betting any of the hairy dog skin still liberally decorating it, I fairly sickened. I turned to Bourke and Grouard in such an appealing way as promptly to evoke the appalling information that no worse insult could possible be visited upon an Indian host than to refuse to eat liberally of such sacred offerings under such momentous auspices. Then one fiendish glance from <b>Crazy</b> Horse was <b>enough</b> to induce the swallowing of anything. I can only add that I did my best and can taste that offensively strong, oily dog meat and glimpse its bloody, bristling backbone and tail hairs like a loathsome nightmare to this day. The Indians lapped theirs up greedily to the last rough-gristle, greasy drop, and gleaming hair, and I felt regarded as threateningly for not doing so likewise.” ...|$|R

60|$|MINNIE. There wasn't {{anything}} providential about it. I {{took the}} six o'clock train to Newcastle this morning. Not that I had {{any notion of}} staying there. I ran into Prag at the station. I nursed his wife, you know--and he started in {{to tell me how}} he was coming up to Foxon Falls to shoot Mr. Pindar because he'd closed down the works rather than recognize the union. I knew that Prag was just about <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> to do it, because I've heard Dr. Jonathan talk about the mental disease he's got. That was about ten, and the train for Foxon Falls was leaving in a few minutes. I ran into the booth to phone Dr. Jonathan, but the storm had begun down there, and I couldn't get a connection. So I caught the train, and when it pulled in here I saw Pray jump out of the smoking car and start to run. I couldn't run as fast as he could, and I'd only got {{to the other side of}} the Common when I saw him walk into the house.|$|E

Kate Thomas (Daily Mail) compared Kim's obsession with Grace {{story to the}} movie Single White Female.

Their opinion of Kim changed and she branded the character [...] "kooky Kim", [...] "cuckoo", [...] "crazy", [...] "increasingly unstable", [...] "a few sandwiches short of a picnic" [...] and [...] "seems to have lost her grip on reality completely". Their colleagues Jane Howdle and Laura Morgan added [...] "cunning Kim", [...] "love-struck loon", [...] "loopy Kim", [...] "nutty nurse", [...] "the bonkers Butterfield", [...] "crafty Kim", [...] "lovesick" [...] and [...] "potty" [...] to the list. Hardingham-Gill (Metro) wrote that Kim had been [...] "seriously unhinged during her short time in Hollyoaks." [...] She viewed her involvement with Grace as a [...] "scary obsession" [...] and believed she {{should not be allowed}} to work in nursing. Greenwood from Daily Mail said that fellow character Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) contained most of Hollyoaks crazy, but Kim had [...] "more than <b>enough</b> <b>crazy</b> of her own". He labelled her a [...] "unhinged nurse" [...] accustomed to [...] "compulsive lying and scheming" [...] to make villainous character Claire Devine (Gemma Bissix) proud. He added that [...] "she's taken the definition of 'obsession' to a whole new level." [...] Kim's unhinged behaviour lead Miles (Liverpool Echo) to agree with the Sienna comparison. She also called her a [...] "cunning nurse", [...] "compulsive liar" [...] who has [...] "bizarre obsessions".|$|R
5000|$|Summary: The {{battle with}} Jing and Mastergear {{continues}} when Sherry discovers Jing's weakness. Jing and Kir split, and Jing makes a quick get away by {{hanging on a}} pendulum. Sherry locates him quickly, but before Mastergear can strike a final blow, Jing is saved by Mirabelle. Jing and Kir wake up in Neverland, where they meet the one-handed Captain and his gang of tardiness escapees. It is not long before Mastergear sends Clockodile to kill the troupe, starting with Mirabelle. When Clockodile kidnaps Mirabelle, however, Jing tracks them down and kills the monster, as well as leaving a note for Mastergear. Jing returns Mirabelle to Captain's gang, and sets out to steal time, on his way evading the Eggnog team, a group of renegade roosters. When Mastergear wakes from his somewhat pleasant sleep, he finds the clocks stopped, and flower petals are floating from the hour glass, which is the town's power source. He destroys the glass and everyone in town goes <b>crazy,</b> giving Jing <b>enough</b> {{time to get to}} the clock tower, which holds what he had come for. Captain and the gang show up and open the door with a key made to fit Captain's missing hand, and Jing leads Mirabelle through the tower, which is filled with giant grape vines. Once finding the clockwork grape's [...] "Wild Bunch", a bunch looking like crystals, Mirabelle aids Jing when Mastergear ambushes them. Jing and Masterdear fight on the final level of the clock tower, Jing coming out the victor. Sherry leaves Mastergear's side and he is crushed beneath the tower. Jing, Mirabelle, and Kir make it out in time, and Jing leaves without saying a word. Jing then plans to travel to Sungaria carrying a cage of Porvoras, nature's dynamite. He meets Izarra, a gunslinging woman out for revenge on the owner of the Sungaria mountains, which is not to Jing or Kir's knowledge. They travel across the solar system of towns and cities until they reach the Venus Source, a crater filled with a type of memory alloy, with only one way across, a small road that goes straight across. Jing loses two of the remaining three Porvora (the fourth one fell from a bridge and exploded) to the magma-like alloy, which blows the road, forcing Jing to come up with another form of transportation through the metal. After some toil, he gets across, the remaining Porvora on his back, Kir following close behind.|$|R
