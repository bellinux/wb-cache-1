5|$|Elements of the cold, harsh {{environment}} of the Alps are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> appears on his left, and the path underfoot has {{a thick layer of}} ice.|$|E
5|$|Life for the {{ordinary}} {{soldiers of the}} garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered {{for even the most}} trivial offences. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant {{acrobatic flight}} with widely spread primaries. The red-billed chough pairs {{for life and}} {{displays}} fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey.|$|E
50|$|The {{rock dove}} breeds {{at any time}} of the year, but peak times are spring and summer. Nesting sites are along coastal <b>cliff</b> <b>faces,</b> as well as the {{artificial}} <b>cliff</b> <b>faces</b> created by apartment buildings with accessible ledges or roof spaces.|$|R

5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|The choughs {{have black}} plumage and brightly {{coloured}} legs, feet, and bills, and are resident {{in the mountains}} of southern Eurasia and North Africa. They have long broad wings and perform spectacular aerobatics. Both species pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding sites, which are usually caves or crevices in a <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> They build a lined stick nest and lay three to five eggs. They feed, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey, supplemented by vegetable material or food from human habitation, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E

5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses {{what seems to be}} a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E
5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, {{a yellow}} beak, red legs, and {{distinctive}} calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers. The Alpine chough pairs {{for life and}} displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{played a}} major part in shaping the art forms of many coastal civilizations, such as the Norse, with some dating to the Stone Age. Petroglyphs off a <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> in Bangudae, South Korea show 300 depictions of various animals, a third of which are whales. Some show {{particular}} detail {{in which there are}} throat pleats, typical of rorquals. These petroglyphs show these people, of around 7,000 to 3,500 B.C.E. in South Korea, had a very high dependency on whales.|$|E

5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
50|$|At {{the centre}} of Korouoma the {{fracture}} valley forms a gorge which has worn down and become much deeper than the surrounding terrain.

5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the battle}} was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the {{entrance}} to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large {{hole in the ground}} for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> also had to leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{first noticed}} {{construction}} activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores {{into the old}} quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
