50|$|An {{electrical}} meter with integral AC current clamp {{is known as}} a clamp meter, <b>clamp-on</b> <b>ammeter</b> or tong tester.|$|E
50|$|In AC circuits, {{a current}} {{transformer}} converts {{the magnetic field}} around a conductor into a small AC current, typically either 1 A or 5 A at full rated current, {{that can be easily}} read by a meter. In a similar way, accurate AC/DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using Hall effect magnetic field sensors. A portable hand-held <b>clamp-on</b> <b>ammeter</b> is a common tool for maintenance of industrial and commercial electrical equipment, which is temporarily clipped over a wire to measure current. Some recent types have a parallel pair of magnetically soft probes that are placed {{on either side of the}} conductor.|$|E
50|$|As the ECM {{monitors}} the varying current, a special circuit (also inside the PCM or Power-train Control Module) converts the current into a voltage value and passes {{it on to}} the serial data stream as an OBD-II PID (not to be confused with a PID controller). This is why the best way to test an AFR sensor’s signal is by monitoring the voltage conversion circuitry, which the ECM sends out as an AFR-voltage PID. It is possible to monitor the actual AFR sensor varying current, but the changes are very small (in the low milliamp range) and difficult to monitor. A second drawback to a manual AFR current test is that the signal wire has to be cut or broken to connect the ammeter in series with the pump circuit. Today’s average <b>clamp-on</b> <b>ammeter</b> is not accurate enough at such a small scale. For this reason, the easiest (but not the only) way to test an AFR sensor is with the scanner.|$|E
40|$|This {{status report}} will give an {{overview}} about {{the research and}} development activities of the GSI beam diagnostics group in collaboration with other European partners for the instrumentation in the FAIR project. Alternative concept of a DC/AC current measurement device for 100 A peak with better than 1 mA resolution based on MR sensors For most beam parameters the stored current is monitored by a commercially available dc-transformer offering a dynamic range from 1 µA to 20 A maximum. Its bandwidth of 10 kHz allows determination of the beam lifetime with ms time resolution. But it is known, that these types of transformers have severe problems by a high current bunched beam passage [1]. Even though an improved version is available, no test with beams has been performed so far and scalability from other machines might be doubtful due to the resonance nature of the severe distortion. Therefore investigations of a different type of sensitive magnetic field sensor in collaboration with the University Kassel (Germany) have been started. The idea consists in taking the scheme of a <b>clamp-on</b> <b>ammeter</b> and using a high-effective magnetic sensor in the core gap. Usually Hall-sensors are installed in such measurement devices, but due to the larger core diameter needed in beam diagnostics and the high dynamics of the beam currents to be monitored other sensors have to be investigated like AMR (Anisotrope MagnetoResistance) ...|$|E
