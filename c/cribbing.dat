After the seasons of 1951 and 1952 not much was expected from the 1953 team as it had also lost six players due to academic failure.

40|$|Wood <b>cribs</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} to stabilize openings in underground coal mines. This U. S.

Multitimbered configurations are wood <b>cribs</b> that are constructed with two or more timbers per layer. Nine different <b>crib</b> configurations were evaluated. Configuration parameters under study included the aspect ratio (height-to-width relationship) {{and the percentage of}} solid rr:aterial used in <b>crib</b> construction. Test results and generalized wood <b>crib</b> behavior are discussed and recommendations are made concerning <b>crib</b> constructions to maximize strength and stability. <b>Crib</b> performance is enhanced by reducing buckling effects by decreasing the aspect ratio and geometry considerations that increase the moment of inertia. A cost benefit analysis of multitimbered wood <b>crib</b> configurations is made. Generally, increasing the percentage of solid provides more resistance at less unit construction cost. A comparison of laboratory results and underground observations of several wood pack wall supports suggest in situ load capacity is less than that measured in laboratory testing. Reasons for the apparent decrease of in situ load-bearing capability include load rate effects, stiffness of reaction surfaces, and varying boundary conditions that alter the load transfer mechanics of the <b>crib</b> structure...|$|R
