40|$|In the {{emerging}} market of online video services, new media entrants and traditional gatekeepers are making efforts {{to reinvent the}} dominant modes of video supply and consumption while fighting for market power and customer lock-in. This article studies, {{through a number of}} U. S. and European online video services, two different groups of strategies employed by stakeholders to control their gatekeeper position and build up or maintain market power. It is suggested that traditional media gatekeepers typically engage in strategic alliances and mergers and acquisitions to establish new services and build a stronger power and bargaining position towards upstream and downstream players. In addition, copyright and IPR disputes are also being used to deter online <b>content</b> <b>aggregators,</b> which depend on content producers and broadcasters' resources. Finally, online <b>content</b> <b>aggregators</b> are building strategic alliances with CE vendors in order to quickly enter a new distribution outlet, benefit from network externalities and build market position...|$|R
40|$|A {{defining}} {{property of}} the World Wide Web is a content site's ability to place virtually costless hyperlinks to third-party content as a substitute or complement to its own content. Costless hyper-linking has enabled new types of players, usually referred to as <b>content</b> <b>aggregators,</b> to successfully enter content ecosystems, attracting traffic and revenue by hosting links {{to the content of}} others. This, in turn, has sparked a heated controversy between <b>content</b> creators and <b>aggregators</b> regarding the legitimacy and costs/benefits of uninhibited free linking. This work is the first to model the complex interplay between content and links in settings where a set of sites compete for traffic. We develop a series of analytical models that distill how hyperlinking affects (a) the incentives of content nodes to produce quality content vs. link to third-party content, (b) the profits of the various stakeholders, (c) the average quality of content that becomes available to consumers, and (d) the impact of <b>content</b> <b>aggregators.</b> Our results provide a nuanced view of the, so called, link economy, highlighting both the beneficial consequences and the drawbacks of free hyperlinks for content creators and consumers. ...|$|R

Web portals, as <b>content</b> <b>aggregators,</b> act as gateways to pertinent and up-to-date information. Social networking portals are a recent development, allowing a user to create and maintain a network of close friends or business associates for social and/or professional reasons. The main types of social network sites will be classified, and an evaluation will be performed in terms of features and functionality. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital markets offer {{abundant}} free content but exhibit extreme concentration among content aggregation intermediaries. These {{characteristics are}} linked. In commoditized weak-IP markets, firms earn revenues by bundling free content for users with positively priced advertising services for firms. Intermediaries promote content commoditization, {{and the resulting}} reallocation of market rents from content producers to <b>content</b> <b>aggregators,</b> through free <b>content</b> distribution and political-influence activities that weaken copyright protections. The expected welfare effects raise concern. Scale economies, network effects, “infinite inventory”, ecosystem effects, and learning effects promote winner-take-all outcomes in the intermediary market while weak IP rights skew investment toward low-cost, short-lived projects in the content market. ...|$|R

50|$|Muxlim {{became quite}} popular, {{particularly}} with Muslims resident in America and Western Europe, {{and the site}} received extensive media coverage. El-Fatatry’s ideas of using the website as a meeting place of different nationalities and religions led him {{to be invited to}} speak to both the United Nations and American White House staff. Despite the widespread attention, the company continually struggled with finances.

When the social network did not develop as the company had hoped, it transitioned first into a Muslim-related <b>content</b> <b>aggregator</b> and then into a business consultant. With meager sales and no more incoming venture capital and investment, Muxlim was shut down early in 2012.|$|E
