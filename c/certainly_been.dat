5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

5|$|Like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart before him, Mendelssohn was {{regarded}} as a child prodigy. He began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six, and at seven was tutored by Marie Bigot in Paris. After the family moved to Berlin, all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with Ludwig Berger, who was himself a former student of Muzio Clementi. From at least May 1819 Felix (and his sister Fanny) studied counterpoint and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin. This was an important influence on his future career. Zelter had almost <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> recommended as a teacher by his aunt Sarah Levy, who had been a pupil of W. F. Bach and a patron of C. P. E. Bach. Sarah Levy was a talented keyboard player in her own right, often playing with Zelter's orchestra at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, of which she and the Mendelssohn family were leading patrons. Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts which she bequeathed to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose tastes in music were conservative, was also an admirer of the Bach tradition. This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn's musical tastes. His works show his study of Baroque and early classical music. His fugues and chorales especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of counterpoint reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach, by whose music he was deeply influenced.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Knútr took other actions to contain Orkney. Evidence that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and Hákon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source. Be that as it may, this twelfth-century text states that Hákon had been sent into the Isles by Óláfr, and that Hákon ruled the region {{for the rest of}} his life. The chronology outlined by this source suggests that Hákon left Norway at about the time Óláfr assumed the kingship in 1016. The former is certainly known to have been in Knútr's service soon afterwards in England. One possibility is that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of Orkney and the Isles in about 1016/1017, before handing him possession of the Earldom of Worcester in about 1017. If this was the case, Hákon would have been responsible for not only a strategic part of the Anglo-Welsh frontier, but also accountable for the far-reaching sea-lanes that stretched from the Irish Sea region to Norway. It seems likely that Knútr was more concerned about Orkney and the Isles, and the security of the sea-lanes around Scotland, than surviving sources let on. Hákon's death at sea would have <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> a cause of concern for Knútr's regime, and could have been directly responsible to the meeting between him and the three kings. If Hákon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his demise could well have paved the way for Echmarcach's own rise to power. Having come to terms with the three kings, it {{is possible}} that Knútr relied upon Echmarcach to counter the ambitions of the Orcadians, who could have attempted to seize upon Hákon's fall and renew their influence in the Isles.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} island was {{apparently}} settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is quite old, was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several Gallirallus and/or Porzana rails make the most likely candidates, given their former {{presence in the region}} and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a Todiramphus kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (T. sanctus) group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia. These birds would have fallen victim to the Polynesian rat and, {{in the case of the}} rails which would have almost <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> flightless, hunting by natives.|$|E

25|$|People {{during the}} Middle Paleolithic, {{such as the}} Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa, began to catch {{shellfish}} for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and in Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens sites at Pinnacle Point, Africa around 164,000BP. Although fishing only became common during the Upper Paleolithic, fish {{have been part of}} human diets long before the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic and have <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic. For example, the Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large -long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago. The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter-gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi-nomadic, which altered their social structures. Example societies are the Lepenski Vir as well as some contemporary hunter-gatherers, such as the Tlingit. In some instances (at least the Tlingit), they developed social stratification, slavery, and complex social structures such as chiefdoms.|$|E
25|$|References in {{contemporary}} charters (for {{which there is}} either an original manuscript or an early copy regarded as authentic) show Egbert of Wessex (802-39) granting lands in Cornwall at Kilkhampton, Ros, Maker, Pawton (in St Breock, not far from Wadebridge, head manor of Pydar in Domesday Book), Caellwic (perhaps Celliwig or Kellywick in Egloshayle), and Lawhitton to Sherborne Abbey and to the Bishop of Sherborne. All of the identifiable locations except Pawton are {{in the far east}} of Cornwall, so these references show a degree of West Saxon control over its eastern fringes. Such control had <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> established in places by the later ninth century, as indicated by the will of King Alfred the Great (871-99). Apart from the reference to Egbert's grant at Pawton {{there is no indication that}} English rule extended deep into Cornwall at this stage and the absence of any burhs west of Lydford in the Burghal Hidage may suggest limitations on the authority of the Kingdom of Wessex in parts of Cornwall.|$|E

The current name of Aliso Creek {{was given by}} Spanish conquistadors {{sometime}} between the 1750s and the 1800s. The word aliso means [...] "alder tree" [...] in Spanish, and likely refers to the riparian vegetation that lines the creek especially near its mouth. The California sycamore, Platanus racemosa, {{is also known as}} aliso in Spanish, and is common in the area around the creek. According to the Geographic Names Information System of the United States Geological Survey, there are now 46places in California that use the name, as well as five other streams in California that use the name, including as a variant name.|$|E
500|$|The first {{monument}} in Sackville Street {{was built in}} 1759 in the location where the Nelson Pillar would eventually stand.

A brass statue sculpted by John van Nost the younger was unveiled on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1759.
