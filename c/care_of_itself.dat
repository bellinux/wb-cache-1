In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune echoed this, saying, [...] "n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in Iron Man 3, I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old [...] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior... Stark no longer {{needs to be in}} the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too.

40|$|Philosophy on {{the edge}} The modem idea of the {{university}} initially assigned Philosophy {{to the heart of}} this institution. But the combination of this idea and an idealist philosophy soon got the better of both - the process o f modernisation fragmented the university into a disparate collection of discourses and interest groups, each struggling for control of whatever resources could be claimed. The process of modernisation, spawned by the very same Enlightenment philosophy, marginalised Philosophy within the university itself, and in society at large. What, then, does the future hold for Philosophy as an academic and a cultural endeavour? A typology of four options, reconstructed from the (albeit recent) history of Philosophy, especially since the Enlightenment, is investigated. After their merits and demerits have been outlined, proposals are made for a postmodern rehabilitation of Philosophy. These proposals centre in Philosophy as trustee of cultural literacy, multidimensional creativity, taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> thinking <b>itself,</b> and, finally, Philosophy as caretaker of the otherwise). </p...|$|R

Beginning with a brief overview of some of the major tenets of Campbell’s guiding force of the “monomyth,” which gathers all the various world mythologies as inflections of one universal story, the essay then moves into a discussion of Keats’ poem in order to reveal the power of poetic utterance in reconfiguring a vital mythology. If there is to be a renewed mythos, it may come out <b>of</b> a revisioned <b>care</b> <b>of</b> language <b>itself</b> as a transport vehicle towards the transcendent or invisible realms of being that poetry exposes us to through its aesthetic and linguistic corridors.

I then go on to explicate some of the discursive influences that have fed into the way that residential child care is currently constituted.

This has led to the commodification, instrumentalisation and, within an increasingly regulated polity, the bureaucratisation <b>of</b> public <b>care.</b> Against this backdrop, public <b>care</b> is conceived <b>of</b> in narrow and abstract concerns around rights and protection.

Within the room is Chitose's broken body, creating the ongoing illusion of Chitose as Hiruko. Shima is returned to door form when he falls alseep, which is impossible unless a Baku intervenes and forces him to do so. However, the Baku is transformed into the key to the door, and can only be returned to their previous state when removed from the keyhole. When the key (the baku) is removed from the keyhole, Shima turns into a human again.|$|R
