40|$|Role of the {{vascular}} endothelium in acetylcholine (ACh) induced modulation of neurogenic and applied ATP (adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate) <b>constrictions</b> of intestinal submucosal arterioles was investigated. Arteriole <b>constrictions,</b> induced either by exogenous ATP or evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation, were attenuated {{in the presence}} of ACh. 100 [*]nM ACh almost completely abolished neurogenic <b>constrictions</b> whereas up to 10 [*]μM ACh reduced <b>constrictions</b> to exogenous ATP by only about 60 %. Treatment of the arterioles with 100 [*]μM Nω-nitro-L-arginine (NOLA) and 5 [*]μM indomethacin, to block respectively nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoid release from the endothelium, had no effect on the ACh induced inhibition of neurogenic <b>constrictions</b> but significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of ACh on <b>constrictions</b> to exogenous ATP. Disruption of the {{vascular endothelium}} had no effect on the ACh induced inhibition of neurogenic <b>constrictions</b> but attenuated the inhibitory effects of ACh on applied ATP <b>constrictions</b> to the same extent as after treatment with NOLA and indomethacin. In comparison, endothelial disruption completely abolished the inhibitory effect of substance P (SP) on exogenously applied ATP <b>constrictions.</b> 50 [*]nM ACh significantly attenuated the amplitude of neurally evoked excitatory junction potentials (ejps) recorded from the vascular smooth muscle without altering the time constant of decay (τdecay) of the ejps. It is concluded that ACh inhibits neurogenic <b>constrictions</b> by prejunctional modulation of transmitter release from the perivascular sympathetic nerves with no major role for endothelial paracrine factors. Endothelial NO and/or prostanoids mediate some of the ACh induced inhibition of <b>constrictions</b> to exogenous ATP whereas the endothelium independent inhibitory effects of ACh are attributed to a direct action of ACh on the vascular smooth muscle. However, an indirect effect resulting from activation of vasodilator nerves cannot be ruled out...|$|R
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery <b>constriction</b> accordingly.|$|E

An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal <b>constriction,</b> but not in another, the hot plate test.

5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular <b>constriction,</b> and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E

We use focused-ion-beam techniques in combination with in-situ electrical measurements to create atomic-sized magnetic metallic <b>constrictions</b> and explore their magneto-transport properties (see Figure 1). We have recently reported that by means of low-energy focused-ion-beam (FIB) Ga etching of a metallic electrode {{it is possible to}} control the formation of atomic-sized <b>constrictions</b> with milling-time, observing steps in the conductance in the range of the conductance quantum (G 0 = 2 e 2 /h), just before entering the tunneling regime [3].

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This <b>constriction</b> is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{we found}} that high intraluminal {{pressure}} leads to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also upregulates several components of the renin-angiotensin system in the wall of small arteries. We hypothesized that acute exposure of arterioles to high intraluminal pressure in vitro via increasing ROS production enhances the functional availability of type 1 angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors (AT 1 receptors), resulting in sustained <b>constrictions.</b> In arterioles (∼ 180 μm) isolated from rat skeletal muscle, Ang II elicited dose-dependent <b>constrictions,</b> which decreased significantly by the second application [maximum (max.) : from 59 % ± 4 % to 26 % ± 5 % at 10 − 8 M; P < 0. 05] {{in the presence of}} 80 mmHg of intraluminal pressure. In contrast, if the arterioles were exposed to high intraluminal pressure (160 mmHg for 30 min), Ang II-induced <b>constrictions</b> remained substantial on the second application (max. : 51 % ± 3 % at 10 − 8 M). In the presence of Tiron and polyethylene glycol (PEG) -catalase, known to reduce the level of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), second applications of Ang II evoked similarly reduced <b>constrictions,</b> even after high-pressure exposure (29 % ± 4 % at 10 − 8 M). Furthermore, when arterioles were exposed to H 2 O 2 (for 30 min, 10 − 7 M, at normal 80 mmHg pressure), Ang II-induced <b>constrictions</b> remained substantial on second applications (59 % ± 5 % at 10 − 8 M). These findings suggest that high pressure, likely via inducing H 2 O 2 production, increases the functional availability of AT 1 receptors and thus enhances Ang II-induced arteriolar <b>constrictions.</b> We propose that in hypertension–regardless of etiology–high intraluminal pressure, via oxidative stress, enhances the functional availability of AT 1 receptors augmenting Ang II-induced <b>constrictions...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles.

The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel <b>constriction.</b> Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
