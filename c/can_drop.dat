5|$|Long term {{forecasts}} {{are made}} {{based on these}} effects. However, they are easily overridden, in winter, by the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillations, {{which can only be}} predicted about two weeks in advance. These <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> the temperature noticeably from seasonal norms.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in shogi, {{there are}} no {{additional}} restrictions when dropping pawns: a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> into the same file (vertical column) as another unpromoted pawn controlled by the same player. Also a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> to check the opponent's king, if the opponent would {{have no way to}} prevent his king being captured on the next move. In other words, a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> to give immediate mate.|$|R
50|$|Unlike shogi, a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> {{when the}} {{opponent}} {{would have no}} way to prevent his general being captured on the next move. In other words, a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> to give immediate mate.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{restrictions}} when dropping pawns. That is, a player may have two unpromoted pawns {{on the same}} file, a piece <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> with no legal moves later, and a pawn <b>can</b> be <b>dropped</b> to give immediate checkmate.|$|R
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth {{and has a}} much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller 7 Iris {{marginally}} exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well {{within the range of}} 10×50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape. In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available. As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available. Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne. For example, a yellow bird speeds up, a blue bird fragments into three birds, a black bird explodes, a white bird <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> an egg-shaped projectile, a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles, a green bird boomerangs back and an orange bird expands and inflates. The pigs also vary, with hardiness relative to their size. Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat. In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making them even more resistant to damage.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "loot" [...] {{refers to}} any item {{that can be}} {{obtained}} from the bodies of dead creatures or players. Loot varies by creature, and some items are found more frequently than others. Loot often includes gold, weapons, shields, helmets, food, quest items, and armor. Usually the most valuable items are the most rare. Creatures <b>can</b> only <b>drop</b> items which the game producers have installed them to drop. For instance, an orc <b>can</b> not <b>drop</b> dragon hams, while dragons <b>can</b> not <b>drop</b> a piece of meat. Most loot can be sold for gold to either other players or NPCs.|$|R
50|$|Doraemon was {{creeping}} silently to {{take the}} Dorayaki without being annoyed by the cat. He takes the ladder and climbs to the cupboard {{to take the}} Dorayaki and the items fall and Doraemon holds on with two hands and a leg. Suddenly, the cat food <b>can</b> <b>drops</b> and Doraemon falls. The cat scratches him.|$|R
5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{finds that}} the camera has not {{detected}} any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E

25|$|The haze is seasonal, {{reaching}} a peak {{in late winter}} and spring.

25|$|During {{their time}} in hibernation, bears' heart rate drops from 40–50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute, and {{metabolic}} rate <b>can</b> <b>drop</b> to {{a quarter of a}} bear's (non-hibernating) basal metabolic rate (BMR). These reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation.|$|E
25|$|The nearby Great Salt Lake is a {{significant}} contributor to precipitation in the city.
