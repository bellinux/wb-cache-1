5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue <b>constitutional</b> recognition of distinct society, but {{was stopped by}} the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any <b>constitutional</b> matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to fulfill his government's commitments. This included the Act respecting <b>constitutional</b> amendments, which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any <b>Constitutional</b> amendment, granting Quebec a de facto veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being <b>constitutional</b> amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale <b>constitutional</b> debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the <b>constitutional</b> process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of <b>constitutional</b> accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} a <b>constitutional</b> amendment on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing <b>constitutional</b> right to acquire, possess and carry firearms.

5|$|The <b>Constitutional</b> Court of the Republic of Belarus is {{the highest}} court in Belarus. While other courts deal with civil or {{criminal}} issues, the <b>Constitutional</b> Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the government. The court {{has the power to}} declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the <b>Constitutional</b> Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be <b>constitutional.</b> The court that deals with criminal law matters is the Supreme Court of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the Court should {{literally}} enforce <b>constitutional</b> guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated <b>constitutional</b> provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, the {{executive}} branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to the}} <b>constitutional</b> officers, although the members of these commissions were often the <b>constitutional</b> officers themselves. Governor Ruby Laffoon proposed the Administrative Reorganization Act of 1934 to organize these boards and commissions into seventeen executive departments and seven independent agencies. The General Assembly passed this legislation, giving {{the executive}} branch some semblance of structure for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or <b>constitutional</b> guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the Supreme Court and the <b>Constitutional</b> Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court {{is made up of}} a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The <b>Constitutional</b> Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E

5|$|Even so, {{the general}} public was apathetic towards the new {{political}} situation and the British regarded this as the major impediment {{to the development of}} democratic government in Singapore. Thus, a <b>constitutional</b> commission headed by Sir George Rendel was set up in 1953 to recommend changes in the <b>constitutional</b> system, with the aim of increasing widespread participation in the central and local government of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} saw as violations of <b>constitutional</b> rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a <b>constitutional</b> amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} <b>constitutional</b> activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed <b>constitutional</b> commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited <b>constitutional</b> conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a <b>constitutional</b> crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow {{divorced}} people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a <b>constitutional</b> monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{election}} as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, {{a spate of}} reports alleging Sultan Iskandar's intention to launch a coup d'état by launching {{a state of emergency}} to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Mahathir himself. The Sultan was reportedly having fostered close relations with several key military personnel, including the Army chief himself. The government subsequently took action to curb <b>constitutional</b> loopholes within the constitution and took to task of reducing the power of royal veto in passing legislation, culminating to a <b>constitutional</b> crisis in late 1983. Nevertheless, during his inaugural speech as the Agong in 1984, about a month after the <b>constitutional</b> amendments were passed in parliament, Sultan Iskandar voiced public support for the revised constitution and pledged to act in accordance to the Prime Minister's advise.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} <b>constitutional</b> {{initiative}} allows citizens {{to put a}} <b>constitutional</b> amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference {{on the ballot in}} case both proposals are accepted. <b>Constitutional</b> amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a <b>constitutional</b> one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the <b>constitutional</b> tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the <b>Constitutional</b> Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The 1975 Australian <b>constitutional</b> crisis, {{also known}} simply as the Dismissal, has been {{described}} as the greatest political and <b>constitutional</b> crisis in Australian history.

5|$|The <b>constitutional</b> {{history of}} the Roman Republic {{can be divided into}} five phases. The first phase began with the {{revolution}} which overthrew the monarchy in 509 BC. The final phase ended with the transition that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the {{history of the}} Republic, the <b>constitutional</b> evolution was driven by the Conflict of the Orders between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{era that}} began when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, and ended when Octavian {{returned}} to Rome after the Battle of Actium in 29 BC, {{can be divided}} into two distinct units. The dividing line between these two units is the assassination of Caesar in March 44 BC, although from a <b>constitutional</b> standpoint, there was no clear dividing line between these two periods. The forces which had supported Pompey during {{the early part of the}} first period were allied against Mark Antony and Octavian in 43 BC and 42 BC, and the <b>constitutional</b> means through which Caesar had held power before his assassination were used by Antony and Octavian to hold power after Caesar's assassination. From a <b>constitutional</b> standpoint, it makes no difference whether an autocrat holds the title of Roman Dictator, as Caesar had done, or of Triumvir, as Antony and Octavian had done. From a <b>constitutional</b> perspective, these twenty years formed a single unit, through which the <b>constitutional</b> evolution of the prior century accelerated at a rapid pace. By 27 BC, Rome had completed its transition from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of a world empire.|$|E
