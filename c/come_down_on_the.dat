5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg is {{a proponent}} of {{large-scale}} development. He has repeatedly come down in favor of projects such as the Atlantic Yards mega-development, the Hudson Yards redevelopment, and the Harlem rezoning proposal. On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well. He favors the demolition of Admiral's Row {{in order to build}} a supermarket parking lot. However, Bloomberg has occasionally <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of preservation, most notably in vetoing landmark revocation for the Austin Nichols warehouse. This move was widely applauded by architectural historians. The City Council overruled the veto shortly thereafter, however.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, {{he made his}} return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock sprang to his feet immediately following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions have been mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy; Ken's adopted brother and rival, Frank, has stated he believes the stoppage was justified, while others have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposing side.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Peter Eckersley, Lancashire {{finished second}} in the championship in 1929 and reclaimed the title in 1930, with ten victories and no defeats that season. After four titles in five seasons, the early 1930s saw a number of retirements including McDonald and Dick Tyldesley in 1931 and Ernest Tyldesley in 1935: no Lancashire batsman has matched Tyldesley’s 100centuries in first-class cricket. Lancashire won the championship outright for the last time in 1934, the same year that Len Hopwood performed the double of 1,000runs and 100wickets (a feat he repeated in 1935) and Cyril Washbrook began to work his way into the team. The captain, Peter Eckersley, retired in 1935 to become an MP. The later half of the 1930s was a period of rebuilding up until the war, with the opening partnership of Cyril Washbrook and Eddie Paynter the highlight. Paynter scored 322 in five hours for Lancashire against Sussex in 1937 having <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sleeper train from the victorious Old Trafford Test against New Zealand. He put on 268 in 155 minutes with Cyril Washbrook and celebrated his innings that evening at Brighton's Ice Palace.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{planned a}} huge {{wheeling}} movement that would ultimately <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Confederates' exposed left flank. Wilson's Cavalry Corps moved west on Charlotte Pike once {{an early morning}} fog dissipated, driving off the Confederate cavalry patrolling the area between the Confederate left and the Cumberland River. Smith's XVI Corps detachment followed, turning south after {{a mile or so}} towards the Confederate flank. The cavalrymen formed on Smith's right flank. Schofield's XXIII followed in reserve, and as the assault moved south a gap opened between Smith and Wilson which Schofield was directed to fill. At about 2:30 pm the Federals attacked the five redoubts guarding the Confederate left. Four brigades, two of cavalry and two of infantry, overran Redoubt No. 4 and then Redoubt No. 5, notwithstanding the spirited resistance of the defenders of Redoubt No. 4. Another of Smith's brigades captured Redoubt No. 3; however, its commander, Col. Sylvester G. Hill, was killed by Confederate artillery firing from Redoubt No. 2. He was the highest ranking Federal officer killed in the battle. Smith's troops proceeded to Redoubt No. 2, which was quickly captured.|$|E

It has been widely {{recognized}} as a masterpiece of polemical literature, in which [...] "Sarsi's" [...] arguments are subjected to withering scorn. It was greeted with wide acclaim, and particularly pleased the new pope, Urban VIII, to whom it had been dedicated.

500|$|The thirteenth {{season premiere}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker gave the episode a positive review, showing approval of Kenny's misadventure, saying [...] "thus did South Park ultimately <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side {{of religion and}} sexual freedom, with lots of big laughs in the bargain.... Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was {{better than any of}} the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white-hot moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire." [...] IGN gave the episode an 8.4 score out of 10.|$|E
500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If {{we have to go back}} to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E

[...] He insisted that a coal power plant not delay in meeting tough emissions standards even at the cost of losing jobs: [...] "I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people....

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Rice {{reportedly}} said, [...] "If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?" [...] She subsequently acknowledged the mistakes made at the time and felt that a debt needed repaying. The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glassford {{retired to}} a farm near Phoenix. [...] He mounted a brief run for {{governor}} of Arizona in 1934, and also that year accepted a federal appointment to mediate labor-management disputes between workers and owners of lettuce and cantaloupe farms in Imperial Valley, California. [...] Faced with workers striking {{in an effort to}} obtain better pay and working conditions, conservative farm owners resorted to violence, spying on attorneys sent to California to aid the workers, and propaganda asserting that the strike was communist-inspired. [...] Though Glassford was initially sympathetic to the farm owners, their tactics caused him to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the workers.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Veruca Salt, Gordon demoed solo {{material}} in Boston with friends Kay Hanley and Michael Eisenstein {{from the band}} Letters to Cleo. In 1998, she sang on James Iha's solo album Let It <b>Come</b> <b>Down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Beauty." [...] Shortly after, she began recording with Eight Arms producer Bob Rock. The album, now titled Tonight and the Rest of My Life, was finished in early 1999 and was set to be released by the Outpost Records label, owned by Geffen Records, in August 1999. However, not all went smoothly, as the merger of Geffen Records with Interscope Records forced Outpost Records to fold, leaving Gordon without a label.|$|E
2500|$|Paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division [...] "Screaming Eagles" [...] jumped {{first on}} June 6, between 00:48 and 01:40 British Double Summer Time. 6,928 troops were carried aboard 432 C-47s of mission [...] "Albany" [...] {{organized}} into 10 serials. The first flights, inbound to DZ A, were {{not surprised by}} the bad weather, but navigating errors {{and a lack of}} Eureka signal caused the 2nd Battalion 502nd PIR to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong drop zone. Most of the remainder of the 502nd jumped in a disorganized pattern around the impromptu drop zone set up by the pathfinders near the beach. Two battalion commanders took charge of small groups and accomplished all of their D-Day missions. The division's parachute artillery experienced one of the worst drops of the operation, losing all but one howitzer and most of its troops as casualties.|$|E
