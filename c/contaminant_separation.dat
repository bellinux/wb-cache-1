5000|$|The {{prominent}} {{deep bed}} filtration processes currently used are direct filtration and contact-flocculation filtration. Direct filtration involves {{a short period}} of pre flocculation stage followed by the filtration process. In sewage treatment plants, the majority of suspended solids and other contaminates are successfully removed after the primary and secondary treatment stages. To remove the remaining solids and organic compounds from the wastewater stream, direct filtration method is utilised with prior flocculation. As the <b>contaminant</b> <b>separation</b> process takes place in the filter medium, factors such as flocculation time, filtration velocity and flocculent dosage are required to be monitored regularly, as they can directly affect the flocculent size produced. This is vital to the process in order to prevent potential clogging or bioclogging of the filter bed.|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{represents}} one of the larger categories among solid waste. This depends on the fact that this material is continuously replacing some other one in many types of applications. Plastic solid waste can be recycled to produce secondary raw materials. This solution is applied in order to decrease the use of raw material and to reduce the accumulation of material in landfill. For these reasons recycling represents an economic and social important issue. Technologies for plastic recycling have to guarantee high-quality secondary raw material, complying with specific standards, for use in industrial applications. The market value of recycled plastics is considerably affected by the purity, degree of decontamination and homogeneity of the plastics. To obtain that is possible to use mechanical recycling methods that usually involve the following steps: <b>contaminant</b> <b>separation</b> (plastics are separated from other types of materials such as paper or metal), separation of different types of plastic polymers (separated by flotation, density difference, aereodynamic or elettrostatic properties, etc), washing and drying, shredding, comminution, agglutination, extrusion. Mechanical recycling is complicated by the similarities in physical properties between several types of plastic. An alternative method to separate contaminants from plastic wastes and different types of plastic polymers can be developed by hyperspectral systems. It is an optimal, low cost, reliable and speedy method. Hyperspectral imaging system is based on the utilization of an integrated hardware and software architecture able to digitally capture and handle spectra, as an image sequence. Different materials are identified by their spectral signature, made by investigation of VIS (400 - 1000 nm) and NIR (900 - 1800 nm) range of wavelength...|$|E

A mixture forms which consists of predominantly the gaseous phase with a mist of small micron-sized droplets of liquid/solid <b>contaminant.</b> The <b>separation</b> process is further enhanced by introducing a second step. The collected liquid/solid slurry is flashed to a liquid/gas mixture at 20  bar. The liquid is purified, {{while most of the}} gas which was dissolved in the liquid/solid slurry evaporates. This gas is re-fed into the gas stream {{in the first part of}} the process.|$|R

5000|$|The {{isolation}} and detection of exosomes {{has proven to}} be complicated. Due to the complexity of body fluids, physical separation of exosomes from cells and similar-sized particles is challenging. Isolation of exosomes using differential ultracentrifugation results in co-isolation of protein and other <b>contaminants</b> and incomplete <b>separation</b> of vesicles from lipoproteins. Combining ultracentrifugation with micro-filtration or a gradient can improve purity. Single step isolation of extracellular vesicles by size-exclusion chromatography has been demonstrated to provide greater efficiency for recovering intact vesicles over centrifugation, [...] although a size-based technique alone {{will not be able to}} distinguish exosomes from other vesicle types. To isolate a pure population of exosomes a combination of techniques is necessary, based on both physical (e.g. size, density) and biochemical parameters (e.g. presence/absence of certain proteins involved in their biogenesis).|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} permits radionuclides, heavy metals, and organics to {{be extracted}} from solution by scavenging {{them with an}} amorphous gel. In the preferred embodiment, a contaminated solution (e. g. from soil washing, decontamination, or groundwater pumping) is transferred to a reaction vessel. The contaminated solution is contacted by the sequestering reagent which might contain for example, aluminate and EDTA anions in a 2. 5 M NaOH solution. The pH of the reagent bearing solution is lowered on contact with the contaminated solution, or for example by bubbling carbon dioxide through it, causing an aluminum hydroxide gel to precipitate as the solution drops below the range of 1. 8 to 2. 5 molar NaOH (less than pH 14). This precipitating gel scavenges waste contaminants as it settles through solution leaving a clean supernatant which is then separated from the gel residue by physical means such as centrifugation, or simple settling. The gel residue containing concentrated contaminants is then redissolved releasing <b>contaminants</b> for <b>separations</b> and processing. This is a critical point: the stabilized gel used in this invention is readily re-dissolved by merely increasing the pH above the gels phase transition to aqueous anions. Thus, concentrated contaminants trapped in the gel can be released for convenient separation from the sequestering reagent, and said reagent can then be recycled...|$|R
40|$|Machining is a {{controlled}} material removal process and finds its application {{in a variety}} of industrial sectors such as automobile, aerospace, and defense. Similar to many other manufacturing processes, machining bears significant environmental impacts in terms of energy/resource consumption, airborne emissions, wastewater discharge, and solid wastes along with occupational health risks. Most of these issues are due to the use of cutting fluids, which are traditionally formulated with petroleum-derived compounds with high ecotoxicity and low biodegradability. Exposure to these chemicals, along with growth of microorganisms and biocides used for microbial control, could lead to respiratory irritation, asthma, pneumonia, dermatitis, and even cancer. To address these concerns, extensive effort has been put forth to (1) extend the cutting fluid life span by removing particulates, free oils, and other <b>contaminants</b> via <b>separation</b> and filtration, (2) reformulate traditional petroleum-based fluids with vegetable oils and bio-based ingredients for lower toxicity and higher biodegradability, and (3) reduce or even eliminate the reliance on cutting fluids during machining through dry machining and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) techniques. Apart from these technology developments, machining process parameters can be optimized for reduced environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and carbon footprint. Process optimization approaches require the development of models and equations to correlate process parameters with process inputs and outputs. Given the current status in the field, opportunities exist in designing new bio-based, microfiltration-compatible formulations using industrial by-products, optimizing minimum MQL system configuration, advancing cutting tool insert materials and lubricants for MQL, and developing high-energy efficiency machine tools...|$|R
40|$|Determination of 55 Fe in reactor samples {{requires}} some care {{because of the}} low-energy x-rays emitted following decay by electron capture {{and the presence of}} 59 Fe and other possible [gamma]-ray emitting <b>contaminants</b> in radiochemical <b>separations.</b> This problem was dealt with by radiochemical separation of Fe followed by use of an intrinsic germanium detector operated at high amplifier gain to count the low-energy x-ray emissions to quantitate 55 Fe. Separation of this important nuclide in reactor samples was by solvent extraction using triisooctylamine in xylene. Low-energy photon counting was done with a high gain setting and a 3 [mu]s shaping time, which provided accurate quantitation without interference of 59 Fe and other potential contaminants, which were either removed by separation or discriminated against by the counting procedure. Iron- 59, either present in the sample or added as a spike, was used as a tracer for determining radiochemical yield, which was about 70 %.

40|$|Stock {{preparation}} {{systems for}} recycled papers {{need to be}} designed to produce a high quality, uniform product from a source that has significantly varying properties. Process models are {{a useful tool for}} analyzing and optimizing stock preparation systems. However, many models only account for the bulk flows of the components {{in the form of the}} fraction of fibers, contaminants, and ash. This report extends some of these modelling ideas to include component distributions. For example, the fiber fraction can be treated as a distribution based on fiber length and possibly fiber coarseness and composition. The contaminant concentration is expressed as a function of both particle size and density of the <b>contaminant.</b> Finally, the <b>separation</b> efficiency of the processing steps also becomes a function of fiber and contaminant distributions. Ultimately, these models are used to determine the efficiency of various stock preparation systems with differing configurations of the cleaners, screens, washing, and other operations. Such models allow the performance of existing and new systems to be compared and optimized, especially in the light of the changing composition of the feedstock...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{utilization}} of bisphenol A (BPA) {{in the industrial}} production of polycarbonate plastics {{has led to the}} occurrence of this compound (at μg/L to ng/L level) in the water treatment plant. Nowadays, the presence of BPA in drinking water sources is a major concern among society because BPA is one of the endocrine disruption compounds (EDCs) that can cause hazard to human health even at extremely low concentration level. Parallel to these issues, membrane technology has emerged as the most feasible treatment process to eliminate this recalcitrant <b>contaminant</b> via physical <b>separation</b> mechanism. This paper reviews the occurrences and effects of BPA toward living organisms as well as the application of membrane technology for their removal in water treatment plant. The potential applications of using polymeric membranes for BPA removal are also discussed. Literature revealed that modifying membrane surface using blending approach is the simple yet effective method to improve membrane properties with respect to BPA removal without compromising water permeability. The regeneration process helps in maintaining the performances of membrane at desired level. The application of large-scale membrane process in treatment plant shows the feasibility of the technology for removing BPA and possible future prospect in water treatment process...|$|R
40|$|Issue: As {{wood waste}} {{material}} travels through a processing facility on conveyors, it can form layers, piles, or clumps. These layers, piles, or clumps often bury or hide embedded contaminants (ferrous metals in particular), reducing {{the effectiveness of}} contaminant removal systems. Failure to remove metal contaminants can cause {{a number of problems}} such as excessive wear, damage to equipment in the processing facility itself, and contamination, creating problems in meeting end-user specifications. If the material is manually sorted either for removal of various types of <b>contaminants</b> or for <b>separation</b> into sub-streams, embedded contaminants and deep piles can also create problems. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the integration of mechanical features into conveyor systems that will improve the exposure of contaminants to specialized removal systems (especially ferrous metals) and to manual sorters. Distribution and exposure of the material flow also helps sorters separate into various sub-streams.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a general two-step method for obtaining peptide fragments for sequence analysis from picomole quantities of proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. After separation by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins are electrophoretically transferred (electroblotted) onto nitrocellulose, the protein-containing regions are detected by reversible staining and are cut out, and each protein is digested in situ by proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin or staphylococcal V- 8 protease. The resulting peptide fragments are separated by narrow-bore reverse-phase HPLC, collected, and sequenced in a gas-phase sequenator. Excellent peptide recoveries {{and the absence of}} extraneous <b>contaminants</b> in the <b>separation</b> of the peptide fragment mixture allow the generation of extensive internal sequence information from picomole amounts of protein. The method thus overcomes the problem of obtaining amino acid sequence data from N-terminally blocked proteins and provides multiple, independent stretches of sequence {{that can be used to}} generate oligonucleotide probes for molecular cloning and/or used to search sequence data bases for related proteins.

We present new enzyme- and dye-based methods to detect (di) ethylene glycol in consumables above 0. 1 wt % without interference and alcohols above 1 ppb. Using DNA intercalating dyes, we can detect a range of pathogens (E. coli, Salmonella, V. Cholera, and a model for Malaria) in water, foods, and blood without background signal. We achieved universal scaling independent of pathogen size above 10 [superscript 4] CFU/mL by taking advantage of the simultaneous measurement at multiple wavelengths.

40|$|While many methods {{exist to}} {{separate}} and analyze radionuclides {{from a variety}} of environmental matrices, the performance of all of these methods is often limited by other interfering constituents that are consistently found in most of these samples. The presence of such constituents can significantly reduce the recovery of the radioisotopes of interests and lead to incomplete separations. Strontium has the same oxidation state and a similar atomic radius as calcium and is therefore readily able to substitute for calcium in lattice sites. This similarity in behavior leads to the preferential accumulation of strontium in newly formed bone. The study of radiostrontium uptake and the analysis of bone samples is therefore of great interest for radiation biology, internal dosimetry, and consequence management. The fact that one of the strontium isotopes of greatest biological importance, 90 Sr, is a pure beta-emitter prevents the use of non-destructive assay techniques and necessitates the development of sophisticated separation methods for radiochemical analysis. It has been previously reported in the literature that the matrix constituents present in bone can significantly affect the strontium recovery from bone samples 1. Bone (hydroxyapatite) is of particular interest when evaluating the effect of common environmental interferences due to the high concentrations of calcium and phosphate present. The goal of this work is to determine the major and minor constituents present in various samples of bone ash and to determine their influence on method performance and strontium recovery. The work presented exploited the use of a variety of radioanalytical separation and isotope detection techniques. Focusing on the characterization of the bone ash, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Powder Diffraction techniques were used to determine the morphology, to verify the crystalline pattern, and to analyze for any contaminants within each unique bone ash sample. The information obtained helped to determine the elements of interest for batch experiments, which were conducted {{in order to determine the}} individual elemental effects that may play a role on the retention of radiostrontium isotopes onto the SR Resin purchased from Eichrom Technologies Inc.

40|$|Electrochemical {{separation}} {{methods are}} promising {{due to their}} modularity, fast kinetics and potential integration with renewable sources. However, they are still limited in application due to high energetic costs and lack of chemical selectivity. This work explores redox-electrodes as a platform for targeting aqueous and organic <b>contaminants</b> with high <b>separation</b> factors, in the contexts of environmental water remediation, chemical product purification in organic synthesis, metal-recovery and bio-separations. The design of selective stimuli-responsive interfaces is a crucial challenge for advanced electrochemical processes. Whereas redox-electrodes are well known in sensing, catalysis and energy storage, here we focus on their unique potential for selective ion removal - cases in which one dilute compound is targeted {{in the presence of}} large excess of competing electrolyte. In particular, organometallics and associated metalcomplexes offer an attractive material platform, due to their flexible metal-ligand design and as a consequence, extensive control allowed of their electronic properties. The first major thrust is the molecular design of various organometallic species for specific interactions with charged compounds in solution. We developed a series of heterogeneous, nano-structured metallocene interfaces to control the selective sorption and release of anions, cations, and even proteins, based on electrochemical potential. In parallel, through a combination of electronic structure calculations and spectroscopy, we unraveled the unique binding mechanism between ferrocenium and organic ions demonstrating an unusual redox-mediated hydrogen-bonding between cyclopentadienyl and carboxylates; and utilize this knowledge to further tune our redox-systems to enhance chemical selectivity. We expanded our organometallic set to various bi-pyridines and functionalized metallocenes, and studied various problems ranging from reactive separations to catalytic remediation of contaminants of emerging concern. A second major thrust consists in utilizing asymmetric pseudo capacitors as the next generation configuration for electrochemical separation devices. Asymmetric systems were shown to have much higher energy storage capabilities as well as separation efficiencies. We focused on counter-electrode design, in which the redox reaction at the cathode works in tandem with the anode, thus maintaining the water chemistry by suppressing parasitic reactions which otherwise lower current efficiency. From a fundamental perspective, the novel interaction mechanisms explored in this thesis were shown to have broader implications in deionization, sensing, catalysis and energy storage. For chemical engineering, this work demonstrated redox-based electrochemical methods as an energy-efficient and sustainable route to process intensification, and paved their way for practical implementation in industry. by Xiao Su.
