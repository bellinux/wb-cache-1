5|$|<b>Coexist</b> {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. <b>Coexist</b> touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coexist</b> is the 2012 second studio album by English indie pop {{band the}} xx. After {{a break from}} touring for their 2009 self-titled first album, the band members began to write songs {{individually}} before they recorded <b>Coexist</b> from November 2011 to May 2012. For the album, the xx drew on personal experiences for their songwriting, while their music {{was influenced by the}} electronic dance scene that occurred when they had been away on tour. The album was produced by the band's Jamie Smith, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, <b>Coexist</b> {{was awarded}} a {{platinum}} certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, indicating sales of at least 400,000 copies throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for <b>Coexist</b> and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed <b>Coexist,</b> wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording <b>Coexist</b> in May 2012.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coexist</b> debuted {{at number}} one on the Official Albums Chart with first-week sales of 58,266 copies in the United Kingdom, {{becoming}} the band's first number-one album on the chart. The album fell to number four in its second week, selling 22,005 copies. On 14 September 2012, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry, denoting shipments in excess of 100,000 copies in the UK. <b>Coexist</b> also debuted at {{number one on}} record charts in Belgium, New Zealand, Portugal, and Switzerland. In the United States, it debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with 73,000 copies sold in its first week. The album debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 10,000 copies in its first week.|$|E

Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do so, and Aslan creates a portal for them and the four Pevensies. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing they will never meet again, as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Indian {{cultural}} elements <b>coexist</b> {{with traditional}} {{practices of the}} ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites Unakoti, Pilak and Devtamura provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and tribal religions. The Great Chinmoy in Agartala was the former royal abode of the Tripuri king.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can <b>coexist</b> in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of its statehood, different religions <b>coexisted</b> in Poland. With the baptism of Poland in 966, the old pagan religions were gradually eradicated {{over the next few}} centuries during the Christianization of Poland. By the 13th century Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout the country. Nevertheless, Christian Poles <b>coexisted</b> with a significant Jewish segment of the population.|$|R
30|$|The {{fault zone}} in the earth’s crust is thought to consist of several regions from top to bottom: the upper {{frictional}} region, the brittle-ductile transition zone and the ductile region. The upper frictional region consists of the unstable frictional zone, the unstable-stable transition zone, and the stable frictional zone. Recent geological observations of fault rock suggest that at the deeper part of the seismogenic zone, co-seismic frictional slip <b>coexists</b> with interseismic flow processes. We propose a possible model for slip processes at the deeper part of the seismogenic zone in which the frictional slip and flow processes are connected in series. In this model, in the ductile region, power law creep is dominant. Around the unstable-stable transition zone, we assume that co-seismic frictional slip <b>coexists</b> with aseismic flow processes. We investigate simple 1 -D and 2 -D models where rate- and state-dependent friction <b>coexists</b> with power law creep that has a threshold stress. The results of numerical simulations show {{that the amount of}} slip during the interseismic period is greater in the case where friction <b>coexists</b> with power law creep than it is when only friction is at work. It is also found that, for the case where friction <b>coexists</b> with power law creep, frictional slip is largely inhibited in the ductile region.|$|R

5|$|Several {{critics and}} {{publications}} ranked <b>Coexist</b> {{as one of}} 2012's best albums in their year-end, top-ten lists, including Kitty Empire of The Observer, The Austin Chronicle, Les Inrockuptibles, State magazine, and The Guardian, whose staff voted it eighth. It was named the 14th best {{album of the year}} by both NME magazine and Christgau in his list for The Barnes & Noble Review. However, the magazine XLR8R ranked the album number seven on their list of the most overrated releases of the year, feeling that the trio's dark and minimal sound on the record was not as exciting as on their debut LP.|$|E
5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to <b>coexist</b> peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to <b>coexist</b> in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans <b>coexist</b> in peace.|$|E
