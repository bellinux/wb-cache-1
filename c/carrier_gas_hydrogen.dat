40|$|Laser-assisted {{chemical}} vapor deposition {{growth is}} an attractive mask-less process for growing locally aligned nanotubes in selected places on temperature sensitive substrates. An essential parameter for a successful and reproducible synthesis of nanotubes is the temperature during growth. Here, we demonstrate a temperature feedback control mechanism based on the dynamic, in situ monitoring of the infrared radiation coupled with reflectivity information. With the information provided by these sensors, an infrared laser, focused on a silicon substrate covered with aluminum-oxide and iron catalyst layers, can be controlled. The growth {{takes place in a}} gaseous mixture of argon (<b>carrier</b> <b>gas),</b> <b>hydrogen</b> (process gas), and ethylene (carbon-containing gas). Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analysis demonstrate the excellent reproducibility of the closed-loop control process over multiple experiments.

40|$|Seven {{variable}} {{parameters of the}} chemical vapor deposition system have been optimized {{with the help of}} the Taguchi analytical method for getting a desired product, e. g., carbon nanotubes or carbon nanobeads. It is observed that almost all selected parameters influence the growth of carbon nanotubes. However, among them, the nature of precursor (racemic, R or Technical grade camphor) and the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>hydrogen,</b> argon and mixture of argon/hydrogen) seem to be more important parameters affecting the growth of carbon nanotubes. Whereas, for the growth of nanobeads, out of seven parameters, only two, i. e., catalyst (powder of iron, cobalt, and nickel) and temperature (1023 K, 1123 K, and 1273 K), are the most influential parameters. Systematic defects or islands on the substrate surface enhance nucleation of novel carbon materials. Quantitative contributions of process parameters as well as optimum factor levels are obtained by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of mean (ANOM), respectively...|$|E

40|$|A semi-empirical {{model for}} {{the growth rate of}} {{selective}} epitaxial silicon(SEG) in the Dichlorosilane-HC 1 -Hz system that represents the experimenltal data has been presented. All epitaxy runs were done using a Gemini-I LPCVD pancake reactor. Dichlorosilane was used as the source gas and hydrogen as the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> Cllloride(HC 1) was used to ensure that no nucleation took place on the oxide. The growth rate expression was considered to be the sum of a growth term dependent on the partial pressures of Dichlorosilane and hydrogen, and an etch berm that varies as the partial pressure of HC 1. The growth and etch terms were found to have an Arrhenius relation with temperature, with activation energies of 52 kcal/mol and 36 kcal/mol respectively. Good agreement was obtained with experimental data. The variation of the selectivity threshold was correctly predicted, which had been a problem with earlier models for SEG growth rates.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to present the design and {{development}} of a chemical vapor deposition reactor {{for the growth of}} high quality homoepitaxy silicon carbide films for electronic device applications. The work was performed in the Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center at the University of South Florida from 8 / 2001 - 5 / 2003. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the technique of choice for SiC epitaxial growth. Epitaxial layers are the building blocks for use in various semiconductor device applications. This thesis reports on a SiC epitaxy process where a <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>hydrogen)</b> is saturated with reactive precursors (silane and propane) which are then delivered to a semiconductor substrate resting on a RF induction heated SiC coated graphite susceptor. Growth proceeds via a series of heterogeneous chemical reactions with several steps, including precursor adsorption, surface diffusion and desorbtion of volatile by-products. The design and development of a reactor to make this process controlled and repeatable can be accomplished using theoretical and empirical tools. Fluid flow modeling, reactor sizing, low-pressure pumping and control are engineering concepts that were explored. Work on the design and development of an atmospheric pressure cold-wall CVD (APCVD) reactor will be presented. A detailed discussion of modifications to this reactor to permit hot-wall, low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) operation will then be presented. The consequences of this process variable change will be discussed as well as the necessary design parameters. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations, which predict the flow patterns of gases in the reaction tube, will be presented.

Furthermore, the system was applied to a real sample, wood smoke particulates. The PAH values determined correlated well with the previous data and those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

5000|$|During {{the growth}} process of {{magnesium}} diboride thin films by HPCVD, the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> is purified <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> H2 at a pressure of about 100 Torr. This H2 environment prevents oxidation during the deposition. Bulk pure Mg pieces are placed {{next to the}} substrate {{on the top of}} the susceptor. When the susceptor is heated to about 650°C, pure Mg pieces are also heated, which generates a high Mg vapor pressure in the vicinity of the substrate. Diborane (B2H6) is used as the boron source. MgB2 films starts to grow when the boron precursor gas B2H6 is introduced into the reactor chamber. The growth rate of the MgB2 film is controlled by the flow rate of B2H6/H2 mixture.

30|$|The ethanol {{produced}} from the fermentation process contains a significant quantity of water {{which must be}} removed. This was achieved by using the fractional distillation process by boiling the water and ethanol mixture. Since ethanol has a lower boiling point (78.3  °C) {{compared to that of}} water (100  °C), the ethanol turns into the vapor state before the water and it can be condensed and separated. The ethanol concentration in the distillate was determined gas chromatography (GC). Samples analyzed for ethanol production were taken at the end of fermentation after 12, 24, 36 and 48  h of incubation.

40|$|Carbon {{clusters}} {{have been}} investigated in the gas phase. A new modular molecular beam apparatus {{has been set up}} and allows a variety of experiments. This work divides up into three parts: In the first part, it is shown that the near-resonant charge transfer reaction C 60 + Na(3 p) [...] > C 60 - + Na + exhibits an extraordinary large alignment effect (r ss > = 0. 8 ± 0. 2). In a crossed beam experiment, the sodium is excited using a linearly polarized two mode dye laser. The alignment effect is observed by simultaneously monitoring the dependence of the fluorescence and the C 60 - anions on the polarization direction. It is found that practically only sodium atoms with their electronic charge cloud asymptotically aligned along the relative velocity vector lead to charge transfer. The clear effect is interpreted in terms of the "orbital following" model and the strong p -character of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of C 60. The second part is dedicated to a mass spectrometric characterization of the carbon clusters. Carbon clusters are produced by laser-vaporization and subsequent supersonic expansion. It turns out that the bimodal distribution of carbon cluster cations may even be trimodal. This third mode is explained by the coalescence of smaller fullerenes in the source. The studies using reactive <b>carrier</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>hydrogen</b> and nitrogen) give some insight in the variety of the geometries of carbon cluster cations. Evidence for the formation of long-lived, excited neutral states in large fullerenes is presented. In the third part, the geometries of the carbon cluster cations are investigated using the technique of gas phase ion chromatography. The mobility of the ions in an inert gas is determined. A comparison with the simulated mobilities of different geometric isomers allows a structural assignment of the different isomers. This will allow future studies of the reactivity of carbon clusters in dependence on their geometry...|$|R

To avoid the need for compressed gas tanks, ambient air is used as the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> and a vacuum pump is used to pull the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> and injected samples through the wall-coated capillary column and a photoionization detector (PID). At-column heating is used eliminating the need for a conventional oven. The fused silica column is wrapped with heater wire and sensor wire so that heating is provided directly at the column.

The samples were deposited on GaAs using growth temperatures between 720 C and 780 C. By means of photoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy a clear dependence of the optical properties of AlGaInP on long range ordering of the group-III-sublattice was observed. The hypothesis had to be put forward, that at 2 K three PL-transitions can be found in principle. The behaviour of these emissions was found to depend strongly on the microstructure of the samples, the so called domain structure. An emission in the limelight of the current research, the so called 'moving emission' was indicated to represent a band of two unresolvable emissions. All in all, it could ascertained that the establishment of long range order is principally promoted by the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> nitrogen. A larger halfwidth of the 300 K PL-spectra of the layers, which were grown under nitrogen atmosphere, could be ascribed to a higher degree of order in the layers and not to an inferior crystal quality.

40|$|I {{changed my}} <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> from helium to hydrogen. Although much shorter {{retention}} times were obtained, {{there was a}} noticeable loss in resolution. I thought that using <b>hydrogen</b> as a <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> would reduce the retention times and increase resolution. Why did the resolution decrease instead of increase? Answer The optimal average linear velocity for hydrogen and helium are different, thus method adjustments are needed when changing between the two <b>carrier</b> <b>gases.</b> For most capillary columns the optimal average linear velocity is 25 – 40 cm/s for helium and 40 – 80 cm/s for hydrogen.

The effects caused by <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> characteristics during PET solid-state polymerization were analyzed with emphasis on the final product molecular weight. The significance of gas-side by-products mass transfer was quantified when varying the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and the humidity level, the latter corresponding to industrial plant operation conditions due to the performed <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> recycling. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|The {{increased}} response due to {{the presence}} of the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> in the flame ionization detector has been reexamined and a good correlation is observed with the thermal conductivity of the carrier. It is reasoned, however, that this correlation is fortuitous and that flame temperature does not explain the origin of the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> effect. It is shown that the effect can be reasonably attributed to the occurrence of an associative chemi-ionization reaction between excited CHO and the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> and a new mechanism is proposed for ion forma-tion in the detector involving both the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> and the H 2...|$|R
50|$|Q1 is the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> that {{is usually}} {{introduced}} into the plasma torch through an injector {{at the center of}} the torch head. As the name indicates it, the function of Q1 is to convey the precursor (powders or liquid) into plasma. Argon is the usual <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> however, many other reactive gases (i.e., oxygen, NH3, CH4, etc.) are often involved in the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> depending on the processing requirement.|$|R
