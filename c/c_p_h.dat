40|$|The {{specific}} heat capacity (Cp) of six variably hydrated (~ 3. 5  wt% H 2 O) iron-bearing Etna trachybasaltic glasses and liquids has been measured using differential scanning calorimetry from room temperature across the glass transition region. These data are compared to heat capacity measurements on thirteen melt compositions in the iron-free anorthite (An) –diopside (Di) system over a similar range of H 2 O contents. These data extend considerably the published Cp measurements for hydrous melts and glasses. The results for the Etna trachybasalts show nonlinear variations in, both, the heat capacity of the glass {{at the onset of}} the glass transition (i. e., Cpg) and the fully relaxed liquid (i. e., Cpl) with increasing H 2 O content. Similarly, the “configurational heat capacity” (i. e., Cpc = Cpl − Cpg) varies nonlinearly with H 2 O content. The An–Di hydrous compositions investigated show similar trends, with Cp values varying as a function of melt composition and H 2 O content. The results show that values in hydrous Cpg, Cpl and Cpc in the depolymerized glasses and liquids are substantially different from those observed for more polymerized hydrous albitic, leucogranitic, trachytic and phonolitic multicomponent compositions previously investigated. Polymerized melts have lower Cpl and Cpc and higher Cpg with respect to more depolymerized compositions. The covariation between Cp values and the degree of polymerization in glasses and melts is well described in terms of SMhydrous and NBO/Thydrous. Values of Cpc increase sharply with increasing depolymerization up to SMhydrous ~  30 – 35  mol% (NBO/Thydrous ~  0. 5) and then stabilize to an almost constant value. The partial molar heat capacity of H 2 O for both glasses (Cgp H 2 O) and liquids (<b>C</b> 1 <b>p</b> <b>H</b> 2 O) appears to be independent of composition and, assuming ideal mixing, we obtain a value for <b>C</b> 1 <b>p</b> <b>H</b> 2 O of 79  J mol− 1  K− 1. However, we note that a range of values for <b>C</b> 1 <b>p</b> <b>H</b> 2 O (i. e., ~ 78 – 87  J mol− 1  K− 1) proposed by previous workers will reproduce the extended data to within experimental uncertainty.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} the ATP 7 B gene mutation in patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson’s disease (WD) in Lithuania. METHODS: Eleven unrelated Lithuanian families, including 13 WD patients were tested. Clinically WD diagnosis was established in accordance to the Leipzig scoring system. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole venous blood using a salt precipitation method. Firstly, the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the <b>c.</b> 3207 C>A (<b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q) mutation. Patients not homozygous for the <b>c.</b> 3207 C>A (<b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q) mutation were further analyzed. The 21 exons of the WD gene were amplified in a thermal cycler (Biometra T 3 Thermocycler, Göttingen, Germany). Direct sequencing of the amplified PCR products was performed by cycle sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators in an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). RESULTS: Total of 13 WD patients (mean age 26. 4 years; range 17 - 40; male/female 3 / 10) presented with hepatic disorders and 16 their first degree relatives (including 12 siblings) were studied. Some of WD patients, in addition to hepatic symptoms, have had extrahepatic disorders (hemolytic anemia 3; Fanconi syndrome 1; neuropsychiatric and behavioural disorder 2). Liver biopsy specimens were available in all of 13 WD patients (8 had cirrhosis; 1 -chronic hepatitis; 3 -acute liver failure, 1 -liver steatosis). Twelve of 13 (92. 3 %) WD patients had the <b>c.</b> 3207 C>A (<b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q) mutation, 6 of them in both chromosomes, 6 were presented as compound heterozygotes with additional c. 3472 - 82 delGGTTTAACCAT, c. 3402 delC, <b>c.</b> 3121 C>T (<b>p.</b> R 1041 W) or unknown mutations. For one patient with liver cirrhosis and psychiatric disorder (Leipzig score 6), no mutations were found. Out of 16 first degree WD relatives, 11 (68. 7 %) were heterozygous for the <b>c.</b> 3207 C>A (<b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q) mutation. Two patients with fulminant WD died from acute liver failure and 11 are in full remission under penicillamine or zinc acetate treatment. Three women with WD successfully delivered healthy babies. CONCLUSION: The <b>c.</b> 3207 C>A (<b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q) missense mutation is the most characteristic mutation for Lithuanian patients with WD. Even 92. 3 % of WD patients with hepatic presentation of the disease are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for the <b>p.</b> <b>H</b> 1069 Q mutation...|$|R
