A total of 78. 9 hours of observation were achieved during five seasons of survey (1996, 1997 and 2000 - 2002) off Plymouth south west England. The temperature range of the local population of <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> was 10. 2 - 14. 7 °C, indicating that <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> did not utilise the full temperature range of 10 - 16. 1 °C generally available in the area. The majority (69 %) of <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> were sighted in June. The mean sea surface temperature during these observations was 13. 2 °C. Behavioural response to fine scale temperature variation was studied to identify the existence and thermal boundaries of preferred temperature. The distance of travel varied with different temperature during a 53 -minute fine scale track, suggesting temperature related behaviour that may be the thermoregulation of metabolic rate.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1889 Van Beneden {{described}} a new tetraphyllid cestode, Dinobothrium septaria, {{for which he}} erected a new genus. It was peculiar in having a rather small body with a very large scolex, the largest of all tapeworm holdfasts. Since then {{a small number of}} other species of Dinobothrium have been described (for two of them new genera were proposed, viz. Gastrolecithus Yamaguti, 1952 and Reesium Euzet, 1955). They have only been found in large sharks, both in preying and in plankton feeding species. Mola (1907) was the first investigator who found such a tapeworm in the Basking Shark, <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> (Gunnerus). Euzet (1955) has tried to elucidate the remarkable and confused history of these animals. He recognized three genera and only three species, viz. Dinobothrium septaria van Beneden from Lamna nasus (Bonnaterre), Gastrolecithus planus (Linton) and Reesium paciferum (Sproston) both from <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> (Gunnerus). Some incidental finds from other sharks have a doubtful status. The most remarkable fact is that these three species with similar scolices were placed in three different families: Dinobothrium septaria in the family Phyllobothriidae, Reesium paciferum in the family Prosobothriidae, while Euzet proposed a new family, Gastrolecithidae, for Gastrolecithus planus. However, it is the opinion of the present author that this view will not generally be accepted. It is improbable that the characteristic scolices would have evolved in three families. In the present paper Gastrolecithus planus is recorded from <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> captured in the North Sea near the Dutch coast. Gastrolecithus planus (Linton, 1922...|$|E

Fisheries for basking shark (<b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus)</b> and porbeagle (Lamna nasus) were well established in northern areas (e. g. off Norway) in the early 20 th century. Although targeted fisheries for basking shark have now ceased, porbeagle is still taken in locally important directed fisheries in the Celtic Sea. Tuna and billfish fisheries, which expanded in recent decades, harvest shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), blue shark (Prionace glauca), {{and a variety of other}} pelagic sharks, with some of these fisheries targeting sharks at certain times/areas. Prior to the late 1990 s, most European nations reported catches as “sharks not elsewhere identified”, and only in recent years has species-specific data become available. There is currently little biological sampling of commercial pelagic shark catches by fisheries laboratories, although there are some tag and release programmes for sharks.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of the papers dealing more or less extensively with <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> the gill rakers (fanunculi) are correctly described and regarded as specifically characteristic, whilst {{in a number of other}} papers, e. g., de Blainville (1812), Vrolik (1826), and Tchang Si (1934) the gill rakers are not mentioned. This does not necessarily indicate that the specimens examined by the cited authors did not possess gill rakers, probably no definite search was made concerning the presence or absence of these parts. From 1821 till 1952 there stranded in the Netherlands or were brought ashore by fishermen 21 specimens of Cetorhinus maximus; of nine of these it was stated that they had gill rakers, four of these specimens proved to be without gill rakers, whilst of the other specimens no notes are given concerning these parts; the last named specimens will not be further dealt with in the present paper.

The numbers of basking sharks caught and copepod abundance showed downward trends and were positively correlated (r-value range, 0. 44 – 0. 74).

40|$|The {{basking shark}} (<b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus)</b> and megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) are {{two species of}} filter feeding sharks, both {{belonging}} to the order Lamniformes.

Evidence obtained from several studies strongly supports the latter hypothesis. Because evidence suggests that C. maximus and M. pelagios have developed their filter feeding adaptations independently, we expect to see convergent evolution taking place within these two lineages. Geometric morphometric analyses were performed on fossil and Recent teeth of megamouth and basking sharks to determine if there is commonality among tooth shape.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The basking shark, <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> (Gunnerus), is the world's {{second largest}} sh, but {{little is known}} of its life history and ecology. The species is broadly {{distributed}} in northern and southern temperate waters of the Atlantic and Pacic oceans, and found from brackish coastal lagoons and shallow coastal waters to the open ocean (Francis & Duy, 2002). In spring and summer, the basking shark moves inshore to feed on planktonic crustaceans, but little is known of its autumn and winter habitats in most of its range (Francis & Duy, 2002). The paucity of winter observations and the discovery of several sharks lacking gillrakers prompted Parker & Boeseman (1954) to propose that basking sharks hibernate during winter because zooplankton densities are too low to make feeding energetically protable. This hibernation hypothesis has persisted for decades, though there are now theoretical considerations (Sims, 1999) and bycatch records (Francis & Duy, 2002) to the contrary. Recent...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods were}} used to reanalyse {{previously}} published length-frequency data on basking shark <b>Cetorhinus</b> <b>maximus</b> and thereby resolve an earlier controversy about the growth rate ofthis fish. These methods confirm earlier suggestions of a slow growth (von Bertalanffy K> 0. 06 /year, for an asymptotic length of 10 m), and correspondingly low natural mortality (M> 0. 07 /year), as appropriate for a fish with a record length of 9. 7 m. Given what is known of the inverse relationship between asymptotic length and K in hundreds of fish species (including sharks), the above results imply that whale sharks Rhincodon typus should exhibit, for an asymptotic length of 14 m, K and M values of about 0. 03 and O. OS/year, respectively. Such slow growth and the high longevity this implies should make whale sharks even more sensitive than basking sharks to human-induced mortality, thus arguing against exploitation by fisheries. Also, ecotourism schemes {{will have to be}} careful to avoid becoming a source of indirect mortality...|$|E
