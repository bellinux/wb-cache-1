This is close to the Kantian view that reality is ultimately unknowable and all models are just imperfect approximations to it.|$|E

Implementing both quality improvement and innovation poses significant managerial, organisational and technical challenges, {{and may also}} involve significant lags before benefits are realised. Here, using data on {{a large group of}} Irish manufacturing plants and econometric analysis, we establish the short- and longer-term influence of plants’ adoption of quality improvement methods (QIMs) on product innovation performance. Our study highlights the short-term disruptive and longer-term beneficial effects of QIM adoption on product innovation performance. In addition, we find evidence of complementarities and learning-by-using effects from QIM adoption. Our results suggest that maximising the returns to innovation and quality improvement requires consideration of the soft and/or hard nature of individual QIMs and the timing and sequencing of their adoption. ...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Marshall was {{instrumental}} in preparing the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces for {{the invasion of the}} European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the <b>central</b> <b>strategy</b> for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled Operation Overlord for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to Operation Husky for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended one year earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.|$|E

In {{an article published in}} April 1940, entitled [...] "The Soviet Union and the World War", Shachtman concluded:The revolutionary vanguard must put forward the slogan of revolutionary defeatism in both imperialist camps, that is, the continuation of the revolutionary struggle for power regardless of the effects on the military front. That, and only that, is the <b>central</b> <b>strategy</b> of the third camp in the World War, the camp of proletarian internationalism, of the socialist revolution, of the struggle for the emancipation of all the oppressed.|$|E
5000|$|On some occasions, simple weapons {{employed}} in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, {{as with the}} Swiss pikemen who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one. Likewise, the Zulus in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals {{in part because they}} adopted a new kind of spear, the iklwa. Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the Wars of Scottish Independence and in the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the Battle of Alesia, the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training. [...] Battles can also be determined by terrain. Capturing high ground, for example, has been the <b>central</b> <b>strategy</b> in innumerable battles. An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down. Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies. Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for guerrilla warfare.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{framework}} of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM hypothesis) {{was applied to the}} analy-sis of the structure of finger force variability during os-cillatory force production tasks. Subjects produced cy-cles of force with one, two (index and middle), or three (index, middle, and ring) fingers acting in parallel against force sensors mounted inside a small frame. The frame could be placed {{on the top of a}} table (stable condi-tions) or on a 4 -mm-wide supporting surface (unstable conditions). Subjects were less variable when they used two fingers than when using one finger; adding the third finger did not change indices of variability of the perfor-mance. Components of finger force variance that did (VUN) or did not (VCOMP) change the value of a particu-lar functional variable were computed for two control hypotheses: (1) at each time, the subjects tried to stabi-lize the total value of force (force-control); and (2), at each time, the subjects tried to stabilize the total moment produced with respect to an axis parallel to the hand/forearm (moment-control). Most subjects showed selective stabilization of moment and destabilization of force throughout most of the force cycle, in both stable and unstable conditions. The shapes of VUN and VCOMP suggested a possibility of selective compensation of tim-ing errors across fingers within force cycles. One subject showed different relations between VUN and VCOMP, sug-gesting that these relations did in fact reflect particular <b>central</b> <b>strategies</b> of solving the tasks. The UCM method is applicable to force production tasks. It allows the comparison of control hypotheses in a quantitative way and unveils <b>central</b> <b>strategies</b> of control of redundant motor systems. Within this approach, redundancy (rather, abundance) is not a problem but an inherent part of a so-lution for natural motor tasks...|$|R

40|$|Poststroke {{spasticity}} (PSS) is {{a common}} complication associated with other {{signs and symptoms of}} the upper motor neuron syndrome, including agonist/antagonist co-contraction, weakness, and lack of coordination. Together, they result in impairments and functional problems that can predispose to costly complications. The goal of PSS man-agement should take into consideration not only reduction of muscle hypertonia but also the impact of PSS on function and well- being. Therapeutic interventions focus on peripheral and <b>central</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as physical techniques to increase muscle length through stretching and pharmacological modu-lation.
