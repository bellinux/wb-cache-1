40|$|Strategies to {{accelerate}} progress of India′s family planning programme are discussed {{and the importance}} of improving the quality and reach of services to address unmet contraceptive need by providing method choice is emphasized. Although there is a growing demand for both limiting and spacing births, female sterilisation, is the dominant method in the national programme and use of spacing methods remains very limited. Fertility decline has been slower in the empowered action group (EAG) s 0 tates which contribute about 40 per cent of population growth to the country and also depict gloomy statistics for other socio-development indicators. It is, therefore, important to intensify efforts to reduce both fertility and mortality in these s 0 tates. a 0 rationale has been provided for implementing integrated programmes using a gender lens because the lack of women′s autonomy in reproductive decision-making, compounded by poor male involvement in sexual and reproductive health matters, is a fundamental issue yet to be addressed.

40|$|Abstract Background Contraceptive {{prevalence}} {{is relatively}} high in Brazil (55 % among women of reproductive age). However, reversible methods account {{for less than}} half of the method mix and widespread differences persist across regions and social groups. This draws attention to the need for monitoring family planning service-related outcomes that might be linked with quality of care. The present study examines the factors associated with method discontinuation, failure and switching among current contraceptive users, with a focus on sub-national assessment. Methods Data for the analysis are drawn from the Brazil Demographic and Health Survey, notably the calendar module of reproductive events. Multilevel discrete-time competing risks hazard models are used to estimate the random- and fixed-effects on the probability of a woman making a specific transition after a given duration of contraceptive use. Results Contraceptive continuation was found to be highest for the contraceptive pill, the most popular reversible method. Probabilities of abandonment while in need of family planning and of switching to another method were highest for injections. Failure, abandonment and switching were each higher among users in the Northeast region compared to the more prosperous Southeast and South. Conclusion Findings point to seemingly important disparities in the availability and quality of family planning and reproductive health care services across regions of the country. Expanding access to a range of contraceptive methods, improving knowledge among health agents of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies</b> and increasing medical supervision of contraceptive practice may be considered key to expanding quality reproductive health care services for all. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Achieving {{the correct}} spatial and {{temporal}} expression of germ-cell-specific genes is fundamental {{to the production of}} viable healthy spermatozoa. Notably, post-transcriptional gene regulation resulting in the repression of protein translation is central to many embryonic processes, and is particularly active during spermatogenesis. In this review, we discuss microRNA (miRNA) regulation of target gene expression in relation to mammalian spermatogenesis, the establishment of testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) and the potential use of miRNA manipulation for cancer therapy and fertility regulation. Methods: Journal databases such as PubMed were searched using key words, including miRNA, testis, spermatogenesis, germ cell, testicular cancer and cancer. Results: In the past decade, the deployment of small non-coding RNA molecules, including miRNA, by the cell, has been recognized as among the most important mechanisms of fine-tuning translational regulation in differentiating cell types. For key regulators of male gametogenesis, high levels of gene expression do not always correspond to elevated levels of protein expression. Cumulatively this indicates that enhancement and repression of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are essential to the success of spermatogenesis. There is also growing evidence that this form of regulation contributes to the aetiology of both TGCT and spermatocytic tumours. Conclusions: miRNA plays an essential role in regulation of genes during the process of spermatogenesis. Disruption of this regulation has the ability to contribute to the neoplastic development of germ cell tumours. However, targeted knockdown of specific miRNA molecules has the potential to form both anti-oncogenic reagents and underpin the basis for novel <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Globally, <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies</b> {{have been}} {{critical}} to improving the reproductive lives of women. This thesis examined the decision-making processes among couples in Kwara State, Nigeria. It began with the premise that contraceptive decision-making is a complex process that involves an array of actors and structural forces that operate and intersect at different levels to influence decision-making. Using a mixed method qualitative approach, this thesis used interviews (semi-structured and Key informant), Focus Group Discussions and participant observation as research tools to provide a nuanced exploration of contraceptive decision-making. The promotion of smaller families by the State served as a precondition for contraceptive discussions collectively within the population and individually within the household. Contraceptive knowledge proved insufficient in guaranteeing use, as {{the decision to use}} contraception is not a rational process. Decision-making is gendered and this thesis argued that spousal communication is critical to the use of contraception and involved a series of non-linear conversations that occur at different stages in the reproductive life course of a couple. These conversations stressed the role of external influences and highlights the effect friends and family have on the decision making process. Economic and sexual triggers were identified as life events necessary to move spousal communication from the household to the public domain of service provision. Making informed choices on the method of contraception used highlighted some of the challenges faced in providing quality contraceptive services and how women’s bodies are differentiated and ‘modernised’ based on location. This thesis suggests that in order to make improvements to women’s reproductive lives, bodies need to be understood more broadly in relation to the gender dynamics between couples, the community (family/friends and service providers) and service provision (the State, service providers and the international community). ...|$|R
40|$|Contraception {{is often}} a taken-for-granted element of {{actively}} heterosexual women’s lives. Yet while modern contraceptives have technically enhanced women’s ability to control their fertility, the history of women’s struggles to achieve this control shows the importance of understanding the social context within which women’s contraceptive decisions are situated. Previous feminist studies of contraception in the UK have tended to concentrate either on aspects of medicine or on heterosexuality. Whilst both areas have highlighted the {{need to understand how}} power relationships structure women’s contraceptive experiences, these two aspects have not been integrated adequately. There has also been a tendency to focus research on younger women, and mature women’s ongoing use of contraception has generally been overlooked. This thesis is based on qualitative interviews with twenty-two mid-life British women aged between 30 and 40, as well as observations at a family planning clinic. It demonstrates that only by giving full consideration to the extent and complexity of the power relationships surrounding contraception can an understanding of women’s decisions and everyday practices be achieved. The concept of ‘subjective power’ is developed to explore how these women make strategic and creative use of circulating discourses, interact with disciplinary regimes, and situate themselves within multi-faceted webs of power relationships, such as in relation to the institutions of medicine, the media, and heterosexuality. The embodied nature of both the risk of pregnancy and the use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies</b> is argued to lead the women to assert a right of bodily autonomy. Yet this assertion conflicts with their expectation of equitable coupledom within heterosexuality and their routine consideration of men’s preferences. In addition, this thesis will show that taking ‘proper’ responsibility for preventing pregnancy constructs women as respectable, yet may increase their risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.

40|$|Though South Africa {{has high}} {{contraceptive}} use, unintended pregnancies are still widespread. The SILCS diaphragm {{could reduce the}} number of women with unmet need by introducing a discreet, woman-initiated, non-hormonal barrier method to the contraceptive method mix. A decision model was built to estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the introduction of the SILCS diaphragm in Gauteng among women with unmet need for contraception in terms of unintended and mistimed pregnancies averted, assuming that the available contraceptives on the market were not a satisfying option for those women. Full costs were estimated both from a provider's and user's perspective, which also accounts for women's travel and opportunity cost of time, assuming a 5 % uptake among women with unmet contraceptive need. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is computed at five and 10 years after introduction to allow for a distribution of fixed costs over time. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate decision uncertainty. The introduction of the SILCS diaphragm in Gauteng could prevent an estimated 8, 365 unintended pregnancies and 2, 117 abortions over five years, at an annual estimated cost of US$ 55 per woman. This comes to a cost per pregnancy averted of US$ 153 and US$ 171 from a user's and provider's perspectives, respectively, with slightly lower unit costs at 10 years. Major cost drivers will be the price of the SILCS diaphragm and the contraceptive gel, given their large contribution to total costs (around 60 %).

Young women married and had children at a lower rate if the state they lived in had early legal access to it; women could set aside their relationships and pursue a career through higher education. Goldin and Katz noted that the birth control pill was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1960 for use by married women. It spread to young, unmarried women in the late 1960s with change in age of majority laws. Thus, they found a difference from the national average for women born 1930-1965 with if they lived in a state with early legal access to the pill. There was a −0.02 difference in marriage age at 23 from the national average of 0.41. There was a −0.07 difference from the national average of having a child by 22. There was a 0.004 difference from the national average of being a professional, and a 0.016 difference from the national average of being a lawyer or doctor.

50|$|The Pill was {{approved}} by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. Time magazine placed the pill on its cover in April, 1967. In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility. Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take the Pill was a private one. This combination of factors served to make the Pill immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.Claudia Goldin, among others, argue that this new <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technology</b> was a key player in forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women. From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies two {{topics in}} the macro-labour literature: {{investment}} in human capital and fertility decisions. The thesis comprises of three chapters, the first studying {{the effects of}} private tutoring in Korea and its resemblance to a human capital rat race and {{the second and third}} investigating the rapid decline in fertility rates experienced in developing countries over the past few decades. With many countries having reached universal primary and secondary education, parental spending on education for supplementary and enrichment purposes has begun to resemble a rat race. In many Asian countries, it is normal for students to receive some or several forms of private tutoring alongside formal schooling. However, unlike the returns to schooling or the effects of school quality on student achievement which have been widely studied, the effects of private tutoring have received limited attention. In the first substantive chapter of this thesis, I exploit exogenous variation in spending on private tutoring caused by the imposition of a curfew on the operating hours of tutoring institutes in Korea, to estimate the impact of spending on tutoring on long-term educational and labour market outcomes. The first stage estimates highlight the severity of the rat race, with curfews imposed as late as 10 pm still constraining tutoring expenditure. While I do not find any significant effects of tutoring expenditure on entering college, when I interact tutoring expenditure with parental education, I find a significant, positive effect of tutoring on attending any college for children of less educated parents, while the effect for children of more educated parents is not significantly different from zero. Given that the less educated parents spend much less on tutoring, these results indicate diminishing marginal effects of tutoring, while the lack of an effect in the specification linear in tutoring expenditure points to the average impact (local to those constrained by the curfew) being close to zero. I also find that tutoring expenditure has a positive effect on both completing a four year degree and on being employed. I place these empirical findings within an asymmetric information framework to explain how the use of test scores as a signal for ability leads to inefficiently high investments in tutoring, leading to a rat-race equilibrium. The second paper highlights the trends in fertility rates observed in developing countries, pointing out that cross-country differences in fertility rates have fallen very rapidly over the past four decades, with most countries converging to a rate just above two children per woman. In the second substantive chapter in the thesis, my co-author and I argue that the convergence in fertility rates has taken place despite the limited (or absent) absolute convergence in other economic variables and propose an alternative explanation for the decline in fertility rates: the population-control programmes started in the 1960 s which aimed to increase information about and availability of contraceptive methods, and establish a new small-family norm using public campaigns. Using several different measures of family planning programme intensity across countries, we show a strong positive association between programme intensity and subsequent reductions in fertility, after controlling for other potential explanatory variables, such as GDP, schooling, urbanisation, and mortality rates. We conclude that concerted population control policies implemented in developing countries are likely to have {{played a central role in}} accelerating the global decline in fertility rates and can explain some patterns of that fertility decline that are not well accounted for by other socioeconomic factors. In the third main chapter of the thesis, we build on the findings presented in the previous chapter by studying a quantitative model of endogenous human capital and fertility choice, augmented to portray a role for social norms over the number of children. The model allows us to gauge the role of human capital accumulation on the decline in fertility and to simulate the implementation of population-control policies aimed at affecting social norms on family size. We also consider extensions of the model in which we allow a role for the decline in infant and child mortality and for improvements in <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies</b> (the second main component of the population-control programmes). Using data on several socio-economic variables as well as information on funding for family planning programmes to parametrise the model, we find that, as argued in the previous chapter, policies aimed at altering family-size norms provided a significant impulse to accelerate and strengthen the decline in fertility that would have otherwise gradually taken place as economies move to higher levels of human capital and lower levels of mortality...|$|R

Harris Candlewick Press, 96 pp., $ 12. 99 Among {{the many}} {{purposes}} served by children’s books, that of teaching kids about subjects {{that their parents}} cannot or will not broach ranks high. In our increasingly libidinous and violent culture, and amid our advancing <b>contraceptive</b> <b>technologies,</b> breakdowns in societal structures, and the waning influence of religious warnings and prohibitions, some form of sex education would seem downright urgent. For even in the highly eroticized global culture of today, alarming numbers of young people {{do not know the}} basic biology of sex and human reproduction. (When teen pregnancy occurs, this is what we hear: but we only did it once; but we were standing up; but he pulled out.) Openly or secretly, every toddler wonders at some point: Where did I come from? Moreover, pre-adolescents trouble over the rate and the dimensions of their changing body contours. A recent New York Times article reports that some American girls are now starting puberty as early as seven and eight years of age—highly disturbing data. A child in a woman’s body can handle neither the concomitant hormonal upheavals nor the ensuing advances from men and boys. Robie Harris’s fine book on sexuality has been updated and reworked for the fifteenth anniversary of its publication. It actually lives up to its promise and delivers “honest, reliable, accurate, and accessible information” about human sexuality and reproduction. Harris’s scientific bent prompts her to provide thoroughgoing up-to-date research on every topic from reproduction and contraception to HIV/AIDS and abortion law. But this book is far from a heavy-handed textbook. Harris has chosen her title with care. Her principal purpose—beyond that of importing crucial information, which is clearly paramount—is to render her subject non-threatening. Most books on sexuality for children offer anatomical diagrams and pictures of the sexes at different stages of development. This one, by populating its pages with humorous and friendly-faced folks, bears brave witness to acts rarely depicted in the others. Drawn disarmingly in a light-hearted vein, the images here include a boy having an erection, a boy putting on a condom, a young girl masturbating and a boy doing likewise, a girl upside down studying her genital area with a mirror, and an interracial couple in bed, smilingly making love. Young readers viewing these pages, even if they skim the text, may find visual answers to their unformed questions. Another normalizing technique introduces a duo of pint-sized characters—a cartoon bird and bee—both wearing shirts and sneakers, who cavort through the book and comment in comic-strip bubbles, section by section. These embedded creature-critics cleverly represent the attitudes of both an embarrassed, defended, disgusted child who doesn’t want to know (Bee: “Are we finished with all this body stuff for now?”) and a curious child who does want to know (Bird: “No! Definitely not!”). The last page of It’s Perfectly Normal reiterates its principal message. Bird and bee discuss whether thinking and talking about bodies and sexuality is “normal or gross. ” Missing here is what this otherwise excellent book lacks, namely, a serious engagement with why the subject itself continues to prove so embarrassing, stressful, anxiety-ridden, confusing, and shrouded in mystery and innuendo. By gleefully agreeing that it is all “perfectly normal,” the bird and the bee elide this darker side of sexuality. Perhaps this is because adults—including most writers, reviewers, and even endorsers of children’s books—are themselves prey to some measure of ineradicable apprehension when faced with this intricately entwined realm of fantasy and behavior. Still, Harris is too casual here. To imply that sexuality should be all sunny and soothing is misleading, and pedagogically inadequate. There remains the hard task of trying to think through, in the company of young people, rather than as their wise guides, some of sexuality’s daunting contradictions. This challenge has been nicely met, by contrast, in Lynda Madaras’s two books, What’s Happening to My Body?, for boys and girls. Inevitably covering the factual material found in Harris and Emberley but with black-and-white line drawings devoid of any special character, Madaras addresses her reader directly in the second person and starts off with an immediate focus on context. She begins her girls’ book with an anecdote about the nastiness of pre-pubescent girls who gossip maliciously behind each others’ backs, and ostracize their chosen victims, and betray one another by switching loyalties. Instantly we are {{in the thick of the}} difficult terrain, plunged appropriately into a psycho-social milieu, and it is from here that the biological story of sexuality unfolds. Even when one breaks down the subject for children, one needs to confront the puzzles. A few serious and jarring notes might have deepened Harris’s presentation and enhanced its value for adolescents. In regard to menstruation, for instance, there is hardly a mention of the ongoing—and devastating—history of taboo, and none at all of the subtle ways in which this event alters forever the dynamics within the family and changes a girl’s relationships with both her mother and her father. The feelings that go along with such a life-changing event deserve acknowledgment in a book on sexuality. Likewise on the subject of giving birth: uterine contractions and vaginal dilation rarely occur in the absence of pain, but this unpleasant fact is left unstated. To become a mother is to bear a child, and labor is never an unmitigated joy. And what about the morning after sex, which may not prove as pleasurable as the moment during which it occurs? And the resultant changes to one’s sense of self, which can be dramatic and intense? To have explored these psychological facets of sexuality might erode the upbeat mood, but it would have made this otherwise valuable book even more valuable. Since parents often find it hard to broach these topics, a book like this can be offered to a young teenager—placed in his or her room—in hopes that, after being read privately, it might serve as the springboard for live intergenerational conversation.

Before these developments, contraceptive choice was limited to either cautiously-related methods which lacked in effectiveness or permanent methods. Contraceptive choices have been broadened. Contraception was moved outside the bedroom by the development of methods such as the pill. People no longer had to make the choice between a method to be used at every coitus or a permanent method; long-acting reversible methods now offer protection ranging from one month to several years. Highly effective but reversible methods became an available option.
