2500|$|Having first sat in {{parliament}} on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 {{to make his}} maiden speech in the House of Lords during a debate entitled [...] "The International Situation: The Middle East".

25|$|On 11 November 1981, {{members of}} the Labor Party moved a motion of no {{confidence}} against Lowe's leadership, petitioning him to resign as Premier and leader of the party, which he did. Harry Holgate was installed as Premier in his place. Instead of joining the backbenches, Lowe resigned from the ALP and joined the <b>cross-benches</b> as an Independent.|$|R
2500|$|As is {{the custom}} with Westminster parliaments, {{members of the}} {{governing}} party sit to the Speaker's right, and the Opposition sits to the Speaker's left. Independents and minor parties sit on the <b>cross-benches.</b> The long benches (the front benches) closest to the despatch boxes are reserved for the Cabinet on the government's side and the [...] "Shadow Cabinet" [...] on the Opposition's side.|$|R

25|$|Narragansett-style {{excursion}} {{cars are}} open-air passenger cars with <b>cross-bench</b> seating first popularized by rail lines in New England. Current operating {{examples of these}} train cars {{can be found on}} the Disneyland Railroad in California and on the Walt Disney World Railroad in Florida. Similar coaches are also found on the Western River Railroad in Tokyo, but it is unknown if these are pure Narragansett-style excursion cars or not.|$|E
5000|$|From the <b>Cross-Benches</b> Lord Strang added: To {{some of us}} it {{had been}} a comfort to have had Lord Jellicoe as Leader. I doubt whether he realises how much we shall miss him. We have been deeply saddened by what has happened. The {{outstanding}} record of his achievements will not be dimmed; our warm regard for him will remain. (Hansard, 5 June 1973) ...|$|R
50|$|They {{were open}} trams with {{passengers}} seated on <b>cross-benches,</b> and no weather protection on the cars' sides. Duncan & Fraser built them with summer excursions in mind {{but they had}} limited utility {{due to the lack}} of weather proofing. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use.|$|R
60|$|As the <b>cross-benches</b> form {{a refuge}} {{for those who have}} no minds to make up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take to Homeric studies. Many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with Achilles after some violent {{political}} crisis and, enraged at the fickleness of fortune, more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant for party.|$|R
25|$|Following two {{and half}} decades of {{economic}} reform and amidst booming trade with Asia, Australia—in stark contrast to most other Western nations—avoided recession following the 2008 collapse of financial markets. Following the 2010 election, the Gillard Government entered an alliance with the Australian Greens and was destabilized by breaking an election promise not to introduce a carbon tax, by leadership rivalry and by lacking the numbers to push some controversial legislation through the Parliament. Nevertheless, the <b>cross-bench</b> alliance continued to operate and though facing declining poll support and firm opposition from the Liberal-National Coalition, in October the government successfully passed its Clean Energy Bill 2011 aimed to restructure the Australian economy {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions associated with global warming by increasing costs to industry for carbon emissions. A carbon tax was introduced in Australia on 1 July 2012. Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013. After the 2013 Australian General Election, Rudd lost the role of Prime Minister to Tony Abbott, the Liberal Leader. On 19 December 2013 95% of the Australian military had withdrawn from Afghanistan with the remaining 5% presently training locals in Kabul and Kandahar who are expected to pull out altogether sometime in December 2014, regardless of how the American and British troops' withdraw plays out.|$|E

2500|$|Rio de Janeiro has {{the oldest}} {{operating}} electric tramway in Brazil and South America, now mainly used by tourists and less by daily commuters. Santa Teresa Tram or bondinho, has been preserved {{both as a}} piece of history and as a quick, fun, cheap way of getting {{to one of the most}} quirky parts of the city. The tram station is near Cinelândia and the Municipal Theatre. Trams leave every half an hour between 6:00am and 11:00pm. A ticket is just 0.60 (US$0.35), one way or return, and people pay as they pass through the barrier to the right of the entrance. The Santa Teresa Tram (known locally as the [...] "bonde") in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro commenced electric operation in 1891, replacing horse-drawn trams and expanding the horse-drawn route. At this time the gauge was altered to , which remains the case today. The tram cars which are currently in operation are Brazilian-built, are of the <b>cross-bench</b> open sided design, and are fitted with trolley poles.|$|E
60|$|Now, but an {{hour before}} the child of Gudruda the Gentle was born, Asmund went up from his house to the Temple, to tend the holy fire that burned night and day upon the altar. When he had tended the fire, he sat down upon the <b>cross-benches</b> before the shrine, and, gazing on the image of the Goddess Freya, he fell asleep and dreamed a very evil dream.|$|R
5000|$|By October 1958 he {{had joined}} the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a {{distinctly}} pink. Whig, who gave him the honour of moving [...] "an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech" [...] My Lords, I am acutely, indeed somewhat painfully, conscious of the great honour which the noble Earl Lord Home (i.e. Alec Douglas-Home), the Leader of the House, has done me in inviting me to move the humble Address to Her Majesty. The last time that I addressed your Lordships' House was from the platonic sanctity of the <b>Cross-Benches.</b> I then had the aesthetic pleasure of seeing your Lordships in profile: I now have the equal pleasure of seeing some of your Lordships full face. I {{do not know why}} I find myself in this particular hot spot this afternoon. I can only surmise that the noble Earl, fishing for a good large Tory trout, cast over the <b>Cross-Benches</b> for an ex-Ambassador and hooked an ex-First Secretary by mistake.|$|R
50|$|Lord Tanlaw {{persists}} in pressing {{his case for}} a change of time zone. Most of his recent appearances in the House of Lords have been to argue for lighter evenings, which he does when there is only the most tenuous link to the topic being debated in the chamber. Such has his reputation become that other Lords are able to predict when the issue will be raised by Lord Tanlaw's appearance in his usual seat on the <b>cross-benches.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Village that {{voted the}} Earth was flat!' It was easier now {{to see who}} were not singing. There were still a few. Of a sudden (and this proves the {{fundamental}} instability of the <b>cross-bench</b> mind) a cross-bencher leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary double-bass with tremendous maestro-like wagglings of the elbow.|$|E
60|$|I {{perceived}} we were embarked upon {{a discussion}} of the elements. We began an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions of general ideas that are dear to the heart of youth. I and Margaret supported one another as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and the initial maintained an anti-socialist position, the curate attempted a <b>cross-bench</b> position with an air of intending to come down upon us presently with a casting vote. He reminded us of a number of useful principles too often overlooked in argument, that in a big question like this there was much to be said on both sides, that if every one did his or her duty to every one about them there would be no difficulty with social problems at all, that over and above all enactments we needed moral changes in people themselves. My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to manage, being unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely impervious to reply. Her standpoint was essentially materialistic; she didn't see why she shouldn't have a good time because other people didn't; they would have a good time, she was sure, if she didn't. She said that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they wouldn't very likely {{know what to do with}} it. She asked if we were so fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and expressed the inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, everything would be just the same again in ten years' time. She also threw upon us the imputation of ingratitude for a beautiful world by saying that so far as she was concerned she didn't want to upset everything. She was contented with things as they were, thank you.|$|E

However, in the 2011 election, New Zealand First gained 6.59% of the total party vote, entitling it to eight Members of Parliament (MPs). The party increased its number of MPs to eleven at the 2014 election. The caucus currently sits on the <b>cross-benches</b> and had tended to vote with the Opposition against Government policies.|$|R

60|$|Now Atli came to Middalhof just as men {{sat down}} to meat and, hearing the clatter of arms, all sprang to their feet, {{thinking}} that perhaps Ospakar had come again as he had promised. But when Asmund saw Atli he knew him at once, though they had not met for nearly thirty years, and he greeted him lovingly, {{and put him in}} the high seat, and gave place to his men upon the <b>cross-benches.</b> Atli told all his story, and Asmund bade him rest a while at Middalhof till the weather grew clearer.|$|R
2500|$|In March, {{at about}} the same time as Lyons led his group of defectors from the right of the Labor Party across the floor, 5 left-wing NSW Labor MPs, {{supporters}} of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang, also split from the official Labor Party over the government's economic policies (for Lyons they had been too radical, for the Langites they were not radical enough), forming a [...] "Lang Labor" [...] group on the <b>cross-benches</b> and costing the government its majority in the House of Representatives. Late in the year, the Langite MPs supported a UAP no-confidence motion and brought the government down, forcing an early election.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the first}} Minister for Community Services and Health in the Follett-led Labor {{government}} in a hung parliament. After a vote of no confidence was passed on Follett, Berry was forced to <b>cross-benches.</b> Surprisingly, Follett's deputy, Paul Whalan resigned from the Assembly in November 1990 and Berry became Follet's deputy. In 1991, when Follett succeeded Trevor Kaine as Chief Minister, Berry again assumed responsibilities as Minister for Health and became Deputy Chief Minister. The responsibilities of industrial relations and sport were added, and he held all three portfolios until the a ministerial reshuffle in 1994 when David Lamont replaced Berry in the ministry.|$|R

Subsequently Doyle convened a second meeting of the PLP on 29 November and moved that Olexander be expelled. This motion was carried (votes not released). Olexander served out the remainder of his term in the Upper House sitting on the cross benches.
