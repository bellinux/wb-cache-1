5|$|Cloth {{manufactured}} in England increasingly dominated European markets during the 15th and early 16th centuries. England exported almost no cloth {{at all in}} 1347, but by 1400 around 40,000 <b>cloths</b> a year were being exported – the trade reached its first peak in 1447 when exports reached 60,000. Trade fell slightly during the serious depression of the mid-15th century, but picked up again and reached 130,000 <b>cloths</b> a year by the 1540s. The centres of weaving in England shifted westwards towards the Stour Valley, the West Riding, the Cotswolds and Exeter, away from the former weaving centres in York, Coventry and Norwich.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cloth</b> {{animation}} is {{an important}} area of computer graphics due to its numerous applications. However, so far an animation of fast moving <b>cloth</b> with multiple wrinkles {{has been difficult to}} make because of the <b>cloth</b> clump problem. <b>Cloth</b> clumps are the frozen areas where <b>cloth</b> pieces are clustered unnaturally- an obstacle in making a realistic <b>cloth</b> animation. Hence we present a novel <b>cloth</b> collision resolution algorithm which prevents clump formation during fast <b>cloth</b> motions. The goal of our resolution algorithm is to let <b>cloth</b> move swiftly without having any frozen <b>cloth</b> clumps, while preventing any cloth-cloth and rigid-cloth penetrations at any moment of a simulation. The non-penetration status of <b>cloth</b> is maintained without the formation of <b>cloth</b> clumps regardless of the speed of <b>cloth</b> motion. Our algorithm is based on a novel order in the resolution of <b>cloth</b> collisions. Our algorithm can be used with any <b>cloth</b> simulation approach such as spring-masses or finite elements. For the particular types of applications presented in this paper, we use a spring-mass system and we show several realistic simulations involving fast motions that are clump-free...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the mostly}} {{researched}} areas in computer graphic is wet <b>cloth</b> simulation. Where, {{there are many}} factors affecting <b>cloth</b> simulation. Among the challenges in simulating <b>cloth</b> is taking into consideration all these factors for example, wetting, internal and external forces. Thus, this study aims to achieve high realism wet <b>cloth</b> simulation, and take in consideration the forces that may affect the process of simulation. Mass Spring Model is the technique that proposed to simulate the wet <b>cloth</b> under the forces of wind and gravity. Initially, to produce the <b>cloth</b> sheet, a <b>cloth</b> structure is being constructed from a matrix of mass point connected by springs. Then, external and internal forces were applied on the <b>cloth</b> sheet. The internal forces represent {{the tension between the}} springs in forming the <b>cloth</b> particles. External forces are represented by wind and gravity. Next, wetting process is applied on the fabric particles. In wetting process, <b>cloth</b> absorbed a substantial amount of fluid which will then affect the physical properties and appearance. In the experiment, the amount of absorbed fluid is calculated using absorption equation, with increasing values of variable up to saturation level. It was observed that there are changes on <b>cloth</b> texture as the wetting increased. The color of <b>cloth</b> texture became darker with increasing wetting value. Highest concentration of texture color can be observed as the <b>cloth</b> reached the saturation level. Finally, wet <b>cloth</b> is being compared with dry <b>cloth</b> in terms of color, physical behavior and motion. The <b>cloth</b> has all the properties of wet <b>cloth</b> like in the real life where, it is appear heavier, darker color, appearance and physical behavior.

5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk <b>cloths</b> or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an {{irrigation}} channel by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with leeches, the water saved the group from dying of thirst.
