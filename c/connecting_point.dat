25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the <b>connecting</b> <b>point</b> of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit of the Old Man before tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge end position gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{south side}} of the {{concourse}} was used by Northeast Airlines until its 1972 merger with Delta Air Lines. Likewise, National Airlines flew out of the north side of Concourse F until its 1980 merger with Pan Am, which continued to use the concourse until its 1991 shutdown. When United Airlines acquired Pan Am's Latin American operations, the airline carried on operating a focus city out of Concourse F until completely dismantling it by 2004. From 1993 to 2004, Concourse F was also used by Iberia Airlines for its Miami focus city operation, which linked Central American capitals to Madrid using MIA as the <b>connecting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|Harmony, {{also known}} as Node 2, is {{the second of the}} station's node modules and the utility hub of the USOS. The module {{contains}} four racks that provide electrical power, bus electronic data, and acts as a central <b>connecting</b> <b>point</b> for several other components via its six Common Berthing Mechanisms (CBMs). The European Columbus and Japanese Kibō laboratories are permanently berthed to the starboard and port radial ports respectively. The nadir and zenith ports can be used for docking visiting spacecraft including HTV, Dragon, and Cygnus, with the nadir port serving as the primary docking port. American Shuttle Orbiters docked with the ISS via PMA-2, attached to the forward port.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport is}} Delta Air Lines' second-largest hub {{in terms of}} total operations. Detroit serves as the primary gateway to Asia for the Eastern United States for Delta and is also the third-busiest gateway to Europe for the airline. The airport is a major gateway for tourism in {{metropolitan}} Detroit {{and is one of}} SkyTeam's major Midwestern hubs. It is also the fourth-largest base for Spirit Airlines and is a major <b>connecting</b> <b>point</b> between the Eastern and the Western United States. Operated by the Wayne County Airport Authority, the airport has four main runways and two crosswind runways, two terminals, 129 in-service gates, and an on-site Westin Hotel and conference center connected to the A concourse. Detroit Metropolitan Airport has maintenance facilities capable of servicing and repairing aircraft as large as the Boeing 747-400.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} one of the largest in terms of cargo in the United States, and is the primary <b>connecting</b> <b>point</b> for cargo between Latin America and the world. Ninety-six {{different}} carriers are involved in shifting over two million tons of freight annually and ensuring the safe travel of over 40 million passengers, according to the Miami International Airport corporate brochure. It was first in International freight and third in total freight for 2008. In 2000, LAN Cargo opened up a major operations base at the airport and currently operates a large cargo facility at the airport. Most major passenger airlines, such as American Airlines use the airport to carry hold cargo on passenger flights, though most cargo is transported by all-cargo airlines. UPS Airlines and FedEx Express both base their major Latin American operations at MIA.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of Eastern's turmoil American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall sought a new hub in order to utilize new {{aircraft}} which AA had on order. AA studies indicated that Delta Air Lines would provide strong competition on most routes from Eastern's hub at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, but that MIA had many key routes only served by Eastern. American {{announced that it would}} establish a base at MIA in August 1988. Lorenzo considered selling Eastern's profitable Latin American routes to AA as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization of Eastern in early 1989, but backed out in a last-ditch effort to rebuild the MIA hub. The effort quickly proved futile, and American purchased the routes (including the route authority between Miami and London then held by Eastern sister company Continental Airlines) in a liquidation of Eastern which was completed in 1990. Later in the 1990s, American transferred more employees and equipment to MIA from its failed domestic hubs at Nashville, Tennessee and Raleigh–Durham, North Carolina. Today Miami is American's largest air freight hub and is the main <b>connecting</b> <b>point</b> in the airline's north–south international route network.|$|E

This miracle is unique among others that appear in the Canonical gospels, in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself.

The Transfiguration {{is one of the}} five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. In the New Testament, Transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the <b>connecting</b> <b>point,</b> acting as the bridge between heaven and earth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{constitutive}} {{property of}} soil, soil strength {{is generally considered}} as a difficult problem. This paper, by establishing the soil granular-structure model and using granules’connecting points to reflect the soil structure, analyzes the mechanical and fracture characteristics of the <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> of granules. 7 yield models are obtained in this paper. Through introduction {{of the concept of}} Vornornoi domain associated with the <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> of granules, the strength of granules’ <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> is transformed to the stress intensity in statistical domain. This is the basis for the analysis of the strength of structured soil in this paper. It's found that the stress intensity of soil {{is directly related to the}} connecting strength of granules and the distributional pattern of granules’ <b>connecting</b> <b>points.</b> When the family of stress intensity curves generated in the statistical domain are observed and studied as a point on a macroscopic scale, the conclusion that there are multiple yield surfaces can be naturally obtained. Theoretically, this solves the theoretical problems associated with multiple yield surfaces. Stress gradient may also affect soil strength, which cannot be explained by the past classical theories...|$|R
