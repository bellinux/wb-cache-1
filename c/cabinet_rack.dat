After an {{initial public offering}} in 1993, shares were traded on the NASDAQ exchange under symbol ASPX.One of the unique features of their systems was the ease with which volumes could be transparently mirrored and migrated between physical disks. Auspex systems used Functional Multiprocessing, essentially Asymmetric multiprocessing, that allowed the systems to scale functions independently -- such as networking, file processing, or storage processing. There was a Host Processor running Unix that controlled the whole system. This 'system within a system' could even be rebooted without interrupting file servicing!

Early models were housed in short (about 2 ft high) 19" [...] <b>rack</b> <b>cabinets</b> {{that would be}} set beside a desk or under a table. The DN300 and later DN330 were designed as integrated units with system and monitor in one unit and fit easily on a desk. Every Apollo system (even standalones) had to include at least one network interface. Originally the only option was the 12 Mbit/s Apollo Token Ring (ATR). Over time, 10 Mbit/s Ethernet was added as an option. It has been stated that the IBM Token Ring was an option - this was never available. The ATR was generally the best choice, since it was extremely scalable; whilst the Ethernet of the time suffered serious performance loss as extra machines {{were added to the}} network, this was not true of ATR, which could easily have over a hundred machines on one network. One drawback was that, unlike Ethernet, one machine failure (which could easily happen given a single faulty connector) stopped the entire network. For this reason, Apollo provided an optional (but strongly recommended) network cabling system of bypass switches and quick connect boxes which allowed machines to be disconnected and moved without problems. Apollo Token Ring networks used 75 ohm RG-6U coaxial cabling.|$|R
40|$|Rapid Granulator {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of granulators, which is a kind of grinder who grinds discarded plastics to granules which later can be reused when pressure molding plastics. The company wanted help in developing a new, or alternatively extending their previous, measurement equipment. The old equipment was hard to use, required changes in the code for different measurement scenarios and had a limited array of measuring quantities. Rapid had an idea of a similar concept only with a greater number of input ports, better range of applicable sensors and an advanced yet easy to use interface. The system is supposed to be placed at Rapid's test department where it will be used as a tool for finding faults and provide data which can be used for further development of the granulators. The project's members accepted the task and immediately began searching for suitable components for the system. After the search was completed a list of costs, limitations, sensors, I/O's and development environment was presented to Rapid's staff. In consultation with their staff some components were ordered, and the development team was asked to keep the system open for future upgrades. Some difficulties arose when shipment times which were promised to four weeks actually took six weeks. In the mean time the chassis of the measurement cart were constructed. One working day was spent at Rapid's workshop to assemble the <b>cabinets</b> with the <b>rack</b> and the wheelbase. LabVIEW arrived first and quite a lot of time was spent on getting acquainted to the program. When the parcel containing all the electronic material arrived, everything was mounted and the final stage involving programming and testing of the sensors and the measurement cart could commence. Tests with accelerometer, strain gauges and PT- 100 showed that the measurement unit worked. The sampled data acquired from the cart were compared to measurements made with calibrated instruments...|$|R
