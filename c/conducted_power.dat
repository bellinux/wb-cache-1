The feeble current which tends to be produced in the worse conductor, has its transmission favoured in the better conductor, and the stronger current which tends to form in the latter has its intensity diminished by the obstruction of the former; and the forces of generation and obstruction are so perfectly neutralize each other exactly.

To examine the significance of change in rates over time, a priori power calculations were computed for overall compliance with checklist statements. A previous multi-site study [19] found compliance rates prior to intervention of 34.2 % and post-intervention 56.7 % in a total sample of 7, 688, equating to an odds ratio (OR) of 2.52 (95 % CI 2.30 – 2.76).

40|$|Taiwan’s {{power system}} is {{isolated}} and {{not supported by}} other interconnected systems. Consequently, the system frequency immediately reflects changes in the system loads. Pumped storage units are crucial for controlling power frequency. These units provide main or auxiliary capacities, reducing the allocation of frequency-regulating reserve (FRR) and further reducing generation costs in system operations. Taiwan’s Longmen Nuclear Power Plant is set to be converted for commercial operations, which will significantly alter the spinning reserves in the power system.

40|$|Although the {{ultimate}} goal of most current fusion research is to build an economically attractive power plant, the present status of physics and technology does not provide the performance necessary to achieve this goal. Therefore, in order to model how such plants may operate and what their output might be, extrapolations must be made from existing experimental data and technology. However, the expected performance of a plant built to the operating point specifications can only ever be a 'best guess'. Extrapolations far beyond the current operating regimes are necessarily uncertain, and some important interactions, for example the coupling of <b>conducted</b> <b>power</b> from the scape-off layer to the divertor surface, lack reliable predictive models. This means both that the demands on plant systems at the target operating point can vary significantly from the nominal value, and that the overall plant performance may potentially fall short of design targets. In this contribution we discuss tools and techniques that have been developed to assess the robustness of the operating points for the EU-DEMO tokamak-based demonstration power plant, and the consequences for its design.

We used distance/detection information for autumn bobwhite coveys from 701 observer-mornings on 39 farms in the Upper Coastal Plain of Georgia to construct a global detection function (Uniform with cosine adjustment) using Program DISTANCE. We used simulation models to determine the expected coefficient of variation (CV) on density in relation to number of points sampled. We generated 1, 000 sets of random samples in increments of 10 at sample sizes of 10 - 1, 000. At each sample size we generated the respective number of observations from a Poisson distribution with λ = 0. 5 - 3. 0 and computed the density and associated statistics using the global detection function. We report the mean CV on covey density at each sample size. As expected, the CV on density decreased with increasing sample size and expected number of detections per point. Assuming sufficient observations to estimate the detection function, a CV on density < 15 % could be achieved with 50 points at densities with a mean detection of 1 covey/point or 20 points with a mean detection of 2 coveys/point.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak has focused {{on a range of}} scientific issues with particular emphasis on ITER needs and on detailed comparisons between experimental measurements and predictive models. Research on ICRF (ion cyclotron range of frequencies) heating emphasized the origins and mitigation of metallic impurities while work on lower hybrid current drive experiments have focused on linear and nonlinear wave interactions that limit efficiency at high densities in regimes with low single pass absorption. Experiments in core turbulence and transport focused on quantitative, multi-field comparisons between nonlinear gyro-kinetics simulations and experimental measurements of profiles, fluxes and fluctuations. Experiments into self-generated rotation observed spontaneous flow reversal at a critical density identical to the transition density between linear ohmic confinement and saturated ohmic confinement regimes. H-mode studies have measured pedestal widths consistent with kinetic-ballooning-mode-like instabilities, while the pedestal heights quantitatively match the EPED code predictions. Experiments with I-mode have increased the operating window for this promising edge-localized-mode-free regime. Extrapolation of I-mode to ITER suggests that the fusion gain Q ~ 10 could be possible in ITER. Investigations into the physics and scaling of the power exhaust channel width in attached enhanced D-alpha H-mode and L-mode plasma showed a direct connection between the midplane pressure-folding length and the outer divertor target footprint.

In support of the program's research and development (R and D) efforts, NREL has constructed state-of-the-art facilities at the NWTC where industry partners, universities, and other DOE laboratories can conduct tests and experiments to further advance wind technology. The latest facility to come online is the DOE-GE 1. 5 -MW wind turbine test platform. Working with DOE, NREL purchased and installed a GE 1. 5 -MW wind turbine at the NWTC in 2009.

40|$|Puff and pump' {{radiating}} divertor scenarios [1, 2] {{were applied}} to upper SN and DN H-mode plasmas. Under similar operating conditions, argon (Ar) accumulated in the main plasma of single-null (SN) plasmas more rapidly and reached a higher steady-state concentration when the B x {del}B ion drift direction was toward the divertor than when the B x {del}B ion drift direction {{was out of the}} divertor. The initial rate that Ar accumulated inside double-null (DN) plasmas was more than twice that of comparably-prepared SNs with the same B x {del}B direction. One way to reduce power loading at the divertor targets is to 'seed' the divertor plasma with impurities that radiatively reduce the <b>conducted</b> <b>power.</b> Studies have shown that the concentration of impurities in the divertor are increased by raising the flow of deuterium ions (D{sup +}) into the divertor by a combination of upstream deuterium gas puffing and active particle exhaust at the divertor targets, i. e., puff-and-pump. An enhanced D{sup +} particle flow toward the divertor targets exerts a frictional drag on impurities, and inhibits their escape from the divertor. A puff-and-pump approach using Ar as the impurity was successfully applied in recent DIII-D experiments to SN plasmas [3] while maintaining good H-mode performance. Studies on DIII-D and other tokamaks have shown that both the direction of the toroidal magnetic field B{sub T} and the degree of magnetic balance between divertors [i. e., {{the degree to which the}} plasma shape is considered SN or DN] are important factors in determining recycling and particle pumping [4, 5]. It is unclear whether the favorable results of Ref. [3] can be extended to cases with different magnetic balance and/or B{sub T} direction. We show in this paper that reversing the direction of B{sub T} or altering the divertor magnetic balance does have an impact on how plasmas behave under puff-and-pump conditions. Our study takes advantage of DIII-D's capabilities to actively pump SN and DN shapes with high-triangularity. In-vessel pumping of deuterium and Ar, shown schematically in Fig. 1, was done by cryopumps located inside the upper outer ('plus'), upper inner ('minus'), and lower outer (dotted) divertor pumping plenums. To increase the ion D{sup +} flow toward these pumps, deuterium gas was introduced at an outboard location, as shown. Argon was injected directly into the private flux region (PFR) of the upper outer divertor...|$|E

40|$|This U. S. Department of Energy GATEWAY Demonstration project {{studied the}} {{applicability}} of light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires for commercial parking garage applications. High-pressure sodium (HPS) area luminaires were replaced with new LED area luminaires. The project was supported under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solid State Lighting Program. Other participants in the demonstration project included Providence Portland Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, the Energy Trust of Oregon, and Lighting Sciences Group (LSG) Inc. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) conducted the measurements {{and analysis of the}} results. PNNL manages GATEWAY demonstrations for DOE and represents their perspective in the conduct of the work. Quantitative and qualitative measurements of light and electrical power were taken at the site for both HPS and LED light sources. Economic costs were estimated and garage users’ responses to the new light sources were gauged with a survey. Six LED luminaires were installed in the below-ground parking level A, replacing six existing 150 W HPS lamps spread out over two rows of parking spaces. Illuminance measurements were taken at floor level approximately every 4 ft on a 60 -ft x 40 -ft grid to measure light output of these LED luminaires which were termed the “Version 1 ” luminaires. PNNL <b>conducted</b> <b>power</b> measurements of the circuit in the garage to which the 6 luminaires were connected and determined that they drew an average of 82 W per lamp. An improved LED luminaire, Version 2, was installed in Level B of the parking garage. Illuminance measurements were not made of this second luminaire on site due to higher traffic conditions, but photometric measurements of this lamp and Version 1 were made in an independent testing laboratory and power usage for Version 2 was also measured. Version 1 was found to produce 3600 lumens and Version 2 was found to produce 4700 lumens of light and to consume 78 Watts. Maximum and minimum light levels were measured for the HPS and LED Version 1 luminaires and projected for the Version 2 luminaires. Maximum light levels were 23. 51 foot candles, 20. 54 fc, and 26. 7 fc respectively and minimum light levels were 1. 49 fc, 1. 45 fc, and 1. 88 fc. These results indicate very similar or even slightly higher light levels produced by the LED lamps, despite the higher lumen output of the HPS lamp. The LED lamps provide higher luminaire efficacy because all of the light is directed down and out. None of it is “lost” in the fixture. Also the HPS luminaire had poorly designed optics and a plastic covering that tended to get dirty and cracked, further decreasing the realized light output. [is this an accurate way to say this?] Consumer perceptions of the Version 2 LED were collected via a written survey form given to maintenance and security personnel. More than half felt the LED luminaires provided more light than the HPS lamps and a majority expressed a preference for the new lamps when viewing the relamped area through a security camera. Respondents commented that the LED luminaires were less glary, created less shadows, had a positive impact on visibility, and improved the overall appearance of the area. PNNL conducted an economic analysis and found that the Version 1 lamp produced annual energy savings of 955 kWh and energy cost savings of $ 76. 39 per lamp at electricity rates of 6. 5 cents per kWh and $ 105. 03 at 11 cents per kWh. PNNL found that the Version 2 lamp produced annual energy savings of 991 kWh and energy cost savings of $ 79. 26 per lamp at electricity rates of 6. 5 cents per kWh and $ 108. 98 at 11 cents per kWh. PNNL also calculated simple payback and found that Version 1 showed paybacks of 5. 4 yrs at 6. 5 c/kWh and 4. 1 yrs at 11 c/kWh while Version 2 showed paybacks of 5. 2 yrs at 6. 5 c/kWh and 3. 9 yrs at 11 c/kWh...|$|E
