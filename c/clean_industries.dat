40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} environmental performance on financial performance using the data of Japanese manufacturing firms from 2004 to 2008. As the environmental performance, our study considers the two different environmental issues of waste and greenhouse gas emissions in capturing the effects of corporate environmental management on financial performance. In addition, to clarify how each financial performance responds to a firm's effort in dealing with different environmental issues, we utilize many financial performance indices reflecting various market evaluations. Our estimation results show the different effects of each environmental performance on financial performance. Waste emissions do not generally have significant effects on financial performance. On the other hand, greenhouse gas reduction leads {{to an increase in}} financial performance in the whole sample and <b>clean</b> <b>industries,</b> although it does not have significant effects on financial performance in dirty industries. Furthermore, as the firm growth rate increases, the partial effects of waste emissions on financial performance decrease, whereas the partial effects of greenhouse gas emissions on financial performance increase.

40|$|The {{relocation}} of more polluting industries in poorer countries due to gaps in environmental standards {{is known as}} the pollution haven effect, whereby the scale and the composition of output change across countries. Changes in the composition of the output mix might translate into changes of comparative advantages across countries, as revealed by trade flows. This paper focus on this issue and looks at the changes of bilateral revealed comparative advantages (RCAs) in the last decade between China and the major fourteen EU countries (EU 14). Using industry level data on bilateral trade, air pollution, water pollution and several measures of environmental stringency, we find that, controlling for other factors that may have affected RCAs, such as labor costs, on average our EU 14 countries have kept or improved their advantages with respect to China in both water polluting industries (such as paper and agro-based industries) and air polluting industries (such as basic metals and chemicals), while they have lost competitiveness in the more <b>clean</b> <b>industries</b> (such as machinery and fabricated metals). revealed comparative advantages, environmental regulation, industrial pollution...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{work has been}} concerned on the studies and development of electrochemical polishing in the magnetic field (MEP) {{in comparison with the}} standard electropolishing methods performed without stirring (EP) and the process with the forced electrolyte mixing (MIX). Advanced techniques were used in the studies, to measure the effects of the surface treatment. They are as follows: scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), surface roughness, and nanoindentation measurements. For the corrosion studies, the electrochemical methods were used, such as: open circuit potential OCP, potentiodynamic curves PC, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS measurements. The MEP process is advised mainly due to the opportunity to enrich the surface layer with the chromium compounds (austenitic stainless steels), or titanium compounds (CP Ti Grade 2, Nitinol). The surface layers of biomaterials after MEP process contain much lower amount of carcinogenic compounds, like chromium VI oxidation stage (Cr 6 +) (austenitic stainless steels) and nickel compounds (austenitic stainless steel & Nitinol) versus those ones obtained after EP & MIX treatments. It is interesting that apart from the significant modification of the surface layer obtained after MEP, also mechanical properties, such as nanohardness, modulus of elasticity, and mechanical resistance to bending and torsion, undergo considerable advantageous changes. All they make the MEP process very promising for application in many <b>clean</b> <b>industries,</b> such as medical equipment and devices, electronics, food industry, etc...|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, we find strong {{evidence}} of the trade-induced scale-technique effect.

As opposed to the PHH studies (Antweiler et al. 2001; Cole and Elliott 2003; Managi et al. 2009), the trade-induced composition effect is not observed for the environmental efficiency. The reason for this {{may be that the}} trade-induced composition effect is smaller relative to the scale-technique effects and the direct composition effect as shown in Cole and Elliott (2003).|$|R

40|$|Accelerating U. S. {{clean energy}} innovation, manufacturing, and commercialization is an {{environmental}} necessity. Without new innovations and a robust {{clean energy technology}} policy, the United States {{will not be able}} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to needed levels, unless the price of GHGs rises to politically unsustainable levels. As important as these environmental objectives are, clean energy innovation is also an economic imperative. Investments in the global <b>clean</b> energy <b>industry</b> are expected to grow 25 percent to $ 200 billion in 2010 and are predicted to reach $ 600 billion by 2020. Government policy and public investment will be critical determinants of which countries become leaders in the race to attract that clean energy technology investment and the economic and job creation benefits these investments will bring. Unfortunately, the United States is lagging behind in this race, in part because it lacks an effective strategy to compete. Even if proposed carbon trading legislation becomes law, the resulting price on carbon will be too low and accompanying efficiency and renewable energy regulations will not be sufficient on their own to ensure that the United States catches up to countries like China in building the <b>clean</b> energy <b>industries</b> of the future. To regain leadership in the global <b>clean</b> energy <b>industry,</b> the United States must prioritize major public investments in clean energy technology and embrace bold new paradigms in clean energy innovation, education, production, and manufacturing. To this end, the reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act offers a critical opportunity to both strengthen and update U. S. clean energy innovation and competitiveness policies. Meeting this challenge, however, will require more than just an increase in funding for existing programs, as critical as these investments are. It will also require re-thinking how the federal government can foster innovation in the <b>clean</b> energy <b>industry,</b> from basic research to full scale commercialization...|$|R
