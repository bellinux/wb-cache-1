A master plan was established in 2009 by the CTRC that entailed their {{vision for the future}} of the terminal. In 2013 the CTRC announced the reuse plan for the terminal stating [...] "Although much work needs to be done to stabilize and prepare the complex for tenancy and other use, various groups have toured the complex and have expressed interest in becoming anchor tenants or partner developers utilizing a Public/Private Development concept." [...] Remedial measures and repairs, replacements and new technologies are part of the plan for the Center. Roof replacement is currently underway with an Energy Star compliant membrane being laid down and a solar Photovoltaic system being installed in the future. The Terminal is experiencing great in-kind development and services with local businesses and trade unions. Other immediate projects include restoration of the Guastavino Tile in the Main Concourse; Brownfields remediation plan and general utilities and improvements. The CTRC is looking forward to the additional historic restoration and remediation of all masonry and windows along with new systems for HVAC utilizing Green Technologies.Although the project does not rely on it happening, it is the ultimately the CTRC’s hope that, with the reuse of the Terminal, rail traffic will also be forthcoming whether starting with interest in the possible reuse of Buffalo’s legendary Belt Line; local light rail expansion and the future of the Terminal’s reuse as a <b>connector</b> <b>hub</b> for possible high-speed rail. The Central Terminal Restoration Corporation, in cooperation with local, state, and federal government representatives, are working to position the Terminal to be Buffalo's high-speed rail station as well as the potential return of Amtrak service. [...] Buffalo, New York is part of the Empire Corridor, one of only ten Federally designated high-speed rail corridors in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Neuroimaging {{and patient}} {{studies show that}} {{different}} areas of cortex respectively specialize for general and selective, or category-specific, semantic processing. Why are there both semantic hubs and category-specificity, and how come that they emerge in different cortical regions? Can the activation time-course of these areas be predicted and explained by brain-like network models? In this present work, we extend a neurocomputational model of human cortical function to simulate the time-course of cortical processes of understanding meaningful concrete words. The model implements frontal and temporal cortical areas for language, perception, and action along with their connectivity. It uses Hebbian learning to semantically ground words in aspects of their referential object- and action-related meaning. Compared with earlier proposals, the present model incorporates additional neuroanatomical links supported by connectivity studies and downscaled synaptic weights {{in order to control}} for functional between-area differences purely due to the number of in- or output links of an area. We show that learning of semantic relationships between words and the objects and actions these symbols are used to speak about, leads to the formation of distributed circuits, which all include neuronal material in <b>connector</b> <b>hub</b> areas bridging between sensory and motor cortical systems. Therefore, these <b>connector</b> <b>hub</b> areas acquire a role as semantic hubs. By differentially reaching into motor or visual areas, the cortical distributions of the emergent ‘semantic circuits’ reflect aspects of the represented symbols’ meaning, thus explaining category-specificity. The improved connectivity structure of our model entails a degree of category-specificity even in the ‘semantic hubs’ of the model. The relative time-course of activation of these areas is typically fast and near-simultaneous, with semantic hubs central to the network structure activating before modality-preferential areas carrying semantic information...|$|E

However, it remains largely unknown about categories of structural brain hubs and their microstructural, functional and cognitive characteristics {{as well as}} contributions to individual identification. Here, we employed three multi-modal imaging data sets with structural MRI, diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI to construct individual structural brain networks, identify brain hubs based on eight commonly used graph-nodal metrics, and perform comprehensive validation analysis. We found three categories of structural hubs in the brain networks, namely, aggregated, distributed and <b>connector</b> <b>hubs.</b> Spatially, these distinct categories of hubs were primarily located in the default-mode system and additionally in the visual and limbic systems for aggregated hubs, in the frontoparietal system for distributed hubs, and in the sensorimotor and ventral attention systems for <b>connector</b> <b>hubs.</b> Importantly, these three categories of hubs exhibited various distinct characteristics, with {{the highest level of}} microstructural organization in the aggregated hubs, the largest wiring cost and topological vulnerability in the distributed hubs, and the highest functional associations and cognitive flexibility in the <b>connector</b> <b>hubs,</b> although they behaved better regarding these characteristics compared to non-hubs. Finally, all three categories of hub indices displayed high across-session spatial similarities and acted as a structural fingerprint with high predictive rates (100 %, 100 % and 84. 2 %) for individual identification. Collectively, our findings highlighted three categories of brain hubs with differential microstructural, functional and cognitive associations, which may shed light on the topological mechanisms of the human connectome.

40|$|Neurons in {{the brain}} are known to operate under a careful balance of {{excitation}} and inhibi-tion, which maintains neural microcircuits within the proper operational range. How this bal-ance is played out at the mesoscopic level of neuronal populations is, however, less clear. In order to address this issue, here we use a coupled neural mass model to study computa-tionally the dynamics {{of a network of}} cortical macrocolumns operating in a partially synchro-nized, irregular regime. The topology of the network is heterogeneous, with a few of the nodes acting as <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> while the rest are relatively poorly connected. Our results show that in this type of mesoscopic network excitation and inhibition spontaneously segre-gate, with some columns acting mainly in an excitatory manner while some others have pre-dominantly an inhibitory effect on their neighbors. We characterize the conditions under which this segregation arises, and relate the character of the different columns with their to-pological role within the network.

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} that theta burst {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TBS) over frontal eye fields (FEF) {{can be used to}} affect reversibly the saccadic behavior in monkeys performing a cognitive task. There are no studies, however, that integrate this approach with theoretical modeling and brain-wide functional measurements. Such an approach opens opportunities to investigate the role of FEF in large scale networks and to link network properties with behavior. Our FEF model was based on that of Heinzle et al. (2007) with canonical circuit networks and integrate-and-fire neurons. We simulated the model’s behavior in a double-target saccade task with variable target onset-asynchrony combined with TBS. The specifics of the simulation were implemented through the following hypotheses: (h 1) Unilateral TBS is changing inter- and intra- hemispheric functional connectivity; the inter-hemispheric changes determine the specificity of the behavioral effects. (h 2) TBS is affecting fixation neurons causing a reduction in response time (Gerits et al, 2011). (h 3) Attentional biases in saccade preferences are determined by pre-target-onset firing (Lauwereyns et al, 2002) of the neurons in layer 2 / 3, and TBS is correcting them. To validate the model, we used two experimental approaches. First, we tested macaque monkeys (N= 4) with the same double-target task combined with offline TBS. This allowed comparing TBS effects, model vs. monkey, on choice preferences and performance. Second, to see how TBS is affecting functional connectivity in brain networks (h 1), we performed a resting state (RS) fMRI experiment combined with offline TBS (N= 2). The experimental and the modeling results were consistent, and confirmed the hypotheses. Unilateral TBS over FEF reduced the intra- and inter- hemispheric RS connectivity (h 1). The inter-hemispheric changes in connectivity were correlated with the observed shifts in saccadic choices. The monkeys showed a bias in dual target choice preferences, and TBS over left or right FEF corrected the bias. The implementation of the bias (h 3) made the model behave the same as the monkey. Finally, the reduction of the reaction time is similar in monkeys and model, provided that TBS is affecting fixation neurons (h 2). TBS over FEF elicit long-range functional connectivity reduction consistent with the fact that FEF is a <b>connector</b> <b>hub</b> (Sporns et al, 2007). Modeling showed that the bias correction is generated by the interaction between saccadic eye movements and attention, where the latter is driving the effects. The model allows us to make new predictions to test in electrophysiology (h 3) and neuroimaging (TBS induced change in fMRI activations). status: publishe...|$|E

We compile a selection of widely used and newly developed network properties and apply these to analyse the structure and spread characteristics of the directed and weighted global cargo ship network (GCSN).

While previous research has attempted to localise intelligence in circumscribed brain regions, more recent work focuses on functional interactions between regions. However, even though brain networks are characterised by substantial modularity, {{it is unclear whether}} and how the brain&#x 2019;s modular organisation is associated with general intelligence. Modelling subject-specific brain network graphs from functional MRI resting-state data (N&#x 2009;=&#x 2009; 309), we found that intelligence was not associated with global modularity features (e. g., number or size of modules) or the whole-brain proportions of different node types (e. g., <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> or provincial hubs). In contrast, we observed characteristic associations between intelligence and node-specific measures of within- and between-module connectivity, particularly in frontal and parietal brain regions that have previously been linked to intelligence. We propose that the connectivity profile of these regions may shape intelligence-relevant aspects of information processing. Our data demonstrate that not only region-specific differences in brain structure and function, but also the network-topological embedding of fronto-parietal as well as other cortical and subcortical brain regions is related to individual differences in higher cognitive abilities, i. e., intelligence...|$|R

One data set was used to define the network nodes and modular structure, the other data set was used to investigate the effects of emotional versus neutral stimuli on network connectivity. Emotional relative to neutral stimuli increased connectivity between 74 nodes belonging to different networks. Most of these nodes belonged to an extended default mode network (eDMN). The other nodes belonged to a cognitive control network or visual networks. Within the eDMN, posterior STG/TPJ regions were identified as provincial hubs.

40|$|Psychedelic {{drugs have}} a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed {{interest}} in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key <b>connector</b> <b>hubs,</b> enabling a state of unconstrained cognition...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in network theory have {{allowed for the}} study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood).

However, most graph-based methods {{suffer from a}} fundamental resolution limit that may have affected previous studies and prevented detection of modules, or "communities", that are smaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function rooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied to brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules (Nicolini and Bifone, 2016), in contrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to binary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain regions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of Surprise, {{for the study of}} weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate this approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular structure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection methods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of small modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such as those observed in fMRI data. We apply our novel approach to functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experiments, and demonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of clusters spanning multiple scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the identification of <b>connector</b> <b>hubs,</b> the brain regions responsible for the integration of the different network elements, showing that the improved resolution afforded by Asymptotical Surprise leads to a different classification compared to current methods...|$|R

While focal brain lesions lead to very specific cognitive deficits, suggesting a modular structure, other focal lesions can have a widespread impact on cognition, suggesting that some cognitive processes emerge from interactions between many brain regions that are not functionally organized as modules. Thus, how information is functionally segregated yet integrated across modules remains an open question.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{architectural}} {{organization of}} protein structures {{has been the}} focus of intense research since it can hopefully lead to an understanding of how proteins fold. In earlier works we had attempted to identify the inherent structural organization in proteins through a study of protein topology. We obtained a modular partitioning of protein structures with the modules correlating well with experimental evidence of early folding units or "foldons". Residues that connect different modules were shown to be those that were protected during the transition phase of folding. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we follow the topological path of ubiquitin through molecular dynamics unfolding simulations. We observed that the use of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could lead to the identification of the transition state during unfolding. Additionally, our earlier contention that the modules uncovered through our graph partitioning approach correlated well with early folding units was vindicated through our simulations. Moreover, residues identified from native structure as <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> and which had been shown to be those that were protected during the transition phase of folding were indeed more stable (less flexible) well beyond the transition state. Further analysis of the topological pathway suggests that the all pairs shortest path in a protein is minimized during folding. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that treating a protein native structure as a network by having amino acid residues as nodes and the non-covalent interactions among them as links allows for the rationalization of many aspects of the folding process. The possibility to derive this information directly from 3 D structure opens the way to the prediction of important residues in proteins, while the confirmation of the minimization of APSP for folding allows for the establishment of a potentially useful proxy for kinetic optimality in the validation of sequence-structure predictions...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{perturbation}} of the hippocampus, {{one of the}} <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> in the brain, is a key step in the pathophysiological {{cascade of}} transient global amnesia (TGA). We tested the hypothesis that network efficiency, meaning the efficiency of information exchange over a network, is impaired during the acute stage of TGA. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to resting-state EEG data collected from 21 patients with TGA. The EEG data were obtained twice, once during the acute stage (2 months after symptom onset) of TGA. Characteristic path lengths and clustering coefficients of functional networks constructed using phase-locking values were computed and normalized {{as a function of}} the degree in the delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma frequency bands of the EEG. We investigated whether the normalized characteristic path length (nCPL) and normalized clustering coefficients (nCC) differed significantly between the acute and resolved stages of TGA at each frequency band using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For networks where the nCPL or nCC differed significantly between the two stages, we also evaluated changes in the connections of the brain networks. During the acute stage of TGA, the nCPL of the theta band networks with mean degrees of 8, 8. 5, 9 and 9. 5 significantly increased (P < 0. 05). During the acute stage, the lost edges for these networks were mostly found between the anterior (frontal and anterior temporal) and posterior (parieto-occipital and posterior temporal) brain regions, whereas newly developed edges were primarily found between the left and right frontotemporal regions. The nCC of the theta band with a mean degree of 5. 5 significantly decreased during the acute stage (P < 0. 05). Our results indicate that TGA deteriorates the network efficiency of the theta frequency band. This effect might be related to the desynchronization between the anterior and posterior brain areas...|$|R

For this analysis, the full network was decomposed along the three anatomical axes, resulting in three networks that describe the connectivity within the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral and laminar dimensions. The rostrocaudal network had a connection density of 12 % and a path length of 2. 4. The dorsoventral network had a high cluster coefficient (0. 53), a relatively high path length (1. 62) and a rich club was identified. The modularity analysis revealed three modules in the dorsoventral network. The laminar network contained most information. The laminar dimension revealed a network with high clustering coefficient (0. 47), a relatively high path length (2. 11) and four significantly increased characteristic network building blocks (structural motifs). Thirteen rich club nodes were identified, almost all of them situated in the parahippocampal region. Six <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> were detected and all of them were located in the entorhinal cortex. Three large modules were revealed, indicating a close relationship between the perirhinal and postrhinal cortex as well as between the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex. These results confirmed the central position of the entorhinal cortex in the (para) hippocampal network and this possibly explains why pathology in this region has such profound impact on cognitive function, as seen in several brain diseases. The results also have implications for the idea of strict separation of the "spatial" and the "non-spatial" information stream into the hippocampus. This two-stream memory model suggests that the information influx from, respectively, the postrhinal-medial entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal-lateral entorhinal cortex is separate, but the current analysis shows that this apparent separation is not determined by anatomical constraints...|$|R

After gaining a multidimensional grasp of the structural characteristics of the networks, we discuss {{their relationship with the}} location of concentrations of cutting-edge industries and with their growth. Specifically, we introduced certain network analysis methods and conducted quantitative analysis of health care-related industries in the Kinki (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe) economic zone and the semiconductor industry in the northern Kyushu economic zone. As a result, we verified first that the networks in both regions and fields have the characteristics of 'small-world' networks; second, that within both networks there exist numerous modules in groupings of varying sizes, and that these have a loosely bound structure; third, that the groups of firms in same business fields within the health care-related industries in the Kinki region form tight horizontally linked modules, while among the system LSI and other semiconductor industries in northern Kyushu there is a mixture of modules formed by individual core manufacturers' vertically segmented keiretsu and horizontal collaboration, and differences in architecture between the two types were perceived; fourth, that there is a high degree of unity in the network within each discrete block-area economic zone; and fifth, that by means of microanalysis in which we observed the major nodes, we established that the core firms, research universities, trading companies, etc., in industrial fields act as <b>connector</b> <b>hubs</b> of the networks. In these two regions characterized by the remarkable concentration and growth of industries in cutting-edge fields, wide-area networks have been formed in a manner adapted for the rapid exchange and melding of information and knowledge, joint business activity, and industry-university collaboration. This indicates the possibility that excellent networks contribute to the nurturing of cutting-edge industries. In addition, in similar large-scale, cutting-edge industries, network structures differ according to the core industrial fields and regional characteristics. Policy efforts aimed at extending networks could be more effective if they were based on these structural characteristics. ...|$|R

These inter-regional networks have previously been analyzed {{in terms of their}} node degree, structural motif, path length and clustering coefficient distributions. In this paper we focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns, while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) <b>hubs</b> or <b>connector</b> (inter-cluster) <b>hubs,</b> and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification of putative hub regions in brain networks on the basis of multiple network attributes and charts potential links between the structural embedding of such regions and their functional roles...|$|R
5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The <b>connector</b> and transport <b>hub</b> were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|R
40|$|Recent miRNA {{transfection}} experiments show {{strong evidence}} that miRNAs influence not only their target but also non-target genes; the precise mechanism of the extended regulatory effects of miRNAs remains to be elucidated. A hypothetical two-layer regulatory network in which transcription factors (TFs) function as important mediators of miRNA-initiated regulatory effects was envisioned, and a comprehensive strategy was developed to map such miRNA-centered regulatory cascades. Given gene expression profiles after miRNA-perturbation, along with putative miRNA–gene and TF–gene regulatory relationships, highly likely degraded targets were fetched by a non-parametric statistical test; miRNA-regulated TFs and their downstream targets were mined out through linear regression modeling. When applied to 53 expression datasets, this strategy discovered combinatorial regulatory networks centered around 19 miRNAs. A tumor-related regulatory network was diagrammed as an example, with the important tumor-related regulators TP 53 and MYC playing <b>hub</b> <b>connector</b> roles. A web server is provided for query and analysis of all reported data in this article. Our results reinforce the growing awareness that non-coding RNAs may play key roles in the transcription regulatory network. Our strategy {{could be applied to}} reveal conditional regulatory pathways in many more cellular contexts...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} complex systems have a {{hierarchical}} modular organization {{originated in the}} early 1960 s and has recently attracted fresh support from quantitative studies of large scale, reallife networks. Here we investigate the hierarchical modular (or “modules-within-modules”) decomposition of human brain functional networks, measured using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} in 18 healthy volunteers under no-task or resting conditions. We used a customized template to extract networks with more than 1800 regional nodes, and we applied a fast algorithm to identify nested modular structure at several hierarchical levels. We used mutual information, 0 < I < 1, to estimate the similarity of community structure of networks in different subjects, and to identify the individual network that is most representative of the group. Results show that human brain functional networks have a hierarchical modular organization with a fair degree of similarity between subjects, I = 0. 63. The largest five modules at the highest level of the hierarchy were medial occipital, lateral occipital, central, parieto-frontal and fronto-temporal systems; occipital modules demonstrated less sub-modular organization than modules comprising regions of multimodal association cortex. <b>Connector</b> nodes and <b>hubs,</b> with a key role in inter-modular connectivity, were also concentrated in association cortica...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{characterized as}} both a membrane probe and a bone ultrafiltration probe has been developed to enable in vivo sampling of interstitial fluid in bone. The probe {{makes it possible to}} measure the concentration of calcium and other constituents of the fluid that may be relevant to bone physiology. The probe could be especially helpful in experimental studies of microgravitational bone loss and of terrestrial bone-loss disease states, including osteoporosis. The probe can be implanted in the bone tissue of a living animal and can be used to extract samples of the interstitial bone fluid from time to time during a long-term study. The probe includes three 12 -cm-long polyacrylonitrile fibers configured in a loop form and attached to polyurethane tubing [inside diameter 0. 025 in. (0. 64 mm), outside diameter 0. 040 in. (1 mm) ]; the attachment is made by use of a 1 -cm-long connecting piece of polyurethane tubing [inside diameter 0. 035 0. 003 in. (0. 89 0. 08 mm), outside diameter 0. 060 0. 003 in. (1. 52 0. 08 mm) ]. At the distal end, a 2 -cm-long piece of polyurethane tubing of the same inner and outer diameters serves as a <b>connector</b> to a <b>hub.</b> A 1 -cm long piece of expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) tubing over the joint between the fibers and the connecting tubing serves as a tissue-in-growth site...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of fractures of the humerus has increased exponentially in recent years. The most used classifications for humerus fracture are morphological (Neer), biological (AO/ASIF) and descriptive (Hertel). The types of surgical treatment for humerus fracture include prosthetic replacement and synthesis using different devices, including the Tension Guide Fixator (TGF), Gex-Fix. External fixation for displaced proximal humeral fractures avoids dissection and soft tissue stripping {{and has been}} reported by some authors {{to be associated with}} higher union rates, a lower {{incidence of}} avascular necrosis, less scarring of the scapulohumeral interface, and faster rehabilitation compared with open reduction and internal fixation. Other authors have reported that external fixation does not ensure acceptable reduction and fracture stability, particularly in patients with osteoporosis. The external fixation technique involves the introduction of Steinmann's pin to keep manual reduction, the introduction of two K-wires in the humeral head, the removal of the Steinmann's pin, and the introduction of two fiches on the humeral shaft. <b>Hub</b> <b>connectors</b> are mounted on the wires and on the chips to connect the outer bar and tensioning system. A total of 84 patients aged 42 - 84 years with proximal end humeral fractures (66 % had two-part fractures) were treated with Fixator TGF in this study from December 2007 to June 2012. The postoperative recovery was earlier and the active-assisted motion was less painful than has been reported with other surgical techniques. The TGF was removed without anaesthesia at the outpatient clinic at a mean of 7 weeks (range 5 - 8 weeks) after surgery, and there was no loss of reduction or secondary displacement after removal. These results, after five years of experience, confirm that the best indication for this fixator is two- or three-part fractures because the device enables early active mobilisation. The limitations of this fixator are evident in fractures in which closed reduction is not possible and in three-part fractures with varus displacement because the TGF has less stability than other systems, such as the plate or cage. The short learning curve, reduced surgical time and risk, and low cost encourage the use of this technique...|$|R
