It is the first system able to process Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in continuous mode. The Plant is able to process up to 40.000 tons per year without previous selection, and the system has been internationally patented by ECOHISPÁNICA. The process just applies water steam, pressure, temperature, and some internal movement... In about 20 minutes, {{the main part of}} the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the <b>calorific</b> <b>power</b> is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner. The advantages of this technology are really impressive: It makes possible the goal of zero landfill, the volume of the garbage is reduced more than 80%, the operational costs are significantly reduced, no emissions, the employees work in very clean conditions, it increases a lot the efficiency in respect to other technologies, and is very fast (20 minutes are enough). The Plant of ECOHISPÁNICA is in the city of Rivas Vaciamadrid (Madrid), one of the most prestigious cities in Spain in environment and new technologies. Visits from more than 80 countries have been received in the Plant in the last 2 years. ECOHISPÁNICA is releasing the Waste Cleaner to the world market, and installation of Plants in China, USA, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Brazil, Ghana and Spain is programmed for 2016 and 2017.|$|E

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of energy}} and woody biomass of the cerrado was studied in function of the diameter at 30 cm above the soil. Sampling was made in 10 plots of 20 x 50 m {{in an area of}} 63. 54 ha of sensu strictu cerrado. The individuals were identified for each species and classified in seven diameter classes, three individuals by class and species, were randomly sampled, weighed in the field and samples collected for determination of the <b>calorific</b> <b>power.</b> On average, 673 individuals/ha were found, a total of 42, 762 individuals in the whole studied area, distributed in 47 species. The mean dried biomass, in the studied area was 12. 39 ton/ha. The biomass was constituted of 30 % on average of bark. When the biomass production per area (kg/ha) was analyzed in relation to the diameter classes, there was increase from the first to the second class and then a decrease, until the last class. The amount of energy (kcal/individual) and the amount of biomass produced when plotted {{as a function of the}} diameter presented similar trends, for wood, as for the bark, and  was represented by a quadratic equation of the type y = a - bx + cx 2, with R 2 superior  to 0, 86. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{wood for}} energy {{purposes}} {{is common in}} Brazil, motivated mainly by the diversity of species that present a potential for energy production. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of tree age and spacing on the energy properties of different components of the biomass: wood, bark, and branch of the species Ateleia glazioviana Baill, distributed at different spacings: 2. 0 × 1. 0 m, 2. 0 × 1. 5 m, 3. 0 × 1. 0 m, and 3. 0 × 1. 5 m in the 1 st, 3 rd, and 5 th year after the planting. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The following variables were determined: biomass (BIO), gross <b>calorific</b> <b>power</b> (GCV), basic density (BD), energy productivity (EP), energy density (ED), fixed carbon content (FCC), volatile material content (VMC), and ash content (AC). Different tree ages significantly affected all analyzed variables, increasing the distribution of BIO, EP, AC, BD, and ED with no tendency to stabilize over time. The four tree spacings induced different levels of BIO and EP, with a trend toward lower values with increasing tree spacing for all assessed periods. The four components of the trees had a significant effect on the variables BIO, EP, GCV, FCC, VMC, and AC...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{attempts}} {{to demonstrate the}} influence of resources used in electric energy production on effects achieved in environmental protection. The analysis uses the generalized least squares method which allows for estimation of econometric model demonstrating environmental effects in a thermal power plant. Environmental effects are reflected by the levels of main air pollutants: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dusts, quantity of generated waste, quantity of sewage and water used. The main energy production raw material is coal which is characterized by specific parameters such as: <b>calorific</b> <b>power,</b> i. e. combustion temperature and calorific value, ash content, sulphur content and other trace elements. The analysis is {{based on data from}} one of the Polish power plants located in Silesian Voivodeship. Environmental threats are becoming one of the major concerns in industry today. Power industry belongs among branches whose environmental impact is particularly negative. The main source of pollution in Polish and European power plants is hard coal and lignite, both of which are used as fuel. Proper prevention or dealing with environmental threats is the key element of a power plant management system. We analyse the influence of use of hard coal on the level of environmental effects. The analysis presents multi-equation models describing the relationship between parameters of hard coal and given environmental effects...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARYThe {{worldwide}} {{consumption of}} wood is distributed between the energy necessities, firewood and charcoal (more than 50 %), the sawmill wood, posts, dismount and construction (20 %) and the {{dedicated to the}} industry of the cellulose and the paper (27 %). The world previsions for the wood consumption in the year 2000 surpasses the 4000 m 3 millions, what supposes a shortage of 1000 millions. There is a shortage {{in the world of}} wood as of energy, what converts to the forest production in priority objective. The Eucalyptus has been {{and is one of the}} forests resources industrially more used in the entire world. Originated from Australia, it presents an enormous diversity, with more than 600 different species. Its wood is suitable for many uses: domestic consumption, firewood of high <b>calorific</b> <b>power,</b> charcoal production, building structures, posts for communications, parquet ground, cellulose pulp, mine wood, bank subjection, or for fiber board manufacture. From its cellulose multiple products of daily use can be made for example: health paper swaddling clothes and hygienic, derived products as the cellophane or the wrapping paper, formic and other sheets, special papers, filters, electronic papers; as well as manufacture of textile fabrics as “rayon”. The request of derivation products of the eucalyptus wood is still very high world wide, the one that shows a sustained growth...|$|E
40|$|Storage and {{transport}} of hydrogen constitutes a {{key enabling technology}} for {{the advent of a}} hydrogen-based energy transition. Main research trends on hydrogen storage materials, including metal hydrides, porous adsorbents and hydrogen clathrates, are reviewed with a focus on recent developments and an appraisal of the challenges ahead. 1 Setting the scene Water! cried Pencroft, water as a fuel for steamers and engines! Water to heat water! Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements, replied Cyrus Harding, and decomposed doubtless, by electricity (…) Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as a fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light (…) Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous <b>calorific</b> <b>power.</b> There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants (…) I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the future. I should like to see that, observed the sailor. You were born too soon, Pencroft, returned Neb, who only took part in the discussion by these words...|$|E
