5000|$|In October 2000, Rosensaft {{expressed}} his utter disillusionment with Arafat. “We believed him,” Rosensaft {{wrote in the}} Washington Post, [...] "when {{he said that he}} and the PLO were committed to a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believed him when he proclaimed an end to terrorism. We were wrong[...] [...] [...] Of course the Palestinians were entitled to self-determination - even independence—but only on terms of mutual respect. The Palestinians’ claims of nationhood could not stand separate and apart from their acknowledgment that Israelis are entitled to precisely the same rights. Arafat and his colleagues gave lip service to these lofty sentiments. We believed them. We were wrong[...] [...] [...] Perhaps, in time, the Palestinians will realize that a different leader will better serve them and their cause. Perhaps they will realize that stabbing and stomping Israeli soldiers to death and then parading their mutilated bodies in an obscene triumph is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century. Perhaps. But then, we also believe in the eventual arrival of the Messiah. In the meantime, those of us who wanted so desperately to see Arafat as a positive, <b>constructive</b> <b>presence</b> of any kind must reiterate over and over again: We were wrong.” ...|$|E

40|$|We tend {{to think}} of prophetic {{proclamation}} simply in terms of prophecies of doom or judgement and salvation or promise. Jeremiah is often regarded as a prophet of doom with rarely any positive proclamation. This view is contested by contending that Jeremiah was also a prophet of realism. He did not shy away from proclaiming prophecies of judgement but also embraced Yahweh�s promises of restoration. Jeremiah�s brief was to proclaim messages that will �pluck up� and �break down� and �overthrow�, but also �to build� and �to plant� (Jr 1 : 10). As much as this is true of Jeremiah�s ministry, the focus of this article is on a neglected aspect of his prophetic ministry namely �prophetic realism�. Jeremiah 29 : 4 � 7 is an example of prophetic realism as the prophet pastorally pays attention to the people of Judah in exile, calling on them to exercise patience whilst in exile and to contribute positively to their exilic society. This they should do whilst still holding onto Yahweh�s promises. Amongst the many confusing prophetic voices to the exiles, Jeremiah�s message is one of realism calling for patience, but also for <b>constructive</b> <b>presence</b> in their situation. Whilst Jeremiah�s message exudes prophetic realism, he still emphasises that Yahweh�s promise of restoration will play out in time (Jr 29 : 10 � 14). Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: Traditionally prophecy is either regarded as judgement or promise. An argument is promoted for a third category of prophetic realism. This view is not only relevant for Old Testament science, but also for the disciplines of Systematic and Practical Theology. Jeremiah�s prophetic realism compels researchers to broaden their views on what prophecy entails. </object...|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} importance {{is the difference}} between traditional Zulu attitudes toward parents and ancestors and those typically held by Europeans. Heidegger postulated that to be human is to find oneself thrown into a world with no clear logical, ontological, or moral structure. In Zulu culture, Hellinger found a certitude and equanimity that were the hallmarks of Heidegger's elusive authentic Self. The traditional Zulu people lived and acted in a religious world in which the ancestors were the central focal point.

40|$|Thank you, Jan, {{and good}} morning. What a fantastic and {{powerful}} day we had yesterday. It’s such {{a joy to}} be with kindred spirits. In her essay, “The Crisis in Education ” (1958), Hannah Arendt wrote: “Education is {{the point at which}} we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it…And education, too, is where we decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from our world … nor to strike from their hands their chance of undertaking something unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance for the task of renewing a common world. ” Jan framed our Colloquium around building a “new ” scientific mind—a mind that consciously reasons and behaves its way into creating a sustained <b>constructive</b> human <b>presence</b> on the earth. This presence is not only manifested by “scientific and social literacy, but by ecological integrity, economic vitality and social equity ” (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2005). As an educator, this grounds my work in a social and cognitive context of generative and restorative learning—in wholeness, interconnections, stewardship and life-affirming design, and it creates the imperative to love our children enough that we ignite and nurture what I’m calling “decidedly different,” “both/and ” scientific minds prepared for the task of renewing a common world ” (Arendt) ...|$|R
40|$|In-mass {{presence}} of Muslims in Europe dates back several decades ago, after Second World War; a presence {{which has been}} intricate since the beginning. After many years, Europe-born generations of Muslim immigrants are yet facing the very same question as their parents: How to identify themselves in Christian/secular European societies; how to be neither submissive nor self-alienated as a Muslim in contemporary Europe. Besides, recent hostile incidents in Europe have once again sharpened public opinion upon Muslims (residing) in Europe. Some scholars have suggested a third path to Muslims, known by some as Euro-Islamic identity, as a route to a <b>constructive</b> and pleasant <b>presence</b> while still connected to their religious thoughts/background. The chief objective in current study was to (i) discuss the theoretical ground for such an hybrid identity (ii) introduce individuals as real examples of that and (iii) characterize the concept by deep interview of the individuals. Hermeneutic principles in understanding a text, nominalism and Wittgenstein family resemblance, core message of Islam and civil rights in Europe are the main concepts this work appealed to, in order to found its theoretical ground. Two Muslim individuals were deep interviewed; a Swede convert and a second generation Muslim with Pakistani roots. Accordingly, the study concluded six features as discerning characteristics of their Islam - permissiveness, reference to fundamentals, societal concerns, tolerance, art-friendly and hybridity - and delineated how the theoretical ground provided a field for such a reading of Islam to come to life...|$|R
40|$|The {{insurance}} industry {{can play a}} material role in decreasing the vulnerability of developing countries and economies in transition to weather-related natural disasters while simultaneously supporting both its own market-based objectives and the objectives of sustainable development. Although insurance is not a "silver bullet" for the problems posed by natural disasters in emerging markets, public-private partnerships can enhance insurance's ability to spread the risks and manage the costs of weather-related disasters {{as well as to}} increase the pool of people who have access to coverage. (For simplicity in this report, the phrase "emerging markets" is intended to encompass developing countries and economies in transition.) Promising strategies for emerging markets involve establishing innovative products and systems for delivering insurance and using technologies and practices that both reduce vulnerability to disaster-related insurance losses and support sustainable development (including reducing greenhouse gas emissions). These strategies can enhance sustainable development efforts and increase the insurability of risks, making insurance markets in emerging markets more viable. Emerging markets are especially vulnerable to extreme weather events, which impede development by causing physical damage, compromising human and ecosystem health, diverting scarce resources to disaster relief and recovery, and deterring future investment and insurance availability by amplifying the risks faced by foreign interests. An average of 300 million people are affected or killed each year by weather-related disasters in emerging markets. Characteristics of emerging markets contributing to their particular vulnerability in contrast to developed nations include: greater frequency of poverty; weaker lifelines (transportation, communication, utilities, emergency response, and hospitals); poorer quality of construction and absence of or deficiencies in building codes and other regulations; and high dependence on resource-based industries (e. g., agriculture). Natural disasters such as drought often dislocate large groups of people, amplifying their vulnerability to future disasters. Development itself can compound these vulnerabilities by promoting population growth, urbanization, intensive coastal development, and concentrations of climate-sensitive physical and health-related hazards. With its pool of financial reserves, the global insurance market provides considerable adaptive capacity for weather-related damage to property, life, and health. The global insurance market [...] perhaps the world's largest industry [...] represented $ 2. 9 trillion in premiums in 2003, or approximately eight percent of global gross domestic product (GDP). To put this in perspective, the {{insurance industry}} s revenues make it equivalent to the third largest country in {{the world in terms of}} GDP. In 2003, total premiums in emerging markets represented $ 314 billion (up from $ 270 billion just a year earlier) or 11 percent of the global total, with growth rates often dramatically higher than those in the industrial world (twice as high, on average, between 1980 and 2000) and often exceeding GDP growth rates. Emerging markets are poised to represent half of world insurance premiums by the middle of this century. Insurance premiums are rising in part because the economic costs of natural disasters are growing, as is the insured share (up from a negligible level in the 1950 s to approximately 20 percent of the total today). Insurance market conditions vary regionally. Current insurance penetration (premiums per GDP) is lowest in Africa and Asia and highest in Latin America. Premiums as a percent of GDP are lowest in the Middle East/Central Asia and Latin America and highest in Africa. The smallest market by total premiums is the Middle East/Central Asia, and the largest is South and East Asia (excluding Japan). The economic costs of weather-related events are high, totaling $ 1 trillion worldwide from 1980 through 2003. During this period, insurance covered four percent of total costs of weather-related disasters in emerging markets compared to 40 percent in high-income countries. While relatively small, insurance payments to people in emerging markets associated with these losses were three-times the magnitude of international aid. The potential for changes in weather patterns, including both average conditions and extreme events, would likely raise the demand for insurance whether the changes are a result natural variability or human-induced climate change. At the same time, increases in weather-related damage create uncertainties and challenge insurers ability and willingness to assume or affordably price these new risks. Sustainable development can contribute to managing and maintaining the insurability of these risks and thereby reduce the need for individuals and governments to absorb the costs. Because of the multi-national structure of the insurance and reinsurance markets, and other factors, the economic consequences of extreme weather events are becoming increasingly globalized. The growth of foreign insurers premiums in emerging markets averaged more than 20 percent per year through the 1990 s. During the late 1990 s, the U. S. alone was collecting approximately $ 40 billion in premiums each year for policies placed in other countries. This globalization of the risks and consequences of natural disasters is a significant reason for the insurance industry to seek to reduce the risks of claims worldwide. Cost-effectively mitigating the damage from (and thus the costs of) natural disasters would be a boon not only to the insurance industry and developed nations but to public health and sustainable development in emerging markets. One of many strategies is curtailing deforestation, which reduces risks of wildfire, malaria, mudslides, and flooding as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable energy technologies can also mitigate risk; for example, distributed power systems coupled with efficient energy end-use technologies reduce business interruptions resulting from damage to the power grid. In sum, involving the insurers of extreme weather events in the development and execution of strategies that contribute to public health and sustainable development would enhance disaster resilience, reduce the magnitude of losses, and thus help increase insurers' willingness to establish, maintain, and expand a <b>constructive</b> <b>presence</b> in emerging markets...|$|E
40|$|The third {{issue of}} the International Interdisciplinary Journal INTERthesis covers a round-table about the Contemporary Brazil, {{explanation}} and discussion of Canadian and Brazilian University students' papers, accomplished at the Canadian Congress of Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CALACS), {{in the city of}} Guelph (Ontario, Canada), on October 30, 2004. The president was Prof. W. E. (Ted) Hewitt (University of Western Ontario), and the coordinator was Prof. Edgar Dosman (York University), having Prof. Judith Hellman (York) as mediator. The round-table was organized and presented to honor Betinho (Herbert de Souza, creator of IBASE in Brazil), who was exiled in Canada between 1974 and 1978, becoming at that time highly acknowledged at the academic environment, for his capacity of leadership, organization and initiative towards the fight for social justice, for the intellectual innovation, and the practical sympathy with the Latin American peoples. Such qualities have been reconsidered today by several Brazilian and Canadian University professors and students, as necessary to rebuild and broaden the exchange, the convergence and the reflection in common, between Brazil and Canada. The reasons for this search for the mutual acknowledgement and cooperation between Brazil and Canada are many. Brazil is today very little known and studied in Canada and the same happens in Brazil concerning Canada. Whenever we hear something involving these two countries, {{it has to do with}} occasional incidents and conflicts of interests. Recently we have seen successive complaints from both countries to the World Trade Organization (WTO), mutually denouncing the state subsidies to the plane industries - Embraer, in Brazil, and Bombardier in Canada, for violation to the rules of free formation and price competition in the international market. Whatever the practical results of these arbitrages for interest might be, the Brazilian and Canadian public opinion just receives very partial information regarding the existence of competition and occasional contradictions between these two countries. However there are convergent characteristics and long-term contributions, even complementary, of both - Brazil and Canada - that have never reached the media. Among these characteristics which challenge the comparative study and the bilateral cooperation, we can highlight, in the internal aspect: the Canadian multiculturalism and the Brazilian ethnic pluralism; the importance of the civil society and of the social mobilizations in the magnification of the public sphere in both countries; the gradual integration of the migratory groups in the national society and the native peoples' rights to the defense of their cultural patrimony; the existence of vast inhabited areas and the challenges they mean to Nature preservation and the national integration. Beyond any doubt, the Parliament in Canada and the Presidentship in Brazil (among other inheritances and historical differences) conditions the development of these common characteristics and challenges in each country. Therefore, this divergent institutional-juridical inheritance must also be the object of a comparative study, that enlightens its relative efficacy in the environmental, social and cultural diversity approach. But besides the convergent national challenges, there are also important Brazilian and Canadian experiences in the international scope, which are unknown to public opinion as well. Let us mention just three examples that present great similarities: 1) The contributions that both Brazil and Canada have been efficiently and constantly giving to the special forces of the UN for the maintenance and reestablishment of peace in areas of conflict all over the world; 2) Regarding the Americas, both countries, in their peculiar ways, have tried to oppose to the ambitions of the United States unilateral hegemony. In North America, Canada has been showing the virtues of the so called North Model accepted at a state of minimum welfare, contrasting with the individualization of the social problems predominant in the United States. Yet Brazil, even having pragmatically accepted the alliance with Bush's government, attempts, through Mercosur and new diplomatic cooperation, establish a <b>constructive</b> <b>presence</b> among its neighbors in South America and other emergent countries around the world; 3) There is also an influential presence of Canada in the British Community of the Nations, as well as of Brazil among the Portuguese speaking countries - in both cases, concerning the preservation and development of their political - cultural traditions. There is no doubt that there are many other national and international similar experiences worth mentioning, showing that both countries have played a most important role, having a moderating and multilateral influence in the construction of a more peaceful and pluralist world. Unfortunately, the international news does not highlight these common objectives practiced by Brazil and Canada, and by several other countries, in favor of the peace and the cooperation among the peoples of the world. This round-table about the contemporary Brazil at the CALACS Conference lines up, therefore, with a greater effort of cooperation, aiming at promoting a mutual study and knowledge of their national realities. The papers selected for presentation at CALACS, have chosen, for discussion among the Canadian University public, a few central themes of studies of the current Brazilian reality. Ted Hewitt begins presenting a report of recent studies about Brazil, performed by intellectual Canadians. The results of the studies have verified significant growth and pending challenges in the area. All the papers presented can be found in this issue of our journal; in the language they have been written and presented, followed by their abstracts. It is important to mention the importance of each study: Sérgio Costa, for instance, approaches the current changes in the ethnic mobilization in Brazil (mainly of those with Afro background), pointing out the contributions of the international studies on the theme, as well as the links that this mobilization establishes abroad. Paulo Krischke discusses the characteristics of the government social politics, emphasizing that they are not only redistributing, but they also turn to the acknowledgement of the social and cultural diversity and the political tolerance as well - hence its impact in the popular approval of the government, in spite of the pending social-economical problems. Leandro Vergara-Camus analyzes the objectives and principles that guide the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST (Landless Rural Workers' Movement), and pictures the existing tension between their objectives and the policies of the current government. Finally, Tullo Vigevani and Marcelo Fernandes de Oliveira show the attempts to change the Brazilian international politics in the last decade, concerning a more autonomous and deliberate participation, facing imminent difficulties, such as the ones occurring along the ALCA negotiations. In short, all the presentations reveal the current Brazilian reality, as a historical process in progress, dedicated to the accomplishment and development of democracy, and, as such, teeming with ambiguities, challenges and problems of difficult solutions. The examples of Canada and other democracies more fully consolidated than ours might provide profitable comparative studies and promote the strengthening of democracy in Brazil. Last, but not least, it is necessary to thank the multilateral support that allowed this round-table at CALACS to be held: the CNPq, which paid for the trip of some of the Brazilians who participated the Congress; their Universities, which released them from their classes and allowed them to travel during that week; CALACS, which paid for their stay and internal trips in Canada; The Study Center on Security and International Relations of the University of York, which provided opportunities of lodging, research and exchange with other colleagues of that University in Toronto and also sponsored all the trip of one of the Brazilian participants; all the Canadians at CALACS - participants, organizers, workers - who welcomed us, Brazilians, so warmly and cordially. We will surely never forget such hospitality and we hope we can soon meet again, this time in Brazil, so that we can also offer them a warm and cordial reception...|$|E

El tercer número del Periódico Internacional Interdisciplinario INTERthesis divulga, a través de los artículos a seguir, una Mesa Redonda sobre el Brasil Contemporáneo, exposición y debate de trabajos universitarios, canadienses y brasileros, realizada en el Congreso Canadiense de Estudios Latino-Americanos y del Caribe (CALACS), en la ciudad de Guelph (Ontario, Canadá), en 30 de octubre de 2004. La Mesa Redonda fue presidida por el Profesor Doctor W. E. (Ted) Hewitt (University of Western Ontario), y coordenada por el Profesor Doctor Edgar Dosman (York University), con participación de la Profesora Doctora Judith Hellman (York University). La mesa fue organizada y presentada en homenaje a Betinho - Herbert de Souza - criador do IBASE no Brasil. Tal homenaje se justifica, porque Betinho estuvo exilado en el Canadá entre 1974 e 1978, tornando-se entonces reconocido en el medio académico, por su capacidad de liderazgo, organización e iniciativa, en causa de la justicia social, de la innovación intelectual, y de la solidariedad práctica con los pueblos de América Latina. Tales atributos son retomados, por varios académicos brasileros y canadienses, como necesarios para reconstruir y ampliar el intercambio, la convergencia y la reflexión comunes entre Brasil y Canadá. No faltan motivos para esta busca por mutuo reconocimiento y colaboración entre Brasil y Canadá. El Brasil es todavía poco conocido o estudiado en Canadá - y lo mismo se pasa en el Brasil acerca del Canadá. Por ejemplo, lo que más se ve divulgado por los medios de comunicación sobre las relaciones entre los dos países son incidentes ocasionales y divergencias comerciales fugases. Recientemente, vimos sucesivas reclamaciones de los dos gobiernos a la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC), denunciando-se recíprocamente sobre los subsidios estatales para las fábricas de aviones Embraer (Brasil) e Bombardier (Canadá), como violaciones a las normas de libre formación y competición de precios en el mercado internacional. Sea cual sea el resultado práctico de estas arbitrajes de intereses, la opinión pública del Brasil y del Canadá apenas recibe una información muy parcial acerca de la existencia de competición y contradicciones ocasionales entre los dos países. Entretanto, hay características convergentes y contribuciones de longo plazo, hasta complementares, entre Brasil y Canadá que nunca alcanzan el noticiario de ambos los países. Entre estas características, que desafían el estudio comparativo y la cooperación bilateral, podemos apuntar por ejemplo, en el plano interno: el multiculturalismo canadiense y el pluralismo étnico brasilero; la importancia de la sociedad civil y de las movilizaciones sociales en la ampliación de la esfera pública en ambos los países; la gradual integración de los grupos migratorios en la sociedad nacional y los derechos de los pueblos nativos a la defensa de su patrimonio cultural; la existencia de amplios espacios despoblados y los desafíos que presentan a la preservación de la naturaleza y a la integración nacional. Seguramente, la vigencia del parlamentarismo en el Canadá, y del presidencialismo en el Brasil, (entre otros legados y diferencias históricas) condiciona el desarrollo en cada país, de estas características y desafíos en común. Por lo tanto, esta herencia jurídico-institucional divergente debe ser también objeto de estudio comparativo, que ilumine su relativa eficacia en el abordaje de la diversidad ambiental y socio-cultural. Mas que los desafíos nacionales convergentes, también existen importantes experiencias brasileras y canadienses en el plano internacional, que tampoco se discute y noticia junto a la opinión pública. Para citar apenas tres ejemplos que presentan gran semejanza entre los dos países: 1) Las contribuciones que han hecho de forma constante y eficiente, tanto Brasil como Canadá, a las fuerzas especiales de la ONU, para la manutención y el restablecimiento de la paz en áreas de conflicto en todo el mundo; 2) En el ámbito de las Américas, los dos países han buscado, a su modo, oponer-se a las ambiciones de hegemonía unilateral de los Estados Unidos. En Norte-América, Canadá está demostrando las virtudes de lo que se está llamando Modelo Norte fundamentado en un Estado de bien-estar mínimo, el cual contrasta con la individualización de los problemas sociales, predominante en los Estados Unidos. Brasil por su vez, aunque pragmáticamente, haya aceptado la alianza con el gobierno Bush, busca a través del Mercosul y de nuevas cooperaciones diplomáticas, establecer una presencia constructiva entre sus vecinos de América del Sur, y otros países emergentes al rededor del mundo; 3) Existe una presencia influyente del Canadá en la Comunidad Británica de las Naciones, y del Brasil entre los países de habla portuguesa, en los dos casos como forma de preservación y desarrollo de sus respectivas tradiciones político-culturales. Otras experiencias nacionales y internacionales semejantes pueden ser nombradas, demostrando que los dos países han ejercido influencia moderadora e multilateral, orientadas a la construcción de un mundo más pacífico y pluralista. Infelizmente, el noticiario internacional no evidencia estos objetivos comunes, practicados por Brasil y Canadá (y por varios otros países), en favor de la paz e de la cooperación entre los pueblos. Esta Mesa Redonda sobre o Brasil Contemporáneo en la Conferencia del CALACS, está por lo tanto integrada a un esfuerzo más amplio de cooperación entre los dos países, que visa promover el estudio y conocimiento común de sus respectivas realidades nacionales. Los trabajos seleccionados para presentación en el CALACS, eligieron para debate entre el público universitario canadiense, algunos temas centrales de los estudios de la actualidad brasilera. Ted Hewitt inicia presentando un levantamiento de los estudios recientes realizados por estudiosos canadienses acerca del Brasil. El trabajo constata crecimiento significativo en estos estudios, y revela lagunas e desafíos pendientes en esta área. Todos los trabajos presentados en la Mesa son reproducidos a seguir en su íntegra, en el idioma original en que fueron presentados, acompañados de sus respectivos resúmenes. Es importante destacar algunas indicaciones sobre la importancia de cada estudio: Sérgio Costa, por ejemplo, aborda los cambios actuales en la movilización étnica en Brasil (principalmente la de los Afro-descendentes), indicando la contribución de los estudios internacionales sobre el tema, bien como los vínculos que esta movilización establece con el exterior. Paulo Krischke discute las características de las políticas sociales del gobierno, salientando que ellas no son apenas redistributivas, pero están dirigidas al reconocimiento de la diversidad socio-cultural y de la tolerancia política ¾ por esta razón se hace sentir su impacto en la aprobación popular al gobierno, aunque pese los problemas socio-económicos pendientes. Leandro Vergara-Camus analiza la trayectoria del Movimiento de Trabajadores Rurales Sin Tierra (MST), demostrando la tensión existente entre sus objetivos de reforma agraria y las políticas del gobierno actual ¾ frente a las imposiciones de mercantilización y de internacionalización de la producción agraria. Por fin, Tullo Vigevani e Marcelo Fernandes de Oliveira muestran las tentativas de mudanza en la política internacional brasilera, en curso durante la última década, con el sentido de una participación mundial más autónoma y deliberativa y sus consecuencias - por ejemplo, en el caso de las negociaciones sobre el ALCA. En suma, todas las presentaciones de esta Mesa revelan la actualidad brasilera como un proceso histórico en andamiento, dirigido a la realización y mejoramiento de la democracia, y como tal, repleto de ambigüedades, desafíos e problemas de difícil resolución. Los ejemplos del Canadá, y de otras democracias más plenamente consolidadas que la brasilera, al tratar problemas semejantes, podrán proporcionar fecundos estudios comparativos, para iluminar y promover el fortalecimiento de la democracia en el Brasil. Solamente nos queda agradecer los apoyos multilaterales que posibilitaron la realización de esta Mesa en CALACS. Al CNPq que financió el viaje de algunos participantes brasileros y a sus respectivas universidades que permitieron que se alejasen de sus cátedras para estar en Canadá. A CALACS que ofreció cobertura para algunos gastos de estada y viaje interna por el Canadá. Al Centro de Estudios sobre Seguridad y Relaciones Internacionales de la Universidad de York que proporcionó oportunidades de alojamiento, pesquisa y intercambio con otros compañeros en aquella universidad en Toronto ¾ además del viaje de uno de los participantes brasileros al Canadá. A todos los compañeros canadienses que participaron de la Mesa, y a los demás dirigentes, participantes, y funcionarios del congreso de CALACS, que recibieron a los brasileros de modo afectuoso y cordial - lo cual esperamos retribuir oportunamente en Brasil.

A homenagem se justifica, porque Betinho esteve exilado no Canadá entre 1974 e 1978, tornando-se então amplamente reconhecido no meio acadêmico, pela sua capacidade de liderança, organização e iniciativa, em prol da justiça social, da inovação intelectual, e da solidariedade prática com os povos da América Latina. Tais atributos são hoje retomados, por vários acadêmicos brasileiros e canadenses, como necessários para reconstruir e ampliar o intercâmbio, a convergência e a reflexão em comum, entre o Brasil e o Canadá. Não faltam motivos para essa busca pelo mútuo reconhecimento e colaboração entre o Brasil e o Canadá. O Brasil é hoje ainda pouco conhecido e estudado no Canadá ¾ e o mesmo acontece no Brasil acerca do Canadá. Por exemplo, o que mais se vê divulgado pela mídia sobre as relações entre os dois países são incidentes ocasionais e conflitos pontuais de interesses. No passado recente, vimos as sucessivas reclamações dos dois governos à Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), denunciando reciprocamente os subsídios estatais às fábricas de aviões Embraer (Brasil) e Bombardier (Canadá), como violações às regras de livre formação e competição de preços no mercado internacional. Seja qual for o resultado prático dessas arbitragens de interesses, a opinião pública do Brasil e do Canadá apenas ganha uma informação muito parcial, acerca da existência de competição e contradições ocasionais, entre os dois países. No entanto, há características convergentes, e contribuições de longo prazo até complementares, do Brasil e do Canadá, que nunca alcançam o noticiário de ambos os países. Entre essas características, que desafiam o estudo comparativo e a cooperação bilateral, podemos apontar por exemplo, no plano interno: o multiculturalismo canadense e o pluralismo étnico brasileiro; a importância da sociedade civil e das mobilizações sociais na ampliação da esfera pública em ambos os países; a gradual integração dos grupos migratórios na sociedade nacional, e os direitos dos povos nativos à defesa do seu patrimônio cultural; a existência de amplos espaços despovoados, e os desafios que apresentam à preservação da natureza e à integração nacional. Sem dúvida, a vigência do parlamentarismo no Canadá, e do presidencialismo no Brasil, (entre outros legados e diferenças históricas) condiciona o desenvolvimento em cada país, dessas características e desafios em comum. Portanto, essa herança jurídico-institucional divergente deve ser também objeto de estudo comparativo, que ilumine sua relativa eficácia na abordagem da diversidade ambiental e sócio-cultural. Mas além dos desafios nacionais convergentes, há também importantes experiências brasileiras e canadenses no plano internacional, que tampouco se discutem e noticiam junto à opinião pública. Para citar apenas três exemplos que apresentam grande similaridade entre os dois países: 1) As contribuições que têm feito constante e eficientemente, tanto o Brasil como o Canadá, às forças especiais da ONU, para a manutenção e o restabelecimento da paz em áreas de conflito no mundo inteiro; 2) No âmbito das Américas, ambos os países têm procurado, a seu modo, se opor às ambições de hegemonia unilateral dos Estados Unidos. Na América do Norte, o Canadá vem mostrando as virtudes do chamado Modelo Norte assente num Estado de bem estar mínimo, o qual contrasta com a individualização dos problemas sociais, predominante nos Estados Unidos. O Brasil, por sua vez, ainda que tenha, pragmaticamente, aceito a aliança com o governo Bush, bu...|$|E
