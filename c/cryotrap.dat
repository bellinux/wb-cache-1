These devices must be unloaded annually to recover their tritium collection efficiency. One approach to collecting the tritium released from ZrFe getter beds utilizes a <b>cryotrap,</b> a coil filled with crushed molecular sieve chilled to liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K).

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarA {{study has}} been carried out on the {{applicability}} of <b>cryotrapping</b> gas chromatography-Fourier Transform infrared spectrometry (GC-FTIR) for the identification and isomer discrimination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Method development has been performed by means of a standard mixture of 24 PAHs of the series from naphthalene to benzo(ghi) perylene. All compounds including structural isomers have been identified on the basis of spectral differences. Detection limits were established as 250 - 500 picogram per microliter injected on-column. The applicability of the method has been tested on the analysis of sediment, soil and river clay extracts, which had been analysed previously by means of HPLC with fluorescence detection. The presence {{of the majority of the}} PAHs was unequivocally confirmed while previously undetermined PAHs could be identified. Moreover essential additional information was obtained on the identity of two coeluting structural isomers. As such <b>cryotrapping</b> GC-FTIR forms an important additional tool in the analysis of PAHs by means of GC-FID, GC-MSD and HPLC with fluorescense detection. <b>Cryotrapping</b> spectra of PAH appear to be quite similar to conventionally recorded spectra.

This method is used for the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in both biodiesel (B 100) and biodiesel blend (B 5) samples. The separation of FAME was based on component boiling point in the first dimension and polarity in the second dimension by using a BPX 5 /BP 20 column set to provide a measure of orthogonality in the 2 -D space. Here the columns are coupled with a cryogenic modulator operating in a novel temperature programmed mode (TM) whereby the <b>cryotrap</b> is progressively incremented in temperature as the oven temperature is increased. The final method employs eight <b>cryotrap</b> temperature settings. The developed GC×GC method is able to successfully characterize and identify both B 100 and B 5 FAME components, which are produced from a variety of vegetable oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils, with high precision.

40|$|Three {{different}} approaches to detecting hydrogen in helium streams were assessed: thermal conductivity, atmospheric sampling using a mass spectrometer, and permeation through a palladium/silver membrane. The thermal conductivity detection system utilized an assembly of four cells fitted with filaments wired to make a Wheatstone bridge. Pure helium flowed through two of the cells. Helium containing hydrogen passed through the remaining two cells. The filament temperature, which {{is determined by the}} thermal conductivity of the gas surrounding the filaments, depends on the hydrogen concentration in the helium carrier. In the atmospheric sampling approach, a slip-stream is drawn from the carrier via two differentially pumped orifices and injected into a vacuum system. The vacuum system is fitted with a mass spectrometer tuned to hydrogen. In the permeation approach, the helium stream is passed over a hot palladium/silver (Pd/Ag) membrane. Hydrogen permeates through the membrane to increase the pressure in a vacuum system. The change in the vacuum pressure {{is directly related to the}} hydrogen concentration in the carrier on the upstream side of the membrane. The Pd/Ag permeation approach proved to be the most sensitive hydrogen detection technique. This approach was used to investigate the performance of a <b>cryotrap.</b> Several interesting phenomena were detected when evaluating the <b>cryotrap.</b> A large but brief breakthrough occurs when the column reaches capacity, and hydrogen elution can occur when the full, cold column is purged with helium...|$|E

40|$|The water {{residence}} {{time in the}} atmosphere is approximately nine days, the shortest {{residence time}} in any major reservoir of the whole water cycle on the planet. Nevertheless, water vapor is {{a key factor in}} climate and hydrology due to its dynamic behavior. The isotopic composition of water vapor can highlight several processes of the water cycle that link the water reservoirs to the atmosphere (Galewsky et al., 2016). In the past, the isotopic composition of water vapor was generally inferred from precipitation data, assuming isotopic equilibrium between rain and water vapor. This assumption works well when precipitation is abundant but gives misleading results when precipitation is scarce. A common method to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor is the <b>cryotrapping</b> technique, proposed by Craig et al., (1963). <b>Cryotrapping</b> consists in freezing all the moisture content of the air (to avoid fractionation) and analyze the liquid sample with the regular mass spectrometry technique. This process includes the designing of customized cold traps and usually requires several man-hours due to the long sampling time (2 - 8 hours per sample). With the advent of the laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) technique is now possible to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor with sampling time down to seconds. This novel technique increases our knowledge about the isotopic composition of water vapor and gives a substantial help in our understanding of the water cycle, both on global and local scales. However, the continuous measurement of isotopic composition of water vapor requires a specific method to calibrate the large amount of data resulting as the output of a Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. This includes the production of vapor with known isotopic composition, determination of the response of the analyzer to different humidity levels and correction of the instrumental drift. In this work, we present a summary of potential calibration techniques for continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor. The study goes in-depth on the developing of a customized calibration unit for a commercial CRDS analyzer (Picarro L 1102 i). Continuous measurements will be compared to water vapor samples collected with <b>cryotraps</b> and several continuous measurements will be presented highlighting sub-daily processes in the atmospheric boundary layer...|$|R

40|$|Membrane inlet sensor {{techniques}} allow online, real-time and in situ {{analyses of}} gases {{during the investigation}} of aquatic environments. Of specific interest for research and applied objectives are quantifications of gases like methane, higher hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and pollutants. For these objectives, membrane inlet systems are coupled to optical or solid state sensors as well as mass spectrometers. Besides the gases of interest, large quantities of water vapor are passing through the membrane and are thus introduced into the sensor system. This downgrades the detection limit, affects the ionization efficiency of mass spectrometers, or could cause the condensation of water within infrared sensors. In this study, we describe a novel robust, low-power <b>cryotrap</b> coupled to a membrane inlet system (CT-MIS), which is suitable {{to be used in}} harsh environments, including underwater applications. The entire system is of small size and weight, is operated at – 85 °C, and requires an energy consumption of less than 10 Watt. By using the <b>cryotrap,</b> we are able to reduce water vapor in the analytical line by more than 98 %. The detection limits for major and trace gases are considerably improved this way. For the trace gas methane (CH 4), the detection limit was lowered from 100 to 16 nmol/L, which allows the measurement of methane in surface and bottom waters of coastal areas and lakes.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} that allows fast target analysis in multidimensional gas chromatography {{by using a}} microswitching valve between two GC columns, with cryogenic trapping and rapid re-injection of trapped solutes in the second dimension. The essence of the procedure is that heart-cut fractions from the first column (1 D) can be selectively transferred to column 2 (2 D), where a moveable cryogenic trap first focuses the transferred solute(s) {{at the head of}} the second column and then permits their facile rapid analysis on 2 D. Since 2 D is a short narrow-bore column, which exhibits very fast analysis (on the order of a few seconds elution), peak responses (heights) are significantly enhanced (by up to 40 -fold). Additionally, by using a 2 D phase of a selectivity different from that used for 1 D, it is possible to also separate components that are not resolved on the first column and to increase the resolution for other compounds. The heart-cut valve isolates the section(s) of solutes of interest from the first column separation, and this provides a considerable simplification to the chromatogramin addition to the separation and sensitivity advantages. By using this method, multidimensional gas chromatography with multiple heart-cuts can be completed within the same time as the primary column separation. Since the described method permits non-heart-cut fractions to be transferred to a monitor detector, normal detection of these fractions is still permitted. By modulation of the <b>cryotrap,</b> it is also possible to achieve comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography for the heart-cut fractions; however, only those compounds passed to the second, separation column, which passes through the <b>cryotrap,</b> will be subjected to GC×GC analysis.

In this key intermediate, the chromophore has a 13 -cis, 15 -anti conformation and a deprotonated Schiff base. Purple membranes containing wild-type or mutant D 96 A bacteriorhodopsin were regenerated with retinals specifically deuterated in the methyl groups of either carbon C 1 or C 5 of the â-ionone ring or carbon C 9 of the polyene chain. Oriented hydrated films were formed by drying concentrated suspensions on glass plates at 86 % relative humidity. The lifetime of the M state was {{increased in the}} wild-type samples by applying a guanidine hydrochloride solution at pH 9. 5 and in the D 96 A sample by raising the pH. 2 H NMR experiments were performed on the dark-adapted ground state (a 2 : 1 mixture of 13 -cis, 15 -syn and all-trans, 15 -anti chromophores), the <b>cryotrapped</b> light-adapted state (all-trans, 15 -anti), and the <b>cryotrapped</b> M intermediate (13 -cis, 15 -anti) at- 50 °C.

Using the chromatogram of a mixture as a map, the GC-R instrument allows the operator to "cut apart" and recombine the components of the mixture at will, selecting compounds, peaks, or sections based on retention time to include or exclude in a reconstitution for sensory analysis. Selective recombination is accomplished with the installation of a Deans Switch directly in-line with the column, which directs compounds either to waste or to a <b>cryotrap</b> at the operator's discretion. This enables the creation of, for example, aroma reconstitutions incorporating all of the volatiles in a sample, including instrumentally undetectable compounds as well those present at concentrations below sensory thresholds, thus correcting for the "reconstitution discrepancy" sometimes noted in flavor chemistry studies. Using only flowering lavender (Lavandula angustifola 'Hidcote Blue') as a source for volatiles, we used the instrument to build mixtures of subsets of lavender volatiles in-instrument and characterized their aroma qualities with a sensory panel. We showed evidence of additive, masking, and synergistic effects in these mixtures and of "lavender' aroma character as an emergent property of specific mixtures.

Validation of the system was performed using a standard mixture of compounds relevant to essential oil analysis, and then using compounds present at different abundances in lavender essential oil. Reproducibility of retention times and peak area responses demonstrated that there was negligible variation in the system {{over the course of}} multiple heart-cuts, and proved the reliable operation of the system. An application of the system to lavender oil, as a more complex sample, was carried out to affirm system feasibility, and demonstrate the ability of the system to target multiple components in the oil. The system was proposed to be useful for study of aroma-impact compounds where GC × GC can be incorporated with MDGC to permit precise identification of aroma-active compounds, where heart-cut multidimensional GC-olfactometry detection (MDGC-O) is a more appropriate technology for odour assessment...|$|E
40|$|In {{preparation}} for the routine deployment of the Earth Networks greenhouse gas monitoring network, we have designed and tested a simple method for drying ambient air to below 0. 2 % mole fraction H 2 O using a Nafion dryer. The inlet was designed for use with a Picarro model G 2301 cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS) CO 2 /CH 4 /H 2 O analyzer. The analyzer measures water vapor mixing ratio at the same frequency as CO 2 and CH 4 and then corrects for the dilution and peak broadening effects of H 2 O on the CO 2 and CH 4 mixing ratios. This analyzer is remarkably stable and performs well on water vapor correction tests, but there is potentially an added benefit of reducing the dependence on the H 2 O correction for long term field measurement programs. Substantially lowering the amount of H 2 O in the sample can reduce uncertainties in the applied H 2 O corrections by {{an order of magnitude}} or more, and eliminate the need to determine an instrument-specific H 2 O correction factor and to verify its stability over time. Our Nafion drying inlet system takes advantage of the extra capacity of the analyzer pump to redirect 30 % of the dry gas exiting the Nafion to the outer shell side of the dryer and has no consumables. We tested the Nafion dryer against a <b>cryotrap</b> (− 95 °C) method for removing H 2 O and found that it does not significantly alter the CO 2 and CH 4 dry mixing ratios of the sample gas. Systematic differences between the drying methods were at the level of 0. 05 ppm in CO 2 and 0. 1 ppb in CH 4 for the wet-air tests, well within the WMO compatibility guidelines...|$|E
40|$|SPIRAL 2 is a {{radioactive}} Ion {{beam accelerator}} under construction now at GANIL dedicated to fundamental and applied research in nuclear physics [1]. This machine aims essentially at producing high intensities of exotic nuclei issued from {{the interaction between}} a Deuteron beam (E= 40 Mev, I = 5 mA) delivered by a superconducting Linac and a carbide uranium target placed in a special zone named production area. Reaction between beam and target in the production area produces {{a large amount of}} radioactive gaseous that must be stopped and retained because it may cause a danger for users and also may generate an uncontrollable contamination of machine equipments. That's why, vacuum pumping system in this special area is considered as a major issue for global machine safety. In this presentation, we will describe the vacuum system design of the production area in order to obtain a pressure lower than 10 - 6 hPa and to ensure a strong limitation of radioactive gas transmission. Firstly, main characteristic of proposed pumping system for which a Monte Carlo Code named MOVAK 3 D [2] has been used to optimize conductance, will be presented. An additional Cryogenic trap system (named "cryotrap"), handled by robots, will be used if necessary to reinforce pumping capacity. Secondly, a description of a special experiment using a prototype of <b>Cryotrap,</b> performed recently, will be exposed and the main experimental results with three different gaseous (H 2, CO 2, N 2) will be given. Modelisation with a Monte Carlo Code named Molflow+ [3] with sticking coefficient determined with experimental data will be also showed. Finally, global status of pumping system will be presented with an illustration of its main specificities in managing radioactive gaseous in the production area where human interventions are forbidde...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur gases are {{important}} {{components of the}} global cycle of S. They contribute to the acidity of precipitation and they influence global radiation balance and climate. The role of terrestrial sources of biogenic S and their effect on atmospheric chemistry remain as major unanswered questions {{in our understanding of}} the natural S cycle. The role of northern wetlands as sources and sinks of gaseous S by measuring rates of S gas exchange as a function of season, hydrologic conditions, and gradients in tropic status was investigated. Experiments were conducted in wetlands in New Hampshire, particularly a poor fen, and in Mire 239, a poor fen at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Ontario. Emissions were determined using Teflon enclosures, gas <b>cryotrapping</b> methods and gas chromatography (GC) with flame photometric detection. Dynamic (sweep flow) and static enclosures were employed which yielded similar results. Dissolved S gases and methane were determined by gas stripping followed by GC...|$|R
40|$|Evaporation is a {{key process}} in water cycle that links liquid water to the atmosphere. In {{the last fifty years}} stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen and oxygen have been intensively used to describe climate processes related to evaporation and precipitation, ranging in different spatial and temporal scales. Evaporation introduces large isotopic effects in the phases involved. The well known Craig-Gordon model (Craig & Gordon, 1965) describes those isotopic effects involving several steps and different processes, moving from the air-water interface to the free atmosphere. However, very few works in literature have tested the vertical behavior of the Craig-Gordon model in natural conditions on both fresh and marine waters. In this work we present the results from four field experiments aimed to describe the vertical variability of δ 18 O and δD in the first few meters over a large water body (the coastal lagoon of Venice, northern Italy) and to test the Craig-Gordon model in such conditions. Each experiment involved <b>cryotrapping</b> of water vapor at different height over the water surface (0. 1 m, 2 m and 4 m) and the sampling of the liquid water at two depth (surface and 0. 5 m). During the experiments, water vapor was also sampled in the nearest mainland (2. 5 km from gradient measurements) to determine the isotopic composition of background water vapor. Liquid samples were then analyzed with a Picarro L 1102 -i and Thermo-Fisher Delta Plus Advantage for water vapor and lagoon water, respectively. The last two experiments have also involved simultaneous measurements of relative humidity using commercially-available humidity probes at each height. This approach was used to determine a reference scale in order to compare observations to modeled estimates. Despite the coarse time resolution due to <b>cryotrapping</b> method (measurements are averaged over 1. 5 hours), preliminary results show measurable differences in the isotopic composition of water vapor along the vertical gradient and good agreement between observations and predicted values from the model. Even if this work is an exploratory phase it shows an interesting potential to grow our understanding of the processes involved as well as a useful implementation for future studies focused on fractionation of water isotopes due to evaporation in natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} by X-ray crystallographic techniques the cryo-trapped {{states that}} accumulate on controlled illumination {{of the blue}} light photoreceptor, photoactive yellow protein (PYP), at 110 K in both the wild-type species and its E 46 Qmutant. These states are related to those that occur during the chromophore isomerization process in the PYP photocycle at room temper-ature. The structures present in such states were determined at high resolution, 0. 95 – 1. 05. In both wild type andmutant PYP, the <b>cryotrapped</b> state is not composed of a single, quasitransi-tion state structure but rather of a heterogeneous mixture of three species {{in addition to the}} ground state structure. We identify and refine these three photoactivated species under the assumption that the structural changes are limited to simple isomerization events of the chromophore that otherwise retains chemical bonding similar to that in the ground state. The refined chromophore models are essentially identical in the wild type and the E 46 Q mutant, which implies that the early stages of their photocycle mechanisms are the same...|$|R
