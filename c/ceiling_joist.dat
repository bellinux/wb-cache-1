500|$|Several people, telling amazing {{stories to}} those who would listen, passed {{themselves}} off as the [...] "sole survivor" [...] in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called [...] "Frankie Slide". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home. [...] Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist.</b> Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. [...] The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995. In total, 23 people {{in the path of the}} slide survived, in addition to the 17 miners who escaped from the tunnels under Turtle Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of a}} truss is {{one single}} triangle. This type of truss is seen in a framed roof consisting of rafters and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist,</b> and in other mechanical structures such as bicycles and aircraft. [...] Because of the stability of this shape and the methods of analysis {{used to calculate the}} forces within it, a truss composed entirely of triangles is known as a simple truss. However, a simple truss is often defined more restrictively by demanding that it can be constructed through successive addition of pairs of members, each connected to two existing joints and to each other to form a new joint, and this definition does not require a simple truss to comprise only triangles. The traditional diamond-shape bicycle frame, which utilizes two conjoined triangles, {{is an example of a}} simple truss.|$|E

The wood used from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> was estimated to be 400 to 500 years old when it was procured for the construction of the St. Boniface Museum the 1840s.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor joist}} framing layout looks {{similar to the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> layout. However, where the ceiling joists may consist of 2x6s, 2x8s, 2x10s and 2x12s, the floor joist layout will {{typically}} show 2x12 joists only. In some cases, where loads and spans dictate, and deeper floor joist system may be required. Deeper floor systems include wood I-joists and open web trusses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> layout shows all of {{the ceiling}} joists over the rooms (typically over {{the second floor of}} a 2-story house, or over the first floor of a 1-story house). The size of the joists will vary {{depending}} on the spacing of the joists, as well as the span. Whether or not the joists are designed for attic storage loads will also affect the size of the members.|$|E

5000|$|Niemczowka {{tenement}} house {{built in the}} Renaissance style, in the terrace building development, with the spacious transit entrance hall. It belonged to Walenty and Anna Niemiec Wrzesień. It was built in 1570. In the past it was an inn. On the ground floor in the big room there is a three-piece window with Renaissance columns, and also the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist,</b> on which there is the date 1634 and the surname of the contemporary chęciński mayor Walenty Soboniewski. Originally the building was one-storey, at present {{it also has the}} mezzanine built into the roof and adapted to council flats. There are also cloister vaulted basements.|$|E
50|$|A {{top rail}} {{across the front}} (north side) of room 2 and the foyer and another across the rear (south side) of room 2 and the foyer tied the {{vertical}} beams all together. Each vertical post had a hand-made mortise at interior ceiling height to receive each <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist,</b> which had a tenon at each end. A wood peg secured each joint. The peg holes were chisel-cut with a square hole by hand, as opposed to round holes made with a drill, indicating construction in early 1800’s. The pegs were hand-formed with an ax from small cut blocks of wood and sized to each hole. Additionally, vertical water saw marks marking are on the vertical posts. Neither the room 2 nor the foyer framing used nails.|$|E
50|$|The {{king post}} truss is used for simple roof trusses and short-span bridges. It is the {{simplest}} form of truss {{in that it is}} constructed of the fewest number of truss members (individual lengths of wood or metal). The truss consists of two diagonal members that meet at the apex of the truss, one horizontal beam that serves to tie the bottom end of the diagonals together, and the king post which connects the apex to the horizontal beam below. For a roof truss, the diagonal members are called rafters, and the horizontal member may serve as a <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist.</b> A bridge would require two {{king post truss}}es with the driving surface between them. A roof usually uses many side-by-side trusses {{depending on the size of}} the structure.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, a {{concrete}} tiled roof would normally have rafters at 600mm centers, roof battens at 300mm centers and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> at 400mm centers. The United States still uses imperial {{units of measurement}} and framing members are typically spaced sixteen or twenty-four inches apart.|$|R

5000|$|In {{traditional}} timber framing {{there may}} be a single set of joists which carry both a floor and ceiling called a single floor (single joist floor, single framed floor) or two sets of joists, one carrying the floor and another carrying the ceiling called a double floor (double framed floor). The term binding joist is sometimes used to describe beams at floor level running perpendicular to the ridge of a gable roof and joined to the intermediate posts. Joists which land on a binding joist are called bridging joists. A large beam in the ceiling of a room carrying joists is a summer beam. A <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> may be installed flush with the bottom of the beam or sometimes below the beam. Joists left exposed and visible from below are called [...] "naked flooring" [...] or [...] "articulated" [...] (a modern U.S. term) and were typically planed smooth (wrought) and sometimes chamfered or beaded.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on those}} results, {{we thought that}} {{changing}} connections of {{the upper and lower}} parts of the brace to fittings of higher strength would improve the aseismic performance of the conventional ceiling as a whole, and we thus conceived a new fitting. The target bearing force in development was roughly twice as large as that of conventional fittings. Fig. 3 shows the developed fittings. Development A is a fitting that connects {{the upper part of the}} brace to the hanger bolt. By adopting enclosed-type fitting to fully cover the hanger bolt, the degree of securing was improved. Development B is a joint that connects the lower part of the brace to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist.</b> It consists of a steel angle connected to Starting with the Geiyo Earthquake in 2001, at every larg...|$|E
50|$|Framing - The {{vertical}} posts on {{the north}} and south side for room 2 and the foyer, built on an irregular beam base, were extended in length above the interior room ceiling to the top attic rail. The length was designed to match the height of the original room 1 roof. The vertical posts were long enough to extend about four feet above the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wall or ceiling {{finishing}} process begins with wood laths. These are narrow strips of wood, or split boards, nailed horizontally across the wall studs or <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> Each wall frame {{is covered in}} lath, tacked at the studs. The lath is typically about one inch (2.5 cm) wide by four feet (1.22 meters) long by 1/4 in thick. Each horizontal course of lath is spaced about 3/8 in away from its neighboring courses.|$|R
50|$|Hanging pot racks are {{the most}} common type of pot racks. Hanging pot racks need to be {{installed}} into <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> They usually come with chains or extension hooks, or hanging links and ceiling screws. Hanging pot racks are normally sold with hooks that can be positioned on the rim or on the grid. Pots and pans can be hung directly from the grid or from the rim using these hooks. Grids can be many shapes, but the most common are rectangular, round, or oval.|$|R
50|$|After {{the sheets}} are secured {{to the wall}} studs or <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> the {{installer}} conceals the seams between drywall sheets with 'joint tape' and several layers of 'joint compound' (sometimes called 'mud'). This compound is also applied to any screw holes or defects. The compound is allowed to air dry then typically sanded smooth before painting. Alternatively, for a better finish, the entire wall may be given a 'skim coat', a thin layer (about 1 mm or 1/16 inch) of finishing compound, to minimize the visual differences between the paper and mudded areas after painting.|$|R
50|$|The Fachwerk Farmhouse {{contains}} three {{rooms on}} the ground level, a central living room and two side rooms accessed from the central room. The floors are timber, covered with carpet and interior walls are rendered and painted. The timber frame is visible {{in the north and}} south walls and the internal dividing walls but the east and west walls have been re-plastered, concealing the timber framing. The original ceiling has been removed and a new timber attic floor now forms the ceiling over the ground level rooms, exposing the original timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Rob Norden {{purchased}} the restaurant, {{which is now}} {{owned and operated by}} his son, also Rob. The Nordens undertook a significant research and restoration project to restore the older appearance and deal with structural problems. The foundation was strengthened with concrete. The floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> weakened by sagging of the foundation, were replaced by others from a barn in Ontario as old as the tavern, and the floorboards were replaced with similar boards from a schoolhouse in Pennsylvania. The '76 House is a contributing property to the Tappan Historic District.|$|R
50|$|Ceiling Height - The room 1 {{ceiling was}} lowered from its {{original}} height to its current height. Notched top rails in the attic, approximately four feet above the ceiling floor, indicate both {{the height of the}} original <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and the slope of the flat roof. West Chimney - A brick fireplace and chimney was installed on the west end of room 2. The fireplace chimney in room 1 was extended in height to accommodate the gable roof height with brick similar to that used in the fireplace in the room 2.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a stream}} of high {{pressure}} water impinges on a surface, water hammer can quickly erode and destroy it. In the 2009 Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station accident, the lid to a 640 MW turbine was ejected upwards, hitting the ceiling above. During the accident, the rotor was seen flying through the air, still spinning, about 3 meters above the floor. Unrestrained, [...] per second of water began to spray all over the generator hall. The geyser caused the structural failure of steel <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> precipitating a roof collapse around the failed turbine.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{components}} {{go into the}} overall planning of a distribution center {{in order to maximize}} its efficiency. If the distribution center relies on a conveyor system suspended from the ceiling, consideration needs to be given to the weight-bearing capacity of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> If the conveyor system runs along the floor, then consideration needs to be given in the design stage to the placement of columns, particularly as they relate to the flue space between pallet rack frames. Other planning considerations include attention to such areas as slotting, product replenishment, storage media, and power requirements.|$|R
50|$|Coconut timber {{has many}} {{applications}} {{as both a}} structural and interior design material. The harder, high-density timber is suitable for general structural purposes such as pillars, trusses, rafting, furniture, window and door frames, floors, decking and floor joists. Medium density coconut timber {{can be used for}} walls, <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and horizontal studs. Low density coconut timber is used in non-load bearing applications like wood panelling, internal trim and ceilings, as well as homewares.Coconut timber supplied by Pacific Green is to be used in exterior applications throughout Abu Dhabi's Masdar City development, including the entrance gates, screens and doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{outstanding}} {{quality of}} the clear finished timber joinery and fittings on the interior of Vida Lahey's house is particularly noteworthy. The internal walls are lined with vertically-jointed boards of first grade timber. Timber boards lining the ceiling are raked to meet {{the underside of the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> on the east and west walls of the house. An outstanding feature of the interior is the joists of hoop pine running the full width of the house. Each joist was made from one piece of timber completely free from knots over its long expanse, a rarity today.|$|R
