40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} shell cooling. This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the back plate. This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser <b>cooling</b> and back <b>plate</b> <b>cooling</b> have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, back <b>plate</b> <b>cooling</b> increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling.

40|$|To provide uniform cooling for a {{fuel cell}} stack, a <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> concept was evaluated. This concept {{utilized}} thin <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> to extract heat from the interior of {{a fuel cell}} stack and move this heat to a cooling manifold where it can be transferred to an external cooling fluid. The advantages of this cooling approach include a reduced number of ancillary components and the ability to directly utilize an external cooling fluid loop for cooling the fuel cell stack. A number of different types of <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> and manifolds were developed. The <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> consisted of two main types; a plate based on thermopyrolytic graphite (TPG) and a planar (or flat plate) heat pipe. The plates, along with solid metal control samples, were tested for both thermal and electrical conductivity. To transfer heat from the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> to the <b>cooling</b> fluid, a number of manifold designs utilizing various materials were devised, constructed, and tested. A key aspect of the manifold was {{that it had to be}} electrically nonconductive so it would not short out the fuel cell stack during operation. Different manifold and <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> configurations were tested in a vacuum chamber to minimize convective heat losses. <b>Cooling</b> <b>plates</b> were placed in the grooves within the manifolds and heated with surface-mounted electric pad heaters.

Different types of control valves and control schemes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to maintain a constant temperature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates.</b> The control valves regulated the cooling fluid flow through the manifold, thereby controlling the heat flow to the cooling fluid.

It is a numerical method to approximately solve various issues concerning flow. ScandiNova Systems AB, Uppsala, uses a heat exchanger, developed by themselves, in the smaller modulators. There is a tank containing transformer, electrical components and oil. When the transformer gets warm during operation, it emits heat to the oil in the tank.

Based on a seismic model of the Pacific upper mantle inferred from a new compilation of seismic surface wave dispersion measurements, we show that, on average, the Pacific lithosphere has experienced a punctuated cooling history, cooling diffusively at ages until 70 Ma and then reheating in the Central Pacific between ages of 70 and 100 Ma predominantly at depths between 70 and 150 km. At ages from 100 Ma to about 135 Ma, the processes of reheating are substantially weaker than in the Central Pacific.

Our motivation is to develop a methodology for reconstructing ocean bathymetry in the geologic past that includes heterogeneous continental margins in addition to abyssal ocean floor. First, the <b>plate</b> <b>cooling</b> model is applied to maps of ocean crustal age to calculate depth to basement. To the depth to basement we add an isostatically adjusted, multicomponent sediment layer constrained by sediment thickness in the modern oceans and marginal seas. A three-parameter continental shelf-slope-rise structure completes the bathymetry reconstruction, extending from the ocean crust to the coastlines. Parameters of the shelf-slope-rise structures at active and passive margins are determined from modern ocean bathymetry at locations where a complete history of seafloor spreading is preserved.
