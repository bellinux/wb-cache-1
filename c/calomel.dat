Their hypothesis was that the <b>calomel</b> given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} <b>calomel</b> or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Zinc and cadmium are {{electropositive}} while {{mercury is}} not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 {{in which the}} ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come {{together to form a}} metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species. Cadmium can also form species such as 4− in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to <b>calomel.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Victoria's first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, {{was born}} on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the {{arrangements}} for the nursery staff. Lehzen put the nursery {{in the hands of}} a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with <b>calomel.</b> In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and be it on her head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E

25|$|A silver {{chloride}} electrode {{is a type}} of reference electrode, commonly used in electrochemical measurements. For environmental reasons it has widely replaced the saturated <b>calomel</b> electrode. For example, it is usually the internal reference electrode in pH meters and it is often used as reference in reduction potential measurements. As an example of the latter, the {{silver chloride}} electrode is the most commonly used reference electrode for testing cathodic protection corrosion control systems in sea water environments.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a reference electrode in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated <b>calomel</b> electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the test solution, providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E
25|$|As used by fumigators {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} cyanide, copper(II) salt and an aromatic amine such as benzidine {{is added to}} the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry {{is the way in which}} the saturated <b>calomel</b> reference electrode (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound.|$|E

[...] It was used by doctors in America throughout the eighteenth century, and during the revolution, to make patients regurgitate and release their body from [...] "impurities". Benjamin Rush was one particular well-known advocate of mercury in medicine and used <b>calomel</b> to treat sufferers of yellow fever during its outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793. <b>Calomel</b> was given to patients as a purgative or cathartic until they began to salivate and was often administered to patients in such great quantities that their hair and teeth fell out. Shortly after yellow fever struck Philadelphia, the disease broke out in Jamaica. A war of words erupted in the press concerning the best treatment for yellow fever; bleeding or <b>calomel.</b> Anecdotal evidence indicates <b>calomel</b> was more effective than bleeding.

This reversible oxidation has itself been used as standard in electrochemistry as Fc+/Fc= 0.40V versus the standard hydrogen electrode. Some electron-rich organic compounds (e.g., aniline) also are oxidized at low potentials, but only irreversibly. Oxidation of ferrocene gives the stable blue-colored iron(III) cation [...] originally called ferricinium, but now more commonly ferrocenium (these terms denote the same ion, contrary to what one would expect {{from the fact that}} ferric and ferrous denote different ions of a single iron atom).

2500|$|Mercury {{occurs as}} salts such as mercuric {{chloride}} (HgCl2) and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), the latter {{also known as}} <b>calomel.</b> Because they are more soluble in water, mercuric salts are usually more acutely toxic than mercurous salts. Their higher solubility lets them be more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. [...] Mercury salts affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys, and can cause severe kidney damage; however, as they cannot cross the blood–brain barrier easily, these salts inflict little neurological damage without continuous or heavy exposure. Mercuric cyanide (Hg(CN)2) is a particularly toxic mercury compound {{that has been used}} in murders, as it contains not only mercury but also cyanide, leading to simultaneous cyanide poisoning. The drug n-acetyl penicillamine has been used to treat mercury poisoning with limited success.|$|E
