500|$|Emeco's {{chairs are}} {{manufactured}} by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania through a two-week, 77-step process. Eames Demetrios, {{the grandson of}} designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called [...] "77 Steps." [...] Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, cut to length, and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding. Workers grind down the welding joints {{to give it a}} smooth finish, creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece. The chair goes through a repeated heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>cycle</b> that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally swivel chair bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.|$|E
2500|$|South America became {{linked to}} North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene, {{bringing}} a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive marsupial faunas. The {{formation of the}} Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic <b>cooling</b> <b>cycle</b> began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off {{the remnants of the}} Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about [...] (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000years.|$|E

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} at typical jetliner cruising altitudes is generally very dry and cold; the outside air {{pumped into the}} cabin on a long flight {{has the potential to}} cause condensation which might in turn cause corrosion or electrical faults, and is thus eliminated. Consequently, when humid air at lower altitudes is encountered and drawn in, the ECS dries it through the warming and <b>cooling</b> <b>cycle</b> and the water separator mentioned above, so that even with high external relative humidity, inside the cabin it will usually be not much higher than 10% relative humidity.|$|E

This is particularly useful in buildings subject to stratification where without frequent air circulation, hot air rises and separates from the cooler air that falls.|$|E

5000|$|A female crested {{only has}} to mate with a male once in order to lay 2 eggs every 4-6 weeks for upwards of 8-10 months. Sperm {{retention}} ensures that the eggs the female lays will remain fertile throughout her breeding cycle. After those 8-10 months, females in the wild go through a [...] "cooling" [...] cycle, usually prompted by slight temperature and daylight changes over the winter season.

Of the two ħk kicks the atom receives in each <b>cooling</b> <b>cycle,</b> the first cools, and the second heats: a simple description of laser cooling which enables us to calculate a point at which these two effects reach equilibrium, and therefore define a lower temperature limit, known as the Doppler cooling limit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cooling</b> <b>cycle</b> {{starts with}} liquid ammonia {{entering}} the evaporator at room temperature. The {{volume of the}} evaporator {{is greater than the}} volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the partial pressure of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the boiling point of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator's interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature, until it reaches that boiling point. It then continues to evaporate, without the liquid descending below the boiling point, while the large enthalpy of vaporization (heat) flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.|$|E
