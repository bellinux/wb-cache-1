40|$|Abstract-In this paper, we {{consider}} a deadline <b>constrained</b> <b>traffic</b> {{and analyze the}} joint effects of packet queuing and adaptive modulation (AM) for packet transmission in MIMO systems. We present a general analytical procedure, and derive the achievable delay-bound violation probability, the packet loss rate, and the average throughput of AM in MIMO wireless links employing orthogonal space time block coding (STBC) over Nakagami fading channels. In the proposed analytical procedure, we use statistical delay-bound for deadline <b>constrained</b> <b>traffic</b> based on the effective bandwidth theory. Based on our performance analysis, we propose a cross-layer design, which selects the optimal target packet error rate of AM at the physical layer, to minimize the packet loss rate and maximize the average throughput, when combined with packet queuing at the data link layer. Numerical results demonstrate that the system performance depends on various parameters, and show the performance gain due to cross-layer design. We also discuss briefly possible applications of our proposed modeling to quality of service guarantee in multiuser scenarios. I...|$|E

Hence, in locations where intensification occurs, greater concentrations of traffic tend to occur, and this worsens local environmental conditions. This phenomenon is defined below as the ‘paradox of intensification’. The consequent challenges for planners and policymakers which arise are considered. The analysis suggests that a compromise involving limited intensification would merely redistribute the balance between the two sets of problems: global and local.

40|$|Dynamic flow {{corridors}} are a Next Generation Air Transportation System Trajectory-Based Operations concept {{designed to}} increase airspace capacity by enabling high density traffic flows and self-separation operations. In this research, a novel concept which uses dynamic flow corridors as a new Traffic Management Initiative to resolve demand-capacity imbalances, called the Flow Corridor-based Traffic Management Initiative (FC-TMI) is proposed, designed, demonstrated and analyzed. The FC-TMI forms and dissolves flow corridors based on demand, traffic patterns, dynamic weather and the necessity to resolve demand-capacity imbalances, thus providing structure only when needed without unnecessarily <b>constraining</b> <b>traffic.</b> The flow corridor network is redesigned at fixed intervals throughout the day in order to adapt to traffic patterns and also to be safe from weather hazards.

Two types of traffic smoothing are considered: global reshaping (when traffic on all network connections is smoothed) and local reshaping (when the traffic specification is changed only for a single connection). The conditions when reshaping is beneficial are derived and the optimal values of traffic model parameters are obtained. In particular, it is shown that, when one tries to minimize end-to-end delay bounds for leaky bucket <b>constrained</b> <b>traffic,</b> the traffic either should be made Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or should not be reshaped at all.

The channel random process is transformed into an extended Markovian setup through hidden Markov models (HMM) and the solution of the resulting optimization problem is shown to be a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

The UK government has made its funding contribution towards major local transport investment conditional on introducing some form of complementary innovative Transport Demand Management measures such as road user charging (RUC). It is intended that this will help <b>constrain</b> <b>traffic</b> and generate local funding contributions towards schemes.

This paper presents {{a case study of}} the project, outlining its development and explaining the public consultation process used and its findings.

The findings reveal that a communication strategy is vital, that WPL is not perceived as the most equitable of systems by many stakeholders but can be considered as an easy and quick policy to implement where the transport funding needs outweigh the negative aspects. WPL could perhaps be considered as a precursor to full RUC as the costs and technological barriers to RUC are reduced. It is also shown that promoters need to produce complementary strategies in order to assist implementation of WPL at an early stage in scheme development. This includes measures for assistance with employer travel planning and parking restraint.
