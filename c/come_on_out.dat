5000|$|Steiner was {{featured}} {{in a series of}} well-known television promos from ESPN's This is SportsCenter comical promo campaign. In 1999, amid fears of the Y2K situation, Steiner starred in a promo where the SportsCenter cast spoke about a [...] "contingency plan" [...] at ESPN's studios after Y2K, and Steiner {{was featured}} wearing a tie as a head band (along with Braveheart-style face paint) and screaming the phrase [...] "Follow me to freedom!" [...] He later screamed this phrase at Wrigley Field after singing Take Me Out to the Ballgame on August 31, 2005. A second promo featured Steiner being traded from ESPN to Melrose Place in exchange for actor Andrew Shue. While Shue delivers a straight-up report on a meeting with Paul Tagliabue, Steiner is then seen wearing shorts and introduces himself to Laura Leighton (in character as [...] "Sidney Andrews") as the new [...] "pool boy" [...] in the show's apartment complex. Steiner starred in a third promo with boxer Evander Holyfield. In the opening shot, Evander questions Stuart Scott about Steiner's assessment that Holyfield is only the [...] "50th best heavyweight of all-time"; Stuart then deadpans that he meant [...] "the 50th best heavyweight [...] - [...] in Georgia". In the final scene, an angry Holyfield is seen roaming the halls of ESPN screaming, [...] "Charley! <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> and get your whoopin'! Charley, <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>out!</b> Steiner!". Steiner is seen cowering under a desk. In probably his funniest promo for the This is SportsCenter campaign, Steiner talks about how at ESPN the personalities can cover the sports that they enjoy and he says that his is boxing. During the promo several personalities try to pick a fight with him and he walks away from them all until the end when Steiner is getting into his car and Otto the Orange comes up to him and Steiner takes out all of his frustrations out on Otto by punching him square in the face. A clip of this promo was used on SportsCenter's coverage of a 2002 Indianapolis Colts - Philadelphia Eagles game in which the Eagles were defeated by numerous Colts players who'd gone to Syracuse University, the home of the Syracuse Orange and Otto.|$|E

[...] In 1961 {{it was announced that}} Wolfe was writing an (unproduced) screenplay for Tony Curtis about Hugh Hefner and Playboy magazine. In 1963 it was announced that Wolfe was writing the (unproduced) screenplay adaptation of Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer. <b>Come</b> <b>On</b> <b>Out,</b> Daddy was published in 1963, an expansion of bitter stories recently published in Playboy and Cavalier (as Andrew Foxe) about Gordon Rengs, a novelist and screenwriter, and his tawdry adventures in Hollywood. A short story collection, Move Up, Dress Up, Drink Up, Burn Up was published in 1968. In the late 1960s he taught at UCLA. Harlan Ellison solicited two stories ("The Girl with Rapid Eye Movements", about Gordon Rengs and the generation gap) to appear in his 1972 science fiction anthology, Again, Dangerous Visions. Wolfe wrote an autobiography, Memoirs of a Not Altogether Shy Pornographer (1972), the title of which alludes to Kenneth Patchen’s Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer. His novel Logan’s Gone (1974), a return to the character of Gordon Rengs, features contemporary politics with campus protests and Vietnam veterans.|$|E
