40|$|Silicosis {{and coal}} worker's {{pneumoconiosis}} are serious occupational respiratory diseases {{associated with the}} coal mining industry and the inhalation of respirable dusts containing crystalline silica. The {{purpose of this study}} (funded by the Mine Health and Safety Council of South Africa) was to evaluate the individual contributions of underground coal mining tasks to the respirable dust and respirable silica dust concentrations in an underground section by sampling the respirable dust concentrations at the intake and return of each task. The identified tasks were continuous miner (CM) cutting, construction, transfer of coal, tipping, and roof bolting. The respirable dust-generating hierarchy of the tasks from highest to lowest was: transfer of coal > CM right cutting > CM left cutting > CM face cutting > construction > roof bolting > tipping; and for respirable silica dust: CM left cutting > construction > transfer of coal > CM right cutting. Personal exposure levels were determined by sampling the exposures of workers performing tasks in the section. Respirable dust concentrations and low concentrations of respirable silica dust were found at the intake air side of the section, indicating that air entering the section is already contaminated. The hierarchy for personal respirable dust exposures was as follows, from highest to lowest: CM operator > <b>cable</b> <b>handler</b> > miner > roof bolt operator > shuttle car operator, and for respirable silica dust: shuttle car operator > CM operator > <b>cable</b> <b>handler</b> > roof bolt operator > miner. Dust control methods to lower exposures should include revision of the position of workers with regard to the task performed, positioning of the tasks with regard to the CM cutting, and proper use of the line curtains to direct ventilation appropriately. The correct use of respiratory protection should also be encouraged. [URL]...|$|E

Whereas in its infancy, it {{focused primarily on}} country music, the show has branched out considerably and has featured several high-profile celebrity guests, such as Jenny McCarthy, Bill Engvall, UFC fighters Chuck Liddell, Forrest Griffin, and Matt Hughes, Piers Morgan, Larry the <b>Cable</b> Guy, Chelsea <b>Handler,</b> Jorge Cruz, and many more.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the United Kingdom has no {{facility}} for {{the disposal of}} any waste above the low level category, indicating that all intermediate and high level waste, apart from spent fuel, has to be stored {{on the site of}} origin. To meet this storage requirement, nuclear sites are resorting to converting existing buildings or contemplating the construction of dedicated facilities, resulting in considerable cost implications. These financing aspects not only concern the construction strategy but also impinge on the ultimate decommissioning costs associated with each particular nuclear site. This paper reports on an investigation to apply the commercially available interlocking hollow block system to the design of a store for drums of radioactive waste. This block system can be quickly, and cost effectively, erected and filled with a choice of dense material. Later, the store can be dismantled with a minimum of disposable radioactive waste and the complete facility re - erected at another location if required, considerably reducing both capital construction and decommissioning costs. The investigation also encompassed a detailed review of the equipment required to place the drums of waste into the store, resulting in a scheme for a remotely operated vehicle that did not rely on umbilical control <b>cables.</b> The drum <b>handler</b> design included for 100 % redundancy of all functions, meaning that whichever component failed, the handler was always recoverable to effect the necessary repair. The ultimate aim of the waste drum store review was to produce a facility that was as safe as a conventionally constructed unit, but at a lower overall building and decommissioning cost...|$|R
