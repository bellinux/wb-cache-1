5000|$|Many {{species are}} notorious pests on plants. Well-known {{examples}} of prostigmatan plant parasites are {{species of the}} gall mites (Eriophyidae, e.g. the redberry mite Acalitus essigi), Tarsonemidae (e.g. the <b>cyclamen</b> <b>mite,</b> Steneotarsonemus pallidus), and the spider mites of the Tetranychidae (e.g. the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae).|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{cyclamen}}</b> <b>mite</b> (Phytonemus pallidus) {{is a tiny}} mite {{often found}} as a pest on African violets and cyclamen plants. It is invisible to the naked eye, measuring only 0.01 inch (0.02 cm) at maturity. It requires a warm, humid environment, and is therefore problematic primarily in greenhouses.|$|E
50|$|While little pest {{management}} {{research has been}} done on the majority of tarsonemid species, comprehensive studies have been made into the biological and chemical control of the <b>cyclamen</b> <b>mite</b> and the broad mite. Chemical trials demonstrated that endosulfan and dicofol consistently reduced densities of P. latus and S. pallidus, and planting stock can be effectively decontaminated through fumigation with methyl bromide or 1,2-dibromoethane. Three entomogenous fungi, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, can effectively manage broad mite infestations, with B. bassiana providing the greatest reduction. Predatory phytoseiid mites, in the genus Neoseiulus, can also successfully control P. latus and S. pallidus under greenhouse and field conditions.|$|E
