5|$|Barmouth Bridge (Welsh: Pont Abermaw), {{also known}} as Barmouth Viaduct, is a {{single-track}} largely wooden railway viaduct that carries the Cambrian Coast Railway across the River Mawddach estuary {{on the coast of}} Cardigan Bay, Wales. It sits between Morfa Mawddach and Barmouth in Gwynedd and caters for rail, foot and <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced by the current swing bridge section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic</b> until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic,</b> as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Optical {{buffering}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} obstacles in optical packet switching (OPS) networks. We proposed the network global control strategy to resolve this problem. By introducing the <b>cycled</b> <b>traffic</b> at the edge node and the slot assignment algorithm at the core node, a slotted OPS networks with no contention can be realized. In this network, a good throughput, end to end delay and delay jitter performance can be gotten at high load simultaneously, so it may be a promising candidate for the future optical networks.

50|$|McIntosh County is {{noteworthy}} {{for being the}} only county in its area having no <b>cycled</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. There are two flashing lights in the county, however. One is at the four-way stop intersection of US-17 and GA-99 in Eulonia, {{and the other is}} at the intersection of US-17 and First Street in downtown Darien. There have been discussions in Darien of placing a traffic signal at the intersection of GA-251 and US-17, {{as well as at the}} Interstate 95 exit ramps on GA-251, as traffic flow has increased in Darien in recent years. However, no definite plans have been made in regards to potential future traffic signals.|$|R
25|$|A Danish road {{directorate}} {{states that}} in town centres {{it is important}} to be able to cycle in both directions in all streets, and that in certain circumstances, two-way <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic</b> can be accommodated in an otherwise one-way street.|$|E
25|$|Indirect methods involve {{reducing}} the infrastructural capacity dedicated to moving motorized vehicles. This can involve {{reducing the}} number of road lanes, closing bridges to certain vehicle types and creating vehicle restricted zones or environmental traffic cells. In the 1970s the Dutch city of Delft began restricting private car traffic from crossing the city centre. Similarly, Groningen is divided into four zones that cannot be crossed by private motor-traffic, (private cars must use the ring road instead). Cyclists and other traffic can pass between the zones and cycling accounts for 50%+ of trips in Groningen (which reputedly has the third highest proportion of <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic</b> of any city). The Swedish city of Gothenburg uses a similar system of traffic cells.|$|E

The model includes three main dynamical modes, accelerated, decelerated and null state. We will show the description of the mathematical modeling used to simulate the system. The simulation was developed under an event driven strategy and implemented in Matlab. Regarding to the numerical analysis, we built a bifurcation diagram where the parameter under variation is the <b>cycle</b> of <b>traffic</b> lights.

25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and <b>cycle</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E

30|$|NICT {{proposed}} a BAN superframe structure for TG 6 [9]. The structure consists of active portion and inactive portion. The active portion is sequentially {{divided into three}} portions: the beacon, the contention access period (CAP), and the contention-free period (CFP) as shown in Figure 2. PTS, CAP, and CFP are called priority access period (PAP). The CAP supports contention-based channel access for one-time prompt traffic, such as device association/deassociation, bandwidth request, and some low duty <b>cycle</b> <b>traffics.</b> The CFP supports scheduled channel access for periodical traffics and QoS guaranteed traffics, such as medical waveforms and stream of audio and video. The priority access period (PAP) is immediately after the beacon in the superframe. The PAP is comprised of priority time slot (PTS) which is a physical time period immediately after the beacon, and embedded PAP, which are the unoccupied slots in both CAP and CFP. The PTS in the superframe provides guaranteed channel access only for emergency traffic.|$|R

The concepts and empirical results obtained by these two procedures are compared and contrasted. The interesting findings are: (1) the composite index of 12 leading indicators performs very well as a qualitative and quantitative predictor and (2) the empirical results obtained by the NBER approach are, in general, consistent with those obtained by the time series approach. ...|$|R

Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease with atherosclerotic plaques containing inflammatory infiltrates predominantly consisting of monocytes/macrophages and activated T cells.

Since DCs were demonstrated in human arteries in 1995, numerous studies in humans suggest a role for these professional antigen-presenting cells in atherosclerosis. Aim. This paper focuses on the observations made in blood and arteries of patients with atherosclerosis. In principal, flow cytometric analyses show that circulating myeloid (m) and plasmacytoid (p) DCs are diminished in coronary artery disease, while immunohistochemical studies describe increased intimal DC counts with evolving plaque stages. Moreover, mDCs and pDCs appear to behave differently in atherosclerosis. Yet, the origin of plaque DCs and their relationship with blood DCs are unknown. Therefore, several explanations for the observed changes are postulated. In addition, the technical challenges and discrepancies in the research field are discussed. Future. Future studies in humans, in combination with experimental animal studies will unravel mechanisms leading to altered blood and plaque DCs in atherosclerosis. As DCs are crucial for inducing but also dampening immune responses, understanding their life <b>cycle,</b> <b>trafficking</b> and function in atherosclerosis will determine potential use of DCs in antiatherogenic therapies...|$|R
