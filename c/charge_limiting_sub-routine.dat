40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the behavior of}} electron bunch charge produced in an L-band normal conducting radio frequency cavity (RF gun) from Cs 2 Te photocathodes illuminated with ps-long UV laser pulses when the laser transverse distribution consists of a flat-top core with Gaussian-like decaying halo. The produced charge shows a linear dependence at low laser pulse energies as expected in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime, while its dependence on laser pulse energy is observed to be much weaker for higher values, due to space <b>charge</b> <b>limited</b> emission. However, direct plug-in of experimental parameters into the space charge tracking code ASTRA yields lower output charge in the space <b>charge</b> <b>limited</b> regime compared to measured values. The rate of increase of the produced charge at high laser pulse energies close to the space <b>charge</b> <b>limited</b> emission regime seems to be proportional {{to the amount of}} halo present in the radial laser profile since the charge from the core has saturated already. By utilizing core + halo particle distributions based on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi-analytical emission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge {{for a wide range of}} RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement uncertainties.

40|$|Electron {{emission}} is {{a requirement}} for most forms of space electric propulsion, {{as well as many}} other space applications. For many such missions minimizing system power is critical to the viability of the mission. The generation of electrons requires an amount of power that varies depending on the source (cold cathode and thermionic sources are considered here, not hollow cathode or other sources requiring consumables) but regardless of the source, the electrons must leave as a beam that has sufficient power (velocity) to escape the spacecraft. The space <b>charge</b> <b>limit</b> refers to the maximum current that can cross a gap (the sheath between the spacecraft and the surrounding plasma for example) at a given velocity, and thus is a practical lower bound to the beam power required for a given current. For many systems, especially those using low-power electron sources, this means that power must be added to the electron beam, usually with biased grids. The minimization of this electron beam power requirement is the topic of this paper. Analytic solutions for the space <b>charge</b> <b>limit</b> in simple geometries have been developed up to three dimensions, and these demonstrate some basic performance tradeoffs. Less practical for the analytical approach are more complicated geometries and the addition of spacing and timing factors. These complications, however, can allow significant improvement in the space <b>charge</b> <b>limit.</b> Therefore, using particle-in-cell computer simulations (with the XOOPIC code developed at Berkley), a number of techniques for mitigating the space <b>charge</b> <b>limit</b> have been investigated, ranging from atypical geometries to spatial and chronological phasing of emission. Some of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} some techniques, and the implications for electron emission system design, will be presented here. Pl as m aem itt er spacecraf...|$|R
