40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{atmospheric}} CO 2 {{budget in the}} Amazon basin, focusing {{on the role of}} shallow and deep convective systems. The vertical redistribution of CO 2 is numerically simulated using an Eulerian transport model coupled to the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS). The transport model includes grid-scale advection, diffusion in the PBL (Planetary Boundary Layer) and convective transport by sub-grid shallow and deep moist convection. In the simulation, the mass conservation equation is solved for six tracers, including or not the shallow and deep moist convection terms. The rectifier effect is also showed through simulation of the transport to the free troposphere of PBL air masses with low CO 2 concentrations due to assimilation by vegetation during the afternoon, when both CO 2 fixation and convection are at their peak. The model is applied to simulate July 2001 with a 30 km grid resolution covering the northwest part of South America. We compare the model results with airborne CO 2 observations collected in the Amazon basin during the 2001 <b>CLAIRE</b> <b>field</b> campaign...|$|E

50|$|With the sub-par 1987 {{performance}} {{fresh in}} their minds, General Manager Fred <b>Claire</b> and <b>Field</b> Manager Tom Lasorda knew {{what needed to}} be fixed. They started the off-season by allowing poor performers such as Glenn Hoffman, Ken Landreaux and Phil Garner explore the free agent market. On December 11, 1987, Claire pulled the trigger on a trade that helped solidify the Dodgers’ defense and bullpen, despite giving up one of the top pitchers of the National League in 1987 in Bob Welch. The Dodgers acquired shortstop Alfredo Griffin and relief pitchers Jay Howell and Jesse Orosco in a three-team trade ironically with the Athletics and Mets, the two teams they would eventually defeat in the ’88 postseason. In an attempt to boost the offense for the upcoming season, the Dodgers signed Mike Davis on December 15, 1987. The biggest move of the off-season was still to come.|$|R
5000|$|Russell Clifford Durant (called [...] "Cliff" [...] by his friends) was a {{race car}} driver, {{speedboat}} enthusiast, amateur flier, President of Durant Motors in Oakland, and son of General Motors founder William [...] "Billy" [...] Crapo Durant. In 1916, he established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street. The first experimental transcontinental airmail through-flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, with Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta (pictured right) at the controls of the Junkers F 13 re-badged as the model J.L.6. The airfield served only secondary duties after 1927, as its runway was not long enough for heavily loaded aircraft. In April 1930, test pilot Herbert [...] "Hub" [...] Fahy and his wife Claire hit a stump upon landing, flipping their plane and mortally wounding Hub without injuring <b>Claire.</b> Durant <b>Field</b> was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles (4 mi) southwest.|$|R
5000|$|Despite winning [...] "Most Popular Serial" [...] in the 1992 Australian Logies, plus actors Bruce Samazan and Simon Baker (then {{known as}} Simon Baker-Denny) both winning their {{respective}} categories in 1992 and 1993, {{it came as}} a blow to cast and crew that E Street had been cancelled by Network 10 early 1993. It was revealed by creator and Executive Producer Forrest Redlich on the DVD release The Best of Mr Bad Part 2 that the cancellation was more due to creative differences and the direction Network 10 wanted to take the show, than falling viewing figures. A series of high-profile cast departures also damaged the show's reputation, with long-running and popular characters Wheels, Sheridan Sturgess, Steven Richardson, Joey Valentine, <b>Claire</b> <b>Fielding,</b> Toni Windsor and Craig [...] "C.J" [...] Jones all exiting during the show's last 12 months. A final blow was dealt when viewer favourite and a pivotal character from the start Reverend Bob Brown was dramatically killed off when Tony Martin quit the show, and it was announced soon after that E Street had been cancelled. Storylines were hastily wrapped up, and in the final episodes (403 and 404), the remaining cast were placed in life-threatening or cliff-hanger situations: Jo-Jo (Kelley Abbey) battled the attentions of a sleazy loan-shark, several characters were trapped inside the blazing Patchetts Pacific pub and Max and Alice were lost in the outback as Bonnie relapsed and slipped into a coma. When the final episode began, time had moved on seven weeks and gradually it was revealed that all the characters are alive and well having survived the previous episodes' various cliff-hangers. The cast gathered around comatose Bonnie's hospital bedside and each read a line from a poem Max had found in recently deceased Rev. Bob's prayer book. As the last line was read out by Max, Bonnie finally opened her eyes and said; [...] "Max!". A final 10-minute montage of E Streets greatest moments was then played out to the closing credits, with Elly tearfully laying a single red rose on Rev Bob's grave as E Streets final scene, thus suitably signifying the end of the four-year series.|$|R
50|$|This brought Hoddinott a {{national}} profile, which {{was followed by}} a string of commissions by leading orchestras and soloists.

50|$|During the 1990 season, E Streets viewing figures {{began to}} rapidly climb {{and the arrival}} of deranged, drug-addicted Sonny Bennett (Richard Huggett) sent ratings soaring. This character, Lisa Bennett's brother and hell-bent on revenge, signalled another shake up of the cast and no less than five {{established}} characters were disposed of during this period - three members of the Patchett family perished in a highly shocking car-bomb explosion - but it was these scenes that shook up the audience figures and the show was soon nearing the top of the ratings and became the most talked about series on Australian television. A super-bitch with shoulder pads, Sheridan Sturgess arrived, taking over the local TV station WTV8, and the role was given to Kate Raison, another actress famous for her four-year run in A Country Practice (as Cathy Hayden). Sheridan became central to E Streets next big storyline; the arrival of the notorious serial killer Steven Richardson, a.k.a. 'Mr Bad' (Vince Martin). The 1991 season was dominated by this long and convoluted plot which cleverly affected every cast member over an entire year. More high-profile contract-cast were killed off during this grisly but utterly compelling storyline, leaving viewers wondering {{who was going to be}} killed-off next. The audience lapped up Sheridan's Technicolor nightmare sequences revealing the murder of a little girl called Becky Campbell by a man with his face painted half black and half silver. That person was of course Steven Richardson, the charming Karate teacher of <b>Claire</b> <b>Fielding,</b> and as Sheridan grew more fearful of Steven, Mr Bad's reign of terror began with the shocking murder of Dr Virginia Travis (Julieanne Newbould) followed soon after by Sheridan's brother Michael (Graham Harvey). E Street had undoubtedly moved on from its well-meaning inception. The opening title sequence was eventually dropped, the pace and melodrama breathlessly increased and cast turnover became exceptionally high; however, the soap continued to develop its audience and E Street finally topped the Australian ratings for the first time during 1991. Viewers had seemingly accepted the drug abuse, religious cults and crazy stalkers - plus the problematic re-cast of the leading character Dr Elly Fielding when Penny Cook quit and was replaced by Diane Craig - because, all along, the show did not take itself seriously and this made the relentless and sensational plots somewhat enjoyable as a form of escapism. Indeed, during the rest of 1991 and most of 1992, E Street was the most popular serial in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Claire {{continued}} as the Dodger general manager through the 1997 season. When Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, {{owner of the}} Fox network and 20th Century Fox purchased the team in 1998, officials stated that <b>Claire</b> and <b>Field</b> Manager Bill Russell would remain in their positions. On May 15, 1998, new Dodger officials made a blockbuster trade without the involvement or knowledge of General Manager Claire, a move that was unheard of in baseball at the time. The trade {{was one of the}} biggest in Dodger history. The Dodgers traded Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich and Bobby Bonilla. Claire was furious that the new FOX officials would make such a deal as Piazza had been with the organization for over a decade and Zeile had signed for less than market value to be closer to his home in suburban Santa Clarita, CA. Claire, who had full control of player transactions before FOX took over, pulled no punches when he was asked his feeling on the trade. On June 21, 1998 Claire and Russell were both relieved of their duties in what was deemed by those in baseball as the [...] "Sunday Night Massacre." [...] Russell was replaced by Glenn Hoffman, Claire by Tom Lasorda.|$|R
50|$|Research by Dom. Jean <b>Claire</b> in the <b>field</b> of {{modality}} {{has shown}} that the third and eighth modes have had their dominants raised from B to C. In mode III is E authentic; the dominant a fifth above is B, which in many chants is raised to C in official editions. Not only are many chants in mode III and VIII in need of melodic restitution, there are errors in all other modes. The Munsterschwarzach-Group (Godehard Joppich, Stefan Klockner et al.)(publishers of the Beiträge zur Gregorianik) have been issuing their own melodic restitutions, as has Anton Stingl, and Geert Maassen with his Fluxus.notation. Whereas some of the researchers are hoping to establish an Urtext edition, others have given this up as unrealistic and prefer not to mix manuscripts into 'editorial soup' but to respect them as local variants in their own right. In 2010 Con Brio, Regensburg, published the Graduale Novum, pro Dominicis et Festis, which is another step along he way of melodic restitution, and judging by some essential critique, not the last word on the issue.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} a painted {{vision of the}} tropics as a space desirable and strange, redolent of fear and longing, bewilderment and comfort. Three painters from the French tradition provide {{the foundation of the}} research: Matisse, who concentrated on the formal element of its physical appearance; Gauguin, who immersed himself in an experiential lived involvement; and Henri Rousseau, who dreamed only of the tropics via his imagination. Local Far North Queensland painters, including Ray Crooke, Margaret Olley, Ian Smith, Helen Wiltshire, James Baines, Claudine Marzik, Laurine <b>Field,</b> <b>Claire</b> Souter and Amanda Feher, demonstrate a continued fascination with the tropics. These painters allow us to revisit the vision of the French painters Matisse, Gauguin and Rousseau. Their experiences display the nuances of the wet tropic landscape by what they see as well as the projection of their inner thoughts. Crooke's attention focuses on the forms of the vegetation and the peopled world within it, while Olley responds to the mildew and colour. Smith, Wiltshire and Baines best describe the negative impact of urban stresses to tropical nature, in which the tropical habitat is seen as threatened by urban expansion. Marzik and Field bring insight into the sensory components of the tropics through its texture and spiritual dimensions, while Souter and Feher utilise the tropical landscape for its motifs and symbols. As a response to the French painters' vision of the tropical world and the case study surveys, I have painted suites of work that reflect the tropical experience. The process of reflection considers the objects of the external physical world combined with imagination. My paintings participate in the tropical vision by expressing the characteristics that shape the imagery, and by the personal journey described within them. The paintings image the tropics using devices of portraiture, landscape and mythological narrative, expressed in the lexicon of postmodern painting...|$|R
