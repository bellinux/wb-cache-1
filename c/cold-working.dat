50|$|<b>Cold-working</b> processes, {{in which}} the product’s shape is altered by rolling, {{fabrication}} or other processes while the product is cold, can increase {{the strength of the}} product by a process called work hardening.

50|$|American {{glass artist}} Harvey Littleton was a tenured {{professor}} of art at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when, in June 1974, he taught a workshop in <b>cold-working</b> techniques for glass artists. To cold-work glass is to shape or sculpt cold (as opposed to hot or molten) glass, or to produce texture or decoration on its surface. <b>Cold-working</b> is done by carving, grinding or engraving glass with various tools, or by selectively blasting it with abrasives. As a result of experimenting with various resists for sandblasting, Littleton became intrigued {{by the possibility of}} printmaking from glass. He asked his colleague at the University of Wisconsin, printmaker Warrington Colescott, to ink five of the sandblasted plates from the workshop and print them onto paper in his etching press. The first plate broke under pressure, but after making some adjustments to the press, the rest of the glass plates printed “like dreamboats,” Colescott said. Editions printed from the plates looked promising, and Littleton was awarded a research grant from the University of Wisconsin to continue the development of printing from glass.|$|E

50|$|By 1972 Eisch {{was putting}} less time into free-blown glass sculpture. Instead, he devoted {{himself to the}} {{creation}} of sculptures from which ceramic molds for glass-blowing were made. His series of heads, including those of Harvey Littleton, Thomas Buechner, Picasso and the Buddha, and his “Blister-finger” series of works, were all mold-blown. This allowed Eisch to concentrate his efforts not only on sculpting but also on engraving and painting on glass. In using different <b>cold-working</b> techniques to create imagery on each piece in his series, along with distorting the hot glass sculpture as it came from the mold, Eisch made virtually identical mold-blown pieces into individual, unique statements.|$|E

It is then descaled with rollers, sheared into blanks, and transferred several successive forming stages, during which it is upset, preformed, final forged, and pierced (if necessary).

50|$|Cold-rolled {{sheets and}} strips come in various conditions: full-hard, half-hard, quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} skin-pass, involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent <b>cold-working</b> processes where good ductility is required.|$|E
50|$|NiTi alloy was {{developed}} in 1960 by William F. Buehler {{who worked at the}} Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Silver Springs, Maryland. The name Nitinol came from Nickel (Ni), Titanium (Ti), Naval Ordinance Laboratory (nol). The first Nickel titanium (NiTi) orthodontic alloy, introduced by Andraeson. This alloy was based on the research done by Buehler. Since their introduction, the wires made out of Niti alloys have become an important part of orthodontic treatment. The composition of the wire has 55% Nickel and 45% Titanium. The first nickel-titanium orthodontic wire alloy was marketed by the Unitek Corporation who are now known as 3M Unitek. These alloys have low stiffness, superelasticity, high springback, large elastic range and were brittle. The initial niti wires did not have shape-memory effect due to the <b>cold-working</b> of the wire. Thus these wires were passive and were considered as an Martensitic-Stabilized alloy.|$|E
50|$|Nobles metals such as gold, platinum, iridium, {{silver and}} their alloys were used {{early on in}} the field of Orthodontics because of their good {{corrosion}} resistance. Some of the other qualities that these alloys had were high ductility, variable stiffness (with heat), high resilience and ease of soldering. Disadvantages of these alloys were: Less elasticity, less tensile strength and greater cost. Composition of both platinum and palladium raised the melting point of the alloy and made it corrosion resistant. Copper material, along with the <b>cold-working</b> of the material, gave the strength to the alloy. The alloy composition of the wires made of noble metals would be Gold (55%-65%), Platinum (5-10%), Palladium (5-10%), Copper (11-18%) and Nickel (1-2%). These composition were similar that of Type IV Gold casting alloys. Edward Angle first introduced the German Silver in orthodontics in 1887 when he tried replacing the noble metals in this practice. At that time, John Nutting Farrar condemned Angle for using a material which lead to discoloration in the mouth. He then in 1888, started altering the alloy composition around the German Silver. However, Angle's composition were extremely difficult to reproduce and therefore, the usage of Silver-based alloys did not get popular in orthodontics. Angle was also known to use materials such as rubber, vulcanite, piano wire and silk thread.|$|E

40|$|Whereas the higher-order {{versions}} of the finite element method (p and hp-versions) are fairly well established as highly efficient methods for monitoring and controlling the discretization error in linear problems, little {{has been done to}} exploit their benefits in elasto-plastic structural analysis. In this paper, we discuss which aspects of incremental elasto-plastic finite element analysis are particularly amenable to improvements by the p-version. These theoretical considerations are supported by several numerical experiments. First, we study an example for which an analytical solution is available. It is demonstrated that the p-version performs very well even in cycles of elasto-plastic loading and unloading, not only as compared with the traditional h-version but also with respect to the exact solution.
