The addition of GeH₃CH₃ also eliminates sidewall tapering and enables Ge nanowire growth at temperatures exceeding 475 °C, which greatly expands the process window. User-programmable diameter modulation is demonstrated without kinking using tetramethyltin (Sn(CH₃) ₄) or trimethylsilane (SiH(CH₃) ₃) reacting directly on the sidewalls of growing nanowires to either block or allow conformal deposition. Catalyst modification with tetramethyltin is demonstrated to tune growth kinetics and provides further control over nanowire design.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} a new optoelectronic quenched avalanche photodiode sensor (QAPD), with the potential of enabling high resolution imaging through turbid media with femtosecond lasers. Our target application is for imaging cancer in the human breast. We aim to improve the contrast ratio of the unscattered, image bearing photons by reducing or removing the large background of multiply scattered photons that result in poor spatial resolution. The approach that we are taking is to use temporal discrimination: ultra-short (less than a picosecond) laser pulses and time gated detection can select only those photons which travel almost straight through the tissue. The feasibility of resolving a 1 mm structure in 50 mm turbid tissue sample, using our system, will be discussed [...] there are no results reported to date that approach this performance. We aim to enhance the detection of short pulses through time resolved single photon counting. In this technique, the earliest arriving photon of the transmitted pulse is detected with a Quenched Avalanche Photo Diode (QAPD).

40|$|The present thesis {{details the}} {{extensive}} calibration and characterization of two CdTe-based semiconductor detectors equipped with Timepix-class readout chips, and presents first results of polarimetric measurements conducted with these sensors. The readout's Time-over-Threshold mode {{provides a means}} to measure the energy deposited {{in each of the}} 65 k sensor pixels, opening the way for a compact and versatile Compton polarimeter for the high-energy X-ray regime that is commonly encountered at, e. g., laser-generated plasmas. Since each pixel features its own dedicated set of <b>conversion</b> <b>electronics,</b> an individual calibration of every pixel is mandatory if the full potential of the energy-sensitive detection mode is to be exploited. Exposures to both gamma and X-ray fluorescence radiation were used to generate the necessary data. In addition, a range of MATLAB programs and classes was created to facilitate the lengthy analyses. The final obtainable energy resolution is on the order of 9 %, with higher bias voltages providing some potential for improvement while simultaneously increasing the observed detector noise. The fraction of charge-sharing events, i. e. those that encompass multiple pixels, was found to conform with expectations, increasing with the incident photon's energy while, for a given energy, being somewhat lower at higher bias voltages. Furthermore, a two-detector Compton polarimeter was constructed where two Timepix detectors are arranged around a passive scattering target of approximately 1 cm diameter, covering azimuthal scattering angles that differ by 90 °. This setup was first tested at DESY's PETRA III accelerator. The observed stark contrast between radiation scattered parallel and perpendicular to the incident photon electric field vector confirms the setups' fitness for Compton polarimetry in the energy range of some 100 keV. By adding a Tantalum plate collimator to further restrict the scattering angle of the incident photons, the contrast between both detectors was enhanced by an additional 18 %. In this configuration, the setup almost reached the contrast theoretically expected for an ideal Compton polarimeter...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} condensers are {{an essential}} component in many energy <b>conversion,</b> <b>electronics</b> and process systems. Increased capacity and functionality with less and less available space has been a main driving force for development of smart condensers in energy systems. A literature survey of microchannel condensation shows that microchannels are useful for enhancing condensation heat transfer. Our previous {{work in this area}} has demonstrated that manifold microgroove heat exchangers operating in single-phase or two-phase modes offer substantially higher heat transfer performance with a greatly reduced pumping power when compared to state-of-art microchannel heat exchangers. Out previous microchannel condensation experiments was using have involved use of small scale manifold microgroove condensers (7 cm 2 base area) and a manifold microgroove condenser of this size and capacity has not been investigated before. The goal is to enhance heat transfer performance while minimizing the pumping power, volume and weight. A compact lightweight manifold microgroove condenser, with 60 x 600 micron microgrooves and cooling capacity of 4 kW, was fabricated, assembled and tested using two different manifold designs. Experiments using R 134 a and R 236 fa as working fluids and two different refrigerant side manifolds were performed. Overall heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop across a manifold microgroove condenser were calculated and refrigerant side heat transfer coefficient was determined based on water side heat transfer coefficient. 4 kW capacity was achieved with an LMTD of 8 C. The manifold geometry was found to have a large effect on pressure drop and heat transfer performance as well as flow distribution. A majority of the pressure drop was found to be in the manifold creating poor flow distribution. Future work should focus on optimization of the refrigerant manifold design to reduce pressure drop, increase heat transfer and flow distribution as well as explore the effect of microchannel geometry. Unfortunately current stage of development CFD optimization techniques does not allow optimization of two-phase flow system. An optimization of the airside surface and manifold geometry of heat exchanger that potentially will be coupled with high performance condenser has been performed. It has been concluded that for high performances of single phase flow manifold flow area has to be comparable to microgrooves flow area...|$|E

The project includes data gathering efforts and documentation of the state-of-the-art design approaches that are being used by microturbine manufacturers in their power <b>conversion</b> <b>electronics</b> development and refinement. This project task entails a review of power converters used in microturbines sized between 20 kW and 1 MW. The power converters permit microturbine generators, with their non-synchronous, high frequency output, to interface with the grid or local loads. The power converters produce 50 - to 60 -Hz power that can be used for local loads or, using interface electronics, synchronized for connection to the local feeder and/or microgrid. The power electronics enable operation in a stand-alone mode as a voltage source or in grid-connect mode as a current source. Some microturbines are designed to automatically switch between the two modes. The information obtained in this data gathering effort will provide a basis for determining how close the microturbine industry is to providing services such as voltage regulation, combined control of both voltage and current, fast/seamless mode transfers, enhanced reliability, reduced cost converters, reactive power supply, power quality, and other ancillary services.
