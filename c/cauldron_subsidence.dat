Based on the GPS data, we reconstructed its three-dimensional shape, which resem-bles an elongated rhomboid with subvertical walls and a flat roof at map-scale. At outcrop-scale, the roof contact is characterised by numerous steps and cuspate indentations interpreted as signs of mag-matic stopping. From this, we conclude that the main volume of the pluton was created by <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence,</b> whereas the roof was subsequently reshaped by magmatic stopping...|$|E

The wood’s Point dyke swarm, Victoria, consists of a set of abundant subparallel narrow dykes with occasional elliptical expansions (“bulges”) intruded into strongly folded Lower Palaeozoic sediments. The swarm represents a hisly differentiated calc-alkaline rock series derived by fractional crystallization of a single parent magma, possibly of periodotitic composition. The rock types present include both high and low Cr-Ni periodotites, pyroxenite, hornblendite, hornblende diorite and monzonite, biotite leucodiorite, and minor residual granophyre. Apart from this hornblende-bearing rock series, a few hornblende-free basaltic dykes of related chemical composition but intruded later, are petrographically and mineralogically distinct, displaying tholeiitic tendencies. The latter dykes appear to be genetically related to volcanics underlying the Upper Devonian Acheron and Cerberean <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidences.</b> Fractional crystallization, flowage differentiation, crystal accumulation and chilling were important factors {{in the development of the}} members of the dyke swarm, whilst assimilation in situ was not. The dykes are zonod, ultramafic types having more basic interiors (“cores”) whereas basic to intermediate composition bulges have more basic margins (“rims”). Magmalic copper-nickel sulphides rich in precious metals (Pt, Pd, Au) occur in dyke bulges of all compositions, especially close to margins where they accumulated by gravitational settling or were trapped by chilling. The sulphides have high Cu/Ni (and Co/Ni) ratios indicative of a highly evolved magma and, along with Au, Pd and Ir are fractionated between dykes of different silicate compositions. The base metal contents of silicates and sulphides vary sympathetically. The dykes have undergone pervasive hydrothermal alteration during which sulphides were largely recrystallised and Au was leached from some copper-nickel sulphides. A zonal arrangement of increasing intensity of alteration inwards was observed in one ultramefic dyke bulge. Later the dykes were deformed and the basic to intermediate composition dykes were fractured and veined, and major gold deposits formed. The veins have associated wall rock alteration which may be mineralogically subdivided into inner and out zones. Dyke bulges, ultramafic rocks, copper nickel sulphides and Au mineralization are all concentrated along two main lineations paralleling the fold axes of the sedimentary trough. The eastern and more important trend (at the centre of the trough) marks the eastern limit of the dyke swarm except at its northern end. These lineations may represent deep-seated fractures which controlled the later upward migration of Au-bearing hydrothermal solutions from depth. The source of the Au could have been various rock types present at depth, including copper-nickel sulphides and Lower Palaeozoic sediments. Open Acces...|$|R

Traditionally, the Horne deposits and the intracauldron deposits have been interpreted to occur within the same stratigraphic interval. Even though they share some characteristics such as mineral zoning patterns, alter-ation assemblages, and an association with synvolcanic faults, the two deposit groups are clearly distinguishable. Intracauldron massive sulfide deposits are small (< 5 Mt), Cu-Zn-rich, concordant mounds associated with interflow horizons and are closely linked to vent zones where synvolcanic faulting provided hydrothermal fluids with cross-stratal structural permeability.

The batholith comprises four roughly concentric granite intrusions from the margin inwards: pyterlite, coarse-grained porphyritic rapakivi granite and two types of medium-grained porphyritic rapakivi granite. Also porphyry aplite and even-grained rapakivi granite occur. The batholith has intruded as a succession of pulses of subhorizontal sheet-like intrusions conceivably through repeated <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Natural stone quarries are confined only to certain intrusions within the batholith. We show that the medium-grained porphyritic granite body in {{the centre of the}} batholith comprises two almost identical but different intrusions, with only slightly different appearances: the inner (IG) and the outer (OG) granite. The quarries are confined to the outer intrusion which has an appearance more attractive to the market than that of the inner intrusion.

A Permian sub-greywacke type sequence consists of some 1300 feet of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and limestone, deposited on a stable to mildly-unstable shelf. Disconformably overlying the Permian are rocks belonging to the Triassic ystem which have been grouped tentatively into three formations. The Permian and Triassic are extensively and complexly injected by dolerite and mineralogical variations from the normal tholeiitic dolerite to granophyre have been traced. Liquid immiscibility is present towards the base of the sill. The Jurassic structure Is interpreted as <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence</b> faulting accompanied by dolerite intrusion as transgressive to concordant sills, lopolithic near the root zone. Various Tertiary faults combine to form a stepped graben, the axis of which trends NW - SE on echelon, resulting in the formation of a chain of lakes and lowlands. In late Tertiary times, large outpouring of olivine basalt and associated tuffs at least 350 feet thick overran the lakes and filled the valley to a depth of some hundreds of feet. The basalts have been mapped into several flows. Five periods of volcanism have been recognized, the inter-basaltic periods being marked by either lake sediments or fossil forests.

40|$|Nepheline natrolite syenites of Center 2 of the Coldwell {{alkaline}} complex exhibit rare wispy mafic-rich modal layering, extensive xenolith-rich {{zones and}} {{a wide variety of}} textural types, the latter resulting from the imposition of high temperature shearing and recrystallization on consolidated syenite. The textures developed range from allotriomorphic granular to porphyroclastic to mosaic granulob-lastic. The nepheline syenites are pyroxene-poor. Pyroxenes occur most commonly as corroded diopside to diopsidic hedenbergite cores surrounded by amphibole and less commonly as acmitic hedenbergite overgrowths upon cores of iron-rich amphiboles. Amphiboles are the dominant mafic phase and range from magnesian hastingsitic hornblende to hastingsite to hastingsitic hornblende to ferroedentic hornblende. Nephelines contain excess silica and have not equilibrated to compositions characteristic of low temperatures. Feldspars lack microcline twinning and perthites and have undergone extensive ion exchange at high sub-solidus temperatutes with sodium-rich fluids. Formation of late stage primary and replacement natrolite, muscovite and thomsonite is characteristic. The nepheline syenites are considered {{to be a part of}} a cycle of continental rift magmatism and to have been emplaced by <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence</b> as a hot hydrous magma. The rocks did not undergo long term subsolidus re-equilibration as the high temperature mineral assemblage has been preserved by uplift during post-intrusive regional block faulting.

40|$|Small mesothermal vein quam-gold-base-metal sulfide {{deposits}} {{from which}} some 20 t of Au-Ag bullion have been extracted, {{are the most}} common gold deposits in the Georgetown region of north Queensland-several hundred were mined or prospected between 1870 and 1950. These deposits are mostly hosted by Proterozoic granitic and metamorphic rocks and are similar to the much larger Charters Towers deposits such as Day Dawn and Brilliant, and in some respects to the Motherlode deposits of California. The largest deposit in the region-Kidston (> 138 t of Au and Ag since 1985) - is substantially different. It is hosted by sheeted quartz veins and cavities in brecciated Silurian granite and Proterozoic metamorphics above nested high-level Carboniferous intrusives associated with a nearby <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence</b> structure. This paper provides new information (K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotopic ages, preliminary oxygen isotope and fluid-inclusion data) from some of the mesothermal deposits and compares it with the Kidston deposit. All six dated mesothermal deposits have Siluro-Devonian (about 425 to 400 Ma) ages. All nine of such deposits analysed have delta(18) O quartz values in the range 8. 4 to 15. 7 parts per thousand, Fluid-inclusion data indicate homogenisation temperatures in the range 230 - 350 degrees C. This information, and a re-interpretation of the spatial relationships of the deposits with various elements of the updated regional geology, is used to develop a preliminary metallogenic model of the mesothermal Etheridge Goldfield. The model indicates how the majority of deposits may have formed from hydrothermal systems initiated during the emplacement of granitic batholiths that were possibly, but not clearly, associated with Early Palaeozoic subduction, and that these fluid systems were dominated by substantially modified meteoric and/or magmatic fluids. The large Kidston deposit and a few small relatives are of Carboniferous age and formed more directly from magmatic systems much closer to the surface...|$|E
40|$|A plug-like {{intrusion}} of Karroo dolerite, near Dordrecht in the Eastern Cape of the Republic, is described. Field mapping with the, aid of aerial photographs {{has revealed that}} the contact of the intrusion, for the most part, dips very steeply outwards. In the south- eastern and eastern areas, however, sheet- or sill-like forms appear to be given off from the main intrusion. In plan view the intrusion is roughly oval shaped, its longer axis being aligned in a north-westerly direction. Its surface area measures approximately 60 square kilometres (24 square miles). A large number of xenoliths composed exclusively of Stormberg sediments, pyroclastic rocks and minor lavas, {{are to be found}} cropping out within the dolerite intrusion. These xenoliths, many of which occur in positions far above or below their normal stratigraphic elevation, are extremely variable in size - the largest having an area of approximately 15 square kilometres (6 square miles). The xenoliths represent fragments of the original "roof" of sediments and pyroclastics which have collapsed into and been engulfed by the dolerite magma. This type of dolerite intrusion is known as a "belljar" intrusion. A superficial classification of the dolerites, based chiefly on textural and certain mineralogical features, is presented. In the area surrounding the main intrusion are a number of dolerite dikes and sheets. The youngest phase of igneous activity is represented by the Dragon's Back dike, which cuts across the complex in a north-westerly direction. Several veining phenomena, as well as an interesting variety of metamorphic and metasomatic rocks, are associated with the main dolerite intrusion. Six diatremes are situated {{in the vicinity of the}} intrusion. Pyroclastic rocks are represented by a variety of types, and are to be found outside the area of the intrusion, and as xenoliths within it. A tentative interpretation of the mechanism of formation of the intrusion, which appears to be related to volcanic activity and <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence,</b> is presented...|$|E
40|$|The Messum igneous complex (MIC) {{lies within}} the ENE-trending zone of Lower Cretaceous (132 Ma) Damaraland {{intrusive}} complexes in Namibia, intruded into Pan-African Damara basement. It {{is defined by}} a roughly circular structure 18 km in diameter, the bounding ring fault exposed along the eastern sector. Encircling Messum are the volcanic sequences of the Goboboseb Mountains, comprising a lower basalt series (Tafelkop and Tafelberg types) followed, with intervening basalts, by four voluminous quartz latite (QL) eruptions (Goboboseb and Springbok QL units). Inferred stages of development are: (a) an initial very broad basaltic lava shield, comprising the Tafelberg and Tafelkop basalts, and Messum crater basalts (MCB: possibly ponded in near-vent lava lakes). Embedded within the lower basaltic sequence is a localised rhyolite-dominated eruptive centre (ca. 5 km in diameter), interpreted as a funnel caldera located towards {{the centre of the}} MIC. (b) Downsagging, extending northwards from Messum, following the Goboboseb QL eruptions (≥ 2300 km). Ponding of overlying basaltic units.

Uplift/resurgence within the MIC has accompanied intrusion of the moat granitoids and mafic cone sheets, thereby juxtaposing volcanic and intrusive sequences. Phases of both subsidence and uplift have characterised the MIC. The NW Scotland Tertiary central igneous complexes and Messum show evidence of a number of parallel developments, but also important differences. The MIC differs markedly from caldera systems within the western USA and circum-Pacific. Messum is therefore suggested to represent a distinct class of intrusive/extrusive central complex, although probably common in large igneous provinces...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{research}} was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the emplacement of rapakivi granite intrusions, as well as the emplacement of gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids in structurally controlled mineralizations. Based on investigations of the magnetic fabric, the internal structures could be analysed and the intrusion mechanisms for rapakivi granite intrusions and respectively different deformation stages within gold-bearing shear and fault zones identified. Aeromagnetic images revealed circular structures within the rapakivi granite batholiths of Wiborg, Vehmaa and Åland. These circular structures represent intrusions that eventually build up these large batholiths. The rapakivi granite intrusions of Vehmaa, Ruotsinpyhtää within the Wiborg batholith and Saltvik intrusions within the Åland batholith all show bimodal magnetic susceptibilities with paramagnetic and ferromagnetic components. The distribution of the bimodality is related to different magma batches of the studied intrusions. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) reveals internal structures that cannot be studied macroscopically or by microscope. The Ruotsinpyhtää and Vehmaa intrusions represent similar intrusion geometries, with gently to moderately outward dipping magnetic foliations. In the case of Vehmaa, the magnetic lineations are gently plunging and trend in the directions of the slightly elongated intrusion. The magnetic lineations represent magma flow. The shapes of the AMS ellipsoids are also more planar (oblate) in the central part of the intrusion, whereas they become more linear (prolate) near the margin. These AMS results, together with field observations, indicate that the main intrusion mechanism has involved the subsidence of older blocks with successive intrusion of fractionated magma during repeated <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The Saltvik area within the Åland batholith consists of a number of smaller elliptical intrusions of different rapakivi types forming a multiple intrusive complex. The magnetic fabric shows a general westward dipping of the pyterlite and eastward dipping of the contiguous even-grained rapakivi granite, which indicates a central inflow of magma batches towards the east and west resulting from a laccolitic emplacement of magma batches, while the main mechanism for space creation was derived from subsidence. The magnetic fabric of structurally controlled gold potential shear and fault zones in Jokisivu, Satulinmäki and Koijärvi was investigated in order to describe the internal structures and define the deformation history and emplacement of hydrothermal fluids. A further aim of the research was to combine AMS studies with palaeomagnetic methods to constrain the timing for the shearing event relative to the precipitation of ferromagnetic minerals and gold. All of the studied formations are dominated by monoclinic pyrrhotite. The AMS directions generally follow the tectonic structures within the formations. However, internal variations in the AMS direction as well as the shapes of the AMS ellipsoids are observed within the shear zones. In Jokisivu and Satulinmäki in particular, the magnetic signatures of the shear zone core differ from the margins. Furthermore, the shape of the magnetic fabric in the shear zone core of Jokisivu is dominated by oblate shapes, whereas the margins exhibit prolate shapes. These variations indicate a later effect of the hydrothermal fluids on the general shear event. The palaeo-magnetic results reveal a deflection from the original Svecofennian age geomagnetic direction. These results, coupled with correlations between the orientation of the NRM vectors and the magnetic and rock fabrics, imply that the gold-rich hydrothermal fluids were emplaced pre/syntectonically during the late stages of the Svecofennian orogeny...|$|E
40|$|The Santa Eulalia {{plutonic}} complex (SEPC) is a late-Variscan granitic body {{placed in}} the Ossa-Morena Zone. The host rocks of the complex belong to metamorphic formations from Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic. The SEPC is a ring massif (ca. 400 km 2 area) composed by two main granitic facies with different colours and textures. From the rim to the core, there is (i) a peripheral pink medium- to coarse-grained granite (G 0 group) involving large elongated masses of mafic and intermediate rocks, from gabbros to granodiorites (M group), and (ii) a central gray medium-grained granite (G 1 group). The mafic to intermediate rocks (M group) are metaluminous and show wide compositions: 3. 34 – 13. 51 wt% MgO; 0. 70 – 7. 20 ppm Th; 0. 84 – 1. 06 (Eu/Eu*) N (Eu* calculated between Sm and Tb); 0. 23 – 0. 97 (Nb/Nb*) N (Nb* calculated between Th and La). Although involving the M-type bodies and forming the outer ring, the G 0 granites are the most differentiated magmatic rocks of the SEPC, with a transitional character between metaluminous and peraluminous: 0. 00 – 0. 62 wt% MgO; 15. 00 – 56. 00 ppm Th; and 0. 19 – 0. 42 (Eu/Eu*) N; 0. 08 – 0. 19 (Nb/Nb*) N [1][2]. The G 1 group is composed by monzonitic granites with a dominant peraluminous character and represents the most homogeneous compositional group of the SEPC: 0. 65 – 1. 02 wt% MgO; 13. 00 – 16. 95 ppm Th; 0. 57 – 0. 70 (Eu/Eu*) N; 0. 14 – 0. 16 (Nb/Nb*) N. According to the SiO 2 vs. (Na 2 O+K 2 O–CaO) relationships, the M and G 1 groups predominantly fall in the calc-alkaline field, while the G 0 group is essencially alkali-calcic; {{on the basis of}} the SiO 2 vs. FeOt/(FeOt+MgO) correlation, SEPC should be considered as a magnesian plutonic association [3]. New geochronological data (U-Pb on zircons) slightly correct the age of the SEPC, previously obtained by other methods (290 Ma, [4]). They provide ages of 306  2 Ma for the M group, 305  6 Ma for the G 1 group, and 301  4 Ma for the G 0 group, which confirm the late-Variscan character of the SEPC, indicating however a faintly older emplacement, during the Upper Carboniferous. Recent whole-rock isotopic data show that the Rb-Sr system suffered significant post-magmatic disturbance, but reveal a consistent set of Sm-Nd results valuable in the approach to the magmatic sources of this massif: M group ( 2. 9 < Ndi < + 1. 8); G 1 group ( 5. 8 < Ndi <  4. 6); G 0 group ( 2. 2 < Ndi <  0. 8). These geochemical data suggest a petrogenetic model for the SEPC explained by a magmatic event developed in two stages. Initially, magmas derived from long-term depleted mantle sources (Ndi < + 1. 8 in M group) were extracted to the crust promoting its partial melting and extensive mixing and/or AFC magmatic evolution, thereby generating the G 1 granites (Ndi <  4. 6). Subsequently, a later extraction of similar primary magmas in the same place or nearby, could have caused partial melting of some intermediate facies (e. g. diorites) of the M group, followed by magmatic differentiation processes, mainly fractional crystallization, able to produce residual liquids compositionally close to the G 0 granites (Ndi <  0. 8). The kinetic energy associated with the structurally controlled (<b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence</b> type?) motion of the G 0 liquids to the periphery, would have been strong enough to drag up M group blocks as those occurring inside the G 0 granitic ring...|$|E
40|$|The Birds River Gabbro Complex is intruded into sediments of the Karroo Stormberg Group in {{the area}} SW of Dordrecht in the northeastern Cape. A geochemical investigation, {{restricted}} to the igneous rock suite, gabbro-ferrogabbro-ferrotholeiite, presents new major-element data as well as data for twelve trace elements - Ba, Sr, Rb, Zr, Y, Nb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, V and Cr. The strong degree of differentiation of Kokstad-type tholeiitic magma in the Birds River intrusion, as noted by previous investigators, is revealed in variation diagrams in which data are plotted against a simple index of fractionation. Later differentiates are strongly enriched in Si, Ti, Fe, Na, K, P, Ba, Rb, Zr, Y, Nb, Zn and Cu but depleted in Mg, Ca, AI, Ni, Co and Cr. Extreme differentiation resulted in a strong depletion of Ti, Fe, P, Cu and V in the most highly evolved ferrotholeiites. Field evidence suggests the initial emplacement of strongly fractionated magmatic residua derived from fractional crystallization processes in a magma chamber at depth during <b>cauldron</b> <b>subsidence</b> of a mass of sediments within an annular fracture. These porphyritic, in part glassy, ferrotholeiites are enriched in Si, Na, K, Ba, Zr, Rb, Y, Nb and Zn and were engulfed by a later episode of renewed hypabyssal intrusive activity from the original source area. The younger gabbro was emplaced {{in a series of}} closely-spaced heaves or pulses of relatively undifferentiated Kokstad-type magma. The gabbro differentiated in place to form ferrogabbros which chemically closely approximate ferrotholeiite compositions. toidal facies. Residual liquids crystallized as a pegmatoidal facies. A simple fractional crystallization path, modelled {{on the assumption that the}} gabbro and ferrotholeiite form a continuous series, indicates that the least evolved ferrotholeiite can be derived from the initial gabbro composition by the fractionation of major amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene but lesser amounts of olivine. Crystallization and removal of magnetite and other Fe-oxides were relatively more important during the later stages of differentiation. The variation of major- and trace-elements in tholeiitic Karroo magma under conditions of strong differentiation at Birds River serves as a framework for the regional study of the geochemistry of other Karroo dolerites and volcanics of the north-eastern Cape. New geochemical data are presented for a sample of thirty chilled and coarse-grained Karroo dolerites collected throughout the north eastern Cape. For the most part, the chilled dolerites are relatively undifferentiated and the average composition differs only slightly from that determined by Walker and Poldervaart (1949). Variation diagrams reveal the steady increase in Si, Al, Ca, Na, K and P and the residual trace elements Ba, Zr, Rb, Y, Nb and Zn with increasing differentiation of the dolerites from more basic types. The concentrations of K, Ba and Rb are highly variable in some Karroo dolerites while new data suggest that Nb levels in the dolerites are low, being generally less than 10 ppm. The strong variation of the K-related elements (K, Ba and Rb) as well as the large ranges determined for certain inter-element ratios, such as K/Rb, Zr/Nb and K/Zr in the chilled Karroo dolerites, suggest that factors other than fractional crystallization processes need to be considered to account for individual variations. Little correlation exists between petrographic type as defined by Walker and Poldervaart (1949) and geochemical character. New geochemical data are also presented for ten Karroo basaltic lavas from the lowermost horizons of the lava sequence exposed in the Barkly East area. Major- and trace-element data indicate that these earliest Karroo extrusives are on average enriched in Si and Rb but depleted in Co and Ni when compared with the averaged chilled Karroo dolerite. Compared with basalts from Lesotho, the Barkly East basalts are enriched in Si but depleted in Ni and possibly Nb, Cu and V. The andesite is markedly enriched in Si, Na, K, Ba, Sr, Rb, Zr and Nb but depleted in Mg, Ca, V, Ni, Cu, Co and Cr. The subdued rate of Ni depletion and the absence of olivine as a major phenocryst phase in the series basalt to andesite, in the Barkly East area, suggests that differentiation trends may be controlled by the fractional crystallization of orthopyroxene and plagioclase, the two common phenocrysts present in these volcanics. The strong depletion of V and Cu in the andesite may indicate some magnetite removal during fractional crystallization...|$|E
