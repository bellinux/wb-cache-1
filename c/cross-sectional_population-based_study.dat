40|$|Objectives: Inflammation is {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of depression. A few <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>studies</b> have found that depression is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers.

We investigated the bidirectional association between suPAR levels and use of antidepressants. Methods: suPAR level was measured in 9305 blood donors and analysed in relation to 5 -years follow-up data on purchase of antidepressants and hospital diagnoses of depression from a nationwide Danish register. Results: For men and women without prior use of antidepressants we found a significantly higher risk for incident use of antidepressants with higher suPAR values.

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to provide a summary {{overview}} of blindness and visual impairment on the context of recent Brazilian ocular epidemiologic studies. Synthesis of data from two <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>studies</b> - the São Paulo Eye Study and the Refractive Error in School Children Study is presented. 3678 older adults and 2441 school children were examined between July 2004 and December 2005. Prevalence of blindness in older adults using presenting visual acuity was 1. 51 % decreasing to 1. 07 % with refractive correction. The most common causes of blindness in older adults were retinal disorders, followed by cataract and glaucoma. In school children, the prevalence of uncorrected visual impairment was 4. 82 % decreasing to 0. 41 % with refractive correction. The most common cause of visual impairment in school children was uncorrected refractive error. Visual impairment and blindness in Brazil is an important public health problem. It is a significant problem in older Brazilians, reinforcing the need to implement prevention of blindness programs for elderly people with emphasis on those without schooling. In school-children cost-effective strategies are needed to address a readily treatable cause of vision impairment - prescription and provision of glasses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Gastric {{inhibitory}} polypeptide (GIP) is postulated to {{be involved}} in type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. It exerts its function through its receptor, GIPR. We genotyped three GIPR SNPs (rs 8111428, rs 2302382 and rs 1800437) in German families with at least one obese index patient, two case-control <b>studies</b> and two <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>studies.</b> Methods Genotyping was performed by MALDI-TOF, ARMS-PCR and RFLP. The family-study: 761 German families with at least one extremely obese child or adolescent (n = 1, 041) and both parents (n = 1, 522). Case-control study: (a) German obese children (n = 333) and (b) obese adults (n = 987) in comparison to 588 adult lean controls. The two <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> studies: KORA (n = 8, 269) and SHIP (n = 4, 310). Results We detected over-transmission of the A-allele of rs 2302382 in the German families (p TDT-Test = 0. 0089). In the combined case-control sample, we estimated an odd ratio of 1. 54 (95 %CI 1. 09; 2. 19, p CA-Test = 0. 014) for homozygotes of the rs 2302382 A-allele compared to individuals with no A-allele. A similar trend was found in KORA where the rs 2302382 A-allele led to an increase of 0. 12 BMI units (p = 0. 136). In SHIP, however, the A-allele of rs 2302382 was estimated to contribute an average decrease of 0. 27 BMI units (p-value = 0. 031). Conclusion Our data suggest a potential relevance of GIPR variants for obesity. However, additional studies are warranted in light of the conflicting results obtained in one of the two <b>population-based</b> <b>studies.</b> </p...|$|R
