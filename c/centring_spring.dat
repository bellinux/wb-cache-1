5000|$|Like {{almost all}} UK-approved amateur-built designs the RAF 2000 {{is subject to}} Civil Aviation Authority Mandatory Permit Directives, similar to {{airworthiness}} directives for certified aircraft. As of January 2010 these MPDs include repetitive inspections for rotor blade cracks, a one time installation of an emergency egress placard, a one time replacement of control system components and a one time inspection of rudder cables. As {{a result of a}} fatal accident [...] the CAA issued an MPD in 2009 which indicates that the design does not fully comply with the required BCAR Section T and that as a result unmodified aircraft are subject to a number of restrictions including flight with doors being prohibited, VNE limited to 70 mph and crosswind limited to 7 knots for take-off and landing, maximum 15 knots windspeed with a 10 knot gust spread are prohibited from flight in moderate or higher turbulence. Many of these restrictions can be removed by modifying the aircraft with a tailplane/rudder <b>centring</b> <b>spring</b> and new doors, although the 70 mph VNE is retained on both modified and unmodified aircraft flown in the UK.|$|E

50|$|The bogie was {{connected}} with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the <b>centring</b> <b>springs</b> of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie. The carrying axle was {{in the form of}} an Adams axle, and therefore had greater articulation than the bogie.|$|R

50|$|Hawker <b>centres</b> <b>sprang</b> up {{in urban}} areas {{following}} the rapid urbanisation in the 1950s and 1960s. In many cases, they were built partly {{to address the problem}} of unhygienic food preparation by unlicensed street hawkers. More recently, they have become less ubiquitous due to growing affluence in the urban populations of Malaysia and Singapore. Particularly in Singapore, they are increasingly being replaced by food courts, which are indoor, air conditioned versions of hawker centres located in shopping malls and other commercial venues.|$|R
5000|$|Hannes Marker felt {{he could}} improve on the concept, and in 1953 he {{introduced}} the [...] "Duplex" [...] toe. The Duplex used two small wedge-shaped metal clips that fit over the toe of the boot's sole, holding it down, and used a spring {{in order to keep}} the boot centred. During a fall, the clips could be forced outward against their <b>centring</b> <b>springs,</b> allowing it to release the toe. Like the Nevada, the Duplex used a cable binding for the heel.|$|R
5000|$|The town {{came into}} being {{initially}} as a resting place for bullock teams lying at the convergence of three bullock tracks from Morven, Tambo, and Charleville. Originally called Burenda it was renamed Ellangowan (still {{the name of the}} local watering hole) and when gazetted in 1883 called Augathella. This is apparently an Indigenous Australian word meaning [...] "camp on a waterhole", referring the Warrego River. A service <b>centre</b> <b>sprang</b> up to service their needs and the needs of the burgeoning grazing industry.|$|R

40|$|An {{aircraft}} {{fatigue test}} rig {{consists of a}} number of vertically mounted hydraulic jacks which are connected to the underside of an aircraft and are used to apply to the aircraft a prescribed loading pattern. Each jack is fitted with a pressure-ratio valve which is used to amplify or attenuate the input pressure signal generated from a common source. Part 1 dealt with the derivation of the static characteristics and equations of motion for the system. Part 2 is concerned with the results of (1) analogue computer investigations using these equations of motion and (2) practical experiments carried out on a hydraulic test rig to verify and to complement the results of the com-putations. The value of simultaneously undertaking the computer and test-rig investigations is demonstrated. The valve, in its basic form, is shown to give rise to transient oscillations even when the load has negligible inertia. When inertia loads are introduced, there is a further tendency to oscillate because of the compressibility of the oil. Both oscillations may be damped by the use of valve-spool <b>centring</b> <b>springs</b> and valve-damping ori-fices. The frequency response characteristics of the system over the normal working frequency range are shown to be quite sensitive to changes in the stiffness coefficients of the <b>centring</b> <b>springs</b> and the orifice-damping co-efficients. Recommended values for these parameters are derived and the effects of varying other parameters are considered...|$|R
50|$|The G 2/2+2/3 {{class had}} an {{external}} frame. The {{part of the}} chassis supporting {{the rear of the}} locomotive was pulled forward, and in the centre supported the rear bogie. The boiler was mounted forward of this point, and thus its rear was supported at fulcrum level. The locomotive had no pivot point, as a ball joint provided for steam injection. The bogie was connected with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the <b>centring</b> <b>springs</b> of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{continuous}} warfare with the Habsburgs, several cultural <b>centres</b> <b>sprang</b> {{up in this}} {{far corner of the}} Empire. Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, seen in the famous centres of Constantinople and Edirne, were also seen in the territory of present-day Hungary, where mosques, bridges, fountains, baths and schools were built. Unfortunately, after the Habsburg conquest, most of these works were destroyed and few survive to this day. The introduction of Turkish Baths, with the building of the Rudas Baths, {{was the beginning of a}} long tradition in the territory of present-day Hungary. No less than 75 hammams (steam baths) were built during the Ottoman age.|$|R
50|$|As an {{administrative}} seat, {{the town has}} schools and a hospital. After the Communist era, new facilities such as a hotel, a restaurant and a cultural <b>centre</b> <b>sprung</b> up in the area. The trunk route from the Kosovar border to Tirana and Durrës pass to each side of Rrëshen, providing good communications with the capital and the Adriatic.Before the Second World War, the city was classed as a small village but administrative change and {{a rise in the}} mining industry have boosted the city's status although since the fall of Communism, most of the mines have become disused. This has resulted in mass migration to Tirana and larger more industrial centres.|$|R
50|$|William Adams (15 October 1823 - 7 August 1904) was the Locomotive Superintendent of the North London Railway from 1858 to 1873; the Great Eastern Railway from 1873 until 1878 and the London and South Western Railway {{from then}} until his {{retirement}} in 1895. He {{is best known for his}} locomotives featuring the Adams bogie, a device with lateral <b>centring</b> <b>springs</b> (initially made of rubber) to improve high-speed stability. He should not be mistaken for William Bridges Adams (1797-1872) a locomotive engineer who, confusingly, invented the Adams axle - a radial axle that William Adams incorporated in designs for the London and South Western Railway.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{important}} mines {{appeared in}} the 1750s, in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr, Inde and Wurm where coal seams outcropped and horizontal adit mining was possible. In 1782 the Krupp family began operations near Essen. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the Ruhr Area, which then became part of Prussia {{took advantage of the}} tariff zone (Zollverein) to open new mines and associated iron smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial <b>centres</b> <b>sprang</b> up, focused on ironworks, using local coal. The iron and steel works typically bought mines, and erected coking ovens to supply their own requirements in coke and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms ("Huettenzechen") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called [...] "Konzern." ...|$|R

Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. The Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>centre</b> also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff coming out to homes to remove venomous snakes from inconvenient places.|$|R
