5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} does not, in itself, entitle {{the holder}} to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveler {{must comply with}} the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary from <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country</b> and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many other factors.|$|E
5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country.</b> For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E

This model gets a redesigned grille and is marketed under different trim levels to their Australasian counterparts. Although these vary from <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country,</b> the range consists of the following models in some markets: 2.0 E, 2.0 G, 2.4 E, 2.4 G, 2.4 Sportivo, 2.4 V, 3.5 V, and 3.5 Q. The decimal in the nomenclature denotes the engine displacement, with the letter representing the level of luxury.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country,</b> {{and suggests that}} all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country.</b> Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} indoor {{continental}} competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There {{has not been}} a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

Thus, country F’s exports require lower transportation and insurance costs than country J’s exports. In this case, the wedge between SF and SJ would reflect larger production efficiency differences.|$|R
