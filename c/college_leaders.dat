25|$|The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic {{defense of}} the Latin and Greek {{curriculum}} against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for {{colleges and universities in}} the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter, who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.|$|E
500|$|Important <b>College</b> <b>leaders</b> in the 19th century include John C. Holmes, {{who kept}} the Agriculture School {{from being a}} part of the University of Michigan and is widely {{credited}} with being the prime mover for the school's founding; Joseph R. Williams, the first president; and Theophilus C. Abbot, the third president who stabilized the College after the Civil War. Also of importance was botany professor William J. Beal, an early plant (hybrid corn) geneticist who championed the laboratory teaching method. Another distinguished faculty member of the era was the alumnus/professor Liberty Hyde Bailey. Bailey was the first to raise the study of horticulture to a science, paralleling botany, which earned him the title of [...] "Father of American Horticulture". William L. Carpenter, a jurist who was elected to the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan in 1894, and member of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1902 until 1904. Other famous 19th-century graduates include Ray Stannard Baker, a famed [...] "muckraker" [...] journalist and Pulitzer Prize winning biographer; Minakata Kumagusu, a renowned environmental scientist; William Chandler Bagley, a pioneering education reformer; and Lyman J. Briggs, 1893 graduate and renowned engineer and physicist who was the chairman of the U.S. Uranium Committee before the Second World War.|$|E

He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would [...] "obscure" [...] his [...] "legacy of slavery rather than addressing it". [...] "Yale is part of that history" [...] and [...] "We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it." [...] One change that will be issued is the title of [...] "master" [...] for faculty members who serve as residential <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> will be renamed to [...] "head of college" [...] due to its connotation of slavery.|$|E

He also strengthened the foundations of several buildings on campus in case of an earthquake. Later in his term, he began plans for the Joseph F. Smith Building, completed in 2004. All in all, Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus, including the Barlow Center in Washington D. C.. This center is a place for students to stay and also provide a BYU presence in the city. Athletics programs also saw development under Bateman. Under him, the women's softball team came into being. He was also one of several key <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference, which BYU's athletics program joined. Previously, BYU had been in the Western Athletic Conference. Bateman was instrumental in a push to rename [...] "Cougar Stadium", [...] "LaVell Edwards Stadium" [...] in 2000, in honor of former football coach LaVell Edwards. He also led a push among several universities to reverse an NCAA ruling that games could be scheduled on Sunday (an effort which was unsuccessful). Overall, sports programs flourished under Bateman's tenure. In the computing and technology area, Bateman directed a merging of BYU's computer systems with the LDS Church's, as well as enlarging the resources available to computing majors. A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000, under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, mere hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace.|$|E
