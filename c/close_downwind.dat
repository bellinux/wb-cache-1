40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between interstate air pollution and the division of power between federal and state agencies in setting and enforcing standards. In {{the context of the}} US Clean Air Act we argue that the EPA is able to monitor the adoption of technology-based standards more closely than it can monitor state-level enforcement, and that this causes an effective division of control between federal and state agencies. Our analysis offers three main insights into the interstate pollution problem in this setting. First, states have an incentive to enforce standards less stringently on firms located <b>close</b> to <b>downwind</b> borders, and this leads to excessive interstate pollution in equilibrium. Second, there can arise an inherent substitutability in the regulatory problem between strict standards and compliance effort, and this creates a strategic linkage between the federal policy on standards and state policies on enforcement. In particular, a tighter federal standard can induce less selective enforcement but can also lead to less enforcement overall. Third, states will attempt to neutralize the impact of location-based federal standards (that specifically target interstate pollution) in a way that actually exacerbates the underlying enforcement problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Many insects migrate at {{high altitudes}} where they utilize fast-ﬂowing airstreams for long-distance transport. Nocturnal insect {{migrants}} typically exhibit a strongly unimodal distribution of ﬂight headings (a phenomenon termed ‘common orientation’), {{and the mean}} heading is often aligned downwind. In addition, these nocturnal migrants are sometimes concentrated into shallow altitudinal zones (termed ‘layers’). The mechanism by which widely separated insects select and maintain common ﬂight headings had until recently eluded explanation, but recent theoretical advances have shown that atmospheric turbulence might enable insects to perceive the downwind direction and orient accordingly. This theory predicts that common orientation downwind should be: (1) widespread in nocturnal insect migrants; (2) facilitated when insects are concentrated into layers; and (3) more pronounced in larger insects. We tested these ideas using radar observations of 647 independent nocturnal migration events, and found strong support for all three predictions: (1) common orientation occurred in 75 e 90 % of events; (2) common orientation was more frequent, had signiﬁcantly less scatter and was signiﬁcantly <b>closer</b> to <b>downwind</b> when insects migrated in layers; and (3) large insects exhibited signiﬁcantly tighter orientation than ‘medium-sized’ insects. Our results provide robust evidence that wind-related common orientation is mediated by detection of atmospheric turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the fine-scale spatial {{epidemiology}} {{of malaria}} consistently identify malaria hotspots, comprising clusters of homesteads at high transmission intensity. These hotspots sustain transmission, {{and may be}} targeted by malaria-control programmes. Here we describe the spatial relationship between the location of Anopheles larval sites and human malaria infection in a cohort study of 642 children, aged 1 - 10 -years-old. Our data suggest that proximity to larval sites predict human malaria infection, when homesteads are upwind of larval sites, but not when homesteads are downwind of larval sites. We conclude that following oviposition, female Anophelines fly upwind in search for human hosts and, thus, malaria transmission may be disrupted by targeting vector larval sites in <b>close</b> proximity, and <b>downwind</b> to malaria hotspots. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Community-based {{research}} between Memorial University of Newfoundland and the Indigenous Sorowako Association (KW AS) {{assessed the}} environmental and potential human health impacts of an operational three-decades old laterite nickel mine and smelter in Sorowako, Indonesia. An active air sampler and health questionnaire were {{used in this study}} to assess seasonal and diurnal patterns of air quality and prevalent health conditions. Air was sampled {{with the use of a}} high volume air sampler to determine average total suspended particulates (TSP) and airborne metal concentrations. Twelve-hour air samples were collected over approximately five days and five nights during both the dry and rainy seasons in six communities. The six communities were located at different distances and directions from the nickel mines and smelter. Air samples were also collected at a reference site located further away from the smelter during the rainy season only. The composition of various metals was analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Twenty-four hour dust fall accumulation in approximately 20 households in the seven communities previously mentioned, as well as in 20 homes located on Lake Matano were recorded with an area standardized Kim wipe swipe. Communities <b>closer</b> to and <b>downwind</b> from the smelter had significantly higher mean TSP values in the day of the dry season than communities further away from the smelter. Average concentrations of nickel, cobalt and chromium were higher in the day than in the night in the dry season in communities <b>closer</b> to and <b>downwind</b> from the smelter. There was only a slight significant regression of airborne nickel concentration with increasing distance from the smelter in the day of the dry season (Linear r²= 0. 276, p= 0. 006, Linear r²= 0. 066, p= 0. 207) but not in the night of the dry season. Dust fall accumulation did not vary significantly among the communities, except in Kampung Baru, a site also exposed to sawmill dust. A confidential health questionnaire administered by community volunteers assessed potential links between prevalent health conditions and mining and smelting in the area. Twenty households were selected in a convenience sampling in the eight communities where dust fall accumulation was also studied. Adult and child versions of the questionnaire focused on respiratory and skin health conditions but also surveyed prevalence of other illnesses, and health determinants. Questionnaire responses showed that some health conditions typical of exposure to airborne particulates and nickel, such as asthma, rhinitis, and skin tumours, were more prevalent in areas <b>closer</b> to and <b>downwind</b> from nickel mining and smelting compared to Malili, a community located further away from the mines and smelter. Several positive correlations between ambient air pollution levels, dust fall accumulation in households, and health conditions typically found in nickel industrial areas suggested a potential human health impact of mining and smelting. The community-based investigation provided a foundation for the community to continually monitor, assess, and address environmental and health concerns...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} 'moves' in team racing; the 'pass back' and the 'mark trap.' The goal of the pass back, {{involving}} three boats sailing upwind, is for the leading boat to slow the next (opposing team's) boat {{in order for the}} third boat (of the leading boat's team) to either tack away from the intermediate covering boat, or sail ahead faster than the covering boat. The mark trap is more complicated. It involves one boat stopping at a mark in a position where it can use the RRS to hinder opposing boats rounding the mark, so allowing team-mates to catch up and then sail ahead. Another tactic is for one boat to gybe onto (right of way) starboard tack when <b>close</b> to a <b>downwind</b> mark, forcing boats just behind to do the same and sail considerable extra distance, and so allow team-mates to catch up.|$|R
40|$|Numerous insect species {{undertake}} regular seasonal migrations {{in order}} to exploit temporary breeding habitats [1]. These migrations are often achieved by high-altitude windborne movement at night [2 – 6], facilitating rapid longdistance transport, but seemingly {{at the cost of}} frequent displacement in highly disadvantageous directions (the so-called ‘‘pied piper’’ phenomenon [7]). This has lead to uncertainty about the mechanisms migrant insects use to control their migratory directions [8, 9]. Here we show that, far from being {{at the mercy of the}} wind, nocturnal moths have unexpectedly complex behavioral mechanisms that guide their migratory flight paths in seasonally-favorable directions. Using entomological radar, we demonstrate that free-flying individuals of the migratory noctuid moth Autographa gamma actively select fast, high-altitude airstreams moving in a direction that is highly beneficial for their autumn migration.

40|$|Migratory insects {{flying at}} high {{altitude}} at night often show {{a degree of}} common alignment, sometimes with quite small angular dispersions around the mean. The observed orientation directions are often <b>close</b> to the <b>downwind</b> direction and this would seemingly be adaptive in that large insects could add their self-propelled speed to the wind speed, thus maximising their displacement in a given time. There are increasing indications that high-altitude orientation may be maintained by some intrinsic property of the wind rather than by visual perception of relative ground movement. Therefore, we first examined whether migrating insects could deduce the mean wind direction from the turbulent fluctuations in temperature. Within the atmospheric boundary-layer, temperature records show characteristic ramp-cliff structures, and insects flying downwind would move through these ramps whilst those flying crosswind would not. However, analysis of vertical-looking radar data on the common orientations of nocturnally migrating insects in the UK produced {{no evidence that the}} migrants actually use temperature ramps as orientation cues. This suggests that insects rely on turbulent velocity and acceleration cues, and refocuses attention on how these can be detected, especially as small-scale turbulence is usually held to be directionally invariant (isotropic). In {{the second part of the}} paper we present a theoretical analysis and simulations showing that velocity fluctuations and accelerations felt by an insect are predicted to be anisotropic even when the small-scale turbulence (measured at a fixed point or along the trajectory of a fluid-particle) is isotropic.

40|$|Abstract—Atmospheric inputs of {{pesticides}} transported from California’s Central Valley to the Sierra Nevada mountains (California, USA) were investigated by collecting winter–spring precipitation (rain and snow) from Sequoia National Park {{and from the}} Lake Tahoe basin. Pesticides currently used in California’s Central Valley were detected in snow and rain samples from two elevations in Sequoia National Park (SNP) in the southern Sierras. At the lower elevation site (533 m), chlorothalonil {{was present at the}} highest levels (, 0. 4 – 85 ng/L), followed by malathion (, 0. 046 – 24 ng/L), diazinon (, 0. 21 – 19 ng/L), and chlorpyrifos (1. 3 – 4. 4 ng/ L). At 1, 920 m elevation, chlorothalonil was also present at the highest levels (, 0. 57 – 13 ng/L) followed by diazinon (, 0. 057 – 14 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (1. 1 – 13 ng/L), and malathion (, 0. 045 – 6 ng/L). Trifluralin, a- and g-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and a-and b-endosulfan were also detected at both locations and at lower concentrations, generally ranging from 0. 5 to 2 ng/L. In the Lake Tahoe basin, elevation 2, 200 m, malathion was also found in snow at concentrations ranging from, 0. 046 to 18 ng/L, as was diazinon (, 0. 057 – 7 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (0. 30 – 3. 4 ng/L), and chlorothalonil (0. 66 – 1. 7 ng/L). Chlorothalonil, chlorpryifos, a-and g-HCH, and a-endosulfan were found in surface and deep water samples at two locations in Lake Tahoe and at concentrations similar to those found in snow within the lake basin. Lake Tahoe basin snow samples in general had lower concentrations than those from SNP. This difference in concentration levels reflects the <b>closer</b> proximity of <b>downwind</b> pesticide usage to SNP than th...|$|R
40|$|Most insect {{migrants}} fly at considerable altitudes (hundreds {{of meters}} above the ground) where they utilize fast-flowing winds to achieve rapid and comparatively long-distance transport. The nocturnal aerial migrant fauna {{has been well}} studied with entomological radars, and many {{studies have demonstrated that}} flight orientations are frequently grouped around a common direction in a range of nocturnal insect migrants. Common orientation typically occurs <b>close</b> to the <b>downwind</b> direction (thus ensuring that a large component of the insects’ self-powered speed is directed downstream), and in nocturnal insects at least, the downwind headings are seemingly maintained by direct detection of wind-related turbulent cues. Despite being far more abundant and speciose, the day-flying windborne migrant fauna has been much less studied by radar; thus the frequency of wind-related common orientation patterns and the sensory mechanisms involved in their formation remain to be established. Here we analyze a large dataset of > 600, 000 radar-detected ‘medium-sized’ windborne insect migrants (body mass from 10 to 70 mg), flying hundreds of meters above southern UK, during the afternoon, in the period around sunset, {{and in the middle of}} the night. We found that wind-related common orientation was almost ubiquitous during the day (present in 97 % of all ‘migration events’ analyzed), and was also frequent at sunset (85 %) and at night (81 %). Headings were systematically offset to the right of the flow at night-time (as predicted from the use of turbulence cues for flow assessment), but there was no directional bias in the offsets during the day or at sunset. Orientation ‘performance’ significantly increased with increasing flight altitude throughout the day and night. We conclude by discussing sensory mechanisms which most likely play a role in the selection and maintenance of wind-related flight headings...|$|R
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1207 – 1213 Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element, but an effective toxic at high concentrations. While there is an extensive literature on occupational exposure, {{few studies have examined}} adults and children living near important sources of airborne Mn. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze hair Mn of children living in the vicinity of a ferro-manganese alloy production plant in the Great Salvador region, State of Bahia, Brazil and examine factors that influence this bioindicator of exposure. We examined 109 children in the age range of 1 – 10 years, living near the plant. Four separate housing areas were identified a priori on the bases of proximity to the emission sources and downwind location. A non-exposed group (n = 43) of similar socio-economic status was also evaluated. Mn hair (MnH) concentration was measured by graphite atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Possible confounding hematological parameters were also assessed. Mean MnH concentration was 15. 20 μg/g (1. 10 – 95. 50 μg/g) for the exposed children and 1. 37 μg/g (0. 39 – 5. 58 μg/g) for the non-exposed. For the former, MnH concentrations were 7. 95 ± 1. 40 μg/g (farthest from the plant), 11. 81 ± 1. 11 μg/g (mid-region), 34. 43 ± 8. 66 μg/g (closest to the plant) and 34. 22 ± 9. 15 μg/g (directly downwind). Multiple regression analysis on log transformed MnH concentrations for the exposed children derived a model that explained 36. 8 % of the variability. In order of importance, area of children's residence, gender (girls > boys) and time of mother's residence in the area at the birth of the child, were significantly associated with MnH. Post hoc analyses indicated two groupings for exposure areas, with those living <b>closest</b> to and <b>downwind</b> of the plant displaying higher MnH concentrations compared to the others. The contribution of the time the mother lived in the community prior to the child's birth to the children's current MnH suggests that in utero exposure may play a role. A study of neurobehavioral performance with respect to Mn exposure in these children is currently underway...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Mediterranean basin is {{characterized}} by large concentrations of aerosols from both natural and anthro-pogenic sources. These aerosols affect tropospheric photo-chemistry by modulating the photolytic rates. Three simulations of the atmospheric composition at basin scale have been performed with the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model for the period from 6 June to 15 July 2013 covered by the ADRIMED campaign, a campaign of intense measurements in the western Mediterranean basin. One simulation {{takes into account the}} radiative effect of the aerosols on photo-chemistry, the second one does not, and the third one is designed to quantify the model sensitivity to a bias in the ozone column. These simulations are compared to satellite and ground-based measurements, with a particular focus on the area of Lampedusa. Values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) are obtained from the MODIS instrument on the AQUA and TERRA satellites as well as from stations in the AERONET network and from the MFRSR sun photometer deployed at Lampedusa. Additional measurements from instruments deployed at Lampedusa either permanently or exceptionally are used for other variables: MFRSR sun photometer for AOD, diode array spectrometer for actinic fluxes, LIDAR for the aerosol backscatter, sequential sampler for speciation of aerosol and Brewer spectrophotometer for the total ozone column. It is shown that CHIMERE has a significant ability to reproduce observed peaks in the AOD, which in Lampe-dusa are mainly due to dust outbreaks during the ADRIMED period, and that taking into account the radiative effect of the aerosols in CHIMERE considerably improves the ability of the model to reproduce the observed day-today variations of the photolysis rate of ozone to O 2 and O(1 D), J (O 1 D), and that of NO 2 to NO and O(3 P), J(NO 2). While in the case of J(O 1 D) other variation factors such as the stratospheric ozone column are very important in representing correctly the day-to-day variations, the day-to-day variations of J(NO 2) are captured almost completely by the model when the optical effects of the aerosols are taken into account. Finally, it is shown that the inclusion of the direct radiative effect of the aerosols in the CHIMERE model leads to reduced J(O 1 D) and J(NO 2) values over all the simulation domain, which range from a few percents over continental Europe and the northeast Atlantic Ocean to about 20 % <b>close</b> to and <b>downwind</b> from Saharan dust sources.
