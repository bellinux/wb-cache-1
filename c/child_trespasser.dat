5000|$|According to the Restatement of Torts standard, {{which is}} {{followed}} in many jurisdictions, {{there are five}} conditions that must be met for a land owner to be liable for tort damages to a <b>child</b> <b>trespasser</b> {{as a result of}} artificial hazards.|$|E
50|$|Sioux City & Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout, 84 U.S. 657 (1873), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States that first enunciated {{the idea that a}} {{landowner}} could be liable for the injuries of a <b>child</b> <b>trespasser.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2013, the British Board of Film Classification {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} they had received and evaluated a complaint about the film in that it encouraged <b>children</b> to <b>trespass</b> on the railway tracks. The BBFC noted that the <b>children</b> did <b>trespass</b> on the line, but only to warn an approaching train of the danger of a landslide on the track ahead. The BBFC also pointed out that the film was set in Edwardian times when access to railway lines was not under the same restrictions as modern times.|$|R
50|$|BTF also {{produced}} the controversial The Finishing Line (1976) and Robbie (1979), which warned <b>children</b> against <b>trespassing</b> on railway lines {{and are often}} thought of as Public Information Films.|$|R
40|$|A subrogee insurer {{sued for}} damages to a {{building}} resulting from acts of <b>children</b> <b>trespassing</b> on adjacent land. Three children, at night, observed a tractor standing unguarded {{on a job}} site in a slum district, and began playing. They inadvertently started the tractor, which ran into and damaged the building. Held, recovery against the tractor owner affirmed {{on the basis of}} the attractive nuisance doctrine. Following the usual application of this doctrine, there would seem to be no question of liability to the children had they been injured while so trespassing and playing on the tractor. However, as the children were not injured, but caused injury to the property of another, this is an unusual application...|$|R
5000|$|The {{attractive}} nuisance doctrine {{applies to}} the law of torts, in the United States. It states that a landowner may be held liable for injuries to <b>children</b> <b>trespassing</b> on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children. [...] The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner. The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by abandoned cars, piles of lumber or sand, trampolines, and swimming pools. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.|$|R
30|$|Trespassers at {{the three}} {{selected}} locations were interviewed. The interviewed trespassers consisted of adults (48 %), youngsters (37 %) and elderly people (15 %). In addition, the interviewers observed some <b>children</b> <b>trespassing,</b> but in all cases they were with adults or elderly people, who were chosen for the interview. The reasons for trespassing were asked with an open question rather than alternatives, and the interviewees were able to indicate as many reasons as they wanted. Although the official routes were not more than 300 Â m away at each location, 80 % of interviewees indicated that the most common reason for trespassing was that the route was the shortest and fastest alternative. Other specific answers included that {{it was easy to}} use the route because there was already an existing path (9 %), and that it had become a habit (11 %) to use a specific route. Some of the trespassers also indicated that they had been using the route for many decades.|$|R
5000|$|Hubert Graft - Rebecca Madisons Chief of Security {{and main}} enforcer, a cyborg who blames the Phantom for his condition. He was {{formerly}} an environmentalist who fought against Maximum {{to protect the}} Amazonian rainforest, before losing his whole body below the shoulders in combat. Maximum rebuilt Grafts body using biot parts, giving Rebecca Madison complete control over Grafts life. Grafts biot torso can be disconnected at the hip and integrated into other robotic systems over which Graft has complete control, most commonly the Urban Combat Biot Walker, a ten-foot steel exoskeleton armed with lasers and claws. Despite this, he still has his desire to protect nature, and will work with the Phantom if a bigger threat hits it. In the end the Phantom would ask if {{he would want to}} escape Maximums clutches, but he always turns this offer down. He also is completely against harming children, even if that <b>child</b> <b>trespassed</b> and destroyed invaluable company technology. In the end, after Maximum Inc is defeated, he is mentioned to have been sent to a half-way house. Voiced by Ron Perlman in the first season, and Richard Lynch in the second.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Aldon James of the National Arts Club that adjoins {{the park}} brought about 40 children, mostly minorities, {{into the park}} from the nearby Washington Irving High School on Irving Place. The trustee at the time, Sharen Benenson, called police alleging that the <b>children</b> were <b>trespassing.</b> [...] The police refused to take action. Later, a suit was filed against the park's {{administration}} in Federal Court. The suit was {{settled out of court}} in 2003. Most of the children settled for $36,000 each, while one received $50,000.|$|R
5000|$|When Jerusalem's Lot was {{incorporated}} in 1765, Maine was {{still part of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The town got its name from a myth {{about one of the}} earliest residents, Charles Belknap Tanner, who raised pigs; one of these pigs was named Jerusalem. One day, Jerusalem escaped from her confines into a nearby forest, and became aggressive and wild. Tanner began warning young <b>children</b> who <b>trespassed</b> on his property to [...] "Keep 'ee out o' Jerusalem's wood lot," [...] lest the pig devour them. Eventually, the phrase [...] "Jerusalem's Lot" [...] was adopted as the town name.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a quiet}} supper {{the three}} friends sat down to. Herbert sat {{narrowing}} his eyes over his thoughts, which, when the fancy took him, he scattered out upon the others' silence. Lawford apparently had not yet shaken himself free from the sorcery of the moonlight. His eyes shone dark and full {{like those of a}} <b>child</b> who has <b>trespassed</b> beyond its hour for bed, and sits marvelling at reality in a waking dream.|$|R
5000|$|A {{child was}} injured by a {{railroad}} turntable owned by Sioux City and Pacific Railroad, {{and the company}} was held liable despite the prevailing idea that a landowner was not held liable for injuries to trespassers. <b>Trespassing</b> <b>children</b> {{were thought to be}} a special case that required a higher duty of care. This theory of liability {{came to be known as}} the [...] "turntable doctrine" [...] and later the attractive nuisance doctrine by the case Keffe v. Milwaukee & St. Paul R.R. Co.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{an adult}} {{trespasser}} who is injured {{while on a}} defendant's property cannot sue under a theory of strict liability, even if the landowner was engaged in ultrahazardous activities, such as the keeping of wild animals, {{or the use of}} explosives. Instead, the trespasser must prove that the property owner intentionally or wantonly injured the plaintiff to recover. The exception is a <b>child</b> who is <b>trespassing</b> to play on ultra-hazardous items on the land. Since these trespassers are considered [...] "anticipated" [...] they are excepted under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|We {{were to go}} to {{the theatre}} in the evening. The Carl Rosa Company was giving [...] "Carmen" [...] at the Royal. We went into the dress circle [...] "like giddy dukes," [...] as I said to him, so that I could see his eyes dilate with {{adventure}} again as he laughed. In the theatre, among the people in evening dress, he became once more childish and timorous. He had always the air of one who does something forbidden, and is charmed, yet fearful, like a <b>trespassing</b> <b>child.</b> He had begun to trespass that day outside his own estates of Nethermere.|$|R
40|$|Plaintiff, an eleven-year-old boy, {{was injured}} when a lumber pile {{on which he}} was playing collapsed. The lumber had been ordered by a {{contractor}} and had been piled on the building site by a lumber dealer. The lumber, which allegedly resembled a boat to the plaintiff, was near two public alleys which bordered the building site. The plaintiff brought an action for injuries under the attractive nuisance doctrine against both the contractor and the lumber dealer. Held: Even though the lumber dealer had neither possession or control of the premises, he owed a duty to <b>trespassing</b> <b>children</b> not to create an attractive, dangerous situation; and liability should {{be determined by the}} jury under the ordinary rules of negligence...|$|R
50|$|Many {{naturally}} occurring platforms are unofficial, and simply known among {{the children in}} a community. For example, the <b>children</b> are often <b>trespassing</b> on quarry land, or the like, when they use the platforms. Usually the locals check the water {{to make sure it}} is deep enough and free of clutter, but there is always the danger of a dead fish or beverage can, bottle, branches, or the like floating near the surface of the water. Bad angle of entry can also cause injury {{even in the absence of}} clutter (e.g. broken bones or re-arrangement of internal organs from the impact of the water itself, if landing crooked). Being knocked unconscious by the impact can also lead to drowning.|$|R
40|$|The road {{lightings}} {{have made}} our living environment safe and active, {{since it was}} first installed in 1900 in Korea. As the industry developed, various kind of road lightings have been installed in an outdoor area. But the spilt light from the road lightings have caused health problem like the sleeplessness, the depression, the failure to thrive and the nearsightedness to <b>children.</b> The light <b>trespass</b> caused by road lightings vary with the height of road lightings, the distance from road lightings {{to the window and}} the BUG rating of road lightings. In this paper, we analyze the effect on the light trespass by the spatial installation position of road lightings using by RELUX program.

60|$|Nevertheless, the Indians {{sufficiently}} {{showed their}} faith in their own doctrines by immediately setting about a series of curious and elaborate ceremonies, which {{it was impossible to}} comprehend, and decidedly unprofitable to describe. They appeared, however, to attach much importance to their propitiatory offerings, the chief among which seemed to be a few inches of tobacco, with which it was fondly hoped the deities of the gulf would condescend to smoke the pipe of peace while their red <b>children</b> ventured to <b>trespass</b> a little on their domain; and hard indeed must have been the hearts of the said spirits had they refused so valuable an offering, for tobacco is the life and marrow, the quintessence of terrestrial felicity, the very joy and comfort of a voyageur, and the poor Indians had but little of it to spare.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case was}} {{primarily}} {{based on the}} negligence of the Post Office workers in leaving the site of work unattended with the lamps burning. They owe a reasonable duty of care to prevent the children from entering the site which could be an [...] "allurement" [...] for the children. This {{was one of the}} issues that were raised; whether the respondent had taken adequate duty of care. A minor issue was brought forward in the case that the <b>children</b> have committed <b>trespass</b> and were liable for contributory negligence. One of the issues had been the question of foreseeability in the presence of children on Russell Road. Although the appellant suffered from injuries which were of higher degree, a question raised whether the explosion caused the accident and kind of injury suffered was of different type than that could have been foreseeable. However, the major issue which was involved in the case was whether the accident was foreseeable in nature. The case was brought forward from the First Division of the Court of Session, which limited the liability of the respondent on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident was not of a foreseeable nature.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the boys}} of South Park are dressed in medieval garb while {{engaging}} in role playing inspired by Game of Thrones, and are themselves anticipating Black Friday. Cartman informs his classmates of the 80% discount, and says if they work together, they can all purchase {{one of the new}} gaming systems so that they can play online games together. The children, however, become split over whether to purchase Xbox Ones or PlayStation 4s. Kyle and Stan find themselves {{on opposite sides of the}} schism, with Kyle allied with Cartman's Xbox One faction, and Stan on the PS4 side. The two factions then begin recruiting other children to increase their ranks. Cartman, strolling through the [...] "Garden of Andros" [...] with Kenny, whose character is [...] "Lady McCormick", tells him that they are only recruiting Xbox One loyalists to help them get inside the mall so them two can get cheap Xbox Ones. He wants Kenny to use his influence to [...] "take care" [...] of Kyle, should his loyalty to their faction falter. The garden is then revealed to be the elaborately landscaped back yard of an elderly South Park resident, who orders the <b>children</b> to stop <b>trespassing</b> on his property. This gag recurs throughout the three-part storyline, with Cartman playing different participants in the conflict against each other, only for the old man to inform them of this from his window, much to Cartman's irritation.|$|R
