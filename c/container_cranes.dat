5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest <b>container</b> <b>cranes.</b> Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

The city outfitted the base with a container crane {{and put a}} one-berth container facility in service {{in addition to the}} breakbulk capacity already available.

Large <b>container</b> <b>cranes</b> from Liebherrs in Killarney are regularly exported worldwide. A rail-link to the port was closed in the 1970s.

25|$|<b>Container</b> <b>cranes</b> {{consist of}} a {{supporting}} framework that can traverse {{the length of a}} quay or yard on a rail track. Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized handling tool called a spreader. The spreader can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a twistlock mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes have the capability to pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E
40|$|Determination {{of working}} force for a {{structure}} {{is very important}} in design. One of the working force of a <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> is the load from the container movement. This final project analyzes displacement, velocity, acceleration and the force caused by the trolley and container movement of the <b>container</b> <b>crane.</b> Approach of the analysis used kinematics and kinetics of particles. Results show that during the acceleration/deceleration of the container transverse motion, swing and fluctuated acceleration accurs, so that cause a vibration of the <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> structure. The largest fluctuation of the acceleration and the sway of the container occurs at the final container transverse motion, therefore the structure vibration will be larger. The results also show that on the <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> with the capacity of 40 tons the average of the acceleration fluctuation during maximum transverse motion of container is ± 0, 2 m/s 2. Furthermore, it is found that its vertical force on the girder/boom is about 786. 89 kN, which accurs {{at the beginning of the}} lifting movement. ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{progress}} has been made in <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> simulated training system research and development globally, but there are still serious problems such as faultiness in training function and effect, less coordination in synchronicity of visual and tactile simulation, etc. The lack of accurate system dynamics model is the main reason. The existing model takes the consideration of real-time motion simulation so simplified that it’s unable to accurately reflect the dynamic characteristics of structure or mechanism in starting and braking stage, and the coupled vibration characteristics in operation process, etc. In this paper, the geometric model of the entire <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> structure was established by using Solidworks, and used ADAMS and ANSYS for joint simulation of start-brake and coupled vibration characteristics, which provides a solution to establishing kernel model of <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> simulated training system and achieving real-time simulation...|$|R
