5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|Off Kyūshū, a Maldives-registered <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> capsized, {{killing one}} crew member. A train was derailed, {{possibly}} {{due to a}} tornado, injuring five people. On the island, an electrician in Fukuoka Prefecture died after an industrial container at his firm fell on top of him, crushing him. A glass entrance of a supermarket in Nobeoka broke on impact with flying debris, killing one person. Elsewhere in the prefecture, a 42-year-old man died in his bedroom when it was crushed, while an elderly woman farmer {{died when she was}} hit by a fallen tree outside a greenhouse. Three other deaths were confirmed on the island.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth Harbour has {{passenger}} ferry {{links to}} Gosport and the Isle of Wight from the Portsmouth International Port, with a <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> {{service to the}} Isle of Wight operated by Wightlink located nearby. Britain's longest-standing commercial hovercraft service, begun in the 1960s, still runs from near Clarence Pier to Ryde, Isle of Wight, operated by Hovertravel. Portsmouth Continental Ferry Port has links to Caen, Cherbourg-Octeville, St Malo, and Le Havre in France, Santander and Bilbao in Spain, and the Channel Islands. Ferry services from the port are operated by Brittany Ferries, Condor Ferries, and LD Lines.|$|E

5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The air ferry {{was the idea}} of Griffith J Powell, who wanted to holiday in France but did not like the ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E
5|$|In July 1948, Silver City Airways {{started an}} aerial <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> service from Lympne to Le Touquet using Bristol Freighter aircraft. At the Lympne Aero Races Lettice Curtis {{set a new}} women's world speed record whilst {{competing}} in the High Speed Handicap race flying a Spitfire XI. The Cinque Ports Flying Club folded on 1 October, its successor being the Kent Coast Flying Club which {{was set up by}} Hugh Kennard and had a Miles Magister (G-AKJX). Kent Gliding Club took up residence, and Skyfotos also made Lympne its base for aerial photography. Aircraft operated by Skyfotos included an Auster Autocrat (G-AIZZ) and a Piper PA-22 Caribbean (G-AREN).|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{was first}} {{designated}} in May or June 1928 {{from the north}} city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River, {{but not all of}} it was built and open to traffic. It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E

5|$|US31 runs due north through Northwest Michigan {{forest land}} {{bypassing}} Freesoil to the west. Northwest of that town, the highway crosses the Big Sable River before entering Manistee County. Across the county line, the trunkline runs northwesterly parallel to Manistee Lake as US31 enters Manistee. The highway follows Cypress Street to a drawbridge over the Manistee River and then Cleveland Street {{on the northern}} side. As the trunkline rounds the northern shore of Manistee Lake, it passes the SS City of Milwaukee, a <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> preserved as a museum. From there, the highway runs northeasterly, intersecting {{the western end of}} M-55 (Caberfae Highway). Next to the Little River Casino, the highway intersects the southern end of M-22 (Orchard Highway), and the LMCT separates from US31.|$|E
5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, US16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS Milwaukee Clipper {{operated}} as a <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where US16 continued to the west. From the docks, US16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US16 turned south along Business US31 (Bus. US31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US31, and US16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people died}} as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land. Rough seas in the western Atlantic {{battered}} the Alberto Benati, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated. A 2,726ton Norwegian <b>car</b> <b>ferry</b> known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hjørring, Denmark. However, one person later died in the hospital. In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fjærland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith.|$|E
