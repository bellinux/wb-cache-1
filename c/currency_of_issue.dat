40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} models {{exist for the}} evaluation of financial risk. Some evaluation models are based on requiring either inputs of historical data or expert opinions. In this paper, we have evaluated the risk in an investment portfolio of a public utilities company in the region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, North East of Italy. For the evaluation, the AHP, a classic model proposed by Saaty, has been used, recognising the hierarchy structure in criteria and sub-criteria defined by the experiences of sector operators and compared with pairs. Five portfolios proposed by financial promoters and five obtained randomly have been compared, considering the knowledge and preferences of the company managers and a level of risk equal to the level proposed by banks. We consider the affiliation sector of the portfolio titles and the geography, meaning the Country of emission of titles, to analyse country risk and the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> of titles to analyse exchange rate risk. For each criterion, experts evaluated sub-criteria. To identify the weights of both algorithms related to the differentiation of titles within a portfolio and to identify the criteria based on the socioeconomic knowledge within a financial framework, experts relied on involved operators. The flexibility of this instrument translates into the ability to use this instrument to consider either qualitative aspects of the risk or quantitative and semi quantitative aspects. The instrument can be considered a usual instrument in the management of public utilities companies, as long as the instrument is linked to the knowledge of managers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the various concepts of government debt in the euro area with {{particular emphasis on}} its size and composition. In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross general government debt used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area government debt broken down by maturity, holder or the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> All these indicators illustrate a sharp increase in government debt in most euro area countries {{as a result of the}} crisis. This in turn has several policy implications: (i) the growing government debt ratios need to be stabilised and put on a downward path which improves market confidence; (ii) fiscal surveillance needs to put more emphasis on government debt indicators than in the past; (iii) government financial assets could play a role when analysing solvency issues; (iv) implicit and other off-balance-sheet government liabilities need to be carefully monitored and reported; (v) the gross debt concept should remain the key basis for fiscal surveillance in the EU and for the Excessive Deficit Procedure in particular; (vi) beyond the size of government debt its composition is also a key factor behind public finance vulnerabilities.

40|$|What {{would be}} the {{short-term}} financial consequences of exiting the Euro? This article addresses this issue by focusing on some key strategic non-financial corporations and systemic banking Groups of French nationality. We show that special attention should {{be paid to the}} marketable debt under foreign law issued to finance domestic activities which is unlikely to be redenominated in a devalued domestic currency becoming suddenly much more difficult to service. What {{would be the}} magnitude of this effect ? Drawing on a new database on debt securities compiled at the firm level and taking into account the nationality of the ultimate issuer, this paper identifies strategic and systemic French companies that would end up, in case of a Euro exit, with unhedged mismatches on their respective consolidated balance sheets, thereby triggering large negative balance sheet effects. These very mismatches would prove to be in fact very similar to currency mismatches faced by many financial and non-financial corporations in emerging economies {{at the time of the}} Asian crisis in the late 1990 s, with the difference that they would be related to the juridical nature of the contracts instead of the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> We find that a significant share of the French financial and non-financial private sector finances its domestic activities with Eurodenominated debts under foreign law, which would ultimately remain in Euro and be repaid with a devalued currency if France were to leave the Eurozone. Historical examples support the idea that this “redenomination channel” has been crucial in explaining the successes or failures of exits from monetary unions. The “redenomination issue” played an important role in the 2002 Argentine collapse. On the contrary, some specificities, unlikely to be found in the Eurozone, of the widely-praised exits from the Gold Standard in the 1930 s and of the “Velvet Divorce” in 1993 Czechoslovakia explain why this very issue was defused. Hence, the problem of private debt and the difficulties of redenomination appear to bemuch more formidable than conventional wisdom has long held and this should be kept in mind by policy makers...|$|E

40|$|Because {{the volume}} <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>issued</b> by a country always affects its {{interest}} rate, price index, income levels, {{and many other}} important macroeconomic variables, the prediction <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> volume <b>issued</b> has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In contrast to the typical single-stage forecast model, this study proposes a hybrid forecasting approach to predict the volume <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>issued</b> in Taiwan. The proposed hybrid models consist of artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression (MR) components. The MR component of the hybrid models is established for a selection of fewer explanatory variables, wherein the selected variables are of higher importance. The ANN component is then designed to generate forecasts based on those important explanatory variables. Subsequently, the model is used to analyze a real dataset <b>of</b> Taiwan's <b>currency</b> from 1996 to 2011 and twenty associated explanatory variables. The prediction results reveal that the proposed hybrid scheme exhibits superior forecasting performance for predicting the volume <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>issued</b> in Taiwan...|$|R
