40|$|Scaling {{of heart}} {{ventricle}} mass and body {{mass in the}} haemoglobinless Antarctic fish Chionodraco hamatus Lonnberg shows a relationship similar to those reported for other 'cardiomegalic' icefish (Chaenocephalus aceratus and <b>Channichthys</b> <b>rhinoceratus).</b> An in vitro preparation of the heart of C. hamatus {{was set up to}} investigate the mechanical performance of this heart at different preloads and afterloads. It appears that this heart is well adapted to working within a range of preloads varying from - 0. 07 to - 0. 04 kPa, while it is unable to sustain increases of afterloads higher than 3. 0 kPa. As in other teleosts, heart rate is unaffected by changes in preload and afterload. Increase in temperature from 0. 5 to 5. 8 -degrees-C affects heart rate whereas stroke volume is unaffected. On the whole, the in vitro data are similar to those in vivo measured in another icefish, C. aceratus and show that the heart of C. hamatus works as a typical volume pump. This is discussed in relation to both the structural constraints related to the cardiac design of this icefish and the biology of this unique vertebrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathways}} {{and mechanisms}} of genomic change {{that have led}} to the peculiar haemoglobinless phenotypeof the white-blooded Antarctic ice¢shes (16 species in the family Channichthyidae) constitute an important model for understanding the rapid diversification of the Antarctic notothenioid fish flock. To provide complementary structural information on genomic change at globin-gene loci in Antarctic fish species,cytogenetic studies and in-situ chromosomal mapping have been undertaken. Using a DNA probe containing one a- and one b-globin gene from the embryonic/juvenile globin gene cluster of the red-blooded species Notothenia coriiceps, we mapped the cluster on the chromosomes of Antarctic teleosts by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. As anticipated {{on the basis of its}} molecular organization, the cluster was located on a single chromosome pair in all of the red-blooded fish species probed (N. coriiceps, N. angustata, Trematomus hansoni, T. pennellii). In contrast, the a/b-globin probe did not recognize complementary sequences on the chromosomes of the white-blooded species Chionodraco hamatus and <b>Channichthys</b> <b>rhinoceratus.</b> These results represent the first example of chromosomal mapping of embryonic/juvenile globin genes in teleostean fishes. Beyond its relevance to the evolutionary history of Antarctic notothenioids, this work contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the chromosomal loci of globin genes in ¢shes and other vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (<b>Channichthys</b> <b>rhinoceratus)</b> and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations. Distinct cohorts of some species (D. eleginoides and C. gunnari) were detected in some sectors. The survey has defined the distribution of species, commercial or not, that are important in the ecosystem and are of major interest for the management and conservation of fish populations in the are...|$|E
