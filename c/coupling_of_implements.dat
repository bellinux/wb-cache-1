The barebones framework can be viewed as the first reconstruction of Discourse Representation Theory in type theory that does justice to the incrementality and the finite domain semantics of the original. The second framework demonstrates how a slight extension of the context notion is enough for an implementation of a simple but powerful mechanism for pronoun reference resolution. The paper contains the complete Haskell code of the implementation...|$|R

40|$|Byzantine {{consensus}} in asynchronous message-passing systems {{has been shown}} to require at least 3 f + 1 processes to be solvable in several system models (e. g., with failure detectors, partial synchrony or randomization). Recently a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> solutions to <b>implement</b> Byzantine fault-tolerant state-machine replication using only 2 f + 1 replicas have appeared. This reduction from 3 f + 1 to 2 f + 1 is possible with a hybrid system model, i. e., by extending the system model with trusted/trustworthy components that constrain the power of faulty processes to have certain behaviors. Despite these important results, the problem of solving Byzantine consensus with only 2 f + 1 processes is still far from being well understood. In this paper we present a methodology to transform crash consensus algorithms into Byzantine consensus algorithms with different characteristics, with the assistance of a reliable broadcast primitive that requires trusted/trustworthy components to be implemented. We exemplify the methodology with two algorithms, one that uses failure detectors and one that is randomized. We also define a new flavor of consensus and use it to solve atomic broadcast, showing the practical interest of the transformations...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem with}} {{introducing}} multiscale domains when modelling mi- cromagnetic processes {{is that some}} phenomena cannot be resolved in the coarser mesh. When using a structured grid, with an interface between the meshes, these phenomena reflect back into the fine mesh as a non- physical result of the discretization. Landau-Lifshitz is solved by using a new, higher order, energy con- serving, finite difference, method. The particular issue of reflections is handled by weakly damping the high frequencies of spin waves, travelling across an interface, using penalty terms close to the interface. A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> ways of imposing these penalty terms are implemented, which results in the damping of high frequencies, and creates unwanted reflections from the low frequencies that travel across the interface.
