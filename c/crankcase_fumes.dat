50|$|A second {{function}} of the PCV valve {{is to protect the}} engine in case of a backfire, which causes a sudden high-pressure pulse in the intake manifold. This forces the PCV valve closed so that the backfire flame can't reach the crankcase, where it could ignite flammable fumes and cause damage. Turbocharged engines also experience periods of high intake manifold pressure during which the PCV valve is closed and the <b>crankcase</b> <b>fumes</b> are admitted to the engine via the breather and air cleaner.|$|E
50|$|The first {{effort at}} {{controlling}} pollution from automobiles was the PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) system. This draws <b>crankcase</b> <b>fumes</b> heavy in unburned hydrocarbons — {{a precursor to}} photochemical smog — into the engine's intake tract so they are burned rather than released unburned from the crankcase into the atmosphere. Positive crankcase ventilation was first installed on a widespread basis by law on all new 1961-model cars first sold in California. The following year, New York required it. By 1964, most new cars sold in the U.S. were so equipped, and PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of <b>crankcase</b> <b>fumes,</b> admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of <b>crankcase</b> <b>fumes</b> generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E
