5|$|The euro {{has been}} used as a trading {{currency}} in Cuba since 1998, and Syria since 2006. There are also various <b>currencies</b> pegged to the euro (see below). In 2009, Zimbabwe abandoned its local currency and used major <b>currencies</b> instead, including the euro and the United States dollar.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their <b>currencies</b> against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their <b>currencies</b> to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency {{is regarded as a}} safety measure, especially for <b>currencies</b> of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of UBS's foreign operations and Basel III risk-weighted assets (RWA) are denominated in foreign <b>currencies.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>currency</b> pair is the {{quotation}} {{of the relative}} value of a <b>currency</b> unit against the unit of another <b>currency</b> in the foreign exchange market. The <b>currency</b> that is used as the reference is called the counter <b>currency,</b> quote <b>currency</b> or <b>currency</b> and the <b>currency</b> that is quoted in relation is called the base <b>currency</b> or transaction <b>currency.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unofficial <b>currency</b> {{substitution}} or {{de facto}} <b>currency</b> substitution {{is the most}} common type of <b>currency</b> substitution. Unofficial <b>currency</b> substitution occurs when residents of a country choose to hold a significant share of their financial assets in foreign <b>currency,</b> even though the foreign <b>currency</b> is not legal tender there. They hold deposits in the foreign <b>currency</b> because of a bad track record of the local <b>currency,</b> or as a hedge against inflation of the domestic <b>currency.</b>|$|R

Asian countries may meet optimal <b>currency</b> area conditions. However, many other factors along the dimensions of history, politics and economic structure should be addressed for the realization of <b>currency</b> unification.

5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different <b>currencies.</b> The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard <b>currencies,</b> structured notes with custom-tailored yields and <b>currencies,</b> discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2009, in {{an effort}} to {{counteract}} runaway inflation, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other, more stable <b>currencies</b> to do business, alongside the Zimbabwe dollar. In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009. In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other <b>currencies</b> such as the rand (South Africa), the pula (Botswana), the euro, and the Pound Sterling (UK).|$|E
5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard <b>currencies,</b> the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local <b>currencies.</b> Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local <b>currencies</b> in 2010, and 45 local <b>currencies</b> in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E
50|$|A <b>currency</b> board (also {{known as}} 'linked {{exchange}} rate system") effectively replaces {{the central bank}} through a legislation to fix the <b>currency</b> to that of another country. The domestic <b>currency</b> remains perpetually exchangeable for the reserve <b>currency</b> at the fixed exchange rate. As the anchor <b>currency</b> is now the basis for movements of the domestic <b>currency,</b> the interest rates and inflation in the domestic economy would be greatly influenced by those of the foreign economy to which the domestic <b>currency</b> is tied. The <b>currency</b> board needs to ensure the maintenance of adequate reserves of the anchor <b>currency.</b> It is {{a step away from}} officially adopting the anchor <b>currency</b> (termed as <b>currency</b> substitution).|$|R
50|$|For example, {{aiming at}} {{decreasing}} the exchange rate/price {{of the domestic}} <b>currency,</b> authorities could purchase foreign <b>currency</b> bonds. During this transaction, extra supply of domestic <b>currency</b> will drag down domestic <b>currency</b> price, and extra demand of foreign <b>currency</b> will push up foreign <b>currency</b> price. As a result, the exchange rate drops.|$|R
50|$|An {{approach}} {{to work around}} this is to select one <b>currency</b> as the funding <b>currency</b> (e.g. USD), and select one curve in this <b>currency</b> as the discount curve (e.g. USD interest rate swap curve against 3M LIBOR). Cashflows in the funding <b>currency</b> are discounted on this curve. Cashflows in any other <b>currency</b> are first swapped into the funding <b>currency</b> via a cross <b>currency</b> swap and then discounted.|$|R
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} <b>currencies</b> also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose <b>currencies</b> had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{first account}} {{was funded by}} a US$5million {{fixed-income}} investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987. In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and <b>currencies</b> for institutional investors. As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained {{a reputation as a}} currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying <b>currencies.</b> In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national <b>currencies</b> of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old <b>currencies,</b> however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Larization - {{a process}} when {{percentage}} of larization is increasing. This process may {{be triggered by}} Economic agents in a country who prefer national <b>currency</b> to foreign <b>currency</b> for transactions. They prefer to keep (of their own free will) their savings in national <b>currency</b> instead of foreign <b>currency</b> and also take loans (of their own free will) in national <b>currency</b> instead of foreign <b>currency.</b> They set prices on goods (including durable consumption goods: flat, car, etc.) in national <b>currency</b> instead of foreign <b>currency.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} dual <b>currency</b> search model where agents can hold <b>currency</b> {{portfolios}} to buy goods, and analyze an agent 2 ̆ 7 s choice to spend safe dollars or risky home <b>currency</b> for internal trade. We focus on two equilibria: a <b>currency</b> competition equilibrium, {{in which the}} 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 <b>currency</b> (dollars) is spent first and the 2 ̆ 7 bad 2 ̆ 7 (risky home) <b>currency</b> is kept for later purchases, and a Gresham 2 ̆ 7 s Law equilibrium in which agents do the reverse. We prove that for the Gresham 2 ̆ 7 s Law equilibrium to prevail, trading frictions and the home <b>currency</b> risk must be small. Otherwise, extensive <b>currency</b> substitution occurs and the <b>currency</b> competition equilibrium prevails. Interestingly, because transaction velocity is endogenous, we demonstrate that as the home <b>currency</b> risk rises, <b>currency</b> substitution causes {{a decline in the}} transaction velocity of the bad <b>currency</b> while increasing it for the good <b>currency...</b>|$|R

5|$|For a {{widespread}} currency war to occur {{a large proportion}} of significant economies must wish to devalue their <b>currencies</b> at once. This has so far only happened during a global economic downturn.|$|E
5000|$|A {{floating}} {{exchange rate}} or fluctuating exchange or {{flexible exchange rate}} {{is a type of}} exchange-rate regime in which a <b>currency's</b> value is allowed to fluctuate in response to foreign-exchange market mechanisms. A <b>currency</b> that uses a floating exchange rate is known as a floating <b>currency.</b> A floating <b>currency</b> is contrasted with a fixed <b>currency</b> whose value is tied to that of another <b>currency,</b> material goods or to a <b>currency</b> basket.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a system}} of fixed {{exchange}} rates maintained by a <b>currency</b> board every unit of local <b>currency</b> must be backed by a unit of foreign <b>currency</b> (correcting for the exchange rate). This ensures that the local monetary base does not inflate without being backed by hard <b>currency</b> and eliminates any worries about a run on the local <b>currency</b> by those wishing to convert the local <b>currency</b> to the hard (anchor) <b>currency.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Alternative <b>currency</b> - generally, {{a synonym}} for {{complementary}} <b>currency,</b> referring to a <b>currency</b> designed to work {{in conjunction with the}} national currency; less often refers to a type of private <b>currency</b> which attempts to supplant or circumvent the national <b>currency.</b>|$|R

5|$|In addition, {{the country}} had to unify the {{disparate}} systems of law, economics, and administration in the former German, Austrian and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five <b>currencies,</b> 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the fixed}} {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank operates in the foreign exchange market to maintain a specific exchange rate. If there is pressure to depreciate the domestic <b>currency's</b> exchange rate because the supply of domestic <b>currency</b> exceeds its demand in foreign exchange markets, the local authority buys domestic <b>currency</b> with foreign <b>currency</b> to decrease the domestic <b>currency's</b> supply in the foreign exchange market. This keeps the domestic <b>currency's</b> exchange rate at its targeted level. If there is pressure to appreciate the domestic <b>currency's</b> exchange rate because the <b>currency's</b> demand exceeds its supply in the foreign exchange market, the local authority buys foreign <b>currency</b> with domestic <b>currency</b> to increase the domestic <b>currency's</b> supply in the foreign exchange market. Again,this keeps the exchange rate at its targeted level.|$|R
5000|$|High and unanticipated {{inflation}} rates {{decrease the}} demand for domestic money and raise {{the demand for}} alternative assets, including foreign <b>currency</b> and assets dominated by foreign <b>currency.</b> This phenomenon is called the [...] "flight from domestic money". It results in a rapid and sizable process of <b>currency</b> substitution. In countries with high inflation rates, the domestic <b>currency</b> tends to be gradually displaced by a stable <b>currency.</b> At {{the beginning of this}} process, the store-of-value function of the domestic <b>currency</b> is replaced by the foreign <b>currency.</b> Then, the unit-of-account function of the domestic <b>currency</b> is displaced when many prices are quoted in a foreign <b>currency.</b> A prolonged period of high inflation will induce the domestic <b>currency</b> to lose its function as medium of exchange when the public carries out many transactions in foreign <b>currency.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Currency</b> {{converters}} {{are often}} used {{as a means of}} checking the relative value of a <b>currency</b> before exchanging it into another <b>currency.</b> This is useful for the traveler because the traveler can check the value of a foreign county’s <b>currency</b> before exchanging money. These programs list the value of a foreign country’s <b>currency</b> relative to the traveler’s own <b>currency.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national <b>currencies</b> ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old <b>currencies</b> ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E
5|$|The drop in export {{is caused}} by the loss of {{competitiveness}} against other major export countries including Japan and Germany, where the currency had been drastically devalued during the previous quantitative easing operations. It sparked a new round of devaluation among Asian <b>currencies,</b> including the Vietnam dong and the Kazakhstan tenge.|$|E
5|$|The euro is the second-most {{widely held}} reserve {{currency}} after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate {{against the other}} major <b>currencies</b> fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With {{the advent of the}} global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable. In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index– measured against <b>currencies</b> of the bloc's major trading partners– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007. In late August 2017 € rose again above 1.20 $.It also hit new relative or absolute highs against £ and other <b>currencies.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market and international finance, a world <b>currency,</b> supranational <b>currency,</b> or global <b>currency</b> refers to a <b>currency</b> that is transacted internationally, with no set borders.|$|R
50|$|A reserve <b>currency</b> (or anchor <b>currency)</b> is a <b>currency</b> that {{is held in}} {{significant}} quantities by governments and institutions {{as part of their}} foreign exchange reserves. The reserve <b>currency</b> is commonly used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard <b>currency</b> or safe-haven <b>currency.</b> People who live in a country that issues a reserve <b>currency</b> can purchase imports and borrow across borders more cheaply than people in other nations because they do not need to exchange their <b>currency</b> to do so.|$|R
40|$|The term "currency" has {{different}} meanings but is usually defined as any {{means of payment}} {{that is not in}} local <b>currency</b> units. The ratio between the foreign <b>currency</b> and local <b>currency</b> units results into exchange rate. When arranging payment transactions abroad, local entities - natural and legal persons must exchange their national <b>currency</b> in advance for the <b>currency</b> of the country in which they are due or in another <b>currency</b> commonly accepted as an international payment. Under this regime, the national <b>currency</b> is quoted in relation to another <b>currency,</b> that is exchange rate...|$|R
