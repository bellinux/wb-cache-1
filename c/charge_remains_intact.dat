40|$|We {{revisit the}} issue of the soliton mass in {{two-dimensional}} models with N = 1 supersymmetry. The superalgebra has a central extension, and at the classical level the soliton solution preserves 1 / 2 of supersymmetry which is equivalent to BPS saturation. We prove that the property of BPS saturation, i. e. the equality of the soliton mass to the central <b>charge,</b> <b>remains</b> <b>intact</b> at the quantum level in all orders of the weak coupling expansion. Our key finding is an anomaly in the expression for the central charge. The classical central charge, equal to the jump of the superpotential, is amended by an anomalous term proportional to the second derivative of the superpotential. The anomaly is established by various methods in explicit one-loop calculations. We argue that this one-loop result is not affected by higher orders. We discuss in detail how the impact of the boundary conditions can be untangled from the soliton mass calculation. In particular, the soliton profile and the energy distribution are found at one loop. A "supersymmetry" in the soliton mass calculations in the non-supersymmetric models is observed...|$|E

The system II primary <b>charge</b> separation <b>remains</b> <b>intact</b> when incubated with this agent in the dark with release of one of the system II Mn pools and simultaneous destruction of O 2 evolving capacity.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the role of}} electrostatic fluctuations on the charge selectivity of cylindrical nanopores confining electrolyte mixtures. To this end, we develop an extended one-loop theory that can account for correlation effects induced by the surface charge, nanoconfinement of the electrolyte, and interfacial polarization charges associated with the low permittivity membrane. We validate the quantitative accuracy of the theory by comparisons with previously obtained Monte-Carlo simulation data from the literature, and scrutinize in detail the underlying forces driving the ionic selectivity of the nanopore. In the biologically relevant case of electrolytes with divalent cations such as CaCl 2 in negatively charged nanopores, electrostatic correlations associated with the dense counterion layer in the channel result in an increase of the pore coion density with the surface charge. This peculiarity analogous to the <b>charge</b> inversion phenomenon <b>remains</b> <b>intact</b> for dielectrically inhomogeneous pores, which indicates that the effect should be observable in nanofiltration membranes or DNA-blocked nanopores characterized by a low membrane permittivity. Our results show that a quantitatively accurate consideration of correlation effects is necessary to determine the ionic selectivity of nanopores {{in the presence of}} electrolytes with multivalent counterions.
