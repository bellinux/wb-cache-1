40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether an over-stimulation of the {{vestibular}} system, induced by thousands of time saccadic head stimulations, affects the vestibular sensitivity, and consequently if such a phenomenon could contribute to the deterioration of postural stability observed after a long distance running exercise. Eighteen athletic subjects performed a 20. 5 km over ground race with an average speed of 15 km x h(- 1), corresponding roughly to 7, 500 strides shocks with associated saccadic accelerations transmitted to the head. A preliminary validation of the exercise protocol was realized to confirm the effect of the sustained exercise on body balance by recording standard postural parameters. A visually perceived eye level (VPEL) task was used to indirectly assess otolithic sensitivity motionless or undergoing low <b>centrifugation</b> <b>conditions,</b> before and after exercise. Results obtained from body balance analysis confirmed a decreased postural stability illustrated by increased postural oscillations after the 20. 5 km run. Under low <b>centrifugation</b> <b>conditions,</b> results showed a lowering of the VPEL with the increase of the gravito-inertial acceleration in accordance with the literature. However, no significant change in the VPEL after a sustained running exercise was observed. In conclusion, the vestibular sensitivity at the otolithic level does not seem to be altered by an intensive running exercise and then failed to play a key role in the post-exercise deterioration of postural stability...|$|E

Microtubules were fluorescently labeled and analyzed by confocal microscopy to determine microtubule network morphology and height. Centrifugation at 10 -g reduced microtubule network height by 15 % on d 4 and 10 % on d 6, with variable changes in more mature cultures. No major changes in microtubule morphology were observed. PGE(sub 2) release by d 4 cultures increased in a dose-dependent fashion (3 -fold at 10 -g and 6 -fold at 50 -g relative to controls). D 6 cultures produced a 5 -fold increase for both 10 -g and 50 -g. PGE(sub 2) increased only 1. 5 -fold by d 9, and by d 19, PGE(sub 2) was not delectable in either the control or hypergravity-stimulated cells.

Methods: The Westendorf method was used for freezing, with some variations. The factors analysed included centrifugation g-force (250 g, 1010 g, and 2250 g), shape of centrifugation tube (spherical or conical), and phase of the freeze-thaw process. Individual boar was a random effect. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} semen quality associated with the shape of the centrifugation tube either for refrigerated (5 ˚C) or thawed semen. The g-force of centrifugation did affect semen quality. In refrigerated samples centrifuged at 250 g, the percentage of sperm with normal apical ridges (NAR) was lower (P . 05).

To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16 S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43. 2 % to 96. 7 % viral reads and from 47. 6 % to 0. 19 % bacterial reads).

The cave atmosphere contains 1 - 2 % methane (CH 4), although much higher concentrations are found in gas bubbles that keep microbial mats afloat on the water surface. As previous analyses of stable carbon isotope ratios have suggested that methane oxidation occurs in this environment, we hypothesized that aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) are active in Movile Cave. To identify the active methanotrophs {{in the water and}} mat material from Movile Cave, a microcosm was incubated with a 10 % 13 CH 4 headspace in a DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiment. Using improved <b>centrifugation</b> <b>conditions,</b> a 13 C-labelled DNA fraction was collected and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. Analysis of genes encoding the small-subunit rRNA and key enzymes in the methane oxidation pathway of methanotrophs identified that strains of Methylomonas, Methylococcus and Methylocystis/Methylosinus had assimilated the 13 CH 4, and that these methanotrophs contain genes encoding both known types of methane monooxygenase (MMO). Sequences of non-methanotrophic bacteria and an alga provided evidence for turnover of CH 4 due to possible cross-feeding on 13 C-labelled metabolites or biomass.

40|$|Neuronal NO-synthase (nNOS) was {{investigated}} in rat longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus (LM/MP) tissue at the cellular and subcellular level. Using preparations and double immune staining and light and electron microscopy, we concluded that, in these preparations, nNOS is only present in neuronal cells. However, in spite of numerous attempts to morphologically identify the NOS-containing subcellular structure, no firm conclusions were possible. Consequently, the problem was approached by biochemical methods including gradient centrifugation followed by analysis of the fractions. Using a protocol involving gentle homogenisation of the tissue, we found that about 10 % of the nNOS immune reactivity was particle-bound confirming previous results (Biochem. Pharmacol. 60 (2000) 145). However, applying a different protocol including strong homogenisation, we now demonstrated that about 50 % of the immune reactive nNOS was sedimentable. The results suggested that particulate nNOS is associated with one single subcellular structure, which {{is different from the}} plasma membrane, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and lysosomes. The equilibrium sedimentation characteristics of the nNOS containing particles corresponded partly to those containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or synaptobrevin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Formal {{validation}} of methods for biospecimen processing {{in the context}} of accreditation in laboratories and biobanks is lacking. A protocol for processing of a biospecimen (urine) was validated for fitness-for-purpose in terms of key downstream endpoints. METHODS: Urine processing was optimized for <b>centrifugation</b> <b>conditions</b> on the basis of microparticle counts at room temperature (RT) and at 4 degrees C. The optimal protocol was validated for performance (microparticle counts), and for reproducibility and robustness for centrifugation temperature (4 degrees C vs. RT) and brake speed (soft, medium, hard). Acceptance criteria were based on microparticle counts, cystatin C and creatinine concentrations, and the metabolomic profile. RESULTS: The optimal protocol was a 20 -min, 12, 000 g centrifugation at 4 degrees C, and was validated for urine collection in terms of microparticle counts. All reproducibility acceptance criteria were met. The protocol was robust for centrifugation at 4 degrees C versus RT for all parameters. The protocol was considered robust overall in terms of brake speeds, although a hard brake gave significantly fewer microparticles than a soft brake.

40|$|The solute {{concentration}} in the subsoil beneath the root zone is an important parameter for leaching assessment. Drainage centrifugation is considered a simple and straightforward method of determining soil solution chemistry. Although several studies {{have been carried out}} to determine whether this method is robust, hardly any results are available for loess subsoils. To study the effect of <b>centrifugation</b> <b>conditions</b> on soil moisture recovery and {{solute concentration}}, we sampled the subsoil (1. 5 – 3. 0 m depth) at commercial farms in the loess region of the Netherlands. The effect of time (20, 35, 60, 120 and 240 min) on recovery was studied at two levels of the relative centrifugal force (733 and 6597 g). The effect of force on recovery was studied by centrifugation for 35 min at 117, 264, 733, 2932, 6597 and 14, 191 g. All soil moisture samples were chemically analysed. This study shows that drainage centrifugation offers a robust, reproducible and standardised way for determining solute concentrations in mobile soil moisture in silt loam subsoils. The centrifugal force, rather than centrifugation time, has a major effect on recovery. The maximum recovery for silt loams at field capacity is about 40 %. Concentrations of most solutes are fairly constant with an increasing recovery, as most solutes, including nitrate, did not show a change in concentration with an increasing recovery. © 2017, The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{would like}} to thank Dr Lee 1 for his {{valuable}} comment ad-dressing the important topic of preanalytic factors confounding biomarker measurements. He has recently demonstrated that re-sidual platelets are a source of artifactually high levels of soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD 40 L) in clinical plasma samples. 2 In general, preanalytic conditions are critical in the assessment of sCD 40 L concentrations and thus should be carefully considered in clini-cal studies. In this context, our research group showed years ago that plasma, but not serum, samples are appropriate for sCD 40 L measurements. 3 Furthermore, several factors such as centrifuga-tion of blood at suboptimal force and duration or single low-speed <b>centrifugation</b> under refrigerated <b>conditions</b> can result in contam-ination by residual platelets and are critical for reliable sCD 40 L measurements. 2 With reference to Dr Lee’s letter, the blood samples in ou...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial biogenesis in the parenchymal cell of {{the mouse}} mammary gland appears to occur in two {{distinct}} phases: replication during cell proliferation, and maturation during cell differentiation. This study of the mitochondrial maturation phase in the mouse gland demonstrates {{a significant increase in}} organelle density on isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation during the transition from late pregnancy to day 8 of lactation. Differential fragility to high sucrose concentrations or changes in mitochondrial lipid composition do not satisfactorily explain the density increases. When organelle densities were assessed by <b>centrifugation</b> under iso-osmotic <b>conditions</b> with Ficoll gradients in 0. 25 M sucrose, the mitochondria from pregnant glands were observed to be more dense than those from lactating glands. The two mitochondrial populations were also found to differ in their response to changes in sucrose concentration in the Ficoll gradients. When sucrose concentration was increased, the density of both pregnant and lactating gland mitochondria increase...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{environmentally}} friendly microextraction technique {{was used for}} determination of chlorpheniramine (CPM), an antihistamine drug, in human urine samples using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) followed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). In this extraction technique, an appropriate mixture of acetonitrile (disperser solvent) and carbon tetrachloride (extraction solvent) was rapidly injected into the urine sample containing the target analyte. Tiny droplets of extractant were formed and dispersed into the sample solution and then sedimented {{at the bottom of}} the conical test tube by <b>centrifugation.</b> Under optimal <b>conditions,</b> the calibration curve was linear in the range of 0. 055 - 5. 5 µg mL- 1, with a detection limit of 16. 5 ng mL- 1. This proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of real urine samples. Low consumption of toxic organic solvents, simplicity of operation, low cost and acceptable figures of merit are the main advantages of the proposed technique...|$|R
