5|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
500|$|The main guns of the Renown-class ships {{could be}} {{controlled}} from {{either of the two}} fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast.

The secondary armament was controlled by directors mounted on platforms on each mast. Each turret was provided with a [...] rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof.|$|E
500|$|Firing trials against [...] in 1907 {{revealed}} this system's {{vulnerability to}} gunfire, as its spotting top was hit twice {{and a large}} splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast. To guard against this possibility, Dreadnoughts fire-control system was comprehensively upgraded during her refits in 1912–13. The rangefinder in the foretop was given a gyro-stabilized Argo mount and 'A' and 'Y' turrets were upgraded to serve as secondary control positions for any portion {{or all of the}} main armament. An additional 9-foot rangefinder was installed on the compass platform. In addition, 'A' turret was fitted with another 9-foot rangefinder {{at the rear of the}} turret roof and a Mark I Dreyer Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> was installed in the main Transmitting Station. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E

500|$|The main guns of Tiger were {{controlled}} from {{either of the}} two fire-control directors. The primary director was in the fore-top on the foremast and the other was mounted on the aft superstructure in the torpedo control tower. Data from [...] rangefinders in the armoured hood above the conning tower and in 'B' and 'Q' turrets was transmitted to the Mk IV Dreyer Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> located in the transmitting station below the waterline. The observations were then plotted and converted into range and deflection data for use by the director and guns. A Mark VII* Dumaresq in the armoured tower was trained on the target to supply bearing data to one transmitting station for use in plotting and calculations, and a second station was fitted for the ship's secondary armament, although a pair of fire-control directors for those guns, one for each broadside, were not fitted until 1915.|$|E
500|$|The main guns of the Admiral-class {{ships were}} {{controlled}} from {{either of the}} two fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast.

Data from a [...] rangefinder in the armoured hood were input into a Mk V Dreyer Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> located in the Transmitting Station (TS) on the platform deck where they were converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data were also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The fore-top was equipped with a [...] rangefinder. Each turret was provided with a thirty-foot rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof and a Dumaresq analogue computer for local fire-control.|$|E

The director layer's trigger fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. A gun within the 'Y' turret was also equipped with transmitters so that, as a backup, it could function as a [...] "directing gun", but there was no provision for the gun battery to be split between the main director and this directing gun. [...] The Indefatigables received their director equipment between mid-1915 and May 1916.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{examples are}} arbitrary (and based upon {{just a single}} input for simplicity), however the intention is merely to demonstrate how control flow can be effected via the use of tables instead of regular program statements. It should be clear that this technique can easily be extended to deal with multiple inputs, either by {{increasing the number of}} columns or utilizing multiple table entries (with optional and/or operator). Similarly, by using (hierarchical) 'linked' <b>control</b> <b>tables,</b> structured programming can be accomplished (optionally using indentation to help highlight subordinate <b>control</b> <b>tables).</b>|$|R

Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and <b>control</b> <b>tables</b> are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements.

500|$|Swiftsures {{bombardment}} of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed {{well away from}} their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the [...] gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her [...] guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with proximity fuses intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective. A subsequent investigation found that a faulty split pin {{had fallen out of}} Swiftsures Admiralty Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table,</b> most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns. After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.|$|E
500|$|Vanguard {{was unique}} among British battleships in having remote power control (RPC) for her main, {{secondary}} and tertiary guns {{along with the}} Admiralty Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> Mk X for surface fire control of the main armament. There were two director control towers (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a [...] "double cheese" [...] Type 274 fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets while 'B' turret could control 'A' and 'X' turrets. 'X' turret could only control 'Y' turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of Type 275 gunnery radar. Lastly, each Mark VI sextuple 40mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF ("close range blind fire") director fitted with a Type 262 radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, Type 293 target indication and Type 277 height finding.|$|E
500|$|The tight {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty raised many challenges and required difficult compromises {{if they were to}} be met. To avoid the class being outgunned by the new ships of foreign navies, especially as by the mid-1930s the Treaty had been renounced by Japan and Italy, Churchill wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1936, voicing strong objections to the proposed armament of 10 14-inch guns. His proposal was for nine 16-inch guns. However, when completed King George V mounted ten [...] guns. They were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. They could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: [...] "A" [...] turret, 286 degrees; [...] "B" [...] turret, 270 degrees and [...] "Y" [...] turret, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was achieved through a hydraulic drive, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed 15,950 pounds; a salvo could be fired every 30 seconds. The quadruple turrets weighed 1,582 tons, the twin turret 915 tons. The turrets were designed by the Vickers Armstrong's Elswick Works, but sets of each type of equipment were manufactured by Vickers Armstrongs in Barrow. A considerable amount of design effort was expended to make the turrets as flashtight as possible. This complicated the mechanical design of the turrets, particularly the quadruple mountings. Due to insufficient clearances and slightly distorted link mechanisms, failures in the intricate safety interlocks in the loading sequence for antiflash precautions caused jams during drills and practice firing. During the summer of 1941 the King George V-class battleships, had their main armament turrets and turret linkages modified to correct the operational faults revealed during the hunt and destruction of Bismarck. HMS King George V used an Admiralty Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table</b> Mark IX to control her main armament.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{controlled}} drainage (CD) on ammonia volatilization (AV) losses from paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI) was investigated by managing water <b>table</b> <b>control</b> levels using a lysimeter. Three drainage treatments were implemented, namely, <b>controlled</b> water <b>table</b> depth 1 (CWT 1), <b>controlled</b> water <b>table</b> depth 2 (CWT 2), and <b>controlled</b> water <b>table</b> depth 3 (CWT 3). As the water <b>table</b> <b>control</b> levels increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased.

Seasonal AV losses from CWT 1, CWT 2, and CWT 3 were 59. 8, 56. 7, and 53. 0 [*]kg[*]N[*]ha− 1, respectively. AV losses from CWT 3 were 13. 1 % and 8. 4 % lower than those from CWT 1 and CWT 2, respectively. A {{significant difference in the}} seasonal AV losses was confirmed between CWT 1 and CWT 3. Less weekly AV losses followed by TF and PF were also observed as the water <b>table</b> <b>control</b> levels increased. The application of CD by increasing water <b>table</b> <b>control</b> levels to a suitable level could effectively reduce irrigation water volumes and AV losses from CI paddy fields. The combination of CI and CD may be a feasible water management method of reducing AV losses from paddy fields...|$|R
500|$|When Belfast {{was first}} {{opened to the}} public, {{visitors}} were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure. As of 2011, nine decks {{are open to the}} public. Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the quarterdeck with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the River Thames. The Imperial War Museum's guidebook to HMS Belfast divides the ship into three broad sections. The first of these, [...] "Life on board the ship", focuses on the experience of serving at sea. Restored compartments, some populated with dressed figures, illustrate the crew's living conditions and the ship's various facilities such as the sick bay, galley, laundry, chapel, mess decks and NAAFI. Since 2002, school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard Belfast overnight, sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck. The second section, [...] "The inner workings", below the waterline and protected by the ship's armoured belt, contains core mechanical, electrical and communication systems. As well as the engine and boiler rooms, other compartments include the transmitting station (housing the ship's Admiralty Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Table,</b> a mechanical computer), the forward steering position and one of Belfasts six-inch shell rooms and magazines. The third section, [...] "Action stations", includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship's armament, fire control, and command facilities. Areas open to the public include the operations room, Admiral's bridge and gun direction platform. During 2011, two of these areas were reinterpreted. The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express, a large British-Australian-American joint exercise held off North Borneo in 1961. The reinterpretation included an interactive audio-visual plotting table. [...] In July 2011, the interior of Y Turret, the aftmost 6-inch turret, was redisplayed using audio-visual and atmospheric effects, seeking to evoke the experience of a gunner at the Battle of North Cape. To emphasise the range of the ship's armament, the forward six-inch guns of A and B Turrets are trained on the London Gateway service area on the M1 motorway, some 12.5 miles away on the outskirts of London. A 4-inch gun mount and a shell hoist are kept in working order and used during blank-firing demonstrations by the Wavy Navy re-enactment group. In addition to the various areas of the ship open to visitors, some compartments have been fitted out as dedicated exhibition space. Permanent exhibitions include [...] "HMS Belfast in War and Peace" [...] and [...] "Life at Sea". The cost of admission to HMS Belfast includes a multilingual audio guide.|$|E

40|$|A {{two year}} field study {{was carried out}} in western Quebec to {{investigate}} methods of predicting and reducing NO 3 [...] N leaching. Corn (Zea mays L.) was planted on the expel site and them were four treatments: water <b>table</b> <b>controlled</b> at 600 mm and 120 kg/ha of N fertilizer (WT 120), water <b>table</b> <b>controlled</b> at 600 mm and 200 kg/ha of N fertilizer (WT 200), free drainage and 120 kg/ha of N fertilizer (FD 120), and free drainage and 200 kg/ha of N fertilizer (FD 200). Drain flow was monitored and water samples were taken and analyzed for NO 3 - -N. Soil NO 3 - levels were measured along with led chlorophyll and denitrification throughout the two growing seasons. Drain flow was dependent on both rainfall and the soil moisture content. In 1996, water <b>table</b> <b>control</b> decreased drain flow. However, in 1997 (a drier year), the drain flows for all treatments were similar. NO 3 [...] N was reduced significantly in the <b>controlled</b> water <b>table</b> plots.
