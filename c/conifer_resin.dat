40|$|Abstract Terpenoid resin is {{produced}} by all families and most genera of the order Coniferales (the conifers), {{and the distribution of}} terpenes present in most <b>conifer</b> <b>resins</b> is characteristic of the originating family. Analyses of early Cretaceous (Barremian) amber (fossil resin) from the English Wealden, Isle of Wight, southern England, by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), indicate a terpene distribution dominated by abietane- and labdane-type terpenes. Similar distributions are observed in some species of the extant family Pinaceae. The Pinaceae are well represented within the Wealden deposits of southern England, by only one (known) species, Pityites solmsii (Seward) Seward, whereas the macro-fossil record of these deposits is dominated by the extinct conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae, for which no resin chemistry has been reported. By analogy with modern materials, it is probable that the ambers found in these deposits are derived from an extinct member of the Pinaceae, but given the absence of evidence concerning the chemotaxonomy of the Cheirolepidiaceae, this family cannot be excluded a priori as a possible paleobotanical source. These ambers may therefore be assigned to either the Pinaceae or to the Cheirolepidiaceae. These samples are the oldest ambers to date to yield useful chemotaxonomic data. </p...|$|R

These samples were also used as substrates for investigation {{of the influence of}} diagenetic alteration on δ 13 C signatures of biomarkers, as well as for assessment of the most convenient utilization for each lithotype. The investigated lithotypes differ in accordance with the composition of huminite macerals. Xylite-rich coal notably distinguishes from other lithotypes beacuse of the highest content of <b>conifer</b> <b>resins</b> vs. epicuticular waxes. The mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal is characterised by the greatest contribution of algae and fungi and the most intense methanotrophic activity at the time of deposition. In all coal lithotypes diagenetic aromatisation influenced isotopic composition of individual biomarkers. Xylite-rich coal has the poorest grindability properties. However, this coal lithotype is the most suitable for fluidized bed gasification, whereas the mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal has the lowest applicability for this process. The calorific value decreases in order: xylite-rich coal > matrix coal > mixture of matrix and xylite-rich coal > mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal. The increase of organic carbon content and calorific value is controlled by the increase of contribution of wood vegetation vs. herbaceous peat-forming plants, as well as by stability of water table during peatification.

The specimen, described as Pinus yorkshirensis sp. nov., is conical, 5 cm long, and 3. 1 cm in maximum diameter. Bract/scale complexes are helically arranged and spreading. Vasculature of the axis forms a complete cylinder with few resin canals in the wood, and the inner cortex is dominated by large resin canals. Bracts are short, with two resin canals, and separate from the scale base laterally. Distally, the ovuliferous scales broaden and thicken to form a rhomboidal apophysis with a dorsal umbo, characters found only in the genus Pinus among living <b>conifers.</b> <b>Resin</b> canals enter the ovuliferous scale abaxial to the vascular tissue, which divides distally to form a row of adaxially convex bundles. A short interseminal ridge separates two inverted and winged seeds on the adaxial surface of the ovuliferous scale. Seeds contain megagametophyte tissue and polycotyledonary embryos. Numerical cladistic analysis of anatomically preserved seed cones yields a well-resolved phylogeny of crown and stem group Pinaceae that is roughly concordant with the results of analyses that include living species only. All of the included species of Pinus form a clade with three very Pinus-like species that currently are assigned to the stem genus Pityostrobus. These results call to question the utility of traditional methods for assigning fossil seed cones to Pinus, resolve relationships among stem and crown group genera, and highlight the unnatural circumscription of Pityostrobus. This suggests that some species of Pityostrobus may actually represent the genus Pinus, and it demonstrates that the evolutionary diversification of Pinaceae began earlier than previously recognized from fossil evidence...|$|R

Redwood, giant sequoia, {{and other members of}} the Cupressaceae respond to injury by producing inducible traumatic resin ducts (TRD) in the xylem (Hudgins et al. 2004, Krokene et al. 2008), and fire-associated TRD occur up to 6 m above the ground on redwood trunks (Brown and Swetnam 1994).

Recent {{studies have shown}} that diterpenoids were the major compounds in propolis samples from Greece and Sicily (Popova et al. 2010; Trusheva et al. 2003; Popova et al. 2009). The major components of Greek propolis consist of communic, cupressic, isocupressic acids and totarol (Popova et al. 2010), indicating a potential origin from <b>conifer</b> (e.g. cedar) <b>resin</b> (Cox et al. 2007). Triterpenoids including β-amyrin, β-amyrone, lupeol, and lupenone, and polyprenyl benzophenones such as 7 -epi-nemorosone, 7 -epi-clusianone, xanthochymol, and gambogenone have been detected in propolis samples from the Brazilian Amazon (de Castro Ishida et al. 2011).

5000|$|Social insects {{have evolved}} {{an array of}} {{sanitary}} behaviours to keep their nests clean, thereby reducing the probability of parasite establishment and spread within the colony. Such behaviours can be employed either prophylactically, or actively, upon demand. For example, social insects can incorporate materials with antimicrobial properties into their nest, such as <b>conifer</b> <b>resin,</b> or faecal pellets that contain symbiont derived antimicrobials. These materials reduce the growth and density of many detrimental bacteria and fungi. Antimicrobial substances can also be self-produced. Secretions from the metapleural glands of ants and volatile chemical components produced by termites {{have been shown to}} inhibit fungal germination and growth. Another important component of nest hygiene is waste management, which involves strict spatial separation of clean nest areas and waste dumps. Social insect colonies often deposit their waste outside of the nest, or in special compartments, including waste chambers for food leftovers, “toilets” for defecation and “graveyards”, where dead individuals are deposited, reducing the probability of parasite transmission from potentially infected cadavers. Where social insects place their waste is also important. For example, leaf cutting ants living in xeric conditions deposit their waste outside the nest, whilst species living in the tropics tend to keep it in special chambers within the nest. It has been proposed that this difference is related to the likelihood that the external environment reduces or enhances microbial growth. For xeric-living ants, placing waste outside will tend to inhibit infectious material, as microbes are usually killed under hot, dry conditions. On the other hand, placing waste into warm, humid environments will promote microbial growth and disease transmission, so it may be safer for ants living in the topics to contain their waste within the nest. Honeybees have evolved the ability to actively maintain a constant temperature within their hives to ensure optimal brood development. Upon exposure to Ascoshpaera apis, a heat sensitive fungal pathogen that causes chalk brood, honeybees increase the temperature of the brood combs, thereby creating conditions that disfavour the growth of the pathogen. This [...] "social fever" [...] is performed before symptoms of the disease are expressed and can therefore be viewed as a preventative measure to avoid chalk brood outbreaks in the colony.|$|E

Drought {{is one of the most}} important factors that influences the tree physiology and resitance. Due to decreased turgor of resin canal cells, the water insufficiency affects the pressure of the resin and thereby the ability of trees to physically prevent pathogen or herbivore invasion by effective outpouring of the resin. In addition, drought can also change the resin composition and thus can influence the quality of volatiles emitted by the tree. The Norway spruce, Picea abies, is the predominant species of production forests in moderate climate zone. Bark beetles, Ips typographus, represent the most important pest species of spruce. In general, pioneer bark beetles use host volatiles to orient themselves toward the tree suitable for colonization and in many species host volatiles synergize bark beetle aggregation pheromones. Thus the host volatile composition could affect significantly host colonization.

40|$|Natural asphalt (or bitumen) deposits, {{oil seepage}} and liquid oil shows are {{widespread}} in the Middle East, especially in the Zagros mountains of Iran. Ancient people from northern Iraq, south-west Iran and the Dead Sea area extensively used this ubiquitous natural resource until the Neolithic period (7000 to 6000 BC). Evidence of earlier use has been recently documented in the Syrian desert near El Kown, where bitumen-coated flint implements, dated to 40, 000 BC (Mousterian period), have been unearthed. This discovery at least proves that bitumen was used by Neanderthal populations as hafting material to fix handles to their flint tools. Numerous testimonies, proving {{the importance of this}} petroleum-based material in Ancient civilizations, were brought to light by the excavations conducted in the Near East as of the beginning of the century. Bitumen remains show a wide range of uses that can be classified under several headings. First of all, bitumen was largely used in Mesopotamia and Elam as mortar in the construction of palaces (e. g. the Darius Palace in Susa), temples, ziggurats (e. g. the so-called 'Tower of Babel' in Babylon), terraces (e. g. the famous 'Hanging Gardens of Babylon') and exceptionally for roadway coating (e. g. the processional way of Babylon). Since the Neolithic, bitumen served to waterproof containers (baskets, earthenware jars, storage pits), wooden posts, palace grounds (e. g. in Mari and Haradum), reserves of lustral waters, bathrooms, palm roofs, etc. Mats, sarcophagi, coffins and jars, used for funeral practices, were often covered and sealed with bitumen. Reed and wood boats were also caulked with bitumen. Abundant lumps of bituminous mixtures used for that particular purpose have been found in storage rooms of houses at Ra's al-Junayz in Oman. Bitumen was also a widespread adhesive in antiquity and served to repair broken ceramics, fix eyes and horns on statues (e. g. at Tell al-Ubaid around 2500 BC). Beautiful decorations with stones, shells, mother of pearl, on palm trees, cups, ostrich eggs, musical instruments (e. g. the Queen's lyre) and other items, such as rings, jewellery and games, have been excavated from the Royal tombs in Ur. They are on view in the British Museum. With a special enigmatic material, commonly referred to as 'bitumen mastic', the inhabitants of Susa sculpted masterpieces of art which are today exhibited in the Louvre Museum in Paris. This unique collection is presented in a book by Connan and Deschesne (1996). Last, bitumen was also considered as a powerful remedy in medical practice, especially as a disinfectant and insecticide, and was used by the ancient Egyptians to prepare mixtures to embalm the corpses of their dead. Modern analytical techniques, currently applied in the field of petroleum geochemistry, have been adapted to the study of numerous archaeological bituminous mixtures found in excavations. More than 700 bituminous samples have been analysed during the last decade, using gas chromatography alone and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and isotopic chemistry (carbon and hydrogen mainly). These powerful tools, focused on the detailed analysis of biomarkers in hydrocarbon fractions, were calibrated on various well-known natural sources of bitumen in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Bahrain and Kuwait. These reference studies have made it possible to establish the origins of bitumen from numerous archaeological sites and to document the bitumen trade routes in the Middle East and the Arabo-Persian Gulf. Using a well-documented case history, Tell el 'Oueili (5800 to 3500 BC) in South Mesopotamia, we will illustrate in this paper how these new molecular and isotopic tools can help us to recognize different sources of bitumen and to trace the ancient trade routes through time. These import routes were found to vary with major cultural and political changes in the area under study. A second example, referring to the prehistoric period, describes bitumen traces on flint implements, dated from Mousterian times. This discovery, from the Umm El Tlel excavations near El Kown in Syria, was reported in 1996 in Boëda et al. At that time, the origin of the bitumen had not been elucidated due to contamination problems. Last year, a ball of natural oil-stained sands, unearthed from the same archaeological layer, allowed us to determine the source of the bitumen used. This source is regional and located in the Jebel Bichri, nearly 40 km from the archaeological site. The last case history was selected to illustrate another aspect of the investigations carried out. Recent geochemical studies on more than 20 balms from Egyptian mummies from the Intermediate, Ptolemaic and Roman periods have revealed that these balms are composed of various mixtures of bitumen, <b>conifer</b> <b>resins,</b> grease and beeswax. Bitumen occurs with the other ingredients and the balms studied show a great variety of molecular compositions. Bitumen from the Dead Sea area is the most common source but some other sources (Hit in Iraq?) are also revealed by different molecular patterns. The absolute amount of bitumen in balms varies from almost zero to 30 % per weight...|$|R

Second, we found almost similar seasonal patterns when comparing the collecting rates of pieces of wood that had been impregnated with turpentine (a distillate of oleoresin) and untreated pieces of wood, which reveals that the preference for resin is based on odour cues. Third, we tested whether the collection of resin is prophylactic or therapeutic. We found that the relative collection rate of resin versus stones did not depend on an experimental infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in laboratory colonies. Together, these results show that the ants deliberately choose the resin and suggest that resin collection is prophylactic rather than therapeutic...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a paucity}} of {{original}} written information, we base {{our knowledge of the}} pre-Columbian civilizations of Latin America on archaeological and archaeometric analysis. Particularly, the analytical study of funerary materials collected by conquerors in historical times and archaeologists nowadays during their travels and expeditions contributes {{to a better understanding of}} religious practices and social organisation. In the present study, a multi-analytical approach is presented which was used for the characterisation of red and blue organic dyes, inorganic pigments and embalming materials in various archaeological finds from the necropolis of Anco`n (Peru). These included the funerary clothes belonging to a set of three mummies, dated between the 11 th and the 13 th century AD. Chromatographic and spectrometric techniques were used: high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Visible detector (HPLC-UV-Vis) for identifying organic dyes, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX) for recognising pigments, and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) for analysing organic embalming materials. This multi-analytical approach enabled us to characterise a range of materials. The presence of red anthraquinoid dyes and blue indigoid ones was assessed, although it was not always possible to identify the original source with certainty. Cinnabar was identified as the colouring material applied to one mummy’s hair. The molecular markers of <b>conifer</b> <b>resin</b> were detected in the bandages. The analytical results highlighted the use of a number of hitherto unknown dyes and embalming materials in Peruvian funerary rituals...|$|E
40|$|Conifer stem pest {{resistance}} includes constitutive defenses that discourage {{invasion and}} inducible defenses, including phenolic and terpenoid resin synthesis. Recently, methyl jasmonate (MJ) {{was shown to}} induce <b>conifer</b> <b>resin</b> and phenolic defenses; however, {{it is not known}} if MJ is the direct effector or if there is a downstream signal. Exogenous applications of MJ, methyl salicylate, and ethylene were used to assess inducible defense signaling mechanisms in conifer stems. MJ and ethylene but not methyl salicylate caused enhanced phenolic synthesis in polyphenolic parenchyma cells, early sclereid lignification, and reprogramming of the cambial zone to form traumatic resin ducts in Pseudotsuga menziesii and Sequoiadendron giganteum. Similar responses in internodes above and below treated internodes indicate transport of a signal giving a systemic response. Studies focusing on P. menziesii showed MJ induced ethylene production earlier and 77 -fold higher than wounding. Ethylene production was also induced in internodes above the MJ-treated internode. Pretreatment of P. menziesii stems with the ethylene response inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene inhibited MJ and wound responses. Wounding increased 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase protein, but MJ treatment produced a higher and more rapid ACC oxidase increase. ACC oxidase was most abundant in ray parenchyma cells, followed by cambial zone cells and resin duct epithelia. The data show these MJ-induced defense responses are mediated by ethylene. The cambial zone xylem mother cells are reprogrammed to differentiate into resin-secreting epithelial cells by an MJ-induced ethylene burst, whereas polyphenolic parenchyma cells are activated to increase polyphenol production. The results also indicate a central role of ray parenchyma in ethylene-induced defense...|$|E
40|$|We {{successfully}} detected biomass burning tracers including levoglucosan and vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic and dehydroabietic {{acids in}} an ice core (153 m long, ca. 300 years old) taken from Ushkovsky ice cap (altitude, 3903 m), the Kamchatka Peninsula, Northeast Asia. Concentrations of {{total organic carbon}} (TOC) were also determined in the ice core. Levoglucosan, which is produced by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose and thus is a general tracer of biomass burning, showed sporadic peaks in the years of 1705, 1759, 1883, 1915, 1949 and 1972, with the largest peak in 1949. However, its concentrations did not show a systematic increase {{in the last century}} although the concentration peaks seemingly corresponded to the higher ambient temperatures in the northern high latitudes. In contrast, dehydroabietic acid, a specific tracer of the pyrolysis of <b>conifer</b> <b>resin,</b> showed a gradual increase from the early 1900 s to 1990 s with a significant peak in 1970. Contributions of dehydroabietic acid to TOC also showed an increasing trend for the 20 th century. Similarly, vanillic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids presented higher concentrations in the last half-century with sporadic peaks in 1705, 1759 and 1949. This study showed that general biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan have been sporadically transported over the glacier of the Kamchatka Peninsula. In contrast, the ice core record of dehydroabietic acid indicated that fires of boreal conifer forest have more frequently and increasingly occurred in Far East and Siberia during the last century and transported to the Northwestern Pacific. The present study demonstrates that organic tracers of biomass burning preserved in ice core could provide historical records of biomass burning and boreal forest fires...|$|E
40|$|Dehydroabietic acid (DHAA) is a {{specific}} organic tracer for the pyrolysis of <b>conifer</b> <b>resin.</b> To understand its atmospheric stability, the degradation behavior of particulate DHAA {{in the presence of}} hydroxyl radicals (OH) was investigated under different environmental conditions using a stainless steel reactor with volume of 30 cm(3), in the dark. At 25 degrees C and 40 % relative humidity (RH), the second-order rate constant (k(2)) of pure DHAA with OH was measured to be 5. 72 +/- 0. 87 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1). The influence of temperature, RH and mixing state on the degradation kinetics of DHAA were also investigated. At 40 % RH, k(2) of pure DHAA increases with increasing temperature and follows the Arrhenius equation k(2) = (8. 9 +/- 1. 9) x 10 (- 10) exp[-(1508. 2 +/- 64. 2) /T], while RH does not have significant impact on k(2) at 25 degrees C. At 25 degrees C and 40 % RH, compared with pure DHAA, the corresponding k(2) for DHAA mixed with (NH 4) (2) SO 4 decreased to 4. 58 +/- 0. 95 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), while the value was 3. 30 +/- 0. 79 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1) when mixed with soot. The atmospheric lifetime of DHAA varied from 2. 3 +/- 0. 2 to 4. 4 +/- 0. 8 days under different environmental conditions. This study indicates that degradation of DHAA by OH radicals is appreciable, and a significant error in source apportionment should be introduced if the contribution of degradation to DHAA concentration is not considered during air mass aging...|$|E
40|$|Twenty three {{samples of}} Egyptian organic materials, {{spanning}} from the Old Kingdom to the Copto-Byzantine Period, were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sample set {{was comprised of}} ten balm samples from human mummies, three balms from shrews, and ten samples of residues scraped from jars and amphora from storehouses. This research program was undertaken with two main goals: Firstly to provide complementary data on the mummification balms from both humans and animals {{with an emphasis on}} the occurrence of bitumen in mummification mixtures. Secondly to explore whether the jar residues were mixtures that were used for mummification purposes or whether they were pure ingredients stored for various uses including ritual practices. The analysis highlighted that the most abundant constituents of the mummification balms were: fats or oils, waxes, <b>conifer</b> <b>resin,</b> pitch, mastic resin, castor oil, and bitumen. Balms from animal mummies were not found to be significantly different from the balms from human mummies. Residues from potsherds appeared to belong to two categories: pure products (fats and castor oil) and mixtures containing fats, Pinaceae resin and pitch, mastic resin, and castor oil, i. e. the constituents also identified in mummification balms. The mixtures were thus residues of preparations for ritual practices and embalming. This study demonstrates that bitumen is underestimated by the chemical approach currently applied in most archaeometric studies of Egyptian organic residues, which are better suited for the identification of lipids and resinous materials. We thus applied a specific analytical design, targeted at bitumen. Bitumen from the Dead Sea was conclusively identified using as reference materials for comparison, i. e. the present day bitumen from the Dead Sea floating blocks, as well as several bitumens from mummification balms and bitumen lumps unearthed from the archaeological site of Tell Yarmouth near Jerusalem in Israel...|$|E
