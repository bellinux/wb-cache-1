40|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>common</b> European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is {{frequently}} {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The idea of a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a <b>common</b> European <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a <b>common</b> European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a <b>common</b> European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> more problematic. What is a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism?

There is evidence for bilateral trade being the main determinant of free trade agreements. Other statistically significant relationships are the sharing a common language or <b>common</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritages</b> well as being a former colony of the same colonizer which are positively correlated with the FTA formation. ...|$|R

50|$|ICH has {{recently}} drawn international attention {{because of its}} immeasurable contributions to the enhancement of human creativity and cultural diversity. However, ICH of each country has been disappearing rapidly as modernization and industrialization processes within each country were intensified. In particular, ICH {{is not easy to}} preserve and protect from destruction due to its immaterial and formless nature. It exists in people’s memory, ideas, and everyday practices. UNESCO has strenuously made efforts to establish safeguarding measures of ICH throughout the world due to distinctive characteristics of ICH. UNESCO’s initiatives signify its view of ICH as the <b>common</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritages</b> of humanity. As part of such initiatives, UNESCO announced the Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage</b> in 2003. The Convention specifies safeguarding measures additionally proclaimed by the directives of ICH and related guidelines. Of the safeguarding methods, inventories are very important ways in which the intangible heritage community members can raise awareness of their <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> According to UNESCO, the process of inventorying ICH enhances the self-respect of heritage bearers and their respective communities and enriches human creativity. The Convention encourages the involvement of state parties in creating inventories of ICH existing in their territories and providing regular updates of any existing inventories. Updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be fully completed. The Convention allows some flexibility for the state parties in utilizing their own methods in inventory-making.|$|R

Nevertheless the EU initiatives put the abstract policy discourse into practice and concretize its notions about a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> A <b>common</b> strategy in this practice is ‘placing heritage’ – affixing {{the idea of a}} European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> to certain places in order to turn them into specific European heritage sites. The materialisation of a European <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> and the production of physical European heritage sites are crucial elements in the policy through which the EU seeks to govern both the actors and the meanings of heritage. On the basis of a qualitative content analysis of diverse policy documents and informational and promotional material, this article presents five strategies of ‘placing heritage’ used in the EU initiatives.
