5000|$|There is no fixed {{definition}} of a classic car. Two taxation issues do impact however, leading to some people using them as cutoff dates. All cars built before January 1, 1976, are exempted from paying the annual road tax vehicle excise duty. This is then entered on the licence disc displayed on the windscreen as [...] "historic vehicle" [...] (if a car built before this date has been first registered in 1975 or later, then its build date {{would have to be}} verified by a recognised body such as British Motor Heritage Foundation to claim tax-free status). HM Revenue and Customs define a classic car for <b>company</b> <b>taxation</b> purposes as being over 15 years old and having a value in excess of £15,000. Additionally, popular acclaim through a large number of classic car magazines {{plays an important role in}} whether a car comes to be regarded as a classic. It is all subjective and a matter of opinion. The elimination of depreciation is a reason for buying a classic car; this is a major cost of owning a modern car. Picking 'future classics' that are current 'bangers' is a pastime of people into classic cars in the UK. Successfully picking and buying one can result in a profit for the buyer as well as providing transport. An immaculate well cared for prestige model with high running costs that impacts its value, but is not yet old enough to be regarded as a classic, could be a good buy, for example.|$|E
