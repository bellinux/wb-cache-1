25|$|Protocrystalline silicon {{with a low}} volume {{fraction}} of nanocrystalline silicon is optimal for high open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage.</b> Nc-Si has about the same bandgap as c-Si and nc-Si and a-Si can advantageously be combined in thin layers, creating a layered cell called a tandem cell. The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nc-Si.|$|E

50|$|While {{the most}} common problem {{adapting}} flash equipment to cameras is an excessive trigger voltage, sometimes the trigger <b>circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> provided by some modern flashes or radio triggers can also be too low {{to ensure that the}} electronic triggering circuits in the camera or receiver can still reliable trigger it. Trigger <b>circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> below ca. 2 to 2.5 volts may exhibit this problem, unless the triggering circuit is specifically designed to continue to work with such low voltages as well.|$|R

25|$|The {{fill factor}} is {{the ratio of the}} actual maximum {{obtainable}} power to the product of the open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and short circuit current. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells with a high fill factor have a low equivalent series resistance and a high equivalent shunt resistance, so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.|$|E
25|$|Reducing {{the silicon}} wafer {{thickness}} at a minimized efficiency loss represents a mainstream trend in increasing the cost-effectiveness of wafer-based solar cells. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that, using the advanced light trapping strategy with a properly designed nano-particle architecture, the wafer thickness can be dramatically reduced to only around 1/10 {{of the current}} thickness (180µm) without any solar cell efficiency loss at 18.2%. Nano-particle integrated ultra-thin solar cells with only 3% of the current wafer thickness can potentially achieve 15.3% efficiency combining the absorption enhancement {{with the benefit of}} thinner wafer induced open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> increase. This represents a 97% material saving with only 15% relative efficiency loss. These results demonstrate the feasibility and prospect of achieving high-efficiency ultra-thin silicon wafer cells with plasmonic light trapping.|$|E
25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic devices with {{perovskite}} {{materials as}} light absorbing material were fabricated through sequential vapor deposition of lead iodide and methylammonium iodide with undoped poly 3 hexylthiophene (P 3 HT) as a hole transporting layer. The sequential vapor deposition process produced films and devices {{with the large}} grains and low defect densities, very small values of dark current, and high open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltages.</b> The thickness of the P 3 HT layer was a critical parameter for achieving high solar conversion efficiencies of 13. 7 %. The vapor deposition process also produced devices with a tight distribution of performance characteristics and very high open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> (0. 99 V) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{output voltage}} always {{has the same}} sign as the op-amp input voltage {{but it does not}} always have the same sign as the <b>circuit</b> input <b>voltage</b> (the signs of the two input {{voltages}} can differ). When the <b>circuit</b> input <b>voltage</b> is above the high threshold or below the low threshold, the output voltage has the same sign as the <b>circuit</b> input <b>voltage</b> (the <b>circuit</b> is non-inverting). It acts like a comparator that switches at a different point depending on whether the output of the comparator is high or low. When the <b>circuit</b> input <b>voltage</b> is between the thresholds, the output voltage is undefined and it depends on the last state (the circuit behaves as an elementary latch).|$|R
25|$|A high {{temperature}} anhydrous example is PCMOF2, {{which consists of}} sodium ions coordinated to a trisulfonated benzene derivative. To improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures, water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or triazole molecules within the pores. The maximum temperature achieved was 150°C with an optimum conductivity of 5 x 10−4 S/cm, which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes. However, this model holds promise for its temperature regime, anhydrous conditions, and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores, all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity. Additionally, the triazole-loaded PCMOF2 was incorporated into a H2/air membrane-electrode assembly and achieved an open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> of 1.18 V at 100°C that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing. This was the first instance that proved MOFs could actually be implemented into functioning fuel cells, and the moderate potential difference showed that fuel crossover due to porosity was not an issue.|$|E
500|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, none of {{the transfer}} matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice. [...] Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy. [...] For waveguide implementations, <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and current are entirely meaningless. [...] Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead. [...] These are the powers tranmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in the transmission line technology used in distributed-element circuits in the microwave band. [...] The most well known and widely used of these sorts of parameters is the scattering parameters, or s-parameters.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. [...] For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. [...] Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300–10,000 V peak-to-peak.|$|E
2500|$|Newer rapid start [...] ballast designs provide {{filament}} power windings {{within the}} ballast; these rapidly and continuously warm the filaments/cathodes using low-voltage AC. Usually operating {{at a lower}} arc voltage than the instant start design; no inductive voltage spike is produced for starting, so the lamps must be mounted near a grounded (earthed) reflector to allow the glow discharge to propagate through the tube and initiate the arc discharge. In some lamps a grounded [...] "starting aid" [...] strip {{is attached to the}} outside of the lamp glass. This ballast technology isn't used outside North America, where 220-240V line voltage is common, and are incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps because these lamps requires a higher starting voltage than that of the open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> of rapid start ballasts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrical}} {{driving force}} or [...] across the terminals {{of a cell}} {{is known as the}} terminal voltage (difference) and is measured in volts. The terminal voltage of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the open-circuit voltage and equals the emf of the cell. Because of internal resistance, the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging exceeds the open-circuit voltage. An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would maintain a constant terminal voltage of [...] until exhausted, then dropping to zero. If such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and stored a charge of one coulomb then on complete discharge it would perform 1.5 joules of work. In actual cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge and the open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> also decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed.|$|E

All amorphous silicon layers are deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in a one chamber direct plasma reactor working at a radio frequency of 13. 56 MHz. The main focus of this work is to study the influence of p- and n-doped Czochralski (Cz) silicon base material with different surface morphology on the cell results of amorphous crystalline SHJ solar cells with intrinsic thin layers.

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.|$|E
