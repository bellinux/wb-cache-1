40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical significance and technique of intraocular lens implantation in {{the condition of}} vitreous <b>cavity</b> <b>filled</b> with gas. METHODS: Clinical data of 36 patients(36 eyes) who received intraocular lens implantation in the condition of vitreous <b>cavity</b> <b>filled</b> with gas was retrospectively studied. The postoperative follow-up period was for 3 - 12 months, averaged in 5. 6 months. RESULTS: Postoperative visual activity improved 2 - 6 lines compared with preoperative best corrected visual activity in all eyes. No severe complication occurred. CONCLUSION: Assisted with noncontact panoramic viewing systems, {{it is easier to}} observe peripheral retinal clearly for photocoagulation in aphakia with gas <b>filled</b> vitreous <b>cavity.</b> Intraocular lens implantation in the condition of vitreous <b>cavity</b> <b>filled</b> with gas is easier, without unnecessary duplication operation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{geometric}} {{structures of}} the mold and embossing conditions can obviously influence the filling flows in the polymeric patterns. In this study, embossing stamp and substrate with different geometries are used to investigate the flow behavior under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. In general, for the stamp, small duty ratio <b>cavity</b> <b>fills</b> more sufficiently than large duty ratio cavity. With the same cavity duty ratio, inner <b>cavity</b> <b>fills</b> more quickly and sufficient than outer cavity. Compared to multiple cavities stamp, individual <b>cavity</b> <b>fills</b> more slowly, especially embossed with the stamp having small duty ratio cavity. Under non-isothermal embossing, the filling flow indicates a wall climbing flow and the polymer flow replaces the outer cavity better. Uncommon substrate provides a limitation of out-squeezing flow from polymer layers, so the polymer pick reaches the mold faster than common substrate like the flat. The present simulation study provides {{an analysis of the}} mold geometry especially the substrate geometry to govern filling flow and replication fidelity...|$|R

50|$|Rib {{features}} help in {{strengthening the}} molded part without adding to wall thickness. In some cases, {{they can also}} act as decorative features. Ribs also provide alignment in mating parts or provide stopping surfaces for assemblies. However, projections like ribs can create <b>cavity</b> <b>filling,</b> venting, and ejection problems. These problems become more troublesome for taller ribs. Ribs need to be designed in correct proportion to avoid defects such as short shots and provide the required strength. Thick and deep ribs can cause sink marks and filling problems respectively. Deep ribs {{can also lead to}} ejection problems. If ribs are too long or too wide, supporting ribs may be required. It is better to use a number of smaller ribs instead of one large rib.|$|E

50|$|Coloradoite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1877 by F. A. Genth, from the Smuggler Mine at Balarat and the Keystone and Mountain Lion mines of the Magnolia district in Colorado; {{it was named}} after the state it was found in. Later studies showed its existence in other mines of the region as well as Kalgoorlie, Australia and Kirkland Lake District, Canada. It is found in large quantities in ores made up of intergrown tellurium, calverite or sylvanite, melonite and altaite, as anhedral grains either enclosed in single crystals of tellurium or localized along grain boundaries in tellurium aggregates, among others. The tectonic settings for ore deposits are; (a) Magmatic deposits (Waarkraal, South Africa) (b) Contact metasomatic (Nickel Plate mine, British Columbia, (c) Lode and Massive replacement deposits (Kirkland Lake, Ontario and South Dakota, respectively), and (d) <b>Cavity</b> <b>filling</b> (Cripple Creek, Colorado, Kalgoorlie, Australia). Tellurides are accountable for just about 20% of gold production and gold mineralization is hosted chiefly by Archean-aged dolerites and basalts that have been metamorphosed to the greenschist facies. This mineralization occurs in hundreds of auriferous and telluride-bearing lodes.|$|E

40|$|Injection molding small {{milligram}} components requires precise metering and high-speed injection. Industrially, metering can {{be maintained}} either by using small injection screws (≤ 14 mm in diameter) or plungers as small as 3 mm diameter and/or by having very large sprues and runners. Although large sprues and runners increase metering volume, they hide the effect of process parameters on microcomponents. Consequently, knowledge of conventional injection molding is not transferable to microinjection molding, making quality control and optimization difficult. We investigated the filling and postfilling behavior of 25 mm 3 microdumbbell specimens with 289 mm 3 sprue and runner by in-line process monitoring. Design of Experiments were carried out to characterize the effects of process parameters on <b>cavity</b> <b>filling</b> and postfilling behavior. Process characterization indicated that the machine transition from velocity control to pressure control (V-P transition) was around 10 ms: this was comparable to <b>cavity</b> <b>filling</b> time and {{had a significant effect}} on <b>cavity</b> <b>filling</b> behavior. Traditional short shot trials cannot provide the correct shot size for small parts, but introduce the effect of holding pressure into <b>cavity</b> <b>filling.</b> Based on a shot size optimization method using only cavity pressure and screw velocity, we eliminated the effect of holding parameters on <b>cavity</b> <b>filling...</b>|$|E
