5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution only {{requires}} {{members of}} the Council to be Singapore citizens residing in Singapore who are at least 35 years old. There is no restriction on Cabinet ministers and members of political parties. Moreover, the Prime Minister may authorize any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to attend Council meetings. It has been noted that this may have a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on the Council's deliberations as such a guest might be the author or a vocal proponent of the legislation under scrutiny. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested}} that members with political affiliations can often make the biggest contribution towards the Council's discussions. Another criticism of the PCMR's composition is that having judges on the Council may lead to a conflict of interest as they may have to exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament they have either endorsed or rejected previously.|$|E

25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the development of}} free software in France, since any modern desktop system is {{supposed to be able to}} read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{distinction}} between a legal system which utilizes judges as triers of both law and fact, {{as opposed to a}} system which incorporates jury trials, has been termed artificial. In a jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom, the same test applies to both jury and non-jury cases. Arguably in a non-jury legal system, there is more public interest in ensuring that judges remain accountable to the people. Hence, there should be greater freedom to discuss the manner in which judges carry out their functions. Finally, {{it has been said that}} the preference for the inherent tendency test because it allows the court to take action before the administration of justice is affected should be evaluated carefully, as it may have an undue <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on speech.|$|E
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture.

Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.|$|E
40|$|Privacy law {{relies on}} the {{argument}} that consent does not entail any relevant impediments for the liberty of the consenting individual.

Providing people with a prior consent option is sufficient to generate <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e., a reduction of norm-deviant behavior).

We also test how the default design of the right to deletion of personal information (right to be forgotten) affects <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> and privacy valuations. Surprisingly, the right to be forgotten does not reduce <b>chilling</b> <b>effects.</b> Moreover, individuals tend to stick with the status quo of permanent information storage...|$|R

This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on future research. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation.

25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have a <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E
