50|$|In twin pregnancies, it is {{very common}} for one or both babies {{to be in the}} breech {{position}}. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30-40% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally. After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin's feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally. However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be performed. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication known as Locked twins. This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens a cesarean section should be performed immediately.|$|E

In these cases, the chin of the first twin locks behind the chin of the second twin while in the uterus or birth canal, preventing vaginal delivery. In vertex/vertex presentations, where both twins are positioned for head-first delivery, the two heads become locked at the pelvic brim, preventing either fetus from passing through the pelvic inlet in a vaginal delivery.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{provide insight}} into the {{differential}} effect of immigration on cesarean section (CS) rates, using the Robson classification. Design. A population-based study using birth certificates from the birth registry of 2009. Setting. All births in two of the three Belgian regions excluding Flanders. Population. 37   628 deliveries from Belgian and immigrant mothers from sub-Saharan Africa, Maghreb and Eastern Europe. Methods. Multivariate analyses using CS as the dependent variable and immigration status as the primary independent variable. Several multivariate logistic regression models were built including medical, anthropometric, socio-economic characteristics, and medical interventions. The impact of analyzing all delivery sites together was tested using mixed-effect analyses. Main outcome measures. CSs of immigrant subgroups compared with Belgian women. Results. CS rates varied according to immigrant subgroups. Mothers from sub-Saharan Africa had an adjusted odds ratio of 2. 06 (1. 62 - 2. 63) for CS compared with Belgian natives. Increased risk for mothers from sub-Saharan Africa compared with Belgian natives was found among nulliparous and multiparous women without previous CS, and a term, singleton fetus in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position.</b> In comparison, nulliparous East European mothers with a term singleton fetus in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> in spontaneous labor had an adjusted odds ratio of 0. 29 (0. 08 - 0. 99) for CS. Conclusions. CS rates currently vary between Robson categories in immigrant subgroups. Immigrant mothers from sub-Saharan Africa with a term, singleton infant in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position,</b> without previous CS, appear to carry the highest burden.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} computed tomographic (CT) myelography in the detection of root damage and differentiation of root avulsions from neurotmesis in a large cohort of patients with an obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived by the medical ethics committee. One hundred eighteen patients with OBPL born in the <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> and six patients born in the breech position were selected for surgery by two neurosurgeons in a multidisciplinary team. Functional loss of the C 5 through T 1 innervated muscles was noted. All patients underwent preoperative CT myelography at {{an average age of}} 19 weeks. CT myelographic examination results were reviewed by two radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical findings, for the presence of root avulsions and pseudocysts. Interobserver agreement was assessed by calculating kappa values. RESULTS: CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in at least one level in 66 (56 %) of 118 patients born in the <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> and in six (100 %) of six patients born in the breech position. Levels C 7 and C 8 showed the most root avulsions, even if not expected from clinical examination results. A large number of root avulsions showed pseudocysts (73 [68 %] of 107 levels in patients born in the <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> and 11 [73 %] of 15 levels in patients born in the breech position). CONCLUSION: CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in more than half of patients with OBPL. Root avulsions were even detected at levels that were not expected at clinical examination. Because root avulsions require specific reconstructive techniques, CT myelography is recommended for every preoperative patient with OBPL...|$|E

Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. Eight hospitals in the Netherlands, August 2009 to May 2014. 830 women with a singleton fetus in breech presentation and a gestational age of more than 34 weeks were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to either 6. 75 mg atosiban (n= 416) or 40 μg fenoterol (n= 414) intravenously for uterine relaxation before ECV. The primary outcome measures were a fetus in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> 30 minutes after the procedure and cephalic presentation at delivery. Secondary outcome measures were mode of delivery, incidence of fetal and maternal complications, and drug related adverse events. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. <b>Cephalic</b> <b>position</b> 30 minutes after ECV occurred significantly less in the atosiban group than in the fenoterol group (34 % v 40 %, relative risk 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval 0. 55 to 0. 93).

Methods We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study in a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Delivery outcomes of women with a successful ECV were compared with those of women with spontaneously occurring cephalic presentations, controlling for maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery, and onset of labour (spontaneous or induced). Exclusion criteria were a history of Caesarean section, delivery at < 35 weeks, and elective Caesarean section. The primary outcome was the prevalence of Caesarean section and instrumental delivery in both groups; secondary outcomes were the characteristics of cases requiring intervention such as Caesarean section or instrumental delivery. Results Women who had a successful ECV had a significantly higher Caesarean section rate than the women in the control group (33 / 220 [15 %] vs. 62 / 1030 [6. 0 %]; P < 0. 001). There was no difference in the incidence of instrumental delivery (20 / 220 [9. 1 %] vs. 103 / 1030 [10 %]). Comparison of characteristics of women in the cases group showed that nulliparity, induction of labour, and occiput posterior presentation were associated with Caesarean section and instrumental deliveries.

40|$|Objective:  To {{evaluate}} {{whether there is}} an association between maternal thyroid hormone and foetal <b>cephalic</b> head <b>position</b> at term gestation. Context:  Rotation and flexion of the head enables the foetus to negotiate the birth canal.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundFixation {{devices to}} treat trochanteric {{fractures}} belong to two general categories: dynamic hip screw (DHS) type and intramedullary type implants. In spite of possible pitfalls, both are considered valid options. Comparing a sliding screw-plate system (DHS) along a mini-invasive nailing device (BCM™ nail) with primary insertion of the cephalic screw, {{sheds light on}} the debated management of trochanteric fractures. HypothesisDue to its design, the BCM™ nailing system allows a stable internal fixation and promotes enhanced postoperative functional recovery. ObjectivesTo test this hypothesis in a comparative prospective case-control study using the DHS screw-plate as a reference. Materials and methodsTwo groups of 30 patients, older than 60 years old, with trochanteric fractures were included in this study. The screw-plates were placed according to the standard method. Regarding the nailing system, the <b>cephalic</b> screw was <b>positioned</b> first, then the nail was inserted through the screw via a mini-invasive approach and locked distally using a bicortical screw. Comparison {{between the two groups}} was based on (1) operative data: operating time, intra- and postoperative blood loss; (2) immediate postoperative course: complications, length of hospital stay, delay to sitting in a wheelchair; (3) the postdischarge evolution: weightbearing, readmission to hospital; (4) functional outcomes: recovery and mobility; (5) anatomical outcomes: restitution and bone healing. ResultsThe operating time (54 ± 8. 8 min vs 59 ± 13. 8 min) and intraoperative (1. 37 ± 0. 98 vs 1. 90 ± 1. 43) and at Day 3 (1. 25 ± 1. 05 vs 1. 82 ± 1. 5) blood loss (haemoglobin loss), were favourable to the screw-plate subgroup (p< 0. 05). The delay to sitting in a wheelchair (4. 76 ± 1. 53 d vs 4 ± 1. 44 d) was favourable to the nail subgroup (p< 0. 05). There was a higher incidence of secondary displacements in the screw-plate subgroup (3 / 26 [11. 5 %] vs 0 / 25 [0 %]) (p< 0. 05). The screw-plate subgroup demonstrated a poorer healing rate at 3 months (88 % vs 100 %) (p< 0. 05). Regarding functional recovery, a lesser decrease in the Parker score was observed in the nail subgroup at 3 postoperative months (2. 42 ± 2. 3 vs 1. 52 ± 1. 44) (p< 0. 05). ConclusionThis study has shown the benefits of the BCM™ nail in terms of stability. But the potential advantages of this mini-invasive technique were limited by ancillary-related difficulties which need to be rectified. These preliminary results are in favour of a further development of this innovating device. Level of evidenceLevel III. Case-report study...|$|R

SETTING: Three academic and six non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. POPULATION: Labouring women with a high-risk singleton pregnancy in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> beyond 36 weeks of gestation. METHODS: We studied 142 women with fever (≥ 38. 0 °C) during labour and 141 women with normal temperature who had been included in two previous studies. In both groups, we counted the number and type of ST-events and classified them as significant (intervention needed) or not significant, based on STAN(®) clinical guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and type of ST-events. RESULTS: Both univariable and multivariable regression analysis showed no association between the presence of maternal intrapartum fever and the number or type of ST-events. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal intrapartum fever is not associated with ST-segment changes of the fetal electrocardiogram. Interpretation of ST-changes in labouring women with fever should therefore not differ from other situations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Worldwide {{induction}} and cesarean delivery {{rates have}} increased rapidly, with consequences for subsequent pregnancies. The majority of intra-partum cesarean deliveries are performed {{for failure to}} progress, typically in nulliparous women at term. Current uterine registration techniques fail to identify inefficient contractions leading to first stage labor arrest. An alternative technique, uterine electromyography {{has been shown to}} identify inefficient contractions leading to first stage arrest of labor in nulliparous women with spontaneous onset of labor at term. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether this finding can be reproduced in induction of labor MATERIAL AND METHODS: Uterine activity was measured in 141 nulliparous women with singleton term pregnancies and a fetus in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> during induced labor. Electrical activity of the myometrium during contractions was characterized by its power density spectrum RESULTS: No significant differences were found in contraction characteristics between women with induced labor delivering vaginally with or without oxytocin and women with arrested labor with subsequent cesarean delivery CONCLUSION: Uterine electromyography shows no correlation with progression of labor in induced labor, which is in contrast to spontaneous labor.

40|$|A prospective, {{randomized}} study {{comparing the}} compression hip screw with the Gamma {{nail in the}} treatment of 426 intertrochanteric fractures is reported. The median patient age was 80 years, and 71 % were women The compression hip screw operation took less time except in Evans Type 5 fractures. Blood loss generally was less in the compression hip screw group except in patients with Type 5 fractures. The most frequent surgical problem for patients in the Gamma group was problems with distal locking. <b>Cephalic</b> <b>position</b> of the femoral head screw and cut-out were seen more often in the Gamma nail group. The Gamma nail more frequently preserved the fracture position obtained perioperatively. Whether there was distal locking of the Gamma nail in unstable fractures did not seem to affect the healing rate. Additional fissures or fractures in the proximal femur occurred during five Gamma nail operations and two compression hip screw operations. Postoperative walking ability did not differ between the groups. At 6 months 88 % of the fractures were healed. In less comminuted fractures, the compression hip screw method is the preferred method of treatment whereas the Gamma nail is an alternative treatment for more comminuted Evans Type 5 fractures...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{identify}} {{potential risk}} factors for cesarean delivery following labor induction in multiparous women at term. Methods. We conducted a retrospective case-control study. Cases were parous women in whom the induction of labor had resulted in a cesarean delivery. For each case, we used the data of two successful inductions as controls. Successful induction {{was defined as a}} vaginal delivery after the induction of labor. The study was limited to term singleton pregnancies with a child in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position.</b> Results. Between 1995 and 2010, labor was induced in 2548 parous women, of whom 80 had a cesarean delivery (3 %). These 80 cases were compared to the data of 160 parous women with a successful induction of labor. In the multivariate analysis history of preterm delivery (odds ratio (OR) 5. 3 (95 % CI 1. 1 to 25)), maternal height (OR 0. 87 (95 % CI 0. 80 to 0. 95)) and dilatation at the start of induction (OR 0. 43 (95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 98)) were associated with failed induction. Conclusion. In multiparous women, the risk of cesarean delivery following labor induction increases with previous preterm delivery, short maternal height, and limited dilatation at the start of inductio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} median episiotomy and severe (third- and fourth-degree) perineal lacerations in primiparous women. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital providing secondary obstetric care in Quebec City. PATIENTS: A total of 6522 primiparous women who gave birth vaginally to a single live baby in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> between 1985 and 1993. OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations. RESULTS: Median episiotomy was performed in 4390 women (67. 3 %). A total of 1002 women (15. 4 %) had a third- or fourth-degree laceration. The frequency of severe perineal lacerations was 20. 6 % with episiotomy and 4. 5 % without episiotomy (relative risk [RR] 4. 58, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 74 - 5. 62). This association persisted after adjustment by stratified analysis for type of delivery and birth weight (RR 3. 03, 95 % CI 2. 52 - 3. 63) and by logistic regression for type of delivery, birth weight, epidural analgesia, shoulder dystocia, baby's head circumference, experience of the physician and year of delivery (odds ratio 3. 58, 95 % CI 2. 84 - 4. 50). CONCLUSION: Median episiotomy is strongly associated with third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations in primiparous women. Reducing {{the use of this}} procedure could decrease the occurrence of severe perineal tears...|$|E

Is intrapartum fever {{associated}} with ST-waveform {{changes of the}} fetal electrocardiogram? A retrospective cohort study. BJOG 2012; 119 : 14101416. Objective To investigate the association between maternal intrapartum fever and ST-waveform changes of the fetal electrocardiogram. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Three academic and six non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Population Labouring women with a high-risk singleton pregnancy in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> beyond 36 weeks of gestation. Methods We studied 142 women with fever (= 38. 0 degrees C) during labour and 141 women with normal temperature who had been included in two previous studies. In both groups, we counted the number and type of ST-events and classified them as significant (intervention needed) or not significant, based on STAN (R) clinical guidelines. Main outcome measures Number and type of ST-events. Results Both univariable and multivariable regression analysis showed no association between the presence of maternal intrapartum fever and the number or type of ST-events.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} midpregnancy cervical length and postterm delivery and cesarean delivery during labor. In a multicenter cohort study, cervical length was measured in low-risk singleton pregnancies between 16 and 22 weeks of gestation. From this cohort, we identified nulliparous women who delivered beyond 34 weeks and calculated cervical length quartiles. We performed logistic regression to compare the risk of postterm delivery and intrapartum cesarean delivery to cervical length quartiles, using the lowest quartile as a reference. We adjusted for induction of labor, maternal age, ethnicity, <b>cephalic</b> <b>position,</b> preexisting hypertension, and gestational age at delivery. We studied 5, 321 nulliparous women. Women with cervical length in the 3 rd and 4 th quartile {{were more likely to}} deliver at 42 (+ 0) to 42 (+ 6) weeks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2. 02, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 07 - 3. 79 and aOR 1. 97, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 3. 67, respectively). The frequency of intrapartum cesarean delivery increased with cervical length quartile from 9. 4 % in the 1 st to 14. 9 % in the 4 th quartile (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). This increase was only present in intrapartum cesarean delivery because of failure to progress and not because of fetal distress. The longer the cervix at midtrimester the higher the risk of both postterm delivery and intrapartum cesarean deliver...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} successful external cephalic version on the incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) requiring treatment in singleton breech presentation at term. Observational cohort study. Three large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Women with a singleton breech presentation of 34 weeks of gestation or more, who underwent an external cephalic version attempt. We made {{a comparison of the}} incidence of DDH between children born in breech presentation and children born in cephalic presentation after a successful external cephalic version. The incidence of DDH requiring either conservative treatment, with a harness, or surgical treatment. A total of 498 newborns were included in the study, of which 40 (8 %) were diagnosed with DDH and 35 required treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender (OR 2. 79, 95 % CI 1. 23 - 6. 35) and successful external cephalic version (OR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 95) were independently associated with DDH. A successful external cephalic version is associated with a lower incidence of DDH, although a high percentage of children born after a successful external cephalic version still appear to have DDH. A larger cohort study is needed to establish the definite nature of this relationship. Until then, we recommend the same screening policy for infants born in <b>cephalic</b> <b>position</b> after a successful external cephalic version as for infants born in breech positio...|$|E
