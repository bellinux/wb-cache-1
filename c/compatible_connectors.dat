40|$|Connection of {{the space}} grid {{elements}} by using connectors {{is one of the}} most common practices for construction of space structures. These connectors usually involve higher fabrication cost due to their complex geometry. To address this issue, in the present work, a new solid connector with simple geometry has been developed by truncating the corners of a cube, and is named as Truncated Hexahedron (THH). The experimental, theoretical and analytical studies have been carried out to obtain the stresses for THH connector. An instrumented axial loading test has been performed on actual THH connector, and the load-stress relationship has been obtained from load and strain measurement. A manual finite element analysis has also been carried out for theoretical computation of the stresses in the connector. Further, the THH connector has been modelled and analysed using ANSYS software and the obtained results have been compared with experimental and theoretically computed results. Subsequently, in order to assess the performance of THH connector in comparison to a standard connector (Spherical connector), a double layer grid has been analysed considering both Spherical and THH connectors at each joint of the grid separately, and it has been observed that the maximum principal stresses in both the connectors are mostly comparable. Hence, the newly developed THH connector can be considered to be as efficient as the Spherical connector. The study opens up a possibility of resorting to a new <b>compatible</b> <b>connector</b> for space grid structures, which can be easily manufactured due to its uncomplicated geometry, making it comparatively cheaper and quicker for fabrication...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} {{years there has been}} a {{considerable}} increase in electricity consumption and generation from renewable sources, especially wind and solar photovoltaic. This phenomenon has increased the risk of line saturation with the consequent need of increasing the capacity of some power lines. Considering the high cost and the time involved in installing new power lines, the difficulty in acquiring tower sites and the related environmental impacts, some countries are considering to replace conventional conductors with HTLS (High-Temperature Low-Sag) conductors. This is a feasible and economical solution. In this paper a numerical-FEM (Finite Element Method) approach to simulate the temperature rise test in both conventional and high-capacity substation <b>connectors</b> <b>compatible</b> with HTLS technology is presented. The proposed coupled electric-thermal 3 D-FEM transient analysis allows calculating the temperature distribution in both the connector and the conductors for a given current profile.

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet <b>compatible</b> with the <b>connector</b> {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|R
