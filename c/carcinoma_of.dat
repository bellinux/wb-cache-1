5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common.

Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell <b>carcinoma</b> <b>of</b> the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E

We describe a pooled case series from published reports <b>of</b> neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the ampulla of Vater including a case which presented to our institution. Methods A narrative review was undertaken including all published English case reports of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the ampulla of Vater. Our primary outcome was to determine overall survival. Results Twenty cases of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the ampulla of Vater were identified. Seventy-six percent of patients were reported to have died of disease with mean survival of 11. 8 months. Twenty percent of the tumours were associated with an adenoma.

Conclusions This pooled analysis demonstrates both the rarity and poor prognosis of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the ampulla of Vater.

40|$|Endemic (Balkan) {{nephropathy}} is {{a chronic}} tubulointerstitial disease frequently accompanied by urothelial cell <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the upper urinary tract. This disorder {{has recently been}} linked to exposure to aristolochic acid, a powerful nephrotoxin and human carcinogen. Following metabolic activation, aristolochic acid reacts with genomic DNA to form aristolactam-DNA adducts that generate a unique TP 53 mutational spectrum in the urothelium. The aristolactam-DNA adducts are concentrated in the renal cortex, thus serving as biomarkers of internal exposure to aristolochic acid. Here, we present molecular epidemiologic evidence relating <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the upper urinary tract to dietary exposure to aristolochic acid. DNA was extracted from the renal cortex and urothelial tumor tissue of 67 patients that underwent nephroureterectomy for <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the upper urinary tract and resided in regions of known endemic nephropathy. Ten patients from nonendemic regions with <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the upper urinary tract served as controls. Aristolactam-DNA adducts were quantified by 32 P-postlabeling, the adduct was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and TP 53 mutations in tumor tissues were identified by chip sequencing. Adducts were present in 70 % of the endemic cohort and in 94 % of patients with specific A:T to T:A mutations in TP 53. In contrast, neither aristolactam-DNA adducts nor specific mutations were detected in tissues of patients residing in nonendemic regions. Thus, in genetically susceptible individuals, dietary exposure to aristolochic acid is causally related to endemic nephropathy and <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the upper urinary tract...|$|R

40|$|Are mucinous and nonmucinous carcinomas two {{distinct}} groups with different genetic lesions? To confirm this hypothesis {{the expression of}} MUC 2 and of p 53 was immunhistochemically investigated in 20 mucinous and nonmucinous <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the colon, pancreas, breast and ovary. P 53 -Expression was detectable in 39 - 64 per cent <b>of</b> the mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the colon, pancreas, breast and ovary, and in 57 - 72 per cent <b>of</b> the nonmucinous <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> these organs. Thus, the mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> showed expression <b>of</b> the p 53 gene with a lower frequency than the nonmucinous carcinomas, but this difference was significant only in the subgroup <b>of</b> colonic <b>carcinomas.</b> The mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the colon, pancreas, breast and ovary showed MUC 2 expression with a higher frequency than the nonmucinous carcinomas. This difference was overall significant. In ovarian, pancreatic and breast tissue where MUC 2 is normally absent, the development <b>of</b> a mucinous <b>carcinoma</b> is associated with de novo expression of MUC 2. This shows, that the tumors of the pancreas, ovary and colon classified upon their morphology as mucinous tumors share similarities also on the molecular level. These characteristics differentiate the mucinous carcinomas from the nonmucinous carcinomas but without forming two discrete groups. Only the mucinous <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> the breast differ in 100 per cent from the nonmucinous carcinomas by de novo expression of MUC 2. An inverse correlation between expression of p 53 and MUC 2 {{as an indicator of}} possible interaction between p 53 and MUC 2 could be excluded. To detect humoral immunoreactivity against overexpressed MUC 2 18 sera of patients exhibiting mucinous carcinomas were investigated if they show reactivity with a peptide out of the MUC 2 core protein.
