40|$|The clouds (IP) versus strings (connection-oriented) {{debate over}} the Internet {{architecture}} is reexamined. Controllability and observability are shown {{to be the key}} to the performance (QoS) of the networks. The <b>clouds</b> <b>architecture</b> treats the network as a black box, making it uncontrollable and unobservable; in contrast, the strings architecture was designed to be a controllable and observable structure. With the simple-core-complex-edge model, the <b>clouds</b> <b>architecture</b> seems to simplify network management. However, the rise of policy-based networking argues for centralized management. Finally, TCP is shown to be unscalable in performance due to its half-blind observability and half-effort controllability...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the dot-com}} bubble, Amazon {{played a key}} role in the {{development}} of cloud computing by modernizing their data centers, which, like most computer networks, were using as little as 10% of their capacity at any one time, just to leave room for occasional spikes. Having found that the new <b>cloud</b> <b>architecture</b> resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements whereby small, fast-moving [...] "two-pizza teams" [...] (teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas) could add new features faster and more easily, Amazon initiated a new product development effort to provide cloud computing to external customers, and launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) on a utility computing basis in 2006.|$|E
50|$|An EAV {{approach}} is justified {{only when the}} attributes that are being modeled are numerous and sparse: if the data being captured does not meet this requirement, the cloud vendors' default EAV {{approach is}} often a mismatch for applications that require a true back-end database (as opposed to merely a means of persistent data storage). Retrofitting {{the vast majority of}} existing database applications, which use a traditional data-modeling approach, to an EAV-type <b>cloud</b> <b>architecture,</b> would require major surgery. Microsoft discovered, for example, that its database-application-developer base was largely reluctant to invest such effort.
