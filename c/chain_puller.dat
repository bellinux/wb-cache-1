Much of the work on this album had been finalized and some demos had been circulated when fate once again struck the Beefheart camp. In May 1976 the long association between Zappa and his manager/business partner Herb Cohen ceased. This resulted in Zappa's finances and ongoing works becoming part of protracted legal negotiations. The Bat <b>Chain</b> <b>Puller</b> project went [...] "on ice" [...] and did not see an official release until 2012. After this recording John Thomas joined ex-Magic Band members in Mallard.|$|E

Don Van Vliet proposed {{that half of}} the tracks from Bat <b>Chain</b> <b>Puller</b> be included on Ice Cream for Crow, but Zappa refused Vliet's request, leading Vliet to compose mostly new material for the album (the one exception is the a cappella track [...] "81 Poop Hatch", which Vliet included from his own copy of the Bat <b>Chain</b> <b>Puller</b> tape, although [...] "The Thousandth And Tenth Day Of The Human Totem Pole" [...] was rerecorded).

Four new songs completed the album, these being [...] "You Know You're A Man", [...] "When I See Mommy I Feel Like A Mummy", [...] "Love Lies" [...] and [...] "Tropical Hot Dog Night", the latter being based on a riff of the Bat <b>Chain</b> <b>Puller</b> song [...] "Odd Jobs", which was otherwise not rerecorded. The album was completed with [...] "Apes-Ma", which is the same recording on both versions, due to being sourced from Van Vliet's own home recording. The result was released as Shiny Beast (Bat <b>Chain</b> <b>Puller).</b> Versions of [...] "Run Paint Run Run" [...] and [...] "The Witch Doctor Life" [...] were attempted during the sessions but not used (they have been bootlegged). They would be finished for Doc at the Radar Station and Ice Cream for Crow respectively.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAcquisition and {{performance}} of instrumental actions are assumed to require both action-outcome and stimulus-response (S-R) habit processes. Over the course of extended training, control over instrumental performance shifts from goal-directed action-outcome associations to S-R associations that progressively gain domination over behavior. Lesions of the lateral part of the dorsal striatum disrupt this process, and rats with lesions to the lateral striatum showed selective sensitivity to devaluation of the instrumental outcome (Yin et al., 2004), indicating that this area is necessary for habit formation. The present experiment further explored {{the basis of this}} dysfunction by examining the ability of rats subjected to bilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway to develop behavioral autonomy with overtraining. Rats were given extended training on two cued instrumental tasks associating a stimulus (a tone or a light) with an instrumental action (lever press or <b>chain</b> <b>pull)</b> and a food reward (pellets or sucrose). Both tasks were run daily in separate sessions. Overtraining was followed by a test of goal sensitivity by satiety-specific devaluation of the reward. In control animals, one action (lever press) was insensitive to reward devaluation, indicating that it became a habit, whereas the second action (<b>chain</b> <b>pull)</b> was still sensitive to goal devaluation. This result provides evidence that the development of habit learning may depend on the characteristics of the response. In dopamine-depleted rats, lever press and <b>chain</b> <b>pull</b> remained sensitive to reward devaluation, evidencing a role of striatal dopamine transmission in habit formation...|$|R
