5|$|After the {{take-over}} in 1905, KSS {{was operating}} seven routes: Homansbyen–Oslo, Homansbyen–Sannergata, Munkedamsveien–Sannergata–Grefsen, Munkedamsveien–Vålerenga, Sagene – St. Hanshaugen – Kampen, St. Hanshaugen – Rodeløkka and Stortorvet–Vippetangen. KSS extended the Vippetangen Line on 8 November 1905, and opened an extension from Homansbyen to Adamstuen on 24 September 1909. KSS and KES agreed to link their two networks, and a <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> opened on 1 May 1912 between Homansbyen and Rosenborg station on KES's Line 1. An {{extension of the}} Vestbanen Line to Skillebekk was finished on 2 November 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{built as a}} joint venture by the NLR and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) {{in order to have}} a station serving freight closer to the City. It was {{immediately}} successful for both goods and passenger services and saw a significant increase in NLR traffic. Usage peaked in the early 20th century, after which it suffered from competition of London trams, buses, and particularly the London Underground network. Patronage gradually fell and services decreased, while the station building became increasingly dilapidated. By the 1980s, all freight services had been cancelled, and the station closed in 1986. The station building was replaced by Broadgate, an office and retail space, while part of the <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> to the station was re-used as part of the London Overground.|$|E
5|$|The system {{initially}} {{had four}} standard gauge, single tracked lines, which had passing loops to allow trams to pass. Three originated at Stortorvet: the Gamlebyen Line, running east to Gamlebyen (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the Vestbanen Line, which ran west to Vestbanen station (Oslo West station); and the Ullevål Hageby Line, which ran west to Homansbyen, where the depot was located. In addition, {{there was a}} short <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> between the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The two lines that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other two lines had fixed fifteen-minute headway—decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks.|$|E

5|$|When Winkelman {{took over}} command, he {{intensified}} the negotiations, proposing on 21 February that Belgium would man a <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> with the Peel Raam Position along the Belgian {{part of the}} Zuid-Willemsvaart. The Belgians refused to do this unless the Dutch reinforced their presence in Limburg; the Dutch had no forces available with which to fulfill this request. Repeated Belgian requests to reconsider the Orange Position were refused by Winkelman. Therefore, the Belgians decided to withdraw, {{in the event of}} an invasion, all their troops to their main defence line, the Albert Canal. This created a dangerous gap forty kilometres wide. The French were invited to fill it. Now the French Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin was more than interested in including the Dutch in his continuous front as, like Major-General Bernard Montgomery four years later, he hoped to circle around the Westwall when the Entente launched its planned 1941 offensive. But he did not dare to stretch his supply lines that far unless the Belgians and Dutch would take the allied side before the German attack. When both nations refused, Gamelin made it clear that he would occupy a connecting position near Breda. The Dutch did not fortify this area. In secret, Winkelman decided on 30 March to abandon the Peel-Raam Position immediately at the onset of a German attack and withdraw his Third Army Corps to the Linge to cover the southern flank of the Grebbe Line, leaving only a covering force behind. This Waal-Linge Position was to be reinforced with pillboxes; the budget for such structures was increased with a hundred million guilders.|$|E

25|$|To join its two lines, the W Railway {{constructed}} in 1912 a double-tracked Bluemont Division <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> that traveled between two new junctions in Arlington: Bluemont Junction on the Alexandria-Bluemont line and Thrifton Junction on the Georgetown-Great Falls line. The <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> passed through Lacey (near {{the west end}} of Ballston), crossing on a through girder bridge over a competing interurban electric trolley line, the Fairfax line of the Washington-Virginia Railway (see Northern Virginia trolleys). The rival line carried passengers between Rosslyn, Clarendon, Ballston, Falls Church, Vienna and Fairfax City.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{a railway}} line once ran through Potsdamer Platz itself. This was a <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> opened in October 1851 and {{running around the}} city just inside the customs wall, {{crossing}} numerous streets and squares at street level, and whose purpose was to allow goods to be transported between the various Berlin stations, thus creating a hated traffic obstruction that lasted for twenty years. Half {{a dozen or more}} times a day, Potsdamer Platz ground to a halt while a train of 60 to 100 wagons trundled through at walking pace preceded by a railway official ringing a bell. The construction of the Ringbahn around the city's perimeter, linked to all the major stations, allowed the <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> to be scrapped in 1871, although the Ringbahn itself was not complete and open for all traffic until 15 November 1877.|$|E

25|$|A balloon loop was {{installed}} at Jernbanetorget on 10 November 1909. KES and KSS {{reached an agreement}} in 1912 to coordinate their services better. This first materialized in a <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Ullevål Hageby Line to Majorstuen.
