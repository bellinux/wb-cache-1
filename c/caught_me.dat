500|$|Twenty {{years of}} hard work, twenty years of fun and frolic and jolly companionship, twenty years of living in an {{atmosphere}} of tuneful nonsense, with the glare of the footlights in my eyes and the thunders of applause in my ears. [...] How terribly I should miss it all! [...] And domesticity, that all my life I had fled from, had <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> at last.|$|E

60|$|Such {{were the}} {{thoughts}} that passed {{through my mind}} as I walked back from the Vale of Bones {{by the side of}} the big-paunched Goza, whom I <b>caught</b> eyeing <b>me</b> from time to time as a curious crow eyes any object that has attracted his attention.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} he <b>caught</b> sight of <b>me,</b> and came up, pleased to find me, but vexed {{with me for}} having got lost.|$|R
500|$|... "You <b>Caught</b> <b>Me</b> Smilin'" [...] is a hymn {{to getting}} high, {{introduced}} by a [...] "slow, wispy soul {{that sounds like}} it's drifting in from a distant radio somewhere". Jurek wrote, [...] "Sister Rose's voice is all sweet, and at first so is Sly's, but as the horns and bassline come stepping in, Sly's voice gets heavy and is distorting in places deliberately. The delicate keyboard lines, luxuriant and in the pocket as they are, cannot keep the voice contained. There's a minimal instrumental break in the tune and it suddenly fades just as it emerged." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|Thin Lizzy flew to Canada in May 1977 as a trio {{to record}} Bad Reputation, with Gorham {{handling}} all the guitar parts. A month into the sessions Robertson joined them, {{in his own}} words, [...] "as a session player" [...] and in Lynott's words, [...] "as a guest". Robertson added lead guitar tracks to three songs as well as rhythm guitar and keyboards, and was officially reinstated in July. The album was released in September and sold well, reaching no. 4 in the UK, after a successful single, [...] "Dancing in the Moonlight (It's <b>Caught</b> <b>Me</b> in Its Spotlight)". Also in 1977, Thin Lizzy headlined the Reading Festival.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{to burst}} it open," [...] said I, and was {{running down the}} entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady <b>caught</b> at <b>me,</b> again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.|$|R

500|$|Following {{publication}} of Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson's nonfiction book Lone Survivor (2007), producer Barry Spikings met Luttrell's attorney, Alan Schwartz, who {{was interested in}} adapting the book to film. Schwartz suggested that Spikings's son-in-law, Akiva Goldsman, write the screenplay. Goldsman however did not believe he was the right screenwriter for the project; he suggested that Peter Berg write and direct the film. Spikings and Goldsman passed the book on to Berg's producing partner Sarah Aubrey. [...] Berg first learned of Lone Survivor while filming Hancock, and after Aubrey had read the book herself. After Berg had read the book, he and Aubrey arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss a film adaptation. Luttrell also viewed a rough cut of Berg's then-upcoming 2007 film The Kingdom, and was impressed by Berg's direction. [...] " [...] <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> with his attention to detail", he said, [...] "and how he portrayed the enemy in the film." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The timing <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> by surprise.

[...] "What happened to our understanding that my exit would be postponed for a few weeks?" [...] I asked. [...] "Oh, I guess we forgot," [...] he said with the faint trace of a smile. [...] And so it was over." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that last}} word, I popped {{up to look}} about the room, and the doctor <b>caught</b> hold of <b>me</b> with ludicrous haste. A pain shot through my body.|$|R

2500|$|Ullman's {{songs were}} {{over-the-top}} evocations of 1960s and 1970s pop {{music with a}} 1980s edge, [...] "somewhere between Minnie Mouse and the Supremes" [...] as the Melody Maker put it, or [...] "retro before retro was cool," [...] as a reviewer wrote in 2002. Her career received another boost when the video for [...] "They Don't Know" [...] featured a cameo from Paul McCartney; at the time Ullman was filming a minor role in McCartney's film Give My Regards to Broad Street. She released her second (and final) album, You <b>Caught</b> <b>Me</b> Out, in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Judson, {{instead of}} {{welcoming}} {{him to the}} faith, pressed him further asking if he believed what he had read in the gospel of Matthew that Jesus the son of God died on the cross. U Shwe Ngong {{shook his head and}} said, [...] "Ah, you have <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> now. I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross." [...] Not long after, he came back to tell Judson, [...] "I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…. I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced {{soul that}} had {{characterized}} the Family Stone's 1960s output, There's a Riot Goin' On was an urban blues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly {{and many other}} people were feeling in the early 1970s. The album {{is characterized by a}} significant amount of tape hiss – the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and overdubbing during production. Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack for others. [...] "(You <b>Caught</b> <b>Me)</b> Smilin'" [...] and [...] "Runnin' Away" [...] were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.|$|E
6000|$|That {{would be}} awkward, I admitted, taking it quite {{as a matter}} of course that he had so {{suddenly}} <b>caught</b> sight of <b>me.</b> [...] "But don't you always want to be happy, Bruno?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That man started it," [...] {{declared}} Jack, {{pointing to}} Davenport. [...] "He <b>caught</b> hold of <b>me,</b> and I {{told him to}} let me go. He {{had no right to}} put his hands on me." ...|$|R

2500|$|Following {{his victory}} over Molina, Khan {{returned}} to the UK, for a fight against 33 year old Julio Díaz (40-7-1, 29 KOs) on 27 April 2013 in a 143lbs 'catch-weight' bout. The fight {{took place at the}} Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Diaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win the fight by a fairly close unanimous decision. The scorecards; Phil Edwards 114–113 – Steve Gray 115–113 – Terry O'Connor 115–112. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, He <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> while I was off balance, and I couldn't get my stance back. I went down. I kept moving to recompose myself. That's what happens. There are little things to work on when we go back in the gym." [...] Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time he became deeply {{involved}} with the Irish Volunteers, a group arming for the fight for Irish independence, which he joined in 1913 spurred by Unionist resistance to Home Rule and their formation of the militant Ulster Volunteers. Kettle was sent by the Volunteers in 1914 on an arms-buying mission to Belgium where he witnessed at first hand the outbreak of World War I. He changed his assignment to being a war correspondent for the Daily News (London). Travelling through France and Belgium in August and September, he was horrified by the German atrocities against the local civilian population, warning against the dire threat to Europe of Prussian militarism. Kettle wrote that [...] "The outbreak of war <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> in Belgium, where I was running arms for the National Volunteers, and on the 6 of August 1914, I wrote from Brussels in the Daily News that it was a war of 'civilisation against barbarians'. I assisted for many weeks in the agony of the valiant Belgian nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E
60|$|At last her gentle ministrations ended, I {{sought to}} rise. A {{dizziness}} assailed me scarce was I on my feet, {{and it is}} odds I had fallen back, but that she <b>caught</b> and steadied <b>me.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Gordeeva and Grinkov won {{almost every}} {{competition}} they entered. In the 31 competitions whose results are {{known at the}} senior and professional levels, they finished first 24 times, and never lower than second {{from the time they}} won their first senior world title. They {{are one of the few}} pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition. [...] They landed the difficult element with ease at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the element at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov's boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating), they were disqualified from that event. They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, [...] making the added physical stress unnecessary. [...] Katia states in her book, [...] "My Sergei: A Love Story" [...] that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team's Doctors: [...] "That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist, in which Sergei threw me in the air, I did a split, then closed my legs and made four turns before he <b>caught</b> <b>me.</b> We were the only pair to do this quadruple element, and it was very exhausting—more exhausting than difficult, really. Soviet doctors had measured my pulse rate as exceeding two hundred beats per minute when I did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of <b>caught</b> <b>me</b> off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E
