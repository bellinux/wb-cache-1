25|$|According to legend, {{ancestors}} of today's Oromo {{people in a}} region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were {{believed to have been}} the first to recognize the energizing effect of the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant,</b> though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a <b>coffee</b> <b>plant,</b> did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian {{ancestors}} of today's Oromo ethnic group {{were the first}} to have recognized the energizing effect of the native <b>coffee</b> <b>plant.</b> Studies of genetic diversity have been performed on Coffea arabica varieties, which were found to be of low diversity but with retention of some residual heterozygosity from ancestral materials, and closely related diploid species Coffea canephora and C. liberica; however, no direct evidence has ever been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the natives might have used it as a stimulant or known about it there earlier than the seventeenth century. The original domesticated <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> {{is said to have been}} from Harar, and the native population is thought to be derived from Ethiopia with distinct nearby populations in Sudan and Kenya.|$|E

40|$|Mycorrhizae provide several {{benefits}} to <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> This study evaluated whether these benefits influence {{the damage caused}} by the Bidens pilosa competition with coffee seedlings. A randomized blocks design was used, with treatments established in a 2 x 3 factorial scheme (presence and absence of B. pilosa interference in non-inoculated control or plants inoculated with either Claroideoglomus etunicatum or Dentiscutata heterogama). Coffee seedlings were inoculated with fungi spores and developed for 120 days. Then, they were subjected to the interference of B. pilosa for more 120 days, when data were collected for growth traits, mycorrhizal colonization, dry matter and foliar nutrient concentrations in <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> Dry matter and nutrient contents in B. pilosa plants were also evaluated. Inoculation provided better growth and nutrition of <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> The competition with B. pilosa reduced mycorrhizal colonization, height, leaf area, leaf and stem dry mass, root dry weight, number of reproductive branches and levels of P and Fe in the <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> However, the harmful effect of the interference was lower in inoculated <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> The dry mass of B. pilosa decreased under the interference of inoculated <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> The inoculation of C. etunicatum and D. heterogama in Arabica coffee seedlings increases the competitiveness of the crop against B. pilosa interference...|$|R

25|$|In the 1900s, {{the company}} began to grow {{dramatically}} due primarily to a salesman named Frank P. Atha. Atha sold coffee in the California area, but proposed to James Folger II that he open and manage a Folgers <b>Coffee</b> <b>plant</b> in Texas. The company grew exponentially after Atha opened the Texas plant.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{is grown}} and {{processed}} {{in the mountain}} areas near the coast, especially in the municipalities of Santa María Huatulco, Pluma Hidalgo, Candelaria Loxicha, San Miguel del Puerto, San Mateo Piñas, Santiago Xanica, and San Pedro Pochutla. This tradition dates from the 17th century when the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> was introduced by English pirates, later developed in the 20th century by German immigrants.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{economically}} important varieties of <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> are the Arabica and the Robusta; 75–80% {{of the coffee}} produced worldwide is Arabica and 20% is Robusta. Arabica beans consist of 0.8–1.4% caffeine and Robusta beans consist of 1.7–4% caffeine. As coffee {{is one of the}} world's most widely consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop and an important export product, counting for over 50% of some developing nations' foreign exchange earnings.|$|E

25|$|The {{maturation}} of {{the insect}} (from egg to adult) lasts between 24 and 45 days, varying {{according to the}} weather. Usually, the female drills the berry through the central disc, although it can enter through the side walls if the fruit is dry. Two days after the access, the beetle lays 35–50 eggs, which produce 13 females for each male. The lifespan for females is 35–190 days and for males 40 days. The new insects mate inside the seed. Some females lay the eggs in the same <b>coffee</b> <b>plant,</b> others colonise new ones. The males never leave the fruit.|$|E
25|$|The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took a <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> to the French {{territory}} of Martinique in the Caribbean , from which {{much of the}} world's cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas. Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. The conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were {{a factor in the}} soon to follow Haitian Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there. It made a brief come-back in 1949 when Haiti was the world's 3rd largest coffee exporter, but fell quickly into rapid decline.|$|E
25|$|Over 900 {{species of}} insect have been {{recorded}} as pests of coffee crops worldwide. Of these, over a third are beetles, and over a quarter are bugs. Some 20 species of nematodes, 9 species of mites, and several snails and slugs also attack the crop. Birds and rodents sometimes eat coffee berries, but their impact is minor compared to invertebrates. In general, arabica is the more sensitive species to invertebrate predation overall. Each part of the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> is assailed by different animals. Nematodes attack the roots, coffee borer beetles burrow into stems and woody material, and the foliage is attacked by over 100 species of larvae (caterpillars) of butterflies and moths.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of shade on growth and production of <b>coffee</b> <b>plants.</b> To achieve this, growth and productivity of <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> growing under shade trees were {{compared with those of}} <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> growing under direct sun light. Different physiological, environmental and quality parameters were assessed for both treatments. Shade trees protected <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> against adverse environmental stresses such as high soil temperatures and low relative humidity. Shade, however, also triggered differences in physiological behaviour of the <b>coffee</b> <b>plants,</b> such as improved photosynthesis and increased leaf area index, resulting in better performance than possible in direct sun light. Consequently, <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> grown under shade trees produced larger and heavier fruits with better bean quality than those grown in direct sun light. Moreover, shaded plants had greater biochemical and physiological potential for high dry matter production which would help them to maintain high coffee yields in the long term. If growing coffee under shade trees would allow other sources of income such as fruits, fuel wood and timber to be produced, it could be socially more acceptable, economically more viable and environmentally more sustainable. Since in Ethiopia people are moving towards replacing coffee by ‘chat’ and/or growing coffee in an open sun, we support the recommendations of growing coffee in the shade and suggest that the future research should be directed toward deterring the development of fungal diseases and increase of coffee yields under shaded conditions...|$|R
40|$|Partitioning {{of gross}} {{rainfall}} into throughfall, stemflow and rainfall interception was assessed in Costa Rica during two rainy seasons (mean annual rainfall of 2900 mm) in two coffee systems: (1) a monoculture (MC) and (2) an agroforestry system (AFS) including Inga densiflora as the associated shade tree species. Coffee architecture, not LAI, {{appeared to be}} the main driver of stemflow as stemflow was higher for shaded <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> (10. 6 % of incident rainfall) than for <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> in MC (7. 2 %), despite the fact that these shaded plants had lower LAI. The presence of Inga trees modified coffee architecture with shaded <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> presenting larger stems and branches resulting in higher coffee funneling ratio under shade. In AFS, <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> and trees accounted respectively for 88 % and 12 % of total stemflow which represented 11. 8 % of incident rainfall. AFS displayed larger cumulative stemflow and smaller total throughfall compared to MC. Cumulative throughfall expressed in % of the gross rainfall, differed between systems and monitoring periods and the trend showed a decrease with increasing LAI. Nevertheless, as stemflow measurement and interception loss estimation were done only during the second year of the study, the shade tree showed a low influence in increasing interception loss, as the combined LAI of <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> and shade trees was rather similar in AFS as that of coffee in MC. Furthermore, <b>coffee</b> <b>plants</b> accounted for the largest fraction of the interception loss in AFS as the coffee LAI was more than 3 -fold that of shade trees. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
25|$|Crops such like coffee, tea, cacao, {{tobacco and}} rubber were all {{introduced}} by the Dutch. The Dutch {{were the first to}} start the spread of the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> in Central and South America, and by the early 19th century Java was the third largest producer in the world. In 1778 the Dutch brought cacao from the Philippines to Indonesia and commenced mass production. Currently Indonesia is the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, a crop that was {{introduced by the}} Dutch in the early 20th century. Tobacco was introduced from the Americas and in 1863 the first plantation was established by the Dutch. Today Indonesia is not only the oldest industrial producer of tobacco, but also the second largest consumer of tobacco.|$|E
25|$|These {{conditions}} are particularly {{characteristic of the}} northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the white ant), the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo Plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant</b> is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.|$|E

2500|$|Alternatively, {{the word}} Khat, a plant widely used as {{stimulant}} in Yemen and Ethiopia before being supplanted by coffee {{has been suggested}} as a possible origin, or the Arabic word quwwah (meaning [...] "strength").

2500|$|The world's {{primary source}} of {{caffeine}} is the coffee [...] "bean" [...] (the seed of the <b>coffee</b> <b>plant),</b> from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely {{depending on the type}} of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety.|$|E
50|$|The {{prospect}} for Decaffito-type coffees was {{shown by the}} discovery of the naturally caffeine-free Coffea charrieriana, reported in 2004.

2500|$|Other {{accounts}} {{attribute the}} discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According to an ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who {{was known for his}} ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern day Wusab, about 90km east of Zabid). Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery, but found them to be bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days.
