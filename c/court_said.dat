5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch <b>court</b> <b>said</b> that his speech was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Court {{reviewed}} another restriction, {{this time}} concerning funding restrictions imposed {{by a public}} university. In the 1997 case Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, a government supported university sought to withhold funds from religious student publications despite funding similar secular publications. While the <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> the government could seek to shape funding to support a government message, such restrictive steps could not be imposed {{to the exclusion of}} a particular viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 the Chief Rabbinate {{found that}} in Israel {{men and women were}} refused divorce in equal numbers, 180 women and 185 men over a two-year period. The Director-General of the Rabbinical <b>Courts</b> <b>said</b> this showed that [...] "the claims by women's {{organizations}} of thousands of women whose husbands refuse to give them divorces have no basis in reality".|$|R

5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals <b>court</b> <b>said</b> {{that although the}} impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} European {{countries}} reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), a {{judgment of the}} European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners {{were not allowed to}} vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that Swamy had {{the locus}} standi to seek {{sanction}} from the Prime Minister {{for the prosecution}} of A Raja in the 2G scam. Sanction by a competent authority for the prosecution of a public servant has to be granted within a time frame, the apex <b>court</b> <b>said.</b> Justice AK Ganguly said that the sanction would be deemed to be granted if competent authority failed to take a decision within four months.|$|E

25|$|The Montana Supreme Court {{has twice}} had {{occasion}} to rule on administrative issues facing District Courts. In , the issue was the substitution and disqualification of District Court judges. If a District Court has not published rules regarding substitution and disqualification, the high <b>court</b> <b>said,</b> then Montana Supreme Court rules regarding the same hold sway. In , the issue was whether a District Court could continue to operate even though its budget {{for the fiscal year}} had ended. Here, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that District Courts had the authority to order the state to pay reasonable and necessary expenses.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> {{it would}} assume for {{purposes}} of deciding the case that regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI may validly prohibit actions that have a disparate impact on certain races, colors, or national origins.|$|E
