40|$|RANSMISSION of {{information}} from one cell to another being the rule in Metazoa, the electrical activity associated with that function, postsynaptic potentials (p. s. p. ‘s), must occur at least as frequently as do spikes of the <b>conductile</b> electrogenesis. Indeed, cases are known in which transmitted effects, including p. s. p. ‘s, develop in cells which do not produce spikes (7, 80 - 8 ~). Therefore p. s. p. ‘s probably occur more commonly than do spikes. The <b>conductile</b> property to which the spike is especially suited, {{and the need to}} communicate information via long fibers, may be secondary developments, arising from the extension of animals and centralization of their nervous control mechanisms (19). It appears to be a general assumption, even among proponents of chemical transmission, that the postsynaptic membrane which develops transmissional electrogenesis has most of the same properties as does the <b>conductile,</b> spike-generating membrane. In the latter, small depolarization from applied electrical stimuli, or from the local circuit, or that produced by other means (e. g., increased external K+) evokes a spike. It has been taken for granted that p. s. p. ‘s may also arise by electrica...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{generator}} {{potential of}} both slowly and rapidly adapting crayfish stretch receptor cells {{can still be}} elicited by mechanical stimuli when all the Na of the bathing medium is replaced by various organic cations. In the presence of tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris), the generator potential is particularly large, about 30 - 50 % {{of that in the}} control saline, while spike electrogenesis of the cell is abolished. Persistence of the generator response is not due to retention of Na by a diffusion barrier, and ionic contributions to the electrogenesis by Ca and C can also be excluded. Thus, whereas the electrogenesis of the generator membrane must be due to an increased permeability to monovalent cations, the active receptor membrane appears to be less selective for different monovalent cations than is the receptor component of some other cells, or the <b>conductile</b> component of the stretch receptor neuron...|$|E
40|$|The cardiotoxidty of streptolysin O {{was first}} {{demonstrated}} by Bemheimer and Cantoni (1) who induced systolic contracture in the frog heart perfused with the toxin. Subsequently, Kellner et al. (2) showed that permanent and irreversible standstill, {{accompanied by a}} profound but transitory reduction in coronary flow, resulted from the exposure of the isolated hearts of guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats to small amounts of the toxin. Halpem and Rahman (3) found that the electrocardiograms of mice given large lethal doses of toxin exhibited immediate and intense bradycardia followed, in some cases, by temporary arrest; progressive atrioventricular dissociation implicated the <b>conductile</b> tissue. Electrocardiograms, obtained by Halbert, Bircher, and Dahle (4) from rabbits given lethal and sublethal doses of highly purified streptolysin O, were characterized by conduction defects and ventricular automatism. Intravenous injection of several multiples of the Ires 0 was followed within 3 - 4 sec by a rapid transition from normal sinus rhythm to ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and standstill. Frequently, smaller lethal doses and sublethal dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of the cardiac impulse to the {{various parts of the}} ventricles involves both the regular myocardial fibers and the specialized or so-called Purkinje network. When the ventricles are driven electrically and conduction times are measured to several epicardial electrodes, it is possible to estimate the conduction velocities in these two <b>conductile</b> tissues. Thus Lewis and Rothschild (1915) demonstrated that conduction between electrodes close to the site of stimulation is relatively slow. They assumed that an impulse arising at the epicardium would have to travel a certain distance through the slowly conducting myocardial fibers before it could reach and utilize the more rapidly conducting Purkinje fibers. Therefore transmission for short. distances along the epicardial surface of the heart would involve only the slow system, and conduction times to near-by electrodes would reflect this slow con-duction velocity. They estimated that the regular myocardial fibers in the dog ventricle conduct at a rate of 300 to 500 mm. /sec. When these investigators drove the ventricle at a greater distance from the re...|$|E
40|$|Neural crest cells {{originate}} from the dorsal most {{region of the}} embryonic neural tube. These cells migrate into several embryonic locations and differentiate {{into a variety of}} cell types. Cardiac neural crest (CNC) cells are a set of neural crest progenitors that aid in the proper formation of the cardiac septum, which separates the pulmonary from the systemic circulation. We have used Splotch mice to investigate whether the murine CNC cells play a role during the development oft he myocardium and the conduction system. Splotch mice carry a mutation in the P AX 3 transcription factor, and display a problem in CNC cell migration. A scanning-electron-microscopy analysis of Splotch mutant-embryonic-hearts reveals abnormalities in the interventricular septum. In addition, the right and left ventricular cavities appear dilated relative to a wild type heart. Hoechst nuclei staining of Splotch heart cryosections demonstrates a decreased number of cardiomyocytes and a corresponding thinner ventricular wall. The absence of Connexin 40 in the ventricles of Splotch mutants, suggests conduction system defects. These results support the evidence that CNC cell signaling plays a role in modulating the growth and development of murine cardiomyocytes and their differentiation into <b>conductile</b> cells...|$|E
40|$|Axon spikes in {{crayfish}} and lobster neuromuscular preparations {{were blocked}} by tetrodotoxin or saxitoxin (concentration 10 − 9 to 10 − 8 g/ml). Responses evoked in the excitatory synaptic membrane by ionophoretically applied glutamate, {{or in the}} inhibitory by GABA were unaffected by concentrations of the poisons up to 10 − 5 g/ml. These confirm other findings that the poisons do not affect electrically inexcitable membrane components. “Miniature” p. s. p. ’s, which indicate local secretory activity in the presynaptic terminals were unaffected by the poisons. Electrical stimuli applied to the axon terminals elicited localized p. s. p. ’s after spike electrogenesis of the axons was blocked. Thus, persistence of secretory activity {{may be linked to}} persistence of depolarizing K activation in the axons. Spikes induced in the muscle fibers by procaine were not affected by the poisons. In correlation with other data this finding indicates that the depolarizing electrogenic element, which does not depend upon Na activation in the normally gradedly responsive muscles, differs chemically from the Na activation component which is present in the <b>conductile</b> membrane of various cells. Three other varieties of electrically excitable response which are present in crayfish muscle fibers (hyperpolarizing Cl activation, depolarizing K inactivation, and K activation) were, likewise, immune to the toxin...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{changes in}} the nervous system occur with ageing. Both a decline of {{function}} {{and a decrease in}} the number of C-fibres in the skin have been reported for healthy aged subjects. With the use of microneurographic recordings from single C-fibres in humans we have compared the sensory and axonal properties of these neurones in young and aged healthy subjects. A total of 146 C-fibres were recorded from the common peroneal nerve in young subjects (mean age 24. 7 years) and 230 C-fibres were recorded in aged subjects (mean age 56. 2 years). In aged subjects, changes were found in the composition of the C-fibre population and in sensory and axonal properties. The relative incidence of afferent to efferent C-fibres was relatively constant independent of the age of subjects. The ratio of mechano-responsive to mechano-insensitive nociceptors was approximately 8 : 2 in the young controls while in aged subjects it was 7 : 3. In aged subjects 13 % of the fibres showed atypical discharge characteristics, while this was not observed in young subjects. Spontaneous activity, sensitization and loss of sensory function were found regularly. Changes in functions of the <b>conductile</b> membrane were also observed in fibres from aged subjects. The degree of activity-dependent conduction velocity slowing in response to high frequency stimulation (2 Hz) was more pronounced, while the normalization of conduction velocity subsequent to high frequency stimulation was protracted. We found that both sensitization and desensitization or degeneration of afferent C-fibres occur with age, but are still rare compared to patients with neuropathy. The {{changes in the}} axonal properties of C-fibres in aged subjects are compatible with hypoexcitability of the fibres. These findings are important for the understanding and differential diagnoses regarding pathological processes and normal ageing...|$|E
