The unpredictable <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> can be described by a very persistent permanent shock and a transitory shock. Our estimates are built from a panel of cohorts, so we use US data from the PSID to provide a magnitude for the underestimation of the estimated variances. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the permanent shock is almost 4 times smaller in Chile than in the US, a result, perhaps, of the relative rigidity of the Chilean labor market. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the profitability of}} earnings-to-price (EP) trading rules based on two alternative measures of earnings: 1. net income before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, and 2. operating income {{that focuses on the}} operating activity of a firm. Specifically, this investigation is motivated by the fact that while prior study finds that operating income is more persistent than non-operating income, there is little evidence on the differential return predictability <b>of</b> the two <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> To the extent that stock price reflects the market 2 ̆ 7 s expectation about future earnings, the return predictability <b>of</b> the two <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> should differ when they have different persistence. The study finds that while the profitability of the conventional EP trading rule is significant, it increases substantially when the earnings are defined to be operating income rather than net income before extraordinary items and discontinued operations. Further, the conventional risk factors, including market return and firm size, do not fully explain the profitability of EP trading rule based on operating income. These results highlight the importance of core operation-related information to investment decision-making...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Identification {{of methods}} for {{presenting}} the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income</b> {{in the statement}} of changes in equity in the reporting practices of public companies in Poland and Germany. Methodology: A study of domestic and foreign literature was conducted with analysis of annual reports of public companies. The study followed the method of induction and to analyse the results, the structure similarity index was used. Results: The {{results of the study}} supported conclusions that the companies under study had not  developed a uniform presentation <b>of</b> the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> in their statements of changes in equity. Five options <b>of</b> presenting the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income</b> in the statement of changes in equity were identified. Companies both from the WIG 30 and DAX  indices most frequently presented the statement of changes in equity in option 1, which consisted of presenting the total comprehensive income item in a row and detailed items of equity in columns in which capital gains and losses were recognized. The differentiated forms <b>of</b> presenting the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> made it difficult to compare financial statements. Scope of research: The survey examined the annual reports of the largest Polish and German public companies respectively from the WIG 30 and DAX indices. The <b>components</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income</b> presented in the statements of changes in equity were the main subject of the study. Originality: Comparative studies on the presentation <b>of</b> the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income</b> in the statement of changes in equity by public companies in Poland and Germany have not yet been conducted. This was therefore the research gap addressed in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the materiality and volatility <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> for non financial firms in a non US environment. As the FASB and IASB are planning to require the reporting <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> in a single performance statement, it is important to resolve the issues surrounding the materiality and the volatility <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income.</b> This study investigates the materiality <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> and its components in relation to total comprehensive income and closing equity for 37 non financial companies listed on the NZX from 2003 to 2008. Moreover, the cumulative impact <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> on equity over time is investigated. Further the volatility <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> is compared to the volatility <b>of</b> net <b>income.</b> This study also investigates the impact of the change to NZ IFRS on comprehensive income The results show that other comprehensive income is material in relation to total comprehensive income, but not in relation to closing equity. Moreover, some <b>components</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> have a cumulative effect over time on closing equity. Comprehensive income is more volatile than net income. However, these findings are due to asset revaluations, which is the most dominant <b>component</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income.</b> Though, all <b>components</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> are significant for some firm year observations. Further, the move to NZ IFRS affects the materiality <b>of</b> some <b>components</b> <b>of</b> other comprehensive <b>income</b> and reduces the volatility <b>of</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> compared to net income. This study provides evidence that other comprehensive income is material for non financial firms in a non US environment. This suggests that it should be displayed clearly in the financial statement in order to be taken into consideration by financial statement users. Further, this study provides evidence that the difference in volatility between comprehensive income and net income in New Zealand can be avoided by choosing the cost method when measuring assets after recognition...|$|R
