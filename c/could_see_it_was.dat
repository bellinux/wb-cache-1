5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had no time for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E

I {{decided to try}} to panic Cambridge by close contact steering, {{breaking}} their rhythm and attacking when the stations levelled out beyond Chiswick Steps." [...] Opinion was divided on Calvert's tactics: The Observers Legget claimed that Calvert [...] "adopted quite the wrong tactics", while Jim Railton of The Times suggested [...] "Calvert's move may well prove to be the future tactics of other crews behind but in contact at Hammersmith Bridge on the Middlesex station in similar conditions." [...] He went on to say [...] "Calvert's tactics nearly paid off and in the circumstances I consider he was justified in his actions." [...] John Rodda of The Guardian described Calvert's steering as [...] "zig-zag" [...] and while acknowledging the [...] "bold imagination" [...] involved, claimed the cox's manoeuvres were [...] "futile".|$|E

When the Miami New Times asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, [...] "I love David. There {{was a lot of}} pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure.

2500|$|Ängelholm tower {{contacted}} {{the flight crew}} at 20:57 and issued the latest weather report, which was for a slight clearing. At 21:08 the pilots confirmed that they were {{at an altitude of}} 600meters (2,000ft) and that they were aiming for LJ. The tower informed the pilots that they had lit a strobeacon, which was (incorrectly) said to be located on the runway center line, [...] from the threshold (it was actually 110m off center, to the right). At 21:13:10 the tower commenced directing the flight of the aircraft, asking it to fly to the left, as the air traffic controller <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> off course. The last transmission from the aircraft was made at 21:13:47.|$|E
2500|$|Tomlin and Bette Midler {{played two}} pairs of {{identical}} twins who were switched at birth in the 1988 comedy, Big Business. Tomlin also played chain-smoking waitress Doreen Piggott in Altman's 1993 ensemble film Short Cuts, based on stories by Raymond Carver. Tomlin performed in two films by director David O. Russell; she appeared as a peacenik Raku artist in Flirting with Disaster and later, as an existential detective in I ♥ Huckabees. In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto YouTube portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names.

2500|$|Napoleon was livid at Oudinot's poor showing and demoted {{him to the}} {{leadership}} of the XII Corps. The new army commander Marshal Ney was ordered to march east from Wittenberg to Baruth south of Berlin. Ney assumed command on 3 September and put his 58,000-man army in motion on the 5th. That day there was a sharp fight at Zahna in which Oudinot's corps drove Tauentzien's troops out of the town. As at Grossbeeren, the III Cavalry Corps was distributed among the different units of the army. Fournier accompanied XII Corps and Lorge marched with IV Corps. The Battle of Dennewitz began at 11:00 AM on 6 September when a IV Corps infantry division, supported by Lorge and a second infantry division, attacked Tauentzien north of Dennewitz. At first the French were successful but the arrival of Bülow's corps from the west forced back Lorge and the IV Corps. The VII Corps came on the field at 1:00 PM and became involved in a see-saw combat at the village of Golsdorf on the left flank. The XII Corps belatedly arrived on the left flank starting at 3:00 PM. Just as the French began gaining ground on the left, Ney ordered the XII Corps to the right to support the badly shaken IV Corps. Though he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake, Oudinot obeyed the letter of his orders and marched off. Bülow, now supported by Swedish and Russian reinforcements, renewed his attack and broke through. The VII Corps might have been totally destroyed but for a [...] "timely charge" [...] by Defrance's cuirassiers. Even so, the battle was a disaster for the Imperial French forces whose flight also carried away the barely-engaged XII Corps. Ney lost 22,000 casualties, mostly prisoners, and 53 guns. Allied casualties at Zahna, Dennewitz, and the pursuit amounted to 10,500, almost all of them Prussian.|$|E

5000|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "Homer at the Bat", Mr. Burns fires Don Mattingly {{for refusing}} to shave sideburns only Burns <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> often assumed {{that this was a}} parody of an {{argument}} Steinbrenner and Mattingly had in real life with regards to Mattingly's hair length. However, the episode was actually recorded a year before the suspension occurred, and {{was nothing more than a}} coincidence. As Mattingly walks off the baseball field, he states, [...] "I still like him Burns better than Steinbrenner." ...|$|R
