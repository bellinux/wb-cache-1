5|$|Distinctive nativity {{scenes and}} traditions {{have been created}} around the world, and are {{displayed}} during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy, and in the United States their inclusion on public lands or in public buildings has provoked court challenges.|$|E

5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, but {{is still}} home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, as they have done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance of Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{long history}} with the Moravian church has had a lasting {{cultural}} effect. The Moravian star is used as the city's official Christmas street decoration. In addition, a 31-foot Moravian star, {{one of the largest}} in the world, sits atop the North Tower of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center during the Advent and <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons.</b> Another star sits under Wake Forest University's Wait Chapel during the Advent and <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> as well.

5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1952, {{aspiring}} photographer Therese Belivet {{is working}} in Frankenberg's department store in Manhattan. She meets a glamorous woman, Carol Aird, who is searching for a doll for her daughter Rindy. At Therese's recommendation, Carol purchases a model train set.

5|$|In 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 17 years old, whom {{his brother}} Joseph had invited for the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell; her mother's family {{was from the}} South and {{included}} successful Scots-Irish planters. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.|$|E
5000|$|Martin-Harvey {{had been}} {{an old friend of}} Raymond Bantock’s, dating from Oxford in the 1920s.  This new work was {{performed}} during several <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> in Johannesburg in the late 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2004 PepsiCo marketed {{a product}} {{somewhat}} similar in taste to julmust in the United States called Pepsi Holiday Spice. It was on sale during the 2004 and 2006 <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which the custom {{was performed}} varied between villages, and {{in a number of}} cases the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 <b>Christmas</b> <b>season,</b> which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
50|$|For {{a limited}} time during the 2006 <b>Christmas</b> {{shopping}} <b>season,</b> the Macy's location in Queens Center was open 24 hours a day, becoming the first to do so. Since then, it has had all-day operating hours during every <b>Christmas</b> shopping <b>season.</b>|$|R

50|$|While {{every day}} is the Open House and the {{performers}} have free rein to alter the script to fit the evening, the club does do some specialty shows for the Halloween and <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> in place {{of one or more}} of the Library events.|$|R
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored {{the work for}} two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload of musicians who had a busy time during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b> In the later version, Bach added a trio of two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Celebrating the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> {{had been}} growing in {{popularity}} through the Victorian era. Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two short}} stories, Sharpe's Christmas and Sharpe's Ransom, {{contained}} within this book were originally written for British newspaper the Daily Mail which serialised them during <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> of 1994 and 1995 respectively.

5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season,</b> they feel as if something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour, the Music Box Tour. Due to stage fright, Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support Music Box. However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel physically or emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, {{in order to give}} her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special Here Is Mariah Carey for release during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E
50|$|Moravian stars {{continue}} to be a popular Advent, Christmas, and Epiphany decoration throughout the world, even in areas without a significant Moravian Church presence. The stars are often seen in Moravian nativity and putz displays as a representation of the Star of Bethlehem. Large advent stars shine in the dome of the Frauenkirche in Dresden and over the altar of the Thomaskirche where Johann Sebastian Bach is buried in Leipzig. The city of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, founded by Moravians in 1766, uses the Moravian star as their official Christmas street decoration. In addition, a 31-foot Moravian star, {{one of the largest in}} the world, sits atop the North Tower of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center during the Advent and <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons.</b> Another star sits under Wake Forest University's Wait Chapel during the Advent and <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|During {{her later}} career, Webb has spent many <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> in {{pantomime}} in venues throughout the UK, such as 2006 where {{she played the}} Fairy Godmother in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Theatre Royal, Windsor. She performed in the 1987 London Palladium pantomime, Babes in the Wood, alongside Cannon and Ball, John Inman and Barbara Windsor.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Stuever {{released}} his second book, Tinsel: A Search for America's Christmas Present. It {{centers on the}} lives of three different families in Frisco, Texas, during three consecutive <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> and the impact the holiday has on modern culture and the consumer economy. The New Yorker called Stuever's book [...] "cultural anthropology at its most exuberant".|$|R
