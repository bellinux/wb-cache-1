500|$|The primary {{place in}} which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) {{is in the form}} of check {{constraint}}s. A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause. While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown. [...] The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into <b>column</b> <b>i,</b> but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls.|$|E

2500|$|This {{proof is}} {{analogous}} to Cantor's diagonal argument. One may visualize a two-dimensional array with one column and one row for each natural number, as indicated in the table above. The value of f(i,j) is placed at <b>column</b> <b>i,</b> row j. Because f {{is assumed to be}} a total computable function, any element of the array can be calculated using f. The construction of the function g can be visualized using the main diagonal of this array. [...] If the array has a 0 at position (i,i), then g(i) is 0. Otherwise, g(i) is undefined. The contradiction {{comes from the fact that}} there is some column e of the array corresponding to g itself. Now assume f was the halting function h, if g(e) is defined (g(e) = 0 in this case), g(e) halts so f(e,e) = 1. [...] But g(e) = 0 only when f(e,e) = 0, contradicting f(e,e) = 1. Similarly, if g(e) is not defined, then halting function f(e,e) = 0, which leads to g(e) = 0 under gs construction. This contradicts the assumption of g(e) not being defined. In both cases contradiction arises. Therefore any arbitrary computable function f cannot be the halting function h.|$|E

They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my <b>column.</b> <b>I</b> was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong.

Unfortunately, the quality of the estimates derived from a sample is negatively affected by the presence of “outliers ” in the data.

Our approach extends the well-known outlier indexing scheme to multiple aggregation <b>columns.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R
