5000|$|A <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> action, {{sometimes}} called a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> suspense, in its more limited meaning, denotes {{the right to}} enforce payment of a debt by legal proceedings, obtain money by way of damages for contract, or receive recompense for a wrong.

Choses in action were, before the Judicature Acts, either legal or equitable. Where the chose could be recovered only by an action at law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or tort), it was termed a legal <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a legacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> action.

5000|$|Chose (pronounced: , French for [...] "thing") is a {{term used}} in common law {{tradition}} in different senses. A chose local is a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill.
