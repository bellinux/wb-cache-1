5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the <b>car</b> <b>might</b> attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

25|$|Shake-the-box kits are simple, easy-to-assemble kits; {{a freight}} <b>car</b> <b>might</b> include a {{one-piece}} body, a chassis, trucks, couplers, and a weight, while a structure kit might include walls, windows, doors, and glazing. The name {{derives from the}} joke that no skill was required – you shake the box, and the kit falls together. A common synonym is screwdriver kit as many kits can be assembled with a screwdriver and tweezers.|$|E

25|$|John M. Studebaker {{had always}} viewed the {{automobile}} as complementary to the horse-drawn wagon, {{pointing out that}} the expense of maintaining a <b>car</b> <b>might</b> be beyond the resources of a small farmer. In 1918, when Erskine's history of the firm was published, the annual capacity of the seven Studebaker plants was 100,000 automobiles, 75,000 horse-drawn vehicles, and about $10,000,000 worth of automobile and vehicle spare parts and harness. In the preceding seven years, 466,962 horse-drawn vehicles had been sold, as against 277,035 automobiles, but the trend was all too clear. The regular manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered removal of the last wagon gear in 1919. To its range of cars, Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse-drawn wagons. Buses, fire engines, and even small rail locomotive-kits were produced using the same powerful six-cylinder engines.|$|E

2500|$|Modifications {{a police}} <b>car</b> <b>might</b> undergo include {{adjustments}} for higher durability, speed, high-mileage driving, and {{long periods of}} idling at a higher temperature. [...] This is usually accomplished by heavy duty suspension, brakes, calibrated speedometer, tires, alternator, transmission, and cooling systems, and also sometimes includes slight modifications to the car's stock engine or the installation of a more powerful engine than would be standard in that model. [...] It is also usual to upgrade {{the capacity of the}} electrical system of the car to accommodate the use of additional electronic equipment.|$|E

At 12:30a.m., Look left the dance, crossed over to Chappaquiddick in the yacht club's launch boat, got into his parked car and drove toward his home, which was south of the Dike Bridge. He testified that between 12:30 and 12:45a.m., he saw a dark car {{approaching}} the intersection of Dike Road. The car was driven by {{a man with a}} female passenger in the front seat. The car first drove onto the private Cemetery Road and stopped there. Thinking that the occupants of the <b>car</b> <b>might</b> be lost, Look got out of his car and walked towards the other vehicle. When he was [...] away, the car started backing towards him. When Look called out to offer his help, the car moved quickly eastward, towards the ocean, along Dike Road leaving a cloud of dust. Look recalled that the car's license plate began with an [...] "L" [...] and contained two [...] "7"'s, both details true of Kennedy's 1967 four-door Oldsmobile Delmont 88; the license plate on Kennedy's vehicle was [...] "L78-207".|$|E

When he was questioned, Buda said that Coacci owned a [...]32 Savage {{automatic}} pistol, which he kept in the kitchen. A search of the kitchen did not locate the gun, but Stewart found a manufacturer's technical diagram for a Model 1907 [...]32 Savage automatic pistol – the exact pistol type and caliber used to shoot Parmenter and Berardelli – in a kitchen drawer. Stewart asked Buda if he owned a gun, and the man produced a [...]32-caliber Spanish-made automatic pistol. Buda told police that he owned a 1914 Overland automobile, which was being repaired. The car was delivered for repairs {{four days after the}} Braintree crimes, but it was old and apparently had not been run for five months. Tire tracks were seen near the abandoned Buick getaway car, and Chief Stewart surmised that two cars had been used in the getaway, and that Buda's <b>car</b> <b>might</b> have been the second car. The garage proprietor who was repairing Buda's vehicle was instructed to call the police if anyone came to pick up the car.|$|E

He had promised her that he would write to her, and from the moment that he was gone she was anxious to send in to the post-office at Ennistimon for the treasure which the mail <b>car</b> <b>might</b> bring to her. When she did get it, it was indeed a treasure. To a girl who really loves, the first love letter is a thing as holy as the recollection of the first kiss. [...] "May I see it, Kate?"
