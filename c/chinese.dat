5|$|According to {{the census}} data, almost 80 percent of <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians are Buddhist or Christian (Catholic and Protestant). <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians {{tend to be}} more Christian than other <b>Chinese</b> ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of {{historical}} reasons. Throughout the 20th century <b>Chinese</b> religion and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many <b>Chinese</b> to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic <b>Chinese</b> Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as a recognized religion in the 1970s. Suharto endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism. Jakarta is home to largest <b>Chinese</b> Christians, meanwhile Medan is home to the largest Buddhist <b>Chinese</b> in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Although most <b>Chinese</b> {{workers in}} 1880 were {{employed}} in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the <b>Chinese</b> in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to <b>Chinese</b> laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, Wyoming, there was a <b>Chinese</b> doctor. <b>Chinese</b> servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's Delight, and Red Canyon, Wyoming, <b>Chinese</b> gold miners were employed. However, {{the majority of the}} 193 <b>Chinese</b> residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1850s, the {{immigration}} of <b>Chinese</b> into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked {{with the onset of}} the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The <b>Chinese</b> Immigration Act of 1885 eventually placed a head tax on all <b>Chinese</b> immigrants, in hopes of discouraging <b>Chinese</b> immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chinese</b> Indonesians (Indonesian: Orang Tionghoa-Indonesia), are Indonesians {{descended from}} various <b>Chinese</b> ethnic groups, {{primarily}} the Han <b>Chinese.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Chinese</b> {{who married}} local Javanese women and {{converted}} to Islam created a distinct <b>Chinese</b> Muslim Peranakan community in Java. <b>Chinese</b> rarely had {{to convert to}} Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount of}} their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the <b>Chinese</b> Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of <b>Chinese</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in <b>Chinese</b> history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with <b>Chinese</b> society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with <b>Chinese</b> archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout <b>Chinese</b> history. For much of the 20th century, only one <b>Chinese</b> traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional <b>Chinese</b> style.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, having {{auctioned}} off her movie costumes and donated {{the money to}} <b>Chinese</b> aid, the <b>Chinese</b> Benevolent Association of California honored Wong for her work in support of <b>Chinese</b> refugees. The proceeds from the preface that she wrote in 1942 to a cookbook titled New <b>Chinese</b> Recipes, {{one of the first}} <b>Chinese</b> cookbooks, were also dedicated to United China Relief. Between 1939 and 1942, she made few films, instead engaging in events and appearances in support of the <b>Chinese</b> struggle against Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the station}} began {{organizing}} {{a series of}} annual competitions open to ethnic <b>Chinese</b> participants in fields of classical <b>Chinese</b> dance, martial arts, traditional clothing design, painting, music, photography, and <b>Chinese</b> cooking.|$|E
5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} <b>Chinese</b> population, spurred by {{government}} repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} deadly force. On 7October, hundreds of ethnic <b>Chinese,</b> many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the <b>Chinese</b> populace and to place the <b>Chinese</b> under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of <b>Chinese</b> atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn <b>Chinese</b> houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at <b>Chinese</b> homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more <b>Chinese.</b> Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill <b>Chinese</b> until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted <b>Chinese</b> strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian first adopted loanwords from Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often through Uighur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and <b>Chinese.</b> However, {{more recent}} loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin <b>Chinese</b> (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language {{commissions}} of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, {{so as the}} Mongolian vocabulary now has jerönhijlögč 'president' ("generalizer") and šar ajrag 'beer' ("yellow kumys"). There are several loan translations, e.g., galt tereg 'train' ('fire-having cart') from <b>Chinese</b> huǒchē (火车, fire cart) 'train'. Other loan translations include mön chanar (essence) from <b>Chinese</b> shízhì (实质, true quality), khün am (population) from <b>Chinese</b> rénkǒu (人口, person mouth), erdene shish (corn, maize) from <b>Chinese</b> yùmǐ (玉米, jade rice) and bügd nairamdakh uls (republic) from <b>Chinese</b> gónghéguò (共和国, public collaboration nation).|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 <b>Chinese</b> troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the <b>Chinese</b> to capture Seoul. The <b>Chinese</b> eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the <b>Chinese</b> assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground and keep the retreating <b>Chinese</b> forces {{from being able to}} rest.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, however, <b>Chinese</b> infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} undermanned 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the <b>Chinese</b> were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the <b>Chinese</b> could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the <b>Chinese</b> force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division artillery fire. At 15:00, they engaged the surprised <b>Chinese,</b> conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire. By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the <b>Chinese,</b> who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{majority}} of the town population is made up of Foochow and Hokkien <b>Chinese,</b> Mandarin <b>Chinese,</b> Fuzhou dialect and Hokkien <b>Chinese</b> are commonly spoken. The majority of Sibu <b>Chinese</b> are multilingual and are able to speak both Malay and English. Indigenous languages such as Sarawak Malay, Melanau, Bidayuh and Iban are also spoken.|$|E
5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han <b>Chinese</b> settlement and an influx of Han <b>Chinese</b> refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han <b>Chinese</b> immigrants created a culture that merged Han <b>Chinese</b> traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han <b>Chinese</b> influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after <b>Chinese</b> styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{passed the}} <b>Chinese</b> Exclusion Act in 1882 {{to deal with}} what was {{believed}} to be an excess of <b>Chinese</b> labor-class immigrants, in particular in California. Many who were already in the United States, or were en route, went to Hawaii, and the islands were flooded with <b>Chinese</b> men. In 1883, between March and May, 3,400 <b>Chinese</b> male laborers arrived in Hawaii. The Hawaiian legislature then restricted immigration of <b>Chinese</b> men to 2,400 per year. Between 1878 and 1884, the population of <b>Chinese</b> laborers in Hawaii tripled.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Chinese</b> {{webmaster}} {{said that}} the authorities demanded for <b>Chinese</b> websites {{to cut down on}} their reporting of the fire, and only allowed usage of the official Xinhua news source. The New York Times reported that <b>Chinese</b> website Huasheng Online was blocked by government censors after criticizing the country's real-estate industry.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{immigrants}} were from China. Several hundred <b>Chinese</b> arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. <b>Chinese</b> miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} no justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the <b>Chinese</b> led to legislation such as the <b>Chinese</b> Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E
5|$|According to 2010 {{population}} census, 22.3 {{percent of}} <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians {{lived in the}} capital city of Jakarta, located on the island of Java. When the island's other provinces—Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, and East Java—are included, this population accounted for around half (51.8 percent) of all <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians. This data doesn't count the number of ethnic <b>Chinese</b> that has foreign citizenship. West Kalimantan have about 8.15 percent of population is ethnic <b>Chinese,</b> followed by Bangka–Belitung Islands (8.14 percent), Riau Islands (7.66 percent), Jakarta (6.58 percent), North Sumatra (5,75 percent), Riau (1.84 percent). In each of the remaining provinces, <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians account for 1 percent or less of the provincial population. Most <b>Chinese</b> Indonesians in North Sumatra lived in the provincial capital of Medan, they are one of major ethnics in the city with the Bataks and Javanese people, but in province, they constituted only a small percentage because of the relatively large population of the province, the sizeable <b>chinese</b> population also presence in Binjai, Tanjungbalai and Pematangsiantar city. Bangka–Belitung, West Kalimantan, and Riau are grouped around the hub of ethnic <b>Chinese</b> economic activity in Singapore and, with the exception of Bangka–Belitung, these settlements existed long before Singapore's founding in 1819.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} {{casualties}} on 1 February 1741 in Pati, <b>Chinese</b> insurgents spread through central Java, joining {{forces with the}} Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting them. As the deception became increasingly obvious and the <b>Chinese</b> drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint <b>Chinese</b> and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order to eliminate all <b>Chinese</b> in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any <b>Chinese</b> he and his troops could find and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Chinese</b> forces {{captured}} Seoul {{by the end}} of the battle, the <b>Chinese</b> {{invasion of}} South Korea galvanized the United Nations' support for South Korea, while the idea of evacuation was soon abandoned by the United Nations Command. At the same time, the <b>Chinese</b> People's Volunteer Army were exhausted after months of nonstop fighting since the start of the <b>Chinese</b> intervention, thereby allowing the United Nations forces to regain the initiative in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a handful}} of <b>Chinese</b> {{settlers}} had arrived in Madagascar {{towards the end of}} the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of <b>Chinese</b> migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina. <b>Chinese</b> migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large <b>Chinese</b> communities, including riz cantonais (<b>Chinese</b> fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (fried egg rolls).|$|E
5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three <b>Chinese</b> soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the <b>Chinese</b> howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the <b>Chinese.</b> For the counteroffensive, the average <b>Chinese</b> soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the <b>Chinese</b> relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the <b>Chinese</b> to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to by-pass the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the <b>Chinese</b> had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during the <b>Chinese</b> Civil War, most of the <b>Chinese</b> weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chinese</b> Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han <b>Chinese</b> on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han <b>Chinese</b> clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this <b>Chinese</b> style. The <b>Chinese</b> clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The <b>Chinese</b> Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). <b>Chinese</b> clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chinese</b> {{nationalist}} forces {{launched a}} large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, <b>Chinese</b> communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material {{resources for the}} communists. Continued antipathy between <b>Chinese</b> communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked {{the headquarters of the}} <b>Chinese</b> 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao. In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with <b>Chinese</b> nationalist forces.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the <b>Chinese</b> withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 <b>Chinese</b> troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off <b>Chinese</b> reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining <b>Chinese</b> and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the <b>Chinese,</b> hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the <b>Chinese</b> government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the <b>Chinese</b> government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the <b>Chinese</b> government did allow the film a limited <b>Chinese</b> release, but only after the <b>Chinese</b> New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. <b>Chinese</b> people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E

5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the <b>Chinese</b> military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the <b>Chinese</b> military's abilities while breaking the fragile <b>Chinese</b> supply lines. Recognizing the <b>Chinese</b> difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the <b>Chinese</b> offensives of 1951.|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Junior College was {{established}} in 1974 at the Bukit Timah campus of The <b>Chinese</b> High School as a separate institution offering pre-university education.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} success at Unsan, {{the rest of}} the <b>Chinese</b> forces {{advanced}} across the US lines, intending to push the US forces back across the Ch'ongch'on River and into Pyongyang. But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the <b>Chinese</b> to disengage on 5 November, thus ending the <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign. Besides the victory at Unsan, the <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong. In return, the <b>Chinese</b> had suffered 10,700 casualties {{by the end of the}} <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign. The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In 1874–75, {{after labor}} unrest {{disrupted}} coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired <b>Chinese</b> laborers {{to work in}} their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, the <b>Chinese</b> population rose slowly at first; however, where there were <b>Chinese</b> immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were <b>Chinese.</b> All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 <b>Chinese</b> laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, <b>Chinese</b> workers far outnumbered any other nationality. Though the 79 <b>Chinese</b> in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no <b>Chinese</b> residents reported in 1870.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 the French Sinologist and {{historian}} Paul Pelliot used Tang <b>Chinese</b> manuscripts excavated from Dunhuang, Gansu to identify an ancient Sogdian colony south of Lop Nur in Xinjiang (Northwest China), which he argued was {{the base for}} the spread of Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity in China. In 1926 Japanese scholar Kuwabara compiled evidence for Sogdians in <b>Chinese</b> historical sources and by 1933 <b>Chinese</b> historian Xiang Da published his Tang Chang'an and Central Asian Culture detailing the Sogdian influence on <b>Chinese</b> social religious life in the Tang-era <b>Chinese</b> capital city. The Canadian Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank published an article in 1952 demonstrating {{the presence of a}} Sogdian colony founded in Six Hu Prefectures of the Ordos Loop during the <b>Chinese</b> Tang period, composed of Sogdians and Turkic peoples who migrated from the Mongolian steppe. The Japanese historian Ikeda On wrote an article in 1965 outlining the history of the Sogdians inhabiting Dunhuang {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century, analyzing lists of their Sinicized names and the role of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism in their religious life. Yoshida Yutaka and Kageyama Etsuko, Japanese ethnographers and linguists of the Sogdian language, were able to reconstruct Sogdian names from forty-five different <b>Chinese</b> transliterations, noting that these were common in Turfan whereas Sogdians living closer to the center of <b>Chinese</b> civilization for generations adopted traditional <b>Chinese</b> names.|$|E
