50|$|A Carbon dioxide {{generator}} or <b>CO2</b> <b>generator</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to enhance}} carbon dioxide levels {{in order to promote}} plant growth in greenhouses or other enclosed areas. Carbon dioxide generators have been used to help grow marijuana. They can be fueled with propane or natural gas. CO2 generators were used mostly by commercial growers until smaller and less expansive systems made the technology more widely available to hobbyists. The generators also give off heat. Using compressed CO2 is an alternative to generators.|$|E
40|$|Lighted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps were baited {{with carbon}} dioxide (CO(2)) {{produced}} {{from three different}} sources to compare the efficacy of each in collecting phlebotomine sand flies in Bahrif village, Aswan Governorate, Egypt. Treatments consisted of compressed CO(2) gas released {{at a rate of}} 250 ml/min, 1. 5 kg of dry ice (replaced daily) sublimating from an insulated plastic container, CO(2) gas produced from a prototype FASTGAS (FG) <b>CO(2)</b> <b>generator</b> system (APTIV Inc., Portland, OR), and a CDC light trap without a CO(2) source. Carbon dioxide was released above each treatment trap 2 ̆ 7 s catch opening. Traps were placed in a 4 X 4 Latin square designed study with three replications completed after four consecutive nights in August 2007. During the study, 1, 842 phlebotomine sand flies were collected from two genera and five species. Traps collected 1, 739 (94. 4...|$|E
50|$|CO2 laser {{ablation}} technique is utilized {{to produce the}} first SWNHs at room temperature in absence of a metal catalyst. The <b>CO2</b> {{laser ablation}} <b>generator</b> is composed of a high-power CO2 laser source (with a wavelength of 10.6 μm, 5 kW of power, 10 nm of beam diameter, and the pulse width varies from 10 ms to continuous illumination) and a plastic-resin reaction chamber attached with a vacuum pumping system, inlet and outlet gas valves and a ZnSe lens system to adjust beam intensity. Ar gas is introduced and flowed through the inside chamber to remove the products to the collection filter {{under the pressure of}} 760 Torr at room temperature. Meanwhile, a graphite rod {{in the middle of the}} chamber continuously rotates and advances along its axis so that a new surface could be exposed to the laser beam that is vertical to the rod and thus SWNHs are produced.|$|R
