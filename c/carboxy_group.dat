50|$|GABA {{is found}} mostly as a {{zwitterion}} (i.e. with the <b>carboxy</b> <b>group</b> deprotonated and the amino group protonated). Its conformation {{depends on its}} environment. In the gas phase, a highly folded conformation is strongly favored due to the electrostatic attraction between the two functional groups. The stabilization is about 50 kcal/mol, according to quantum chemistry calculations. In the solid state, an extended conformation is found, with a trans conformation at the amino end and a gauche conformation at the carboxyl end. This {{is due to the}} packing interactions with the neighboring molecules. In solution, five different conformations, some folded and some extended, are found as a result of solvation effects. The conformational flexibility of GABA is important for its biological function, as it has been found to bind to different receptors with different conformations. Many GABA analogues with pharmaceutical applications have more rigid structures in order to control the binding better.|$|E

30|$|Bochek et al. {{suggested}} the conductometric over the potentiometric titration {{to calculate the}} esterification degree of polygalacturonic acid. Usually, the procedure consists of determining the number of free <b>carboxy</b> <b>groups,</b> with phenolphthalein as indicator and with the same solution, obtains the number of esterified <b>carboxy</b> <b>groups</b> by back titration. This technique needs a pre-treatment to dissolve the pectin under study. The pectin was dissolved by wetting with ethanol and {{with the addition of}} distilled water heated at 40  °C. The system was stirred for 2  h. They emphasized that the color turn of the indicator occurs in a relatively wide range of pH so this fact can result in a considerable error in the determination. Their results showed that conductometric titration is the technique that offers more similar results to those published in the literature, if compared with the results obtained by potentiometric titration [6]. Two important conclusions can be remarked from this research work. The first one is the benefit of not using an indicator in the conductometric titration technique, so the error of this kind can be disregarded and the second one, which was related to the first one, is the advantages of implementing this technique over the potentiometric because it offers more accurate results.|$|R
40|$|Obesity and its {{associated}} metabolic diseases represent {{some of the most}} rapidly expanding health issues worldwide, and, thus, the development of a novel chemical compound to suppress adipogenesis is strongly expected. We herein investigated the effects of water-soluble fullerene derivatives: a bis-malonic acid derivative and three types of proline-type fullerene derivatives, on adipogenesis using NIH- 3 T 3 cells overexpressing PPARγ. One of the proline-type fullerene derivatives (P 3) harboring three <b>carboxy</b> <b>groups</b> significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as aP 2, induced by the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. On the other hand, the bis-malonic acid derivative (M) and the 2 other proline-type fullerene derivatives (P 1, P 2), which have two <b>carboxy</b> <b>groups,</b> had no effect on PPARγ-mediated lipid accumulation or the expression of aP 2. P 3 fullerene also inhibited lipid accumulation induced by the combined stimulation with 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), dexamethasone, and insulin in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. During the differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells into adipocytes, P 3 fullerene did not affect the expression of C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, or PPARγ, but markedly inhibited that of aP 2 mRNA.
