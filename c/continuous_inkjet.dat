25|$|Professional digital {{printing}} (using toner) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto {{which it is}} printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, <b>continuous</b> forms <b>inkjet</b> drop-on-demand printing system.

Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{advancement}} of additive manufacturing (AM) / 3 -dimensional (3 D) printing, single-step fabrication of multifunctional parts using AM is limited. With the view of enabling multifunctional AM (MFAM), in this study, sintering of metal nanoparticles was performed to obtain conductivity for <b>continuous</b> line <b>inkjet</b> printing of electronics. This was achieved using a bespoke three dimensional (3 D) inkjet-printing machine, JETx®, capable of printing a range of materials and utilizing different post processing procedures to print multi-layered 3 D structures in a single manufacturing step. Multiple layers of silver were printed from an ink containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and infra-red sintered using a swathe-by-swathe (SS) and layer-by-layer sintering (LS) regime. The differences in the heat profile for the SS and LS was observed to influence the coalescence of the AgNPs. Void percentage of both SS and LS samples was higher towards the top layer than the bottom layer due to relatively less IR exposure in the top than the bottom. The results depicted a homogeneous microstructure for LS of AgNPs and showed less deformation compared to the SS. Electrical resistivity of the LS tracks (13. 6 ± 1 μΩ cm) was lower than the SS tracks (22. 5 ± 1 μΩ cm). This study recommends the use of LS method to sinter the AgNPs to obtain a conductive track in 25 % less time than SS method for MFAM...|$|R

30|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} of metal supports for SOFCs by vacuum sintering and {{the evaluation of the}} porous substrates suitability for direct ceramic inkjet printing (DCIJP) of SOFC functional coatings. The “green” metal supports were produced by commercial powder metallurgy methods such as tape casting and high-pressure injection moulding. Commercially accessible stainless steel 430 L powders were chosen as source supports material. The DCIJP technique is simple and cost-effective non-contact “wet” technique for fabrication of ceramic coatings onto variety of surfaces. It can reproducibly dispense droplets in the range of nL volumes at high rates (kHz). Drop-on-demand (DOD) ceramic inkjet printing offers excellent thickness and uniformity control and introduces the possibility of printing 2 D and 3 D patterns as well as <b>continuous</b> coatings. <b>Inkjet</b> systems offer wide scale of application—from experimentation platforms working with customized inks, up to mass manufacturing systems that can print rapidly and competitively on industrial scale. The technology is cost effective and environmentally friendly through waste minimization of the expensive precursors. The influence of the major printing parameters was evaluated. The production of anodes and electrolyte coatings with a modified Domino print head was reported previously by Tomov et al. [23, 24] using suspension inks. Wang et al. [25] deposited GDC electrolytes on NiO– 8 YSZ cermet anodes using sol–gel-based precursor solutions. Sukeshini et al. [26] employed a DMP- 2831 printer for the deposition of 8 YSZ electrolyte layers, LSM–YSZ and LSM cathode layers on to NiO– 8 YSZ supports, reporting a maximum power density of 450  mW/cm 2 at 850  °C in hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{has emerged}} as an interdisciplinary field to overcome current challenges for tissue repair or replacement in the human body. In essence, it proposes new medical therapies customized to match the biology of specific patients. The potential benefits offered by tissue engineering have driven scientific inquiry {{to make it a}} clinical reality. ^ One of the current challenges in tissue engineering is to provide oxygen supply to thick tissues as oxygen diffusion is limited to 100 - 200 µm layer of viable tissue. Engineered vascular conduits are applied in vitro, providing pre-vascularization to tissues; however, host anastomosis is still a problem. Biomaterials are suggested as another strategy; the aim is to construct scaffolds able to provide oxygen to cells in a controlled manner. Tissues require a controlled progressive oxygen supply, otherwise hypoxia or hyperoxia could induce cell necrosis. Inkjet printing method was developed to dispense living organisms, or biomaterials using a designed pattern. The hypothesis tested in this study is that scaffolds can be developed to provide a controlled oxygen supply thereby enhancing cell viability in hypoxic environments. ^ Calcium peroxide (CaO 2) was selected as oxygen generating material. It was encapsulated in alginate hydrogels to provide a <b>continuous</b> oxygen supply. <b>Inkjet</b> printed microparticles of CaO 2 were evaluated under hypoxic environment (0. 01 mol/m 3 O 2) in direct contact with culture medium. Samples with a ratio of 2 mg/mL (CaO 2 /medium) exhaust the oxygen supply after 30 hours. Oxygen generating scaffolds fabricated with a ratio of 160 mg of alginate per 10 mg of CaO 2 provided a stable oxygen supply in the range of 0. 066 - 0. 052 mol/m 3 under hypoxic environment. Fibroblast L-cells were cultured for 120 hours on these scaffolds under hypoxia (0. 01 mol/m 3, 5 % CO 2, 37 ºC) and their viability was evaluated via MTS metabolic assay. Statistical differences between oxygenized scaffolds and negative control scaffolds were observed. Live/Dead assays corroborated these results. ^ The current study shows a scaffold composed of alginate-hydrogel, and CaO 2 microparticles dispensed by the inkjet printing technology, able to supply oxygen in contact with culture medium. The oxygen generating scaffold was capable of maintaining cell mitochondrial activity under hypoxic conditions. The inkjet printing method may play an important role to construct complex scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, where the diffusion of oxygen is a constraint for large engineered-tissue implants. ...|$|R

[...] The process uses image editing software to convert screen printing into continuous digital printing. The digital printing continuously recirculates the unused ink back into the system instead of the stop start method used by the traditional screen printing method.

40|$|Electronically complementary, low {{molecular}} weight polymers that self-assemble through tuneable π-π stacking interactions to form extended supramolecular polymer networks {{have been developed for}} inkjet printing applications and successfully deposited using three different printing techniques. Sequential overprinting of the complementary components results in supramolecular network formation through complexation of π-electron rich pyrenyl or perylenyl chain-ends in one component with π-electron deficient naphthalene diimide residues in a chain-folding polyimide. The complementary π-π stacked polymer blends generate strongly coloured materials as a result of charge-transfer absorptions in the visible spectrum, potentially negating the need for pigments or dyes in the ink formulation. Indeed, the final colour of the deposited material can be tailored by changing varying the end-groups of the π electron rich polymer component. Piezoelectric printing techniques were employed in a proof of concept study to allow characterisation of the materials deposited, and a thermal inkjet printer adapted with imaging software enabled a detailed analysis of the ink-drops as they formed, and of their physical properties. Finally, <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet</b> printing allowed greater volumes of material to be deposited, on a variety of different substrate surfaces, and demonstrated the utility and versatility of this novel type of ink for industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResults are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} on the possibility and cause of polymer degradation in a full commercial inkjet printer. The behaviour of three linear poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples, having Mw 90, 310 and 468  kDa respectively, in a <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet</b> (CIJ) Domino A-Series+ printer is investigated and compared with earlier reported results for two experimental drop on demand (DOD) printers, a Dimatix DMP- 2800 and a Microfab single nozzle glass capillary. Despite all three printheads having equivalent strain rate at the nozzle tip (ε) no degradation is observed within the CIJ head alone whereas single pass degradation is observed in both DOD printheads. This can be attributed to a consequence of a number of factors including the slightly greater nozzle diameter, and different nozzle geometry, which includes cone angle and nozzle cylinder length, for CIJ, the different mode of drop generation or the higher polymer concentration investigated. It should also be noted that the flow through the CIJ nozzle is continuous, where it is pulsed in the case of DOD. The calculated maximum strain rates are similar, but in DOD it is being periodically ramped up and switched off. The main source of polymer degradation in CIJ printing through a CIJ Domino A-Series+ printer is found to be the continuous recycling of ink through the pump resulting in mechano-chemical polymer degradation. Molecular weight degradation proceeds by random scission, and is obtained at the lower shear rates experience as a consequence of the longer residence time due to mechano-chemical damage in the pump. These results have significance in the total design of inkjet systems for the delivery of high molecular weight polymers and materials sensitive to mechano-chemical degradation and highlight the need for careful consideration when moving from laboratory based print tools to full scale application...|$|E
40|$|A novel process {{utilizing}} specialized <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet</b> (CIJ) {{printing technology}} and innovative conductive inks to fabricate three-dimensional electronic products is {{introduced in the}} current investigation. The major advantage of the CIJ process is that it not only provides a fast and cost-effective method for applying electronic components, but it also allows the printing of conductive traces in three-dimensional space. The greatest challenge for inkjet printing of electrical circuits is the formulation of the conductive inks, which define not only the convenience of the materials being deposited, but also the final comprehensive properties and the major expense. Several conductive inks were investigated and compared mainly based on their electric conductance and mechanical adherence to a substrate. Two different particle-free solution conductive inks were specifically researched for low cost, deposition convenience and improved properties. A novel aqueous solution of silver nitrate with a corresponding adhesion promoter is introduced for the first time. It {{has been found that}} the traces produced by the process have excellent adherence and have an electrical resistivity of only 2. 9 times that of bulk silver. Low temperature curing plus further annealing of a specified metallo-organic decomposition (MOD) ink produces close-packed silver crystal substructures. The electrical conductance of the final conductive trace was close to that of bulk silver, and wearability was significantly improved from ductile deformation. These two particle-free solution inks are expected to find a number of applications in various industries. Fundamental concepts in formulating and post-processing of inkjet printing are fully discussed. The two primary problems faced by inkjet printed components are low deposited thickness and porosity. An interlayer oxide film was found to be necessary to bond the precious metal layer with the glass substrate. Porosity can be significantly reduced through high temperature annealing, which not only increases electrical conductance, but also mechanical strength. Special curing methods are proposed to consolidate the printed conductors and avoid overheating of temperature sensitive substrates...|$|E
40|$|The common {{denominator}} of this thesis is {{the quest for}} processing {{a wider range of}} materials using inkjet technology, to allow for the realization of innovative manufacturing methods based on the precisely controlled placement in time and space of small portions of possibly different materials in order to build a complete product. One of the limiting factors in commercial available inkjet systems is the viscosity. To overcome this, a printhead has been developed, based on the very first inkjet principle developed, namely <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet.</b> In this thesis the design phases of the complete print system are described. Several aspects are discussed {{all the way from the}} material supply mechanism, the droplet generation mechanism itself, towards means and methods to control the droplet landing position. To create a system which is as material independent as possible, deflection mechanisms are described requiring no material adaptation; droplet selection by collision, and droplet selection by air-jet. Thereafter several application areas are described, from powder generation towards novel encapsulation methods. For the realization of functional 3 D electronics, using additive manufacturing techniques, it is required to create conductive tracks without additional high temperature processing steps. To that end two methods are described. The first process, pyrolitic metal printing, creates droplets of metal salt solutions which are pyrolised in flight on their way to the substrate. The second process, direct metal printing, deposits metal droplets directly from the melt. Therefore a printhead is developed capable of operating at 1140 ¿C allowing deposition of Feingold. Finally an overview is given of the challenges occurring when implementing the developed inkjet technology and creating a 3 D layer-wise production system. Combining multiple materials into one single product opens new opportunities. The described process is used in one of the first systems capable of generating gradients in material properties within one product. Until now only nature was able to generate these structures. Now production technology is starting to catch up...|$|E
40|$|Can inkjet {{technology}} revolutionise manufacturing processes {{as we know}} them? By extending the existing benefits of inkjet methods to attain the speed, coverage and material diversity of conventional printing, we can transform inkjet from its present status as a niche technology into a mainstream process, with the UK as a major player. However, we require {{a better understanding of}} the science underlying the formation of small droplets and the effect of complex additives. First, we highlight key inkjetting methods and discuss well-known effects that particles and polymers have on jet evolution. We describe how jetting and filament-thinning experiments can be used to measure key characterisation parameters and how these techniques can be modelled via an established simulation method. Second, we review the literature exploring jet stability and break-up, including the Rayleigh stability analysis and universal self-similar thinning laws. In Chapter 3, we develop a simple one-dimensional model. First, we model particulate effects on the decay of a liquid bridge and identify three thinning regimes. In particular, we describe a mechanism for acceleration, which agrees quantitatively with experiments. In contrast, the addition of viscoelasticity retards thinning processes and delays break-up. Our viscoelastic jetting model demonstrates the theoretical exponential thinning law, `beads-on-string' structures and is in quantitative agreement with axisymmetric simulations. In Chapter 4, we develop a simplified drop-on-demand jetting model to predict the printability of polymer solutions. We demonstrate three known jetting regimes and the predicted `jettable' concentration threshold is in quantitative agreement with experimental data. Using axisymmetric simulations, we identify a `pre-stretch' mechanism that is able to fully extend polymers within the nozzle. Consequently, we show that molecules can undergo central scission due to high strain rates at the nozzle exit. In Chapter 5, we simulate a one-dimensional <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet</b> using an adaptive mesh technique. We explore non-linear behaviour caused by finite-amplitude modulations in the driving velocity profile, where jet stability deviates from Rayleigh behaviour. We identify a modulation range where pinching becomes `inverted', occurring upstream of the filament connecting the main drops, rather than downstream. This behaviour can be controlled by the addition of a second harmonic to the initial driving signal. Our results are compared to full axisymmetric simulations in order to incorporate the effects of nozzle geometry. ...|$|E
40|$|Fabrication of micro and nano devices is {{of prime}} {{significance}} {{to the area of}} Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Attempts have been made to accommodate high performance devices in compact units, thus reducing their overall size. There exist a variety of microfabrication techniques including lithography, chemical vapor deposition, and LIGA that are used today. Manufacturing costs associated with these processes can be prohibitive due to cycle time and the precious material loss that occurs during etching operations. These drawbacks become more significant problem when building curved traces and support structures that most occur in 3 D space. To address the problems associated with building 3 -dimensional circuits and devices in free space, a unique manufacturing process has been developed. This process utilizes conductive Nano-Particulate Fluid Jets (NPFJ) that are deposited onto a substrate by a <b>Continuous</b> <b>Inkjet</b> (CIJ) printing methodology. In this method, a fluid jet consists of colloidal suspensions of conductors and carrier fluids that are deposited onto a substrate and later sintered at high temperatures to form a homogeneous material. The major contribution of the present research is the investigation, development and optimization of the NPFJ. In this work, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to simulate the fluid jet and CIJ process. The modified CIJ printing process involves interaction of three domains namely, electrostatics, structural and fluidics. A coupled field analysis of the piezoelectric membrane that exists in the CIJ print head is conducted to establish the perturbation characteristics applied to the fluid. Interaction of the above three domains is captured within a single model using a (FSI) fluid-structural algorithm which staggers between domains until convergence is attained. A Design of Experiments approach was used to determine trends for the drop formations based on various exciting parameters. Results from these simulations have been validated using an ultra-high-speed camera featuring exposure/delay times from 100 nanoseconds at full sensor resolution. The results of present research will give manufacturers the freedom to construct 3 D devices and circuits that conform to the desired shapes and sizes of products, rather than being limited to present 2 D components such as printed circuit boards...|$|E

In response, organizations such as the CIA, Secret Service and FBI must continually train and educate their employees and staff. To meet the increasing demands of these groups, the Rochester Institute of Technology has developed the Marking Engine Characterization (MEC) target to train and assist forensic document examiners in identifying print processes. The MEC target 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in identifying print processes was tested by printing the target on a variety of marking engines and processes. These marking engines included: Heidelberg Speedmaster 74 - Offset Lithography Nexpress 2100 - Dry electro-photographic process Xerox DocuColor 6060 - Toner based electro-photographic process Indigo 3000 - Liquid ink electro-photographic process Fuji Pictroproof- Silver halide photographic process Iris Realist FX 5015 - <b>Continuous</b> <b>inkjet</b> process Epson 9600 - Piezo based inkjet process Kodak Approval NX - Thermal dye sublimation The substrate used during the study was limited to 100 # Titan gloss to decrease variability, however, the Fuji Pictroproof, Epson 9600 and Iris Realist FX 5015 are not compatible with other brands of stock and used the following stocks: Fuji Pictroproof Matte Paper, Epson Premium Gloss Photo Paper and Iris Realist Inkjet Gloss Paper. SWOP specifications were used as benchmark settings for CMYK and the specific settings of each marking engines was documented using the Press Run Organizer. Thirtysix MEC targets were printed per marking engine and visually evaluated to ensure the marking engines were consistent. A group of samples were selected and evaluated by 13 observers who were participants in the Forensic Document Examiners Seminar held at RIT on November 18, 2005. The results of the observation group lead to several conclusions. Firstly, the MEC target is not effective in helping forensic document examiners identify print processes. Secondly, the attendees of the seminar did not have enough experience in digital processes to distinguish between them. Thirdly, the experience among the user group is varied.

40|$|Digital color proofs and pre-proofs {{are used}} by graphic artists and {{commercial}} printers throughout the prepress process. However the prepress process has undergone radical changes {{over the past decade}} due to the introduction of desk top publishing and desktop prepress. Alongside of the desktop publishing revo lution has come a multitude of new digital proofing technologies for use in this ever changing environment. Technologies including, but not limited to, liquid inkjet, dye sublimation, <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet,</b> color laser, and thermal wax transfer printers have provided an entire range of color accuracy and price suitability to many of their users. However one {{needs to be able to}} understand the practical applications and limitations of these technologies to make a suitable choice for a specific prepress operation or design process. Therefore a handbook for the users of digital proofs has been created for their benefit. The underlying structure of this handbook is based on the following six chap ters. The first chapter, entitled Communicating with Prepress and the Attributes of Digital Proofing, contains multiple parts. Firstly, it contains information for the designer in regards to the advantages and disadvantages of all types of digital output devices. It discusses the advantages which digital output devices may or may not have over conventional proofing systems. Additionally, ideas such as the vantages and drawbacks of preproofers and proofers is elaborated upon. Information for this part of the chapter was obtained through questionnaires completed by, and interviews with print buyers, art directors, and production managers from advertising agencies and prepress providers in the Rochester area. More information for this section of the first chapter was obtained through various manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s literature, printing industry reports and various periodi cals. Chapter One also discusses ideas behind the application of color printers (preproofers) and digital proofers. These ideas address issues which pertain to the application of specific printing and proofing processes to specific phases of the creative and production processes. Additionally, discussions regarding proof ing costs, qualities, and production turnaround time may be found in this part of the first chapter. Information for this section of Chapter One was obtained through information found in printing and publishing related periodicals, as well as in manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 literature. Finally, the first chapter develops a system for the correction of digital preproofs and proofs. Multiple groups of ideas pertaining to the correction of digital output are discussed. Some of these include sections entitled Digital File Tracking and Identification, Evaluation of Design Elements, Evaluating Colors, Element Positioning, and Element Dimension Adjustments. Information for this part of the chapter was obtained through the evaluation of previously corrected digital con tract proofs and preproofs, as well as the interviews and questionnaires men tioned above. The second chapter, entitled Proofing Typography, displays the many different ways that printing and proofing technologies affect text type and display typog raphy. Using the CD-Rom included in the back of the book, one may view on screen how the following technologies affect type ranging from 3 points to 72 points in size: liquid inkjet, large format liquid inkjet, phase-change inkjet, ther mal wax transfer, dye sublimation, <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet,</b> and dye ablation. Information and samples for this chapter were obtained through printing and proofing system manufacturers and advertising agencies in the Rochester area. The Color Primer and Chapter Three: Proofing for Imagery and Color, contain information for the designer which may be applied to proper evaluation of color on color prints and digital proofs. The Color Primer discusses subjects such as color space, the additive and subtractive color theories, and common color mea surement tools. Chapter Three then applies some of this knowledge in its discus sions of proper lighting conditions for viewing prints and proofs, and different human factors which influence the highly subjective evaluation of all digital color output. Information for this chapter was gathered using graphic arts and printing industry related periodicals and industry-wide books related to color and its reproduction. The fourth chapter, entitled Substrates and Digital Output, educates the design er about the effects on text, imagery, and graphics which occur when creating digital prints and proofs on a variety of papers. Various paper surfaces such as gloss, semi-gloss and matte surfaces are addressed. The affects of colored paper on imagery and graphics are also elaborated upon. Additionally, printing and proofing processes are discussed in regards to the substrates that they accept for output. Information for this chapter was gathered through manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 litera ture and various industry related books and periodical articles. The Proofing Process Supplement was created to familiarize the designer with all currently popular forms of digital output technology. The process supplement discusses the imaging processes used by the following digital output technolo gies: liquid inkjet, phase-change inkjet, thermal wax transfer, dye sublimation, <b>continuous</b> <b>inkjet,</b> and dye ablation. Additionally, the supplement contains brief explanations regarding screening technologies. Information for the process sup plement was gathered through manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 literature, interviews with pre press providers in the Rochester area, and interviews with technical representa tives from the manufacturers of devices which use the above digital, color out put technologies. Chapter Five, entitled Image Fidelity, simply illustrates how all of the current ly popular printing and proofing technologies affect graphics and imagery. Using the CD-Rom included with the guidebook, the reader may view magni fied and normal views of printing and proof sample imagery. Information noted by the reader in the proofing process supplement may then be actively applied when viewing these samples. Information and sample prints for the fifth chapter were gathered from several manufacturers and advertising agencies in the Rochester area. The sixth chapter, entitled The Acceptance of Digital Contract Proofing, discusses a new definition of the contract proof in regards to the evolution of digital proof ing. This chapter provides ideas for the designer, art director, and print buyer to realize when considering the use of digital contract proofing. Several questions are raised concerning what requirements a digital contract proof must fulfill depending upon the areas of its application and any agreements between the designer and prepress provider regarding their specific definition of a digital contract proof. Additionally, specific advantages of digital contract proofs, such as their ability to fingerprint a press and/or press run, are discussed. Finally, a discussion pertaining to the education of all users of digital proofing technolo gies is presented to aid the overall acceptance of digital contract proofing. Information for this chapter was obtained through the extensive interviews of leading technical and product oriented representatives from the manufacturers of currently used digital contract proofing systems. Many conclusions have been reached with the completion of this guidebook. In brief, the first and most prominent conclusion which may be reached states that the acceptance of digital contract proofing lies within the education of all designers, art directors and print buyers about digital printing and proofing technologies. As the use of digital contract proofing grows, education and inter est by all creative professionals will orient them towards their use of digital proofing systems. The next conclusion which has been reached is that the proper application of color printers and digital proofers is of major importance for the designer due to the added flexibility and rewards which result from the use of digital color out put devices throughout the creative and production processes. Another conclu sion which may be reached is that the display of proofing and printing process effects on text, graphics, and imagery serves to directly inform the creative pro fessional how these elements may be distorted by the utilized output device. Knowledge gained by the creative professional in regards to these effects helps to answer many questions regarding print or proof quality and proper output device application. Finally, additional knowledge gained by designers which pertains to proper viewing of all color output, color theories, color measurement, and proofing sub strates helps them to better communicate with those prepress and print professionals involved in the production process...|$|E
