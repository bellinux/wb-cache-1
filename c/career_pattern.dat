40|$|Abstract The life-course <b>career</b> <b>pattern</b> {{of female}} criminals {{is still a}} {{neglected}} dimension in criminology. In the present study we re-analyzed the Project Metropolitan data for 7719 boys and 7398 girls up to age 30 with respect to antisocial career patterns, guided by the Moffitt model of life-course persistent and adolescence-limited crime careers. Females were much less predisposed to offend than males, but when they did they tended to follow a similar set of trajectories as men {{in the development of}} crime over time. Six career patterns were identified, which had meaningful and different associations with crime characteristics as well as a set of non-criminal indices of deviant behaviour (school and abuse problems). A new finding was that the recruitment of females into criminal careers, in contrast to males, showed two peaks, one at age 13 and one at age 26 which corresponds to Moffitt’s third <b>career</b> <b>pattern</b> (adult onset – chronic pattern).

40|$|The {{development}} of women’s career {{is more complicated}} than that of men’s, as various internal and external barriers exist, for instance, the family and related duties, the role in life, employment, the surrounding environ-ment, traditions and stereotypes that both facilitate and limit the choice of a career by women and their career growth. To understand the specifics of women’s professional career, scientists seek to explain the relations of employment and careers. A career is defined as a position of employment, a sequence of roles, activities and experiences that combines the job, the career and the profession as well as the situation of being unemployed. It means that a career may develop not only upwards, but during its course women may end up in various situations and have various statuses of employment. Therefore, employment is associated with a professional career through the change of the status of employment. The research includes the research results on women’s career patterns. The research aim is to examine the ways of women’s <b>career</b> <b>pattern.</b> To achieve the aim, a survey of women was conducted. In the survey, the ways of women’s <b>career</b> <b>pattern</b> in Latvia were identified based on seven ways of women’s <b>career</b> <b>pattern,</b> as defined by D. Super’s Theory of Career Development. The paper concludes that the distribution of the given of women’s careers patterns are as follows: 38. 5 % are parallel careers, 25. 6 % interrupted careers, 15. 4 % stable careers, 12. 8 % traditional careers, 5. 1 % instable careers and 2. 6 % are stable housekeeper careers.

30|$|Occupational <b>career</b> <b>patterns</b> (OCP) {{may be of}} {{significant}} importance for organizations (since OCP may influence system maintenance; Barley 1989), {{as well as for}} society (because OCP are likely to influence the profile of communities; Wilensky 1961). The most important influence, however, concerns the individual. Occupational activity has an impact on life stage functioning {{as well as on the}} fulfillment of tasks in different life stages (Super 1957). Furthermore, studies have found that <b>career</b> <b>patterns</b> may play a role in terms of well-being (e.g. Jepsen and Choudhuri 2001). Therefore, empirical studies of OCP are very important in vocational and career guidance (Jepsen 1994; Savickas 1995). They create a basis for optimal OCP guidance based on well-founded knowledge—including the risks—of the various <b>career</b> <b>patterns.</b> For this reason, researchers are to identify OCP and factors involved in influencing decisions at numerous points in time (Osipow and Fitzgerald 1996).|$|R
30|$|However, all the {{mentioned}} {{strategies are}} merely coarse examinations of <b>career</b> <b>patterns.</b> For example, the theoretically based method to define <b>career</b> <b>patterns</b> is less based on data, {{and to identify}} OCPs by including occupations only at {{a limited number of}} time points makes results depend strictly on those time points inspected (Pollock et al. 2002). To address these problems, we use longitudinal data and examine occupational sequences over a period of 30  years. We categorize the <b>career</b> <b>patterns</b> {{with the help of the}} “International Standard Classification of Occupations” (ISCO; ILO 2012), which is a very well established instrument. The ISCO is basically a categorical system but does partially have a hierarchical structure based on educational level (for more details see “Career patterns” section). Therefore the categorization of “stable” “horizontal changes”, “upward career”, “downward career” and “fluctuating pattern” are the logical consequence to describe OCPs.|$|R
40|$|Existing career {{theories}} are {{largely based on}} a stable working environment and have focused excessively on men and single work roles. In the postindustrial era, however, women’s careers, characterized by the constant negotiation of multiple roles and more frequent job changes, have had implications on {{the changing nature of}} careers. The general purpose of this thesis is to increase knowledge about the process of career development of women. The focus is on two aspects: Life Career (characterized by multiple role constellations over the life course) and Occupational Career (characterized by different shapes of occupational movement over the life course). Three sets of questions addressed these two aspects of career: trajectory patterns, interrelationships, and antecedents and consequences. Career biographies covered ages 16 to 43. Antecedents reflecting individual agency (e. g., life role value, aspiration, and early experiences) were investigated. The impact of family context on occupational choice was also examined. Among the consequences examined were midlife work wellness and stress, health, and wellbeing. Results showed that (1) <b>Career</b> <b>patterns</b> were highly diverse, including nine distinct life <b>career</b> <b>patterns</b> and ten occupational <b>career</b> <b>patterns.</b> (2) Occupational and life careers were significantly related, indicating that the paid work career is embedded in the overall life role structure throughout the life course. (3) Individual agency factors predicted life career. Occupational career was related to life career more than family context. (4) Occupational career did matter in work wellbeing. In terms of stress, health, and wellbeing at midlife, there was little difference among life <b>career</b> <b>patterns,</b> but more significant differences among occupational <b>career</b> <b>patterns.</b> The thesis indicates career theory can benefit from taking multiple roles and career development into account. Implications for career counseling, social policy, and organizations are discussed...|$|R

30|$|On the whole, {{our results}} show that in today’s {{professional}} careers, linear career courses (such as “stable courses”) or reaching a higher-status position (“upward careers”) are still common, but modern career models with several occupational changes (“fluctuating patterns”) have probably become more frequent recently.
