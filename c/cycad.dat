5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a <b>cycad</b> Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|The Guimarota {{locality}} {{is located}} in the eastern Lusitanian Basin, {{which is part of the}} Iberian Meseta. The vertebrate-bearing Guimarota-strata was deposited in a brackish lagoon that periodically received both freshwater and saltwater influxes. Ecologically, the environment would have been akin to a modern mangrove swamp. Plants known from megafossils include the horsetails Equisetum and Schizoneura; the seed fern Caytonia; the <b>cycad</b> Otozamites; the araucaria Brachyphyllum; Ginkgo; and the charophyte algae Porochara. Additionally, plant families known only from pollen include lycopods, forked ferns, possible scaly tree ferns (which may be matoniaceans or dicksoniaceans instead), royal ferns, the seed fern Sphenopteris, cypresses, and pines. Most of the preserved organisms probably originated from around the swamp, although there may have been minimal transportation by water currents.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 18th-19th centuries, {{discoveries of}} several species were {{reported}} by numerous naturalist researchers and discoverers traveling throughout the world. One of the most notable researchers of <b>cycads</b> was American botanist C.J. Chamberlain whose work is noteworthy for the quantity of data and the novelty of his approach to studying <b>cycads.</b> His 15 years of travel throughout Africa, the Americas and Australia to observe <b>cycads</b> in their natural habitat resulted in his 1919 publication of The Living <b>Cycads</b> which remains current in its synthesis of taxonomy, morphology and reproductive biology of <b>cycads,</b> most of which was obtained from his original research. His 1940s monograph on the Cycadales, was never published.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cycads</b> between 11.5 and 5 m.y.a. {{began to}} rediversify after {{previous}} declines in variety due to climatic changes, and thus modern <b>cycads</b> {{are not a}} good model for a [...] "living fossil".|$|R
50|$|The early larval instars of some aposematic, day-flying looper moths are {{specific}} to <b>cycads,</b> and genus Encephalartos {{is one of their}} food plants.

25|$|In {{his book}} The Island of the Colorblind Sacks wrote about an island where {{many people have}} {{achromatopsia}} (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia). The second section of this book, entitled <b>Cycad</b> Island, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have {{a high incidence of}} a neurodegenerative disease locally known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the <b>cycad</b> nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.|$|E
25|$|Species {{diversity}} of the extant cycads peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the equator. There is therefore not a latitudinal diversity gradient towards the equator but towards the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. However, the peak near the northern tropic {{is largely due to}} Cycas in Asia and Zamia in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to Cycas again, and also to the diverse genus Encephalartos in southern and central Africa, and Macrozamia in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of <b>cycad</b> species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining <b>cycad</b> genera and their species, and perhaps because they are partly xerophytic rather than simply tropical.|$|E

50|$|All <b>cycads</b> possess 'coralloid' (meaning coral-like) roots. These roots contain {{symbiotic}} cyanobacteria that fix gaseous nitrogen {{from the}} atmosphere and provide essential nitrogenous compounds to the plant.

25|$|In 1903, {{workers for}} the Commercial Pacific Cable Company took up {{residence}} on the island {{as part of the}} effort to lay a trans-Pacific telegraph cable. These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the canary, <b>cycad,</b> Norfolk Island pine, she-oak, coconut, and various deciduous trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.|$|E

5000|$|... {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{studies have}} produced {{at least six}} different placements of Ginkgo relative to <b>cycads,</b> conifers, gnetophytes and angiosperms. The two most common are that Ginkgo is a sister to a clade composed of conifers and gnetophytes or that Ginkgo and <b>cycads</b> form a clade within the gymnosperms. A 2013 study examined {{the reasons for the}} discrepant results, and concluded that the best support was for the monophyly of Ginkgo and <b>cycads,</b> these being the earliest diverging gymnosperms.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cycads</b> are an {{important}} relic {{from the past and}} rep-resent the oldest living seed plants. <b>Cycads</b> have been instrumental in our understanding the evolution of angiosperms and gymnosperms because they have recognizable morphological characteristics intermedi-ate between less-recently evolved plants such as ferns and more-derived (advanced) plants including the angio-sperms. <b>Cycads</b> also produce several compounds that are carcinogenic and neurotoxic. Because of their unique placement in terrestrial plant evolution, molecular studies should help to define the origins of structures that led to the rise of seed plants and the role of neuro-toxic compounds that are found in <b>cycads.</b> The eminent cycadologist Knut Norstog said ‘I have sometimes used the analogy of the Rosetta Stone for th...|$|R

25|$|The {{probable}} former {{range of}} cycads {{can be inferred}} from their global distribution. For example, the family Stangeriaceae only contains three extant species in Africa and Australia. Diverse fossils of this family have been dated to 135mya, indicating that diversity may have been much greater before the Jurassic and late Triassic mass extinction events. However, the <b>cycad</b> fossil record is generally poor and little can be deduced {{about the effects of}} each mass extinction event on their diversity.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{correlations}} can be {{made between}} the number of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is likely that <b>cycad</b> diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000species, compared to the 1080remaining gymnosperms. It is surprising that the cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.|$|E
25|$|The family Stangeriaceae (named for Dr. William Stanger, 18111854), {{consisting}} {{of only three}} extant species, {{is thought to be}} of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Argentina, dating to 70135mya. The family Zamiaceae is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle Triassic to the Eocene (54200mya) in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Antarctica, implying the family was present before the break-up of Pangea. The family Cycadaceae is thought to be an early offshoot from other cycads, with fossils from Eocene deposits (3854mya) in Japan, China, and North America, indicating this family originated in Laurasia. Cycas is the only genus in the family and contains 99species, the most of any <b>cycad</b> genus. Molecular data have recently shown Cycas species in Australasia and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting adaptive radiation may have occurred. The current distribution of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by genetic drift following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict endemism across present continental lines.|$|E
50|$|Zamia in the New World, Cycas in Asia and Encephalartos in Africa are {{the most}} {{threatened}} genera. This pattern reflects the pressures on species in these regions. At least two species, Encephalartos woodii and Encephalartos relictus (both from Africa), are confirmed extinct in the wild. <b>Cycads</b> are long-lived with infrequent reproduction, and most populations are small, putting them at risk of extinction from habitat destruction and stochastic environmental events. Regionally, Australian <b>cycads</b> are the least at risk, as they are locally common and habitat fragmentation is low. However, land management with fire {{is thought to be}} a threat to Australian species. African <b>cycads</b> are rare and are thought to be naturally decreasing due to small population sizes, and there is controversy over whether to let natural extinction processes act on these <b>cycads.</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{detailed}} {{computer analysis}} of the biomechanics of Stegosauruss feeding behavior was performed in 2010, using two different three-dimensional models of Stegosaurus teeth given realistic physics and properties. Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for Stegosaurus were 140.1 Newton (N), 183.7 N, and 275 N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was {{less than half that}} of a Labrador Retriever. Stegosaurus could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12mm in diameter. Stegosaurus, therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study. However, A study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates Stegosaurus' bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as [...] "Sophie" [...] from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; Erlikosaurus and Plateosaurus to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that Stegosaurus had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely Stegosaurus also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading <b>cycad</b> seeds. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.|$|E
