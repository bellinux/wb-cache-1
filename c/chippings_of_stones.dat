50|$|From this lusorium of {{the dogs}} and geese whom I left at their several occupations, I return to the mansion merely to observe that its walls are formed from the marble {{quarries}} with which this parish abounds {{and that in the}} front towards the west the same injudicious alteration {{in the form of the}} windows has taken place, 'tis may be remarked of the principal one in the sketch the Gothic style having been converted to the Grecian and the antient mullion modernised to the trim sash!! In the church as might be expected are to be found a number of monuments in honour of the family of Bluett, many of them of considerable beauty and magnificance and one in particular of white marble of John Bluett Esq. and his wife Elizth. daughter of Sir Jn. Portman Bart., whose effigies are in a recumbent posture surrounded by eight daughters kneeling. The road winding round the house ascended immediately a steepish hill giving me a view of the garden which it skirted and of the noble hanging wood that defended it from the northern blasts. Notwithstanding however the contiguity of this road to a gentleman's place of residence and to lime rocks, the <b>chippings</b> <b>of</b> whose <b>stones</b> must necessarily afford abundant materials for its repair, it was so rugged and full of ruts as to render it, in addition to the steepness of its acclivity, extremely incommodious to the traveller.

30|$|In {{industrial}} machining of timber, {{the method}} {{in which the}} operator visually inspects both wear and <b>chippings</b> <b>of</b> router bits after stopping the machine is generally adopted. However, many working hours are lost in this method and productivity suffers. Therefore, {{the development of a}} system that can automatically measure wear or chippings without stopping the machine is desirable. In this study, a laser measuring instrument was installed in a computerized numerically controlled (CNC) router, and an automatic measurement system for the cutting edge profile of throw-away-type straight bits with single-edged blades was developed. The main results are summarized as follows: (1) an automatic measurement system for the cutting edge profile of the bit was constructed; (2) this system was composed of a laser measuring instrument, a control personal computer (PC) for the CNC router, and a monitoring PC to control some devices and collect sampling data; (3) the system could measure the cutting edge profile of the bit without stopping the CNC router.|$|R

The compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> masonry was studied through masonry prisms using 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 cement mortars.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the contribution of}} interdisciplinary material culture studies to the study <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> tools.

Employing case studies derived from the fields of museum studies and heritage studies, it contends that the meaning and social role <b>of</b> a <b>stone</b> artefact changes throughout the course of its life history with each transformation in its use cycle, and most importantly, that stone artefacts continue to have social and material agency and do social ‘work’ even after they have been discarded. Although much of this chapter focuses on the materiality and meaning <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> artefacts in the modern world, these ideas also provide opportunities for a reconsideration of the materiality and meaning <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> artefacts in the past...|$|R
