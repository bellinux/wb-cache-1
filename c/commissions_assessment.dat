40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with subsidiarity in Directive 2014 / 104 EU on actions for antitrust damages. After providing an overview of private enforcement of competition law and subsidiarity in EU law, it examines the arguments presented by the Commission in the relevant Impact Assessments. While most of the arguments {{were based on the}} need to prevent adverse cross- border effects, of particular interest was the argument that Member States were slow or unresponsive in providing effective measures designed to compensate antitrust victims. Subsequently, it shows that the <b>Commission?s</b> <b>assessment</b> of the underlying problems was discretionary and played a pivotal role before the considerations on subsidiarity were made. On this basis, this article makes the case for subsidiarity to be understood as Member States? constructive engagement in EU action, rather than constraint on EU action...|$|E

We discuss how such features are generally troublesome for statistical inference and interpretation. Through examples we examine some of the implications for maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian estimation, and bootstrapping.

40|$|The {{public sector}} {{capacity}} of the EU Member States to access the European funds depends highly on the sustainability of their government budgets. According to the European <b>Commission</b> <b>assessment,</b> Romania is not facing a risk of fiscal stress in the short run. However {{the effects of the}} economic crisis and the vision with a predominantly social character regarding the public expenditures have contributed to the limitation of resources allocated for economic development. The low level of absorption of the European funds in Romania means implicit losses for the national economy, but a higher level could have been a cause for excessive budget deficit. In order to reduce the pressure on the state budget the government aims at being committed mainly in investment projects with EU financial assistance. This reflects the substitution of the state own financial resources with foreign funds, therefore the additionality effect initially wanted by the EU decreases. The paper evaluates the public investment effort in Romania under the Fiscal Pact limit on deficit and the conditionalities negotiated with IMF, as well as its effects on the economy and budget deficit...|$|R
