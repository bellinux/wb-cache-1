Martin Luther King Jr. Day was {{established}} as a holiday in numerous <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states</b> beginning in 1971, and as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a county in Washington State was also renamed for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states</b> beyond central Italy, {{such as the}} Republic of Florence at this time, {{were also}} notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states.</b> In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, a number of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states,</b> mostly in {{the eastern half of}} the United States, have passed ordinances and laws governing rodeo.

Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go—specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.

25|$|In {{the last}} century {{refrigeration}} allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states.</b> In the 20th century, refrigeration has made “Galactic Cities” such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.|$|E
25|$|The end of October 1918, in Wilhelmshaven, in {{northern}} Germany, saw {{the beginning of}} the German Revolution of 1918–19.

On 3 November, the revolt spread to other <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states</b> of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated.

25|$|Telecommunications {{equipment}} providers, {{convinced that}} the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access, went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and fiber optic cables. In the struggle to become a technology hub, many <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states</b> used tax money to fund technology conference centers, advanced infrastructure, and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the dotcom industry in their locale. Virginia's Dulles Technology Corridor along I-495 {{is a prime example}} of this activity. Large quantities of high-speed fiber links were laid, and the State and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms. Office vacancy increased significantly after the bubble burst, although the area still remains a major technology hub.|$|E

25|$|In 701BCE, Sennacherib {{turned from}} Babylonia {{to the western}} part of the empire, where Hezekiah of Judah, incited by Egypt and Marduk-apla-iddina, had renounced Assyrian allegiance. The {{rebellion}} involved various small states in the area: Sidon and Ashkelon were taken by force and a string of other <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states,</b> including Byblos, Ashdod, Ammon, Moab and Edom then paid tribute without resistance. Ekron called on Egypt for help but the Egyptians were defeated. Sennacherib then turned on Jerusalem, Hezekiah's capital. He besieged the city and gave its surrounding towns to Assyrian vassal rulers in Ekron, Gaza and Ashdod. Sennacherib however never breached the city. Hezekiah remained on his throne as a vassal ruler. (The campaign is recorded with differences in the Assyrian records and in the biblical Books of Kings).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} preserved blessed sword, now {{located at}} the Royal Armory in Madrid, was given by Pope Eugene IV to King John II of Castile in 1446.

Not all recipients are known; among those whose names have been preserved, {{there were at least}} 12 emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, ten kings of France, seven kings of Poland, and six kings of Spain. Additionally, three or four blessed swords and hats were given to kings of England, two or three to kings of Scots, and three each to the kings of Hungary and Portugal.

25|$|The Early Dynastic period (abbreviated ED {{period or}} ED) is an archaeological culture in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) that is {{generally}} dated to c. 2900–2350 BC. It {{was preceded by}} the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods, and saw the invention of writing {{and the formation of}} the first <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>states.</b> The ED itself was characterized by the existence of multiple city-states: small states with a relatively simple structure that developed and solidified over time. This development ultimately led to the unification of much of Mesopotamia under the rule of Sargon, the first monarch of the Akkadian Empire. Despite this political fragmentation, the ED city-states shared a relatively homogeneous material culture. Sumerian cities like Uruk, Ur, Lagash, Umma and Nippur, located in Lower Mesopotamia, were very powerful and influential. To the north and west stretched states centered on cities such as Kish, Mari, Nagar and Ebla.|$|E
