25|$|Three {{different}} printings of Pius V's Roman Missal, {{with minor}} variations, appeared in 1570, a folio and a quarto edition in Rome and a folio edition in Venice. A reproduction {{of what is}} considered to be the earliest, referred to therefore as the editio princeps, was produced in 1998. In the course of the printing of the editio princeps, some <b>corrections</b> were made <b>by</b> <b>pasting</b> revised texts <b>over</b> parts of the already printed pages. There were several printings again in the following year 1571, with various corrections of the text.|$|R
50|$|Both councils were {{dissolved}} on 31 December 1999 as planned. Within days of {{the dissolution}} of the Urban Council, its distinctive symbol was systematically removed from public sight, such as <b>by</b> <b>pasting</b> <b>over</b> it with paper on all litter bins and information boards. Shortly afterwards, all the litter bins were themselves discarded, replaced by a similar design, but in green rather than purple. The duties of the councils were taken up by two newly created government departments: the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera Tom and Jerry {{cartoons}} {{began to}} appear on television in heavily edited versions. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two-Shoes and remove her <b>by</b> <b>pasting</b> <b>over</b> the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat White Irish woman; occasionally, as in Saturday Evening Puss, a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by June Foray. However, recent telecasts on Cartoon Network and Boomerang retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by Thea Vidale to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks. The standard Tom and Jerry opening titles were removed as well. Instead of the roaring MGM Lion sequence, an opening sequence featuring different clips of the cartoons was used instead. The title cards were also changed. A pink title card with the name written in white font was used instead.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} and cost effective process for edge isolation of silicon solar cells by strongly local deposition of etching paste isishape SolarEtch® SiD is presented. The deposition of the paste {{was carried out}} by deposition technique being free of contact to substrate, namely dispensing. Basic deposition parameters were figured out and later on refined by design of experiment applying elaborated sub-design. In order to evaluate isolation properties of the new process, experimental trials focusing on process step of edge isolation of standard solar cells were conducted by applying different deposition conditions. For this purpose, experimental trials were sub-divided into two phases: firstly, evaluation of new concept and secondly, its validation by applying industrial conditions of mass production. Conventionally isolated wafers, e. g. by laser scribing, were taken as reference. Comparison of paste-isolated batches with reference batches provided clear evidences for improved cell performances after isolation <b>by</b> etching <b>paste</b> <b>over</b> reference batches. The main beneficial factor for improving solar cell’s performances was identified to originate from increased values of JSC. Isolation process <b>by</b> <b>paste</b> was supplemented <b>by</b> ES&H considerations which provided evidence for environmentally friendly process conduction being superior to single side etching...|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s {{there was}} a great demand in Germany for jazz music, {{especially}} swing (which included elements of the big band sound). However, such African and American influences were viewed as counter to goals of German racial purity; by 1935 they were outlawed, and the Nazis informally labeled it as Negermusik. An underground jazz scene, however, persisted in Berlin. Here bandleader Lutz Templin and drummer Fritz Brocksieper brought together key swing figures of the late 1930s, including singer Karl Schwedler ("Charlie"), clarinetist Kurt Abraham and trombone player Willy Berking. They escaped notice <b>by</b> <b>pasting</b> pro-German lyrics <b>over</b> sheet music and using instruments like harpsichords for boogie-woogie rhythms.|$|R
40|$|Support has {{increased}} for employing an ecological {{rather than a}} sequential model {{for the assessment of}} behavior change in applied settings. A major impetus for this change has been increased reports of simultaneous changes in nontreated behaviors following the application of interventions to a single response. The purpose of the present investigation was twofold. First, an integrative model for concomitant behavior change was developed based upon: (a) the functional equivalence of behavior; (b) the discriminative properties of reward; and (c) the nature of responding under concurrent schedules of reinforcement. Second, this model was put to empirical test in a simplified behavior-environment setting to determine the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictive validity. ^ Each day for 15 minutes during morning free play, four preschool-age subjects engaged in two activities. During the first five minutes of the experimental period, subjects were asked to place either checkers or letters into two paper bags that were provided. During the final ten minutes of the experimental period, subjects were allowed to work on design sheets composed of various geometric shapes of standard size either <b>by</b> <b>pasting</b> <b>over</b> the matching shape, or by coloring the shapes with crayons. ^ Following baseline, two forms of reward were made available to the subjects under identical and concurrent schedules. Half of the subjects received additional information during training about the discriminative properties of withholding reward for the target response. After concurrent schedule training, reward for collecting letters only was withheld for all subjects and changes in frequencies of the other three response alternatives were monitored. ^ Results of the present investigation provided partial support for the hypotheses under investigation. Specifically, collateral changes occurred in the behavior that was functionally equivalent to the target response while inverse changes occurred in behaviors which were functionally different from the targeted response for the group that received additional information during training. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for a systems level approach to behavioral intervention. ...|$|R
6000|$|Fakarava {{was chosen}} to be the seat of Government from {{nautical}} considerations only. It is eccentrically situate; the productions, even for a low island, poor; the population neither many nor--for Low Islanders--industrious. But the lagoon has two good passages, one to leeward, one to windward, so that in all states of the wind it can be left and entered, and this advantage, for a government of scattered islands, was decisive. A pier of coral, landing-stairs, a harbour light upon a staff and pillar, and two spacious Government bungalows in a handsome fence, give to {{the northern end of}} Rotoava a great air of consequence. This is confirmed on the one hand by an empty prison, on the other <b>by</b> a gendarmerie <b>pasted</b> <b>over</b> with handbills in Tahitian, land-law notices from Papeete, and republican sentiments from Paris, signed (a little after date) [...] "Jules Grévy, Perihidente."
