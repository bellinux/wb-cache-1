25|$|Birefringence can be {{observed}} in amyloid plaques such as are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients when stained with a dye such as <b>Congo</b> <b>Red.</b> Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take on a beta-pleated sheet conformation. <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> dye intercalates between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{is used in}} a chemical test {{for the detection of}} aldehydes in combination with ferric chloride. In this test a few drops of aldehyde containing specimen is dissolved in ethanol, the sulfonamide is added together with some sodium hydroxide solution and then the solution is acidified to <b>Congo</b> <b>red.</b> An added drop of ferric chloride will turn the solution an intense red when aldehyde is present. The sulfonamide can be prepared by reaction of hydroxylamine and benzenesulfonyl chloride in ethanol with potassium metal.|$|E
2500|$|The UN-operated World Food Program began {{delivering}} {{hundreds of}} tons of food to the Congo on November 14, along with medical supplies and water purification kits. <b>Congo</b> <b>Red</b> Cross Secretary-General Jacques Katshitshi reported the situation as extremely impoverished, with [...] "Displaced people [...] in extremely difficult conditions" [...] and [...] "a lack of food and water, and [...] hygiene conditions." [...] He stated that cases of malnutrition had been reported even within UN refugee camps. The rations were said to cover approximately 50,000 people, providing them with one-month rations consisting of maize meal, peas, cooking oil and salt. The main obstacle to getting food to displaced persons was stated to be the upheaval in the region.|$|E
50|$|<b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> is {{an organic}} compound, the {{sodium salt of}} 3,3′-(1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diyl)bis(4-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. It is an azo dye. <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> is water-soluble, {{yielding}} a red colloidal solution; its solubility is greater in organic solvents. However, the use of <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> has long been abandoned, primarily because of its carcinogenic properties.|$|E
50|$|In {{histology}} and microscopy, <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> is {{used for}} staining in amyloidosis, and for amyloid in the cell walls of plants and fungi, and for the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Apple-green birefringence of <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> stained preparations under polarized light {{is indicative of the}} presence of amyloid fibrils. Additionally, <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> {{is used for}} the diagnostics of the Shigella flexneri serotype 2a, where the dye binds the bacterium's unique lipopolysaccharide structure.Furthermore, <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> may also be used to induce expression of the type III secretion system of Shigella flexneri, bringing about the secretion of IpaB and IpaC, which form translocation pores within host cell membrane, allowing effector proteins to pass through and alter the host cell's biochemistry.|$|E

50|$|Due to a {{color change}} from blue to red at pH 3.0-5.2, <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> {{can be used}} as a pH indicator. Since this color change is an {{approximate}} inverse of that of litmus, it can be used with litmus paper in a simple parlor trick: add a drop or two of <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> to both an acid solution and a base solution. Dipping red litmus paper in the red solution will turn it blue, while dipping blue litmus paper in the blue solution will turn it red. This property gives <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> a metachromatic property as a dye, both in strongly acidic solutions and with strongly acidophilic tissue.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> has a {{propensity}} to aggregate in aqueous and organic solutions. The proposed mechanisms suggest hydrophobic {{interactions between the}} aromatic rings of the dye molecules, leading to a pi-pi stacking phenomenon. Although these aggregates are present under various sizes and shapes, the [...] "ribbon-like micelles" [...] of a few molecules {{seem to be the}} predominant form (even if the [...] "micelle" [...] term is not an entirely appropriate name for it). This aggregation phenomenon is more prevalent in high <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> concentrations, at high salinity and/or low pH.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{clinical}} setting, amyloid diseases are typically identified by {{a change in}} the fluorescence intensity of planar aromatic dyes such as thioflavin T, <b>congo</b> <b>red</b> or NIAD-4. [...] In general, this is attributed to the environmental change, as these dyes intercalate between beta-strands to confine their structure. <b>Congo</b> <b>Red</b> positivity remains the gold standard for diagnosis of amyloidosis. In general, binding of <b>Congo</b> <b>Red</b> to amyloid plaques produces a typical apple-green birefringence when viewed under cross-polarized light. To avoid nonspecific staining, other histology stains, such as the hematoxylin and eosin stain, are used to quench the dyes' activity in other places such as the nucleus, where the dye might bind. Modern antibody technology and immunohistochemistry has made specific staining easier, but often this can cause trouble because epitopes can be concealed in the amyloid fold; in general, an amyloid protein structure is a different conformation from the one that the antibody recognizes.|$|E
5000|$|Maneval's capsule stain: {{the capsule}} {{appears as a}} clear halo between the pink-stained {{bacterium}} and the bluish-grey stained background. The background stain is the acidic stain <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> (which changes color to bluish-grey due to the pH), and the pink stain is acid fuschin.|$|E
5000|$|Senile plaques {{are visible}} in light {{microscopy}} using the staining techniques of silver, <b>Congo</b> <b>red,</b> Thioflavin, cresyl violet, and PAS-reaction. Plaque deposits are also visible through fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy. [...] Bielschowsky silver staining {{was found to}} be the least efficient means of visualizing senile plaques whereas Campbell and Gallyas silver staining techniques showed improved identification and accuracy. Using <b>Congo</b> <b>red,</b> only one-fourth of senile plaques present were noticeably stained. Senile plaques may also be visualized with an immunostain directed against beta amyloid. The primary problem with the above staining methods is that sections of the neural tissue must be excised from the brain in order to accurately identify senile plaques. This is problematic because removing neural tissue can be as detrimental as the actual plaques themselves.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of {{amyloidosis}} requires tissue biopsy. The Biopsy is {{assessed for}} evidence of characteristic amyloid deposits. The tissue is treated with various stains. The most useful stain in the diagnosis of amyloid is <b>Congo</b> <b>red,</b> which, combined with polarized light, makes the amyloid proteins appear apple-green on microscopy. Also, thioflavin T stain may be used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1883 by Paul Böttiger, {{who had been}} employd at Friedrich Bayer Company in Elberfeld, Germany. He was looking for textile dyes that did not require a mordant step. The company {{was not interested in}} this bright red color, so he filed the patent under his own name and sold it to the AGFA company of Berlin. AGFA marketed the dye under the name [...] "Congo red", a catchy name in Germany {{at the time of the}} 1884 Berlin West Africa Conference, an important event in the Colonisation of Africa. The dye was a major commercial success for AGFA. In the following years, for the same reason, other dyes were marketed using the [...] "Congo" [...] name: Congo rubine, Congo corinth, brilliant Congo, Congo orange, Congo brown, and Congo blue. [...] Once of economic significance, <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> has been fallen into disuse as have all benzidine-derived dyes, owing to their carcinogenic activity.|$|E
5000|$|If renal {{amyloidosis}} is diagnosed, antibody or proteomic {{methods are}} used to type amyloidosis. [...] AL amyloidosis {{is the most common}} form of amyloidosis, accounting for 85% of total cases, and can be tested by taking a blood sample. If the patient tests negative for AL, a <b>Congo</b> <b>Red</b> staining of the kidney biopsy will be done to determine if the patient has ALect2.|$|E
50|$|The {{sulfonic}} acid derivatives of 1-naphthylamine {{are used for}} the preparation of azo dye, these dyes possessing the important property of dyeing unmordanted cotton. The most important is naphthionic acid, 1-aminonaphthalene-4-{{sulfonic acid}}, produced by heating 1-naphthylamine and sulfuric acid to 170-180 °C with about 3% of crystallized oxalic acid. It forms small needles, very sparingly soluble in water. Upon treatment with the bis(diazonium) derivative of benzidine, 1-aminonaphthalene-4-sulfonic acid gives <b>Congo</b> <b>red.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} is suspected in an elderly person, especially male, presenting with symptoms {{of heart failure}} such as shortness of breath or swollen legs, and or disease of the electrical system of the heart with ensuing slow heart rate, dizziness or fainting spells. The diagnosis is confirmed {{on the basis of}} a biopsy, which can be treated with a special stain called <b>Congo</b> <b>Red</b> that will be positive in this condition, and immunohistochemistry.|$|E
5000|$|The classical, histopathological {{definition}} of amyloid is an extracellular, proteinaceous deposit exhibiting beta sheet structure. Common to most cross-beta-type structures, in general, they are identified by apple-green birefringence when stained with <b>congo</b> <b>red</b> and seen under polarized light. These deposits often recruit various sugars and other components such as Serum Amyloid P component, resulting in complex, and sometimes inhomogeneous structures. Recently this definition {{has come into}} question as some classic, amyloid species have been observed in distinctly intracellular locations.|$|E
5000|$|Reactive stains undergo an {{observable}} change due to {{a chemical}} process related to {{the function of the}} gastrointestinal tract. <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> is used as a test for achlorhydria in the stomach, to test adequacy of vagotomy ( [...] post adequate vagotomy, gastric acid secretion is abolished) and to detect presence of ectopic gastric tissue, as it changes colour from red to black at a pH less than 3. Should acid not be present in the stomach, it would remain red.|$|E
50|$|Conversion of {{benzidine}} to the bis(diazonium) salt {{was once}} an integral step {{in the preparation of}} direct dyes (requiring no mordant). Treatment of this bis(diazonium) salt with 1-aminonaphthalene-4-sulfonic acid gives the once popular <b>congo</b> <b>red</b> dye. In the past, benzidine was used to test for blood. An enzyme in blood causes the oxidation of benzidine to a distinctively blue-coloured derivative. The test for cyanide relies on similar reactivity. Such applications have largely been replaced by methods using phenolphthalein/hydrogen peroxide and luminol.|$|E
50|$|Contact of {{the needle}} with a host cell {{triggers}} the T3SS to start secreting; not much is known about this trigger mechanism (see below). Secretion can also be induced by lowering the concentration of calcium ions in the growth medium (for Yersinia and Pseudomonas; done by adding a chelator such as EDTA or EGTA) and by adding the aromatic dye <b>Congo</b> <b>red</b> to the growth medium (for Shigella), for instance. These methods and other are used in laboratories to artificially induce type III secretion.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{is used in}} a chemical test {{for the detection of}} aldehydes in combination with ferric chloride. In this test a few drops of aldehyde containing specimen is dissolved in ethanol, the sulfonamide is added together with some sodium hydroxide solution and then the solution is acidified to <b>Congo</b> <b>red.</b> An added drop of ferric chloride will turn the solution an intense red when aldehyde is present. The sulfonamide can be prepared by reaction of hydroxylamine and benzenesulfonyl chloride in ethanol with potassium metal.|$|E
50|$|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), {{also known}} as congophilic angiopathy, {{is a form of}} angiopathy in which amyloid {{deposits}} form in the walls of the blood vessels of the central nervous system. The term congophilic is used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after application of a special stain called <b>Congo</b> <b>red.</b> The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis.|$|E
50|$|Isosbestic {{points are}} also used in {{clinical}} chemistry, as a quality assurance method, to verify the accuracy in the wavelength of a spectrophotometer. This is done by measuring the spectra of a standard substance at two different pH conditions (above and below the pKa of the substance). The standards used include potassium dichromate (isosbestic points at 339 and 445 nm), bromothymol blue (325 and 498 nm) and <b>congo</b> <b>red</b> (541 nm). The wavelength of the isosbestic point determined {{does not depend on}} the concentration of the substance used, and so it becomes a very reliable reference.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} other {{staining}} techniques {{that have been used}} to selectively stain cells and cellular components. One of these techniques involves marking peripheral tumors or surgical margins, in which a certain color of dye is applied to the posterior border of a sample, another to the anterior, etc., so that one can identify the location of a tumor or other pathology within a specimen. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include safranin, Oil Red O, <b>Congo</b> <b>red,</b> Fast green FCF, silver salts, and numerous natural and artificial dyes that usually originated from the development of dyes for the textile industry.|$|E
