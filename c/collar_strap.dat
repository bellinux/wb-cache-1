The brand was created in 1975 and introduced to American markets in 1980 by Europe Craft Imports. Members Only racer jackets were distinguished by their narrow epaulettes and <b>collar</b> <b>strap</b> and their knitted trim; they were manufactured {{in a wide variety}} of colors. Their advertising tagline was [...] "when you put it on, something happens".|$|E

40|$|Using a Kastle‐Meyer (KM) technique, the {{following}} equipment from the emergency departments of six UK hospitals (four trusts) and three regional ambulance services was tested for blood contamination: extrication (“spinal”) boards, cervical <b>collars,</b> <b>straps,</b> box splints, head blocks, and headboards. Only equipment ready for patient use was tested. Over half of trauma equipment (57 %) {{tested positive for}} blood, including 15 % of equipment that was visibly stained with blood. There have been no recorded cases of infection from contaminated trauma equipment but our study has identified the potential risk. Disposable covers for boards, disposable straps, and disposable radiolucent head blocks which are currently available provide a solution but have resource implication...|$|R
50|$|A coat is {{a garment}} worn by any gender, for warmth or fashion. Coats {{typically}} have long sleeves and are open down the front, closing {{by means of}} buttons, zippers, hook-and-loop fasteners, toggles, a belt, {{or a combination of}} some of these. Other possible features include <b>collars,</b> shoulder <b>straps</b> and hoods.Persians were the first people who made coats.|$|R
50|$|Type I - {{the initial}} pattern {{introduced}} in 1981-1982. The <b>collar</b> tabs, shoulder <b>straps</b> and arm patches {{were the same}} grass green ones as worn on the khaki uniforms.|$|R
50|$|Type II - Worn by {{both the}} KGB and MVD troops (RSN, Osnaz, ChOn and ODON). This design is closely based on the {{airborne}} Afghanka to include hidden button and subdued <b>collar</b> tabs, shoulder <b>straps</b> and arm patches.|$|R
6000|$|To win him {{became a}} problem. Irvine liked problems. He had a metal plate made, on which was stamped: [...] "Return to Walt Irvine, Glen Ellen, Sonoma County, California." [...] This was riveted to a <b>collar</b> and <b>strapped</b> about the dog's neck. Then he was turned loose, and {{promptly}} He disappeared. A day later came a telegram from Mendocino County. In twenty hours {{he had made}} over a hundred miles to the north, and was still going when captured.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 a more {{elaborate}} full dress was adopted in [...] "Atholl Grey" [...] (a light grey with slightly violet tint). Tunic and overalls {{were in this}} distinctive colour, with <b>collars,</b> shoulder <b>straps,</b> piping and trouser stripes in yellow. The slouch hat continued to be worn, with black cock's tail feathers. This uniform was worn by all ranks for ceremonial and church parades, plus walking out dress for other ranks, until the outbreak of war in 1914. There were also special uniforms for pipers, and for optional mess wear by officers and sergeants.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the actual}} design would vary {{slightly}} {{depending on the}} manufacturer, and even among contracts within a single manufacturer, all A-2 jackets had several distinguishing characteristics: a snap-flap patch pocket on either side {{that does not have}} hand warmer compartments (hands in pockets were considered unfit for a military bearing), a shirt-style snap-down <b>collar,</b> shoulder <b>straps</b> (or Epaulets), knit cuffs and waistband, a back constructed from a single piece of leather to limit stress on the garment, and a lightweight silk or cotton inner lining with a leather hang strap (not a loop) and military spec tag attached just below the back collar.|$|R
50|$|The officer's service dress {{consisted}} of a jacket with turned <b>collar</b> and shoulder <b>straps.</b> Over knickerbockers hung a long khaki shirt, and other Indian ranks wore a kurta. They wore regimental buttons, shoulder straps, badges and stripes. The infantry in the Indian army pre-1914 wore a bandolier, and a brown leather belt reminiscent of the British Army pre-1908 webbing issue. They carried a Lee Enfield rifle and short bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|The Richmond Depot Type I {{was issued}} late in 1861 or the {{beginning}} of 1862. The Richmond Depot Type I, was a jacket with a six piece body and two piece sleeves, with an eight or nine button front, shoulder straps and probably belt loops. There were generally two buttons on the cuffs. The lining was probably a cotton osnaburg. The distinctive point about the first pattern jacket and the feature that distinguished it from the Type II, {{was that it was}} trimmed on the <b>collar,</b> shoulder <b>straps</b> and cuffs with either tape or piping-which appears to be usually dark colored, 1/4" [...] inch tape, or 1/8" [...] piping. Today, there are no surviving Type I jackets, but based on photographs, these details can be deduced.|$|R
5000|$|Infantry uniforms had red facings on tunic <b>collars,</b> {{shoulder}} <b>straps</b> and trouser stripes. Line infantry had yellow {{bands and}} piping on their caps while the infantry of the Imperial Guard were distinguished by red. Trouser seams for both {{branches of the}} infantry had wide red stripes. Artillery had yellow facings on their dark blue uniforms. The branch colour for engineers was dark brown, green for medical and light blue for transport units. Finance, administration and other support services had white facings.A dark blue shako (red for Imperial Guard units) with a short white plume was worn for full dress. The ordinary duty and active service headdress was however a form of peaked cap with a narrow crown, somewhat resembling the French kepi of the period.|$|R
50|$|The M40 uniform was {{the first}} design change in the {{standard}} army uniform. It differed from the M36 only in the substitution of feldgrau for the bottle green <b>collar</b> and shoulder <b>straps,</b> which began to be phased out in 1938/39, though most combat examples show this variation appearing in 1940, hence the unofficial M40 pattern. The troops liked the older green collars, and M40 (and later) tunics modified with salvaged M36 collars or bottle-green collar overlays are not uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|With the IWRG {{version of}} Carta Brava Jr. rising up the ranks the IWL version of Carta Brava Jr. made an {{appearance}} during an IWRG show, {{making it clear}} that there were indeed two versions of the character active, claiming that he was the true Carta Brava Jr. since he used the name first. The tension, storyline or real, between the brothers led to a prolonged storyline between the two. The two faced off on several occasions in IWL, including a [...] "Bull Terrier" [...] match, where both wrestlers are chained together with dog <b>collars</b> <b>strapped</b> around their necks. The IWL version of Carta Brava Jr. won the match in question. The storyline between the two did not lead to a Lucha de Apuestas, or mask vs. mask match between the two Carta Brava, Jrs. On March 15, 2013 at IWRG's 2012 Rebelión de los Juniors event, Carta Brava Jr. was one of 10 wrestlers fighting for a match against the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship but was eliminated by tournament winner Bestia 666. IWRG's annual Guerra del Golfo Carta Brava Jr. survived a steel cage match without having to put his mask in the line as he climbed out of the cage. He successfully defended the Lightweight Championship against Chicano as part of IWRG's Caravan de Campeones event. His next defense against Chicano was less successful as Carta Brava Jr. lost the championship. He was one of 10 wrestlers, including the other Carta Brava Jr. to put their mask or championship on the line in a steel cage match. The match ended with El Ángel winning the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Oficial Fierro while both Carta Brava, Jrs. escaped the cage with their masks. Weeks later he was involved in another multi-man steel cage match at the 2012 El Castillo del Terror event, but managed to leave the cage before the final two wrestlers were forced to fight each other.|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular <b>collar</b> (eccentric <b>strap)</b> attached to which an eccentric rod is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or return crank can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|R

He wears a dark shirt {{with an open}} <b>collar.</b> A studded <b>strap</b> hangs across his body from his {{shoulder}} to his waist. His long, parted hair is held behind his head. The large hoop earrings and necklace are clearly seen. His hands lay in his lap. He is looking down to his left. Part of a native dwelling (blurred) is visible in the background...|$|R
5000|$|Possible {{remains of}} the [...] "commodious wharf" [...] noted by Lang in 1868 are found above the {{waterline}} include a single large in situ timber post at 499893E, 7002031N and numerous metal artefacts, including horseshoes, circular <b>collars,</b> heavy <b>straps</b> and bolts) which are eroding {{out of the river}} bank at 499886E, 7002022N. Based on an 1873 historical photograph of this area and aerial photography, the wharf is thought to be located adjacent to these finds. Archaeological investigations at other historic wharf sites in Queensland and interstate have revealed rich archaeological deposits at such locations, {{even in the absence of}} structural remains above the waterline, and also significant archaeological deposits in maritime zones where dredging has occurred. [...] There is therefore good potential for archaeological artefacts that were lost overboard or discarded from ships, or the wharf deck itself, to be situated in the vicinity of the former wharf area and within the riverbed out to the mid-channel of the Caboolture River.|$|R
5000|$|In another {{photograph}} is an unknown {{member of the}} Meherrin Grays. He is seated, wearing a (presumably) cadet-grey jacket and pair trousers, with a dark, probably blue forage cap. His jacket has 9 buttons down the front, solid faced shoulder <b>straps,</b> <b>collar,</b> and belt loops, with French peak styled, solid cuff trim. This is a commutation jacket, not a later Richmond Depot issued jacket. The only identifying feature is the insignia on his cap, which under magnification, {{can be seen in}} three rows as; [...] "I" [...] with [...] "12" [...] underneath, and the last row is barely visible, to ascertain its designation.|$|R
5000|$|Flight {{clothing}} varied widely by {{theater of}} operation {{and type of}} mission. Innovative aviation flight suits, boots, leather helmets, goggles, and gloves were issued as early as 1928 to the Air Corps, {{and at least one}} style, the Type A-3 flight suit, continued in service until 1944. However, A-2 flight jackets, made standard issue on 9 May 1931, became one of the best known symbols of the AAF. Made of seal brown horsehide leather (later supplemented by goatskin) with a beige spun silk lining (cotton after 1939), the jackets featured an officer's stand-up <b>collar,</b> shoulder <b>straps,</b> knit waistbands and cuffs, a zipper closing, and unit insignia. Heavy, sheepskin-lined B-3 and B-6 flight jackets, A-3 winter flying trousers, and B-2 [...] "gunner's" [...] caps, all in seal brown shearling, proved insufficient for the extreme cold temperatures of high altitude missions in unpressurized aircraft, and were supplemented by a variety of one-piece electrically heated flying suits manufactured by General Electric. In addition to men's flight clothing, flight nurses wore specially manufactured women's lightweight and intermediate weight flight jackets and pants. Flight clothing such as the A-2 jacket was not authorized to be worn off the camp or post unless required for flight duty. The same sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill, and wind-resistant poplin field jackets used by Army ground troops, were also worn by AAF troops depending on duty assignment.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: All trauma {{patients}} with a cervical spinal column injury or with a mechanism of injury {{with the potential to}} cause cervical spinal injury should be immobilised until a spinal injury is excluded. Immobilisation of the entire patient with a rigid cervical collar, backboard, head blocks with tape or straps is recommended by the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. However there is insufficient evidence to support these guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects on the range of motion of the addition of a rigid collar to head blocks strapped on a backboard. METHOD: The active range of motion of the cervical spine was determined by computerised digital dual inclinometry, in 10 healthy volunteers with a rigid <b>collar,</b> head blocks <b>strapped</b> on a padded spine board and a combination of both. Maximal opening of the mouth with all types of immobiliser in place was also measured. RESULTS: The addition of a rigid collar to head blocks strapped on a spine board did not result in extra immobilisation of the cervical spine. Opening of the mouth was significantly reduced in {{patients with}} a rigid collar. CONCLUSION: Based on this proof of principle study and other previous evidence of adverse effects of rigid collars, the addition of a rigid collar to head blocks is considered unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Therefore the use of this combination of cervical spine immobilisers must be reconsidered...|$|R
5000|$|When the Nazis came {{to power}} in early 1933 the Reichswehr, the armed forces of the Weimar Republic, were near the end of a two-year project to {{redesign}} the Army Feldbluse (field-blouse). Beginning in that year the new tunic was issued to the Reichsheer and then the rapidly growing Wehrmacht Heer, although minor design changes continued to be made until the appearance of the standardized Heeres Dienstanzug Modell 1936. The M36 tunic still retained the traditional Imperial and Reichswehr uniform color of grey-green [...] "field gray" [...] (feldgrau) wool, but incorporated four front patch pockets with scalloped flaps and pleats (on Reichswehr tunics the lower pockets were internal and angled). The front was closed with five buttons rather than the previous eight, and the <b>collar</b> and shoulder <b>straps</b> were of a dark bottle-green instead of the Reichswehr grey. Compared to the Weimar-era uniforms the skirt of the feldbluse was shorter and the tailoring was more form-fitting due to Germany's adoption of mechanized warfare: soldiers now spent much time in the confined space of a vehicle and a shorter jacket was less likely to pick up dirt from the seats. It also included an internal suspension system, whereby a soldier could hang an equipment belt on a series of hooks outside of the tunic. These hooks were connected to two straps inside the lining, which spread the weight of equipment without having to use external equipment suspenders. The M36 was produced and issued until {{the very end of the}} war, though successive patterns became predominant.|$|R
5000|$|Men's {{clothing}} was {{the symbol of}} beauty at the time. This attire includes a shirt, tëlinat which were long briefs, a scarf and tirqe. There were differences among the clothing of adults, based on their economical standing. In the men clothing framework, the groom's attire was the most symbolic one. The costume is built upon the symbolic meaning of starting a new phase of life. Men of Podgur used to wear white semi-spherical plis. Along with it {{there was also a}} scarf made of white fabric which consisted of a few horizontal shokë of different colors. This scarf was circled around plis and covered a part of their head and ears. Scarfs were worn by men of older age, around their forties. Men's shirts were called [...] "chestnut shirts" [...] because they were made of horizontal shokë of chestnut color. [...] "Chestnut shirts" [...] are rarely seen today, except in mountain regions. Blazers were the items worn over shirts. The part among the sleeves, the collar and arms contained of a black stripe. The vest or xhamadani made of soutane was wide sleeved and reached the waist in length and had no collar. It was buttoned up with a clasp. The vest was double-breasted, and it was of black color. In cold weather, they used to wear a type of blazer called mitani and was made of soutane material. It was randomly worn over the vest or xhamadani. It had long sleeves, but no <b>collar.</b> The black <b>strap</b> covered the parts along the sleeves, around the neck and along the elbows. Mitani had an opening from the armpits to the elbows, and these openings were used to hold mitani freely. On the left part, a small pocket was sewn where men used to keep their cigars. Mitani was also worn by youngsters, but it was simpler than the mitani of men. Among the traditional clothing of Podgur's men, xhurdia which is a type of clothing worn by young boys is mostly known and symbolizes pride. It was made of soutane and tailors were usually the ones who made it. It had long and tight sleeves, open-chested, waist-length, and had a loose part at the back. Besides xhurdia there is also japanxhija which was a clothing of shepherds. However, it was also worn by others in cases of bad weather or long journeys. During nighttime, it was also used as a type of cover. It was made of white soutane along with black stripes, and it was also sleeveless and foot-length whereas its width depended on the length, taking form into a cone-shaped model. Along the belt the red shokë was worn which was older than the colorful shokë. Its length had to be long enough to be wrapped around the waist 5 times. Tëlinat or the long briefs were made of linen, from which their name originates. Later on these long briefs were also made of fabric using a loom. The edges were embroidered and were 20 cm wide. During summer time men used to wear tëlina along with a shirt which was called the shirt of tire. Shokë was tied around the waist, making the shirt resemble a kilt. Tirqe were made of soutane, which varied in quality based on the amount of cord it contained. Tirqe of high quality contained 20 threads of cord. Whereas, the one ones with lower quality had 2-3 threads of cord. The economical status determined which ones they wore. Nevertheless, traditionally white tirqe with black cords were worn in Podgur. Black tirqe were seldom worn by young boys but they were considered infamous because they were worn during the night in order not to attract attention. The socks that they wore were made of sheep wool and were from the toe gore to the heel and sometimes knee -length. Some people used to wear a type of short socks called meste over the previous ones. They were made of the wool and skin of bull, whereas the moccasins were made of sheep skin. After The Second World War, moccasins were made up of threads of different ties and cotton. Instead of opinga they were called yrnek. Men used to wear a lot of accessories at the time, such as rings, qystek të sahatit or otherwise known as pocket watches, etc. Weapons may also be considered as a part of men's accessory, and the revolver was the most common. Simplicity is what characterizes the attire of old men. Their most important item of {{clothing was}} Goxhufi, which was type of a vest and it was made of lamb skin. It had a sleeveless design and sometimes was knee length. They were reversible according to the climate.|$|R
