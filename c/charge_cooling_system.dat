While this was not as effective, it did increase boost without the complexity of the additional tanking and plumbing. Additionally, many of the late-war engines also included a system for high-altitude boost, GM-1, which was intended to add oxygen to the fuel/air mix by injecting nitrous oxide into the supercharger instead of employing higher boost levels - the Jumo 213E inverted V12 on the Ta 152H could [...] "sprint" [...] with both boost systems engaged to airspeeds of well over 560 km/h at low altitudes.|$|E

Published reports estimate that the average life of an aluminium <b>charge</b> air <b>cooler</b> is currently only about 3,500 hours. Aluminium is near its upper technological limit to accommodate higher temperatures and thermal stress levels because the tensile strength of the metal declines rapidly at 150°C and repetitive thermal cycling between 150°C and 200°C substantially weakens it. Thermal cycling creates weak spots in aluminium tubes, which in turn causes charge air coolers to fail prematurely. A potential option is to install stainless steel precoolers in aluminium charge air coolers, but limited space and the complexity of this solution is a hampering factor for this option.|$|R

To date charge air temperature control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient <b>charge</b> <b>cooling</b> need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the charge temperature. Air Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable <b>charge</b> air <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> which will deliver charge air at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range.

District <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is widely used but its performance is rarely reported. The system performance compared with the individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> determines its future application. Performance assessment of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> is conducted by comparing with individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in subtropical areas. Characteristics of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized after quantitative energy performance analysis. Measures to handle the additional peak electricity load due to developing a new area and using district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are assessed. Application of ice storage systems in the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated under different tariffs and design strategies. The performance of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> integrated with PHES is analyzed. The operation costs of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> with and without combined cooling, heating and power system are compared. Comments and suggestions are summarized for the application of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in the subtropical area. Information or data used in the system design at planning and design stages are often very different from that when the system is in operation. Such difference is taken as uncertainty. Uncertainty exists widely in the design process of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> It will affect the design options but is not sufficiently investigated yet. To ensure that the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> perform well in operation eventually, uncertainty-based optimal design methods are proposed. The performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the proposed methods is compared with that using the conventional design method. An optimal design method concerning uncertainty is developed based on mini-max regret theory. It achieves the optimal design considering uncertainty. Without the needs of probability distribution assumptions and introducing new models, this method can determine the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> very effectively. By comparing the regrets of each design option, the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be identified, which is associated with the minimum maximum regret. The method is demonstrated {{in the design of the}} chiller plant and chilled water system of a building. By quantifying the uncertainty at planning and design stages, an uncertainty-based optimal design method is proposed and its application steps are introduced. Uncertainties in the outdoor weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are concerned. Strategies to deal with the variables containing uncertainties are introduced. Based on the peak cooling load distribution, the capacity of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be determined with quantified risks. Based on the distribution of the annual energy consumption or cost, the configuration of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be selected with quantified confidence. The uncertainty-based optimal method is implemented in a district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and an individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in Hong Kong respectively. By using the uncertainty-based optimal design method, stake holders can make decisions with quantified confidence. The components or sub-systems in a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> cannot be always available due to failures or maintenance. A robust optimal design method considering both uncertainty and reliability is proposed. The robust optimal design can maintain the good performance under uncertainty or failures of components in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Steps to realize the robust optimal design method are presented. The availability risk cost is introduced to account for the losses caused by the unmet cooling load. By taking the total annual cost including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost as the objective, the robust optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be achieved. The proposed method is demonstrated in both the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the robust optimal design is compared with that using the conventional design method, uncertainty-based design method and reliability-based design method. The impacts of uncertainty on the design of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are compared. The influential factors for cooling loads of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are identified. Similarities and differences are summarized. Then the impacts of both uncertainty and reliability on the design of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are also assessed and compared.

Investigation of direct injection <b>charge</b> <b>cooling</b> effects is indispensable {{in design and}} development of new combustion systems for Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines. The <b>charge</b> <b>cooling</b> can be utilized to increase engine volumetric efficiency or compression ratio.

The main purpose of this work was to develop an experimental setup for quantitative measurements of <b>charge</b> <b>cooling</b> during fuel injection process inside the combustion chamber of a GDI engine with optical access. For this purpose a tracer-based two-line Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique was implemented for the measurements.

The thermometry technique was evaluated by measurements of average in-cylinder charge temperature during compression stroke for both motoring and firing cycles and comparing the results with temperature values calculated from in-cylinder pressure data assuming a polytropic compression.

Energy analysis has been carried out for the proposed <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> The COP of the proposed <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is defined as the cooling effect by the mass rate of water evaporated in the system divided by the amount of energ...|$|R
