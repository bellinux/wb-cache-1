40|$|The <b>calcareous</b> <b>alabaster</b> {{was used}} to carry out {{historical}} and archaeological artifacts. Its diffusion was very increased in imperial age when quarries of Circeo mountain exploitation began. Coloured litotype exploitated more {{times in the past}} were studied, in fact archaeologies have found evidences in many roman remains of Giove Anxur temple near Terracina and in some covering slabs and columns in monumental churches of XVI-XVIII centuries. The 2 quarries are near San Felice Circeo town (“Guardi D’Orlando – Monticchio and “La Batteria”); “cotognino” alabaster and “a giaccione” alabaster was carried out from these 2 sites, these 2 litotypes was considered very valuable some years ago. Alabaster formation of “Monticchio” ore is made up from calcareous water circulation into the jointing of Circeo liassic limestones, it is constituted of crystalline stalactitic concretions, sometimes many zones show gradation of colour from honey to intense brown, and it is called “cotognino”. “Giaccion” alabaster take its name to be like ice, in fact it shows colours from white to bright yellow, and is into the liassic fractured limestones. By the light of this thin section analyses, X-ray diffractometry, RI determination, X-ray fluorescence and C, O and Sr isotopic analyses was carried out from each samples. A geologic characterization is defined, considering minero-petrographic, chemical and geochemical features, to solving archaeometric problems about artifacts made up to alabaster lithotypes...|$|E
40|$|The term {{alabaster}} {{is often}} {{applied only to}} compact, translucent gypsum, but sometimes it also denotes a variety of decorative rocks consisting essentially of calcium carbonate. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>alabasters,</b> often petrographically classified as travertines, were quarried in several provinces of the Roman Empire and widely used for architectural elements and small decorative objects. In spite of their considerable importance as ornamental stones, and their wide distribution, very {{little is known about}} their origin, and their positive identification often remains very difficult. This is due to their variability of colour and fabric, also within the same species, and to a lack of specific studies, especially of archaeometric characterisation. Hence our analyses – minero- petrographical (by XRD and OM on thin section) and geochemical (Sr isotopes by mass spectrometry, and chemical quantitative analysis by XRF) – of two important Italian alabasters, those of Iano di Montaione (Florence) and of Castelnuovo dell’Abate (Siena) and of a Tunisian variety/ example/specimen from Djebel Oust (Tunis), and comparison of the results obtained with other alabasters from Egypt, Thyatira (Turkey) and Oran (Algeria), all of which have already been studied and are sometimes very similar macroscopically...|$|R
40|$|<b>Calcareous</b> <b>alabasters</b> {{from several}} {{areas of the}} ancient world have been {{frequently}} used for the manufacture of small precious objects such as vases (alàbastra), statuettes, etc., and for architectural elements. In spite of their importance, alabasters have been seldom studied archaeometrically, so that many problems connected to the accurate identification of many types, especially of those used in Roman times, are still existing. It {{is for this reason that}} we have started a systematic research on two alabasters used by the Romans: that of Thyatira (province of Akhisar, Turkey), and that of Iano di Montaione (Florence, Italy). The first may be easily macroscopically confused with the more famous Egyptian alabaster (alabastro cotognino) that is why we tried to differentiate it by using Sr-isotope determination. The second was for the first time characterised by laboratory analyses (OM, XRD, AA, Sr-isotopes) also to check if it was much used in the Renaissance and Baroque times by comparative analyses on archaeological artefacts. In both cases the more interesting and discriminant analysis resulted that of Sr-isotopes. This allows us to distinguish between the alabaster of Thyatira and the Egyptian alabaster, and to confirm that three aryballoi found in Greek Lydian tombs come from Egyptian quarries (whose values vary from 0. 7070 to 0. 7078), hence, the use of the first limited only to Roman times. The analyses of the alabaster from Iano gave values of Sr varying from 0. 70798 to 0. 70922. They allowed to establish that a slab facing a wall of the Veronese Capitolium came from that locality, thus proving the use of the alabaster from Iano di Montaione in Roman times...|$|R
