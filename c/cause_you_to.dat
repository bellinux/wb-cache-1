500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E

[...] Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq: [...] "God caused Jesus to die for seven hours", while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was Judas, the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility it was a man named Natlianus.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E

When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When Muhammad died Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, [...] "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come upon you." [...] 'Umar was making a sermon to the people saying, [...] "By Allah, he is not dead but has gone to his Lord as Musa ibn Imran went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Musa returned after it was said that he had died. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey wrote [...] "Luxoflux have turned a slightly above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate {{has a knack for}} chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished."

2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
