40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, rapidly switching magnetic fields {{are used to}} spatially encode the signal. The temporal change of these fields induces eddy currents in nearby conducting structures of the scanner. These eddy currents, in turn, generate a secondary magnetic field that opposes and distorts the desired gradient field. Eddy current compensation methods are generally applied assuming that the primary and secondary magnetic field gradients possess similar spatial characteristics in the imaging volume (field matching). In this work an optimization method is used to deform {{the shape of the}} <b>coil</b> <b>support</b> and/or a highly conductive passive shield in order to improve the field matching and reduce the inductive coupling between the gradient coil and the passive shield. Using the residual field after eddy current compensation as the objective function, the <b>coil</b> <b>support</b> and/or conducting surfaces were deformed to obtain passively shielded x- and z-gradient coils with improved field matching and eddy current compensation. Assuming a single frequency, quasi-static simulation, it was demonstrated that the residual field was reduced up to 24 times by reshaping the coil and passive shield surfaces due to the improved field matching. However, using transient analyses we showed {{that in the case of}} the passively shielded x-gradient coil the residual field may only be reduced by five times from a cylindrical coil configuration. A bulge shape is created in the conducting surface as a mechanism of matching the field and at the same time reducing the mutual inductive coupling between the coil and the passive shield. An actively shielded coil with control over the magnetic field produced by the induced current was used as a reference coil that produces the minimal residual field. The actively shielded gradient coil produces minimal residual field for short and long pulses in the transient analyses. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

The plasma minor radius, however, becomes smaller with the pitch parameter, and a higher field is necessary to attain the same plasma performance.

40|$|VDEs), {{the plasma}} acts {{more as a}} voltage source than a current source when {{generating}} halo currents so that by altering {{the resistance of the}} current path it is possible to limit these currents. Although improved understanding of tokamak operation has greatly reduced the likelihood of uncontrolled plasma terminations it is impossible to eliminate such events completely. The halo currents associated with VDEs are of particular concern as these can be a significant fraction of the pre-termination plasma current and produce large forces on plasma facing components. Present extrapolations for likely halo currents in ITER [1] are based on empirical scalings from existing devices. MAST with its spherical geometry and comprehensive set of halo current detectors provides important additional information with which to test halo current models. MAST [2, 3] is equipped with a comprehensive set of halo current detectors, comprising 150 individual detectors. These are divided into four groups (see Fig. 1); full Rogowski coils fitted around all the P 2 /P 3 <b>coil</b> <b>supports</b> and at {{the top and bottom of}} the centre column (CC); arrays of partial Rogowski coils embedded in the P 2 shield to measure radial and toroidal variations in halo currents; bands containing 12 Btor pick-up coils at four heights on the centre column allowing toroidal and vertical variations in halo currents to be determined; and as part of a divertor biasing experiment [4] a number of the lower rib limiters have been soft-earthed through resistors with additional current and voltage diagnostics on the resistors. The magnitude of halo currents and the paths taken through the vessel structure are not only determined by where and how the plasma interacts with the vessel, but also by the plasma properties and the magnetic field structure.

40|$|A {{vertical}} beam loss on the extraction {{elements of the}} K 500 cyclotron has been observed during commissioning of the Coupled Cyclotron Project. The cause {{was found to be}} the misalignment of coils, and the coil shift vertically about 1 mm made a correction. The vertical displacement of a 9. 5 MeV/u Ar beam prior to the correction was roughly 4 mm at a magnetic focusing bar. The effect of coil misalignment seems to be pronounced during beam extraction because the gradient of coil field is high in the extraction region and the magnetic elements employed for radial focusing are misaligned with the coil field. The observed off-center of the Ar beam could also be partly explained by a coherent beam oscillation prior to the extraction if assuming the coil was tilted as the vertical focusing tune approaches one. Balancing of the electromagnetic forces on the <b>coil</b> <b>support</b> links is a usual method of alignment for superconducting coils. In reality a fine adjustment of the coil position may be needed with a beam because readings of the forces on the links could be imprecise indication of the coil position as the coil is supported by the matrix of support links.
