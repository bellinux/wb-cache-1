5|$|Helena {{was devoted}} to nursing, and took the lead at the {{charitable}} organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest that surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses' Association. The RBNA still survives today with Baroness Cox as president. Emily Williamson founded the Gentlewomen's Employment Association in Manchester; one of the projects which <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group was the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses, in Fallowfield, Manchester.|$|E
25|$|A {{week later}} Sydney {{travelled}} across the Tasman to face Wellington Phoenix at Westpac Stadium. Sydney <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> match once again victorious winning 2–0 with goals from Northern Ireland superstar Terry McFlynn and current leading goalscorer for Sydney in 2007/2008 Alex Brosque. This {{kept them in}} 3rd position on the A-League ladder and in good contention for a finals berth. This win also ensured that the Phoenix would not reach the finals.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E
25|$|During his civil {{engineering}} days, Cauchy {{once had been}} briefly in charge of repairing {{a few of the}} Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode was Cauchy's promotion to Baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.|$|E
25|$|At the February council meeting, great {{opposition}} {{was raised to}} the proposed construction of a line along Forest Road at an estimated cost of £13,000, and so the scheme was dropped. One good thing which <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> meeting was the approval for top-covering two trams experimentally, {{at a cost of}} £85 each. Cars 33 and 94 made their appearance on 9 March with Bellamy-type roofs. This type of roof was the idea of C. R. Bellamy, the Manager of Liverpool Corporation Tramways, and consisted of a box-like structure over the main saloon, without covers over the canopies at each end. On the whole they were well received and increased receipts were taken on the cars, with the result that similar modifications to further cars, believed to be four in number, were made.|$|E

25|$|Glazunov soon enjoyed {{international}} acclaim. He had {{a creative}} crisis in 1890–1891. He <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period {{with a new}} maturity. During the 1890s he wrote three symphonies, two string quartets and a ballet. When he was elected director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1905, {{he was at the}} height of his creative powers. His best works from this period are considered his Eighth Symphony and his Violin Concerto. This was also the time of his greatest international acclaim. He conducted the last of the Russian Historical Concerts in Paris on 17 May 1907, and received honorary Doctor of Music degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. There were also cycles of all-Glazunov concerts in Saint Petersburg and Moscow to celebrate his 25th anniversary as a composer.|$|E

At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave him a lot of ideas.

500|$|Hilliard's {{continued}} {{contact with}} Lansing and Blackburn {{led to a}} conversation about the poor state of loudspeakers in movie theaters. The three men shared ideas {{about how best to}} improve existing designs. Hilliard took his plans to MGM's head of sound, Douglas Shearer (brother of Norma Shearer), who decided to fund the effort. Hilliard was made responsible for the concept and design of the project. Lansing Manufacturing was tapped to develop the drive units while Hilliard worked to improve the electronic components. What <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> collaboration was a well-received industry standard loudspeaker system, [...] "The Shearer Horn System for Theatres" [...] (1937), that garnered a technical award [...] "Oscar" [...] for sound from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
500|$|In the fall, Michaels {{joined forces}} with real-life friend Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H), Helmsley's then real life girlfriend Chyna, and Rick Rude to form the stable D-Generation X (DX). Michaels {{continued}} his rivalry with Bret Hart and his reformed Hart Foundation, which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted the group and Canada by engaging in acts such as blowing his nose with and humping the Canadian Flag. Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Hart's idea. Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a championship match at Survivor Series in November 1997 against Hart. Michaels <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> match, dubbed by fans the [...] "Montreal Screwjob", as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Michaels now held both the WWF World Heavyweight and European championship at the same time. Michaels dropped the European Championship to D-Generation X member Hunter Hearst Hemsley in a farcical match.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} stories behind {{the origin of}} the song. Several historians trace [...] "Pittsburgh Town" [...] to the Almanac Singers' 1941 {{national}} tour. According to the liner notes of Pete Seeger's American Industrial Ballads, originally released in 1956, on July 7, 1941, the group recorded fourteen songs for a small record label in New Jersey. The $250 that they were paid was used to purchase a 1932 Buick in which they traveled on their subsequent tour. While stopped in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the group decided to play for steel workers who {{were in the process of}} unionizing. They played two nights of concerts in a steel patch, spending the night there in a cockroach-infested hotel. During the second concert, Woody Guthrie impulsively started to improvise lyrics to the tune of the folk song [...] "Crawdad Hole". The song's entire body <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> jam session. Millard Lampell continued improving and created the second verse of the song from that point.|$|E

500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for FreeSpace 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} FreeSpace series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the FreeSpace franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was to give those outside the game industry {{a chance to look at}} the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to FreeSpace 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the Freespace license, but nothing significant <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wilderness}} {{is situated}} on high desert terrain and {{is associated with}} a volcanic rootless shield. This broad [...] volcanic shield issued lava from a rootless vent. The lava flow dates to about 80,000 years old and comes from a main vent further up the slopes of Newberry Volcano. This main vent was located near Lava Top Butte and the lava that <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> vent travelled through the Arnold Lava Tube System to arrive at the current location of the Badlands. An irregularly-shaped pit crater {{at the top of the}} shield marks the site where lava flowed in all directions to create the Badlands. Lava tubes acted as conduits for the lava in some instances and are evidenced on the surface by tumuli, also known as pressure ridges. Soils in the Badlands were largely formed from ash associated with the eruption of Mount Mazama some 7,700 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Pappy Daily, {{the father}} of band member Mike Daily, decided to record the group for his [...] "D Records" [...] label at a studio in Houston, Texas.

The songs were released to radio stations in Texas and Oklahoma. In 1977, Bill Mabry {{was added to the}} lineup as a fiddle player and the band recorded their second single, which featured the songs [...] "Lonesome Rodeo Cowboy" [...] (later recorded on Strait's 1990 album Livin' It Up) and [...] "That Don’t Change the Way I Feel About You" [...] which was written by Strait. The next year, the band recorded the songs [...] "Right or Wrong," [...] and [...] "Little Liza Jane", which were later included on the 2005 D Records label release Complete D Singles Collection, Vol. 6: The Sounds of Houston, Texas. Strait re-recorded [...] "Right or Wrong" [...] in 1983 for his album Right or Wrong and took it to number one on the country charts.
