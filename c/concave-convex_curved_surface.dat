Hydraulic transfer is generally used for printing on <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> [24, 25]. By floating a printed film on water and pressing a <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> onto the film, uniform printing on the <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> is obtained. Retinal vessels on a <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> are obtained by overlaying patterned PDMS sheets on a <b>curved</b> <b>surface,</b> {{as shown in}} Fig. 5. With this hydraulic transfer process, we can realize the fine microchannel with size of ≃ 10 μm on a <b>curved</b> <b>surface,</b> which is difficult to achieve with conventional fabrication techniques.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{based on}} the idea of profit and loss modification, we present the {{iterative}} non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> to settle a key problem in computer aided geometric design and reverse engineering, that is, constructing the <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> fitting (interpolating) a given ordered point set without solving a linear system. We start with a piece of initial non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> which takes the given point set as its control point set. Then by adjusting its control points gradually with iterative formula, we can get a group of non-uniform B-spline <b>curves</b> (<b>surfaces)</b> with gradually higher precision. In this paper, using modern matrix theory, we strictly prove that the limit <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> of the iteration interpolates the given point set. The non-uniform B-spline <b>curves</b> (<b>surfaces)</b> generated with the iteration have many advantages, such as satisfying the NURBS standard, having explicit expression, gaining locality, and convexity preserving, etc...|$|R

The method of measurement based on laser range finder is a method commonly used in modern industry measurement, which can solve this problem.

We show that, nonetheless, <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be reconstructed {{up to an}} affine ambiguity from their apparent contours viewed from uncaiibrated cameras with unknown linear translations. Furthermore, we show that, even if the reconstruction is nonmetric (non-Euclidean), we can stili extract useful information for many computer vision applications just from the apparent contours. We first show that if the camera motion is linear translation (but arbitrary direction and magnitude), the epipolar geometry can be recovered from the apparent contours without using any optimization process. The extracted epipolar geometry is next used for reconstructing <b>Curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> from the deformations of the apparent contours viewed from uncaiibrated cameras.

It {{is a novel}} generalization of Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces.</b> Firstly, a class of polynomial basis functions with n adjustable shape parameters is present. It is a natural extension to classical Bernstein basis functions. The corresponding Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> the so-called Quasi-Bézier (i. e., Q-Bézier, for short) <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> are also constructed and their properties studied. It {{has been shown that}} the main advantage compared to the ordinary Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces</b> is that after inputting a set of control points and values of newly introduced n shape parameters, the desired <b>curve</b> or <b>surface</b> can be flexibly chosen from a set of <b>curves</b> or <b>surfaces</b> which differ either locally or globally by suitably modifying the values of the shape parameters, when the control polygon is maintained. The Q-Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> inherit the most properties of Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> and can be more approximated to the control polygon. It is visible that the properties of end-points on Q-Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> can be locally controlled by these shape parameters. Some examples are given by figures...|$|R
