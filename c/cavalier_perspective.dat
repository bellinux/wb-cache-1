50|$|The term cabinet {{projection}} (sometimes cabinet perspective) {{stems from}} {{its use in}} illustrations by the furniture industry. Like <b>cavalier</b> <b>perspective,</b> one face of the projected object {{is parallel to the}} viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically 63.4°).

50|$|In {{cavalier}} projection (sometimes <b>cavalier</b> <b>perspective</b> or high view point) {{a point of}} the object is represented by three coordinates, x, y and z. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, x″ and y″. On the flat drawing, two axes, x and z on the figure, are perpendicular and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the dimetric projections, {{although it is not}} an axonometric projection, as the third axis, here y, is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the x″ axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cavalier</b> <b>Perspective</b> has {{previously}} been described as merely a pictorial technique of spatial representation within the history of Chinese painting. It is a common belief that this unique visual system is capable of providing an experience of three-dimensional spatial perception in both representational art and actual space, {{in a manner similar}} to technique of foreshortening and perspective in post-renaissance western art. However, as Chinese ancient artists have a different understanding of geometry and philosophy, it is difficult to either define the origin and nature of the technique itself or to identify which particular visual phenomena it is intended to communicate, when artists transform three-dimensional space into two-dimensional surface information. The thesis begins by presenting an iconological analysis of the Chinese visual representation of space, in order to develop this visual study into a psychological analysis of the perception of three-dimensional form. To redefine <b>Cavalier</b> <b>Perspective,</b> it is necessary to firstly conduct a historical survey based on available visual evidence of both architecture and landscape representation. In both cases, the represented objects are transformed into flattened forms; and a psychological consequence thus appears involving the loss of a sense of depth in vision, which consequently contributes to the psychology of visual perception. To reassemble, and thus reactivate a similar perception in the representation of space, Chinese ancient artists are also believed to have created specific visual schemes to help reconstitute the perception of depth; thus rendering pictorial space perceptible. <b>Cavalier</b> <b>Perspective</b> is seen as just such a perceptual system. Consequently, the theoretical part of the thesis conducts an iconological study by elaborating a hierarchy of form, technique, and scheme in the history of Chinese spatial representation. After that, a theoretical association is formulated between iconology and visual perception, in which visual techniques are identified as potential cues to indicate depth. The translation between visual technique and depth cue appears so compulsive for both modem scholars and ancient artists that, to a certain extent, the progress of the visual arts could be described as the discovery of techniques for presenting depth through purposive patterns of form. Symbolic images are therefore seen to have their concrete formal basis established upon both pictorial idea and, more importantly, the psychology of visual perception. The thesis aspires to challenge CP by means of this formal analysis. Whether it belongs to a simple technique or a sophisticated visual scheme of ancient Chinese artists; the representational space of geometry; the making of visual perception by means of technical implements; and the bodily experience in actual space, are all shown to be indispensible parts of the present research. A concluding case study of the Chinese landscape garden gives a further demonstration that the pictorial ideas and visual techniques that once contributed to the iconological and psychological understanding of Chinese painting have also delivered an idealised form of spatial perception within the garden - where the sense of depth is firstly eliminated, and then artistically reconstituted. In this way, the nature of <b>cavalier</b> <b>perspective</b> will therefore have been explored on two levels - in the form of both spatial representation and bodily perception in actual space.

40|$|This work acquaints {{with the}} program Sam for {{interactive}} computer training of students on the theme "Mutual intersecting of pyramids and prisms in axonometry”. The program containing three modules – teacher, student and autopilot – allows for briefest time to teach and study the whole variety of the tasks on this theme. A classification of the pierce points of the surrounding edges of the one polyhedron with the other one, based on the mutual position of their auxiliary planes, is made. The solutions of the tasks can be traced {{in each of the}} popular axonometric projection (cabinet projection, <b>cavalier</b> <b>perspective,</b> military perspective, increased orthogonal dimetry, increased orthogonal isometry) in their significant stages as well as in each step. Each stage of the solution is accompanied by commentary. The student can manipulate any object of the drawing or can apply on the whole drawing rotation, translation, expansion, shrink, zoom, etc. The student can watch on all sides the rotating 3 D image of the composition of the two intersecting polyhedrons and separate the rotating 3 D image of their common part. The combination of traditional methods of training in descriptive geometry using the program Sam and the classification of the pierce points enable for a thorough, creative and self study of the students. They are instruments through which the students can not only learn in depth material for a short time, but they can prepare creative course projects such as: improvisations on a task or a selection of tasks from known sources and creating original tasks on a given topic. The program also allows to create dynamic geometric drawings...|$|E
40|$|The {{illustrations}} {{created by}} the engineer Auguste Choisy for his principal work, the Histoire de l 2 ̆ 7 architecture of 1899, express a deliberate correspondence between the mode of visual expression and the architectural idea of building. His novel development of the worm 2 ̆ 7 s-eye view axonometric merits scrutiny. This dissertation investigates Choisy 2 ̆ 7 s use of parallel projection in communicating not only his tectonic theory of architecture, but {{the ways in which}} this drawing form came to communicate uniquely the dynamic patterns characterizing nineteenth century French epistemological and architectural discourse. The intellectual content of Choisy 2 ̆ 7 s education, career, scholarship, and teaching of architecture while associated with the pre-eminent technical institutions, the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées, are examined. The dissertation tracks the invention of axonometric projection, detailing its pragmatic genesis in 1820 as isometrical perspective in England to its ultimate theoretical refinements within the fields of mathematics and geometry in Germany and France. The study demarcates the spatial divide in parallel projection between the oblique <b>cavalier</b> <b>perspective</b> and orthogonal axonometric perspective. It proceeds to analyze how Choisy used these forms of parallel projection and exploited the new rotational space of axonometry in his conception of the inside view to document the spatio-tectonic fundaments of vaulted structure in his first illustrated work in 1873, L 2 ̆ 7 art de bâtir chez les Romains. The imagined worm 2 ̆ 7 s-eye view is explored as a critical device that equilibrates the geometric, homogenized object in parallel space via an inhabiting observer. Shifting the examination to the Histoire reveals an abundant use of cavalier perspectives and limited examples of axonometric perspectives; Choisy guides their inherent spatial differences toward divergent theoretical purposes. This dissertation concludes that Choisy 2 ̆ 7 s cavalier perspectives operate comparatively, ultimately structuring an iconic technique through which the built artifact becomes a theoretical proposition, and that axonometric perspectives idealize tectonic space, implicitly positing space as one of the necessary elements in the artful assemblage of architectural form. ...|$|E
