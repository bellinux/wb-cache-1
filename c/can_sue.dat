5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English {{contract}} law and the law of real estate that governs the transfer of rights from one party to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt. In this situation the party who is assigned the debt <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> the debtor despite any contractual agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E
5|$|As Liz Lemon is {{returning}} to studio 6H, the TGS with Tracy Jordan studio, she meets Jack Donaghy returning from Washington. Jack tells her {{that he intends to}} get his old job back and Liz tells him of her upcoming adoption evaluation. When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to work his way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a sexual interest in Jack he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> the drivers.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

25|$|Title {{to the bed}} {{and banks}} of rivers, and the mineral rights therein, {{generally}} passes to states upon their gaining statehood. However, this general doctrine does not apply where a tribe held treaty rights to the bed prior to statehood. Additionally, tribes can gain title to dry lands formerly covered by rivers after a river changes course. The United States <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> on behalf of tribes to gain title to those lands.|$|E
25|$|Part of Title I {{was found}} unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court as it {{pertains}} to states in the case of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the Department of Justice or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> on their behalf.|$|E

500|$|It can {{be argued}} {{that this is not a}} true {{exception}} to the doctrine because once the contract is made the [...] "agent" [...] plays no further part, leaving it as an agreement between two parties. Certain elements of the doctrine of agency have been said to clash with privity, however. In some circumstances the principal <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> the third party even when the agent has not disclosed to the third party that he is acting as an agent to the principal. In this situation, the third party can be sued by somebody that he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|E
500|$|On May 16, 2013, {{choreographer}} Wade Robson alleged on The Today Show that Jackson {{sexually abused}} him for 7 years, beginning when Robson was 7 years old. Robson had previously testified in defence of Jackson at the singer's 2005 child molestation trial. The attorney for Jackson's estate described Robson's claim as [...] "outrageous and pathetic". The {{date for the}} hearing which will determine whether Robson <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> Jackson's estate was scheduled for June 2, 2014. In February 2014, the Internal Revenue Service reported that Jackson's estate owed $702 million, including $505 million in taxes, plus $197 million in penalties after the estate had undervalued Jackson's fortune.|$|E
500|$|Social hosts {{are given}} more {{liability}} protection than licensed businesses in that a private person is generally only {{liable for the}} actions of guests over 21 if their blood alcohol content is above 0.15, and the lawsuit involves drunk driving injuries. As long as a guest is not underage, a social host has no liability for assaults, falls, and other non-DUI injuries. Although most alcohol-related lawsuits involve parties injured by drunk drivers, there have been cases in New Jersey where drunk drivers were able to successfully sue the establishment that served them. [...] Recently, in Voss v. Tranquillino the New Jersey courts held that a drunk driver <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> a bar or restaurant under the [...] "Dram Shop Act" [...] and prevail under the theory that: ...|$|E

50|$|The general rule, {{where such}} {{contracts}} are recognized, {{is that the}} promisee can not specifically enforce the contract if the testator later revokes or supersedes the will making the promised bequest, but <b>can</b> only <b>sue</b> the testator's estate for breach of contract. This protects the testator's very strong freedom to dispose of his property however he sees fit. For example, suppose Joey agrees to execute a will bequeathing his house to Rachel in exchange for services provided by Rachel. If Joey later revokes that will, Rachel can not force Joey's estate to convey the house to her, but <b>can</b> only <b>sue</b> {{for the value of}} the house.|$|R
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract <b>can</b> <b>sue</b> on it".|$|E

2500|$|In marriage, {{conjugal}} {{relations are}} guaranteed {{as a fundamental}} right for a woman, along with food and clothing. This obligation is known as [...] "onah."
