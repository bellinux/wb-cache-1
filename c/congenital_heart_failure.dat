40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} investigation of autoimmune reaction targeted against neirospecific protein antigens {{in patients with}} <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> are presented. It is shown that titer for autoanibodies to these patients’ brain proteins is significantly higher compared with healthy persons. Elevation of titer of these autoantibodies is correlated {{with the ability to}} solve tasks for revealing complex analogies and decrease of life quality. Therefore, worsening of life quality and development of cognitive deficit in patients with cardiovascular diseases might be associated with autoimmune reaction against specific proteins of nervous tissue cells. The results obtained demonstrate that generation of autoantibodies in patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> is linked with the cognitive deficit. One of the most important causes of cognitive decline could be hypoxia state due to surgery intervention. Consequences of hypoxia, in their turn, are accompanied by chronic oxidative stress. Molecular and cell injuries induced by free radicals are known to be the widely spread cause of various pathologies. Further investigations for validation of diagnostic hallmarks for estimation of the origin of progression of the cognitive deficit in patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> are needed.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Congenital heart defects {{occur in}} {{approximately}} {{one percent of}} births every year, which makes it the most frequently occurring congenital defect in patients. The aim of this project was to use two mutant neural crest (NC) mouse models to study the mechanisms underlying <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in utero. The first mouse model was a Pax 3 systemic knockout, which was lethal by mouse gestational day 14, and had appreciably reduced numbers of migratory NC cells. The second mouse model was a Wnt 1 Cre-mediated NC genetic cell ablation model, which was surprisingly viable and survived to birth, despite an apparent lack of migratory NC cells. The resultant data indicated that both mouse models had similar heart structural defects including persistent truncus arteriosus, which was due to fewer or no migratory cardiac NC cells. However, in utero heart function was appreciably perturbed in Pax 3 mutants when {{compared to that of}} the ablated mutant model. The loss of embryonic cardiac function in Pax 3 mutants was directly attributed to a substantial decrease in the activity of the beta-adrenergic pathway. This was {{due to a lack of}} proper specification of trunk NC cells, leading to diminished levels of circulating catecholamine levels in the embryo. To definitively confirm this conclusion, poor cardiac function was successfully restored by pharmacological stimulation of the beta-adrenergic pathway via administration of isoproterenol and forskolin to pregnant dams, which led to embryonic survival of Pax 3 mutants to birth. By comparison of these two mutant mouse models, perturbation in the beta-adrenergic pathway was identified as the underlying mechanism responsible for in utero heart failure and lethality in Pax 3 mutant embryos. The results of this study are expected to be significant in developing future therapeutic targets for <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in prenatal and newborn patients...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 150 ongoing {{clinical}} trials utilizing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to target various genetic diseases, including hemophilia (AAV 2 and AAV 8), <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (AAV 1 and AAV 6), cystic fibrosis (AAV 2), rheumatoid arthritis (AAV 2), and Batten disease (AAVrh. 10). Prior to patient administration, AAV vectors must have their serotype, concentration, purity, and stability confirmed. Here, we report the application of differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) as a good manufacturing practice (GMP) capable of determining the melting temperature (Tm) for AAV serotype identification. This is a simple, rapid, cost effective, and robust method utilizing small amounts of purified AAV capsids (∼ 25  μL of ∼ 1011 particles). AAV 1 - 9 and AAVrh. 10 exhibit specific Tms in buffer formulations commonly used in clinical trials. Notably, AAV 2 and AAV 3, which are the least stable, have varied Tms, whereas AAV 5, the most stable, has a narrow Tm range in the different buffers, respectively. Vector stability was dictated by VP 3 only, specifically, the ratio of basic/acidic amino acids, and was independent of VP 1 and VP 2 content or the genome packaged. Furthermore, stability of recombinant AAVs differing by a single basic or acidic amino acid residue are distinguishable.

40|$|Background—Many {{patients}} with {{congenital heart disease}} develop right ventricular (RV) failure due to anatomy and prior therapy. RV problems may include right bundle-branch block (RBBB), volume loading, and chamber enlargement. Because the failing RV may have regional dyskinesis, we hypothesized that resynchronization therapy might augment its performance. Methods and Results—We studied 7 {{patients with}} RV dysfunction and RBBB, using a predefined pacing protocol. QRS duration, cardiac index (CI), and RV dP/dt were measured in 4 different pacing states. Atrioventricular pacing improved CI and RV dP/dtmax and decreased QRS duration as compared with atrial pacing or sinus rhythm. Conclusions—Atrioventricular pacing in patients with RBBB and RV dysfunction augments RV and systemic perfor-mance. RV resynchronization is a promising novel therapy for patients with RV failure. (Circulation. 2003; 107 : 2287 - 2289.) Key Words: pacing heart defects, <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> Right heart failure is an important cause of late morbidityin congenital heart disease. 1 – 3 Whereas left ventricular (LV) failure is well studied, the therapeutic approach to right ventricular (RV) failure is largely empirical, and clinical trial data are nearly nonexistent. Regional dyskinesis is common in LV systolic dysfunction, impeding global cardiac contractility and relaxation. Restor-ing mechanical synchronization with biventricular pacing improves hemodynamics and bioenergetics. 4 Resynchroniza-tion improves cardiac contractility without the increase in oxygen demand that accompanies inotropic therapies. 5 Trials have demonstrated improved exercise tolerance, although survival benefit is uncertain. 6 In contrast to LV dysfunction, the failing RV is poorly understood. Prior surgery often produces right bundle-branch block (RBBB). 7 Tricuspid or pulmonary insufficiency may cause RV enlargement. These alterations may decrease RV ejection fraction. 8 The motion of the interventricular septum often becomes paradoxic in these circumstances, indicating an abnormal RV activation sequence. 9 Thus, RV dyskinesis {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic target.

40|$|SUMMARY Height, weight, {{total body}} fat, lean body mass, size of fat cells and {{total number of}} lipid-con-taining fat cells were {{compared}} in two groups of children, ages 2 - 6 years, with <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Twelve children who developed <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in infancy made up one group and 14 asymptomatic patients made up the other. No patient was cyanotic or had undergone surgical repair. Patients with <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> were shorter and lighter than asymptomatic patients. Whereas both fat and lean tissues were less in the <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> group, reduction in body fat was more important in producing under-weight. Although {{there was no difference}} in the size of fat cells, the number of lipid-laden fat cells was diminished in the children who had early <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Thus hypocellularity of fat cells appeared to be the ma-jor determinant of diminished body fat with <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Because shortness and decreased lean tissue were associated with these adipose tissue abnormalities, it is likely that widespread changes are caused by early <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> As previously reported with hypoxemia, the early development of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> seems to produce tissue changes that handicap growth. INFANTS with <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> disease who develop congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> often become under-nourished.
