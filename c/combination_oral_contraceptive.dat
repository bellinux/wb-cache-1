Study Design: This was a randomized, open-label study of 104 young women who received six cycles of treatment. Blood was collected at baseline and on treatment; changes by Day 20 /Cycle 6 in baseline hemostasis markers [prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PAP) and fibrin degradation products (d-dimer) ] were assessed. Results: All contraceptives induced similar increases in F 1 + 2 and d-dimer. Patch-induced PAP increases were less than with the monophasic and similar to the triphasic COC. Decreases in protein S and increases in sex hormone-binding globulin were greater with the patch than with either COC. Patch-induced increases in activated protein C resistance were greater than with the triphasic and similar to the monophasic COC.

Heavy menstrual bleeding, a subset of AUB, also referred to as menorrhagia, is defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 mL or the patient&# 39;s perception of excessive blood loss. The newest treatment option available is a novel <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> product containing estradiol valerate (E 2 V) and dienogest (DNG). As with other combination oral contraceptives, E 2 V/DNG works primarily by preventing ovulation. However, in contrast with other combination oral contraceptives, it is the progestin component of E 2 V/DNG that is responsible for endometrial stabilization. Use of E 2 V/DNG for six months has led to significant reductions in heavy menstrual bleeding with an average 65 % reduction in mean blood loss. Approximately half of the women with heavy menstrual bleeding who received E 2 V/DNG for six months demonstrated an 80 % reduction in mean blood loss. Additionally, significant improvements in hematologic indicators (ie, ferritin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) have been shown. Based on its chemical properties, E 2 V/DNG may have fewer adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism and reduced risk of thromboembolic complications compared with other combination oral contraceptives. This has not yet been shown in clinical trials and until then it should be assumed that E 2 V/DNG has a safety profile similar to other combination oral contraceptives containing 35 µg or less of ethinyl estradiol. E 2 V/DNG has been compared with another <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> in healthy women without heavy menstrual bleeding and demonstrated improved bleeding patterns. E 2 V/DNG has not been compared with the levonorgestrel intrauterine device or other treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. When compared with some other treatment options for AUB, E 2 V/DNG provides the added advantage of effective contraception.

40|$|Dysfunctional uterine {{bleeding}} (DUB) {{is defined}} as abnormal uterine bleeding {{in the absence of}} demonstrable structural or organic pathology. Bleeding occurs frequently or irregularly, lasts longer, or is heavier. DUB is {{the most common cause of}} abnormal vaginal bleeding during a woman's reproductive years and occurs most commonly at the beginning of the reproductive years in adolescent girls. The frequency is 20 % in adolescent girls. DUB is diagnosed when all other possible causes of vaginal bleeding have been excluded such as bleeding disorders, pregnancy, medications, iatrogenic causes, genital tract pathology, malignancy, and systemic disease by appropriate investigations. Approximately 90 % of DUB cases result from hypothalamic anovulation in adolescents during early puberty. The goal of therapy should be to arrest bleeding, replace lost iron to avoid anemia, and prevent future bleeding. Conjugated estrogen (Premarin) 25 mg IV can be given every 4 - 6 hours until the bleeding stops for very heavy bleeding. After bleeding stops, low doses of the oral contraceptive may then be prescribed for at least 3 months to prevent the bleeding from recurring. <b>Combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills with 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol may be used or progesterone alone can be used to stabilize an immature endometrium until the bleeding stops for up to 7 days in patients with moderate bleeding.

40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} in Los Angeles County, California, of 127 endometrial cancer cases aged 45 years or less at diagnosis, to investigate the role of fertility, obesity and exogenous oestrogens {{in the development of the}} disease in young women. Use of sequential oral contraceptive (SOCs) or oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for greater than or equal to 2 years was strongly associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer. After excluding these cases, since the SOC or ERT use was probably the cause of their disease, we were left with 110 case-control pairs for further study. Among these remaining case-control pairs increasing parity was strongly associated with decreased risk (relative risk of 0. 12 for women of parity 3 compared to nulliparous women, P less than 0. 001).

40|$|Background: <b>Combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> (COC) is {{the most}} common method of {{contraception}} utilized in the United States. Currently, the traditional 28 -day cyclic COC {{is the most}} popular. The newly developed continuous COC shows multiple advantages over the traditional cyclic COC, both in reducing the frequency of menses and the severity of associated symptoms, as well as providing the lifestyle benefits and convenience for women. This systematic review evaluates the effect of continuous COC use on subsequent fertility in healthy women of child-bearing age. Method: An extensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Evidence Based Medicine Review Multifile was conducted using fertility and oral contraceptives as key words. Articles written in the English language between 1990 and the present with human subjects were included. The GRADE system was utilized to assess the quality of each study. Results: Two studies were included in this systematic review. For women who had discontinued continuous COC for pregnancy intent, the pregnancy rate at 12 months was 81 %, comparable to the pregnancy rate of women with previous traditional cyclic COC use. The median time to return of spontaneous menses after cessation of continuous COC use was 1 month. These studies seem to indicate that continuous COC use does not delay the time to fertility. However, the studies utilized were both of very low quality. Conclusion: Based on current research, continuous COC has a good safety and efficacy profile. Recent studies point towards lack of delay in return to fertility; however, more high quality research is necessary to ascertain the effect of continuous COC use on subsequent fertility. At this time, women should be educated about the limitations of current research {{to make their own decisions}} in choosing continuous COC as a contraceptive method.

40|$|Abstract Background Consistent {{with its}} effect on gastric emptying, exenatide, an {{injectable}} treatment for type 2 diabetes, may slow the absorption rate of concomitantly administered oral drugs resulting in a decrease in maximum concentration (C max). This study evaluated the drug interaction potential of exenatide when administered adjunctively with oral contraceptives, given their potential concomitant use. Methods This trial evaluated the effect of exenatide co-administration on single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of a <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 30 μg, levonorgestrel [LV] 150 μg [Microgynon 30 ®]). Thirty-two healthy female subjects participated in an open-label, randomised, crossover trial with 3 treatment periods (oral contraceptive alone, 1 hour before exenatide, 30 minutes after exenatide). Subjects received a single dose of oral contraceptive on Day 8 of each period and QD doses on Days 10 through 28. During treatment periods of concomitant usage, exenatide was administered subcutaneously prior to morning and evening meals at 5 μg BID from Days 1 through 4 and at 10 μg BID from Days 5 through 22. Single- (Day 8) and multiple-dose (Day 22) pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed for each treatment period. Results Exenatide did not alter the bioavailability nor decrease daily trough concentrations for either oral contraceptive component. No substantive changes in oral contraceptive pharmacokinetics occurred when oral contraceptive was administered 1 hour before exenatide. Single-dose oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in mean (90 % CI) C max reductions of 46 % (42 - 51 %) and 41 % (35 - 47 %) for EE and LV, respectively. Repeated daily oral contraceptive administration 30 minutes after exenatide resulted in C max reductions of 45 % (40 - 50 %) and 27 % (21 - 33 %) for EE and LV, respectively. Peak oral contraceptive concentrations were delayed approximately 3 to 4 hours. Mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events observed during the trial. Conclusions The observed reduction in C max is likely of limited importance given the unaltered oral contraceptive bioavailability and trough concentrations; however, for oral medications that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, such as contraceptives and antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those drugs at least 1 hour before exenatide injection.

Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16. 0 %) be-fore initiating and in 25 women (12. 5 %) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P. 4). There {{were no significant differences}} in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cer-vical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was – 313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV. High rates of coinfection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 have been demonstrated in African populations [1, 2]. Infection wit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> are {{amongst the}} most popular drugs, at present about 60 million women are using this highly {{effective}} form of contraception. Following the classic demonstrations by Pinchus and Rock (1958) interest has centred on progesterone-oestrogen <b>combinations</b> as <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> The first <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> to be introduced contained high doses of oestrogen and progesterone. Since then {{there has been a}} gradual, but signifi- cant reduction in both components, leading to a decrease in adverse effects. A large number of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pill formulations are available with an even greater number of proprietary preparations (Kestelman, 1981). Further preparations are being developed (Eyong, 1987). Many women appear to be suited by any pill formulation they are offered, but some find only one formulation acceptable. Unfortunately there are no simple rules for identifying which formulation is suitable for a particular patient, and if the first choice of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> formulation proves unsuitable, the second choice must be better and based on the knowledge of the composition of available varieties and the relationship to each other.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of multiple sclerosis (MS) is rising in women. To {{determine whether the}} use of combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) are associated with MS risk and whether this varies by progestin content. We conducted a nested case-control study of females ages 14 - 48 years with incident MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) 2008 - 2011 from the membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity and membership characteristics. COC use up to ten years prior to symptom onset {{was obtained from the}} complete electronic health record. We identified 400 women with incident MS/CIS and 3904 matched controls. Forty- percent of cases and 32 % of controls had used COCs prior to symptom onset. The use of COCs was associated with a slightly increased risk of MS/CIS (adjusted OR = 1. 52, 95 %CI = 1. 21 - 1. 91; p< 0. 001). This risk did not vary by duration of COC use. The association varied by progestin content being more pronounced for levenorgestrol (adjusted OR = 1. 75, 95 %CI = 1. 29 - 2. 37; p< 0. 001) than norethindrone (adjusted OR = 1. 57, 95 %CI = 1. 16 - 2. 12; p = 0. 003) and absent for the newest progestin, drospirenone (p = 0. 95). Our findings should be interpreted cautiously. While the use of some <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> may contribute to the rising {{incidence of}} MS in women, an unmeasured confounder associated with the modern woman's lifestyle is a more likely explanation for this weak association...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} a long-acting injectable progestin, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), compared with <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) on the risk of diabetes in Latino women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — An observational cohort study of 526 His-panic women with prior GDM who were not diabetic in their postpartum visit during January 1987 to October 1997 and who elected DMPA (n 96) or COCs (n 430) as initial contra-ception were followed for a maximum of 9. 2 years with a median follow-up of 12 months. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed and choice of contraception method was recorded at each visit as part of routine clinical care. RESULTS — Annual diabetes incidence rates were 19 % in the DMPA group and 12 % in the COC group, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1. 58 (95 % CI 1. 00 – 2. 50; P 0. 05) for DMPA compared with COCs. Adjustment for baseline imbalances reduced the HR to 1. 18 (0. 67 – 2. 28; P 0. 57). Additional adjustment for weight gain during follow-up, which was on average 1. 8 kg higher in the DMPA group (P 0. 0001), reduced the HR to 1. 07.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the use of}} <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (OCs) and the risk of endometrial cancer was assessed in a case-control study conducted in the Swiss Canton of Vaud between 1 January 1988 and 31 July 1990. Subjects included 122 women aged 75 or less with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer, and 309 control women in hospital for acute conditions unrelated to OC use. Overall, 14 percent of cases and 27 percent of controls had ever used OCs, corresponding to a multivariate relative risk (RR) of 0. 5 (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0. 3, 0. 8). The risk of endometrial cancer was found to be related inversely to duration of OC use: RR = 1. 0 for less than two years of OC use; 0. 5 for two to five years; and 0. 3 (95 percent CI: 0. 1, 0. 7) for more than five years. The protection appeared greater within 20 years since last use, and the RR rose to 0. 8 after 20 or more years since last use; numbers are too small, however, for reliable inference from these subanalyses. No significant interaction or modifying effect was observed with other major factors related to endometrial cancer, including parity, body mass index, estrogen replacement therapy, and cigarette smoking. While this study provides further evidence for the protective effect of OCs against risk of endometrial cancer, the relationship requires continued evaluation to assess the long-term implications and public health impact of OC use...|$|R
40|$|The Norplant * {{system is}} {{composed}} {{of a set of}} six Silastic * (silicone polydimethysiloxane) capsules measuring 34 mm by 2. 4 mm, each containing 36 mg of levonorgestrel and sealed at either end with a medical grade silicone elastomer adhesive. Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progestin, widely used in <b>combination</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and in single-agent "mini-pills. " In a procedure completed in less than 15 minutes by an experienced physician, the six capsules are surgically implanted subdermally, most commonly {{on the inside of the}} left upper arm. The levonorgestrel diffuses through the Silastic material into the blood stream and is carried to the target organs. Ovulation is suppressed in the majority of the cycles during the first years of use, and cervical mucus is thickened, inhibiting sperm penetration. During use, the effective delivery of levonorgestrel is about 30 mcglday from day 500 to day 2300. Recently, we have seen patients with complications from Norplant, and we describe here a patient who presented with systemic complications resulting from both the endocrinological aspects of Norplant and the immunological aspects of the Silastic implants. To our knowledge this is the first case report in the western medical literature describing systemic immunological complications as a result of a failed Norplant device.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> were {{introduced}} in the late 1950 s, and their use has altered society and has led to radical changes. Combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> are considered the most acceptable, effective, and most easily reversible method of contraception. In the early 1960 s, an association between venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use was identified. In response, the amount of estrogen used in these contraceptives was decreased. Later, the concept that reducing the dose of estrogen would eliminate the risk of venous thrombosis was strongly challenged. OBJECTIVE: The available epidemiologic data and the mechanisms that underly the risk of venous thromboembolism as {{a side effect of}} <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use will be described. Clinical implications based on both the relative and absolute risks in the general population and in women with a known tendency for venous thromboembolism will be discussed. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE was conducted for the years 1995 through 2005, using search word <b>combinations</b> including <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive,</b> estrogen, progestin, venous thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and pulmonary embolism. Relevant articles relating to the topic of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and the risk of venous thromboembolism were studied and summarized for inclusion in this review article. RESULTS: Certain third-generation progestins in low-estrogen preparations were found to increase the risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Also, the realization that genetic factors {{play a role in the}} degree of thrombosis risk led to insights into the hemostatic changes that occur during <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use and that predispose women to thrombosis. Known risk factors for venous thromboembolism-inherited thrombophilia, a personal history of venous thromboembolism, and obesity-pose varying degrees of concern for both women and their physicians regarding the safety of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> CONCLUSION: In order to prevent venous thromboembolism, prudence is required when prescribing <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> to women who have an increased risk of that condition. Furthermore, having a risk factor may not be an absolute contraindication to the use of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> but it offers the opportunity for women to make informed decisions about their use. In the future, researchers should focus on developing effective <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> that are even safer than those that are available toda...|$|R
40|$|Only 10 % of plasma TFPIα (TFPI) {{exists in}} the full length form, the rest circulates as a C-terminally {{truncated}} form. However, blood platelets exclusively contain full length TFPI, which is released {{at the site of}} injury upon platelet activation, and which could play an important local regulatory role in thrombin generation and prevention of thrombosis. The anticoagulant activities of full length and truncated TFPI were investigated using thrombin generation assays. Blood samples were obtained from 30 healthy volunteers (10 male subjects, 10 female subjects, and 10 females using <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives).</b> Platelet TFPI was released in platelet rich plasma and in platelet isolates using convulxin or thrombin, and measured by free TFPI ELISA and thrombin generation assays. Full length TFPI and platelet TFPI were much more potent inhibitors of thrombin generation than truncated TFPI, which was virtually inactive. Although mean plasma TFPI antigen levels decreased from men (0. 30 nM) to women (0. 20 nM) to women using <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (0. 11 nM), no relevant differences were found in platelet TFPI among those subgroups. Platelets release similar amounts of TFPI regardless of plasma TFPI concentrations and is unaffected by sex or <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use. We speculate that platelet TFPI is important to prevent systemic coagulation and thrombosis and restrict thrombus formation {{to the site of the}} growing platelet plug. The stable contribution of platelet TFPI to the anticoagulant potential in plasma is likely to become particularly relevant under conditions of low plasma TFPI levels in <b>combination</b> of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> use...|$|R
