50|$|The English {{version of}} Digimon Adventure was {{somewhat}} unusual {{at the time}} it was dubbed. Most anime dubbed in the 1990s changed the names <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>locales</b> for the sake of localization. In Digimon, however, most names of the DigiDestined remained unchanged or were shortened to Americanized nicknames, and almost all name references to the locations in Japan visited during the series were retained. Some Digimon names were modified into English equivalents.|$|R
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, has revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>locales</b> in games was used by him in order to develop the personality <b>of</b> his <b>character.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the basic properties of stably closed, or proper maps <b>of</b> <b>locales,</b> {{in a setting}} formally similar to that developed by A. Joyal and M.

Johnstone, and that proper surjections are stable coequalizers, effective for descent in the category <b>of</b> <b>locales...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{episode of}} Peter’s rescue {{from prison in}} Acts 12 : 5 – 17 {{occupies}} an intriguing position in the narrative of Acts as a whole. Scholars hold differing views on the episode’s function. These views range from seeing the episode as a hermeneutical key to the work as a whole to making no discernable difference to the narrative whatsoever. The present article seeks {{to contribute to the}} debate by reading Acts 12 : 5 – 17 spatially. In paying attention to the various spatial references in the text, the movement <b>of</b> <b>characters,</b> their <b>locales</b> and their own and the reader’s experience of them being present or not present, a contrasting structure may be perceived in the text. Furthermore, spatiality helps to point out the contrast between different character groups in the narrative. Some implications for reading the episode in this contrasting fashion will be indicated, and the enigmatic statement about Peter’s ‘going to another place’ (Ac 12 : 17) will be read against the text’s spatial background.

The first theorem shows a morphism <b>of</b> <b>locales</b> B→Ω with nucleus j which induces an isomorphism <b>of</b> <b>locales</b> between B and the sublocale Ωj↪Ω. The second theorem, which generalizes the first one, gives an equivalence between the category of Kolmogorov bornological spaces and bounded maps, and the full subcategory B′↪B formed by all j-sheaves which are separated for the double negation topology of B...|$|R

40|$|Locales are Isabelle’s {{approach}} {{for dealing with}} parametric theories. They have been designed as a module system for a theorem prover that can adequately represent the complex inter-dependencies between structures found in abstract algebra, but have proven fruitful also in other applications — for example, software verification. Both design and implementation <b>of</b> <b>locales</b> have evolved considerably since Kammüller did his initial experiments. Today, locales are a simple yet powerful extension of the Isar proof language. The present tutorial covers all major facilities <b>of</b> <b>locales.</b> It is intended for locale novices; familiarity with Isabelle and Isar is presumed. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} {{elementary}} diameter is introduced to provide, {{in the context}} <b>of</b> <b>Locale</b> Theory, a constructive notion of metrisability. Besides foundational aspects, elementary diameters allow to express metrisability in locales more simply {{with respect to the}} existing (non-constructive) approach based on diameters. By relying on the presentation <b>of</b> <b>Locale</b> Theory provided by formal topology, the notions to be presented may be conceived as phrased within (Martin-Löf) Type Theory. A type-theoretic version of Urysohn metrisation theorem is thus obtained. As an application, a set (data type) of indexes for the points of locally compact metrisable formal spaces is shown to exist...|$|R
