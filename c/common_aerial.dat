50|$|Aerials (or more {{commonly}} airs) are {{a type of}} skateboarding trick usually performed on half-pipes, pools or quarter pipes {{where there is a}} vertical wall with a transition (curved surface linking wall and ground) available. Aerials usually combine rotation with different grabs. Most of the different types of grabs were originally aerial tricks that were performed in ditches, empty pools, and vert ramps before flatground <b>aerials</b> became <b>common.</b> <b>Aerials</b> can be executed by ollieing just as the front wheels reach the lip of a ramp, or can be executed simply by lifting the front wheels over the coping (or lip). The former is preferable on shallower ramps where the skateboarder has less speed to lift them above the ramp.|$|R

2500|$|Within the Eurasian clade, the two subclades {{differ in}} bulb type. In subclade B2 (Fritillaria, Rhinopetalum, and Japonica), the bulb type is {{described}} as Fritillaria-type, with 2–3 fleshy scales and the tunica derived from the remnants of previous year's scales. by contrast subclade B2 (Petilium, Theresia and Korolkowia) differ. Those of Theresia and Korolkowia are large, consisting of a single large fleshy scale, while Petilium species have several large erect imbricate scales. In Liliorhiza the bulbs are naked and have nunerous scales similar to Lilium, but with numerous [...] "rice-grain bulbils".

50|$|Moving a wedge either closer or {{farther away}} from the laser {{can also be used to}} steer the beam. When the wedge is moved closer to the target ({{farther away from}} the laser), the refracted beam will move across the target. When two wedges in {{opposite}} directions slide relative to each other they can be used to provide variable focusing for cameras, allowing objects at vastly different distances to be photographed, in focus, at the same focal plane. This method is <b>common</b> in <b>aerial</b> or space launch-vehicle photography, when the distance to the object is changing very rapidly. Wedges were sometimes used in rangefinding, by combining the image formed by one telescope with the image formed by another.|$|R

40|$|Tree {{swallows}} are <b>common</b> <b>aerial</b> insectivores. Nestlings are fed {{until they}} fledge 20 days after hatching. From 2008 - 2012, {{we examined the}} effects of brood size and year on nestling growth (head-bill length, mass and wing length) from 430 nestlings in 102 broods when 3, 6, 9 and 12 days old. We measured nestlings at ND 12 because nestling size at ND 12 predicts size at fledging. Brood sizes ranged from 1 - 7 nestlings. Head-bill, mass and wing growth rates were all significantly affected by brood size and year. In the most common brood sizes of 4, 5, and 6, head-bill and wing growth rates were significantly affected by brood size, mass was not. Nestling size at ND 3 was positively correlated with size at ND 12. On ND 12, head-bill length, mass and wing length were positively correlated with each other suggesting that brood size affects nestling growth. Nestlings in BS 4 - 6 were the largest on ND 12. Nestling growth rates changed with year suggesting that food availability affects growth...|$|E

40|$|With {{respect to}} the usual {{processing}} chain in UAV photogrammetry the consideration of the camera’s influencing factors on the accessible accuracy level is of high interest. In most applications consumer cameras are used due to their light weight. They usually allow only for automatic zoom or restricted options in manual modes. The stability and long-term validity of the interior orientation parameters are open to question. Additionally, <b>common</b> <b>aerial</b> flights do not provide adequate images for self-calibration. Nonetheless, processing software include self-calibration based on EXIF information as a standard setting. The subsequent impact of the interior orientation parameters on the reconstruction in object space cannot be neglected. With {{respect to the}} suggested key issues different investigations {{on the quality of}} interior orientation and its impact in object space are addressed. On the one hand the investigations concentrate on the improvement in accuracy by applying pre-calibrated interior orientation parameters. On the other hand, image configurations are investigated that allow for an adequate self-calibration in UAV photogrammetry. The analyses on the interior orientation focus on the estimation quality of the interior orientation parameters by using volumetric test scenarios as well as planar pattern as they are commonly used in computer vision. This is done by using a Olympus Pen E-PM 2 camera and a Canon G 1 X as representative system cameras. For the analysis of image configurations a simulation based approach is applied. The analyses include investigations on varying principal distance and principal point to evaluate the system’s stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} and lower free atmosphere, or aerosphere, is increasingly important for human transportation, communication, environmental monitoring, and energy production. The impacts of anthropogenic encroachment into aerial habitats {{are not well}} understood. Insectivorous birds and bats are inherently valuable components of biodiversity and play an integral role in aerial trophic dynamics. Many of these insectivores are experiencing range-wide population declines. As {{a first step toward}} gaging the potential impacts of these declines on the aerosphere’s trophic system, estimates of the biomass and energy consumed by aerial insectivores are needed. We developed a suite of energetics models for {{one of the largest and}} most common avian aerial insectivores in North America, the Purple Martin (Progne subis). The base model estimated that Purple Martins consumed 412 (± 104) billion insects*y- 1 with a biomass of 115, 860 (± 29, 192) metric tonnes*y- 1. During the breeding season Purple Martins consume 10. 3 (+ 3. 0) kg of prey biomass per km 3 of aerial habitat, equal to about 36, 000 individual insects*km- 3. Based on these calculations, the cumulative seasonal consumption of insects*km- 3 is greater in North America during the breeding season than during other phases of the annual cycle, however the maximum daily insect consumption*km- 3 occurs during fall migration. This analysis provides the first range-wide quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the trophic impact of this large and <b>common</b> <b>aerial</b> insectivore.

40|$|The {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) are automated systems {{whose main}} characteristic is {{that can be}} remotely piloted. This property is especially interesting in those civil engineering works in which {{the accuracy of the}} model is not reachable by <b>common</b> <b>aerial</b> or satellite systems, there is a difficult accessibility to the infrastructure due to location and geometry aspects, and the economic resources are limited. This paper aims to show the research, development and application of a UAV that will generate georeferenced spatial information at low cost, high quality, and high availability. In particular, a 3 D modelling and accuracy assessment of granite quarry using UAV is applied. With regard to the image-based modelling pipeline, an automatic approach supported by open source tools is performed. The process encloses the well-known image-based modelling steps: calibration, extraction and matching of features; relative and absolute orientation of images and point cloud and surface generation. Beside this, an assessment of the final model accuracy is carried out by means of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), imaging total station (ITS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in order to ensure its validity. This step follows a twofold approach: (i) firstly, using singular check points to provide a dimensional control of the model and (ii) secondly, analyzing the level of agreement between the realitybased 3 D model obtained from UAV and the generated with TLS. The main goal is to establish and validate an image-based modelling workflow using UAV technology which can be applied in the surveying and monitoring of different quarries...|$|E
