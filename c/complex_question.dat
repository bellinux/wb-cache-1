After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the <b>complex</b> <b>question</b> of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E

Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a <b>complex</b> <b>question</b> of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} been {{substantial}} progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering <b>complex</b> <b>questions</b> remains challenging, typically requiring both {{a large body of}} knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrieval-based methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more <b>complex</b> <b>questions</b> to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on <b>complex</b> <b>questions</b> of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.

If woman as woman grated on him you would suppose that the most womanly details would be the worst for him, but time and again I have known him to have a chair placed for a female so that his desk would not obstruct his view of her legs, and the answer can’t be that his interest is professional and he reads character from legs, because the older and dumpier she is the less he cares where she sits.

2500|$|In cricket {{to throw}} the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no ball, but until 1960 it was {{undefined}} and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence. To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball [...] increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a [...] "chucker" [...] could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright straight arm was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said [...] "It is the most <b>complex</b> <b>question</b> I have known in cricket, because it {{is not a matter of}} fact, but a matter of opinion and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views".|$|E

Having settled this {{in his own mind}} he forced himself to attend a meeting at which his assistance had been asked as to a <b>complex</b> <b>question</b> on Law Reform. The Duke endeavoured to give himself up entirely to the matter; but through it all there was the picture before him of Mrs. Finn waiting for an answer to her letter. If he should confirm himself in his opinion that he had been right, then would any answer be necessary? He might just acknowledge the letter, after the fashion which has come up in official life, than which silence is an insult much more bearable. But he did not wish to insult, nor to punish her further. He would willingly have withdrawn the punishment under which she was groaning could he have done so without self-abasement. Or he might write as she had done,--advocating his own cause with all his strength, using that last one strong argument,--"there should not have been a moment." [...] But there would be something repulsive to his personal dignity in the continued correspondence which this would produce. [...] "The Duke of Omnium regrets to say, in answer to Mrs. Finn's letter, that he thinks no good can be attained by a prolonged correspondence." [...] Such, or of such kind, he thought must be his answer. But would this be a fair return for the solicitude shown by her to his uncle, for the love which had made her so patient a friend to his wife, for the nobility of her own conduct in many things? Then his mind reverted to certain jewels,--supposed to be of enormous value,--which were still in his possession though they were the property of this woman. They had been left to her by his uncle, and she had obstinately refused to take them. Now they were lying packed in the cellars of certain bankers,--but still they were in his custody. What should he now do in this matter? Hitherto, perhaps once in every six months, he had notified to her that he was keeping them as her curator, and she had always repeated that it was a charge from which she could not relieve him. It had become almost a joke between them. But how could he joke with a woman with whom he had quarrelled after this internecine fashion? ...|$|E

5000|$|Closely {{connected}} with principii is {{the fallacy of}} the <b>Complex</b> <b>Question.</b> By a <b>complex</b> <b>question,</b> in the broadest meaning of that term, is meant one that suggests its own answer. Any question, for instance, that forces us to select, and assert in our answer to it, one {{of the elements of}} the question itself, while some other possibility is really open, is complex in the sense in which that term is here employed. If, for example, one were to ask whether you were going to New York or London, or if your favourite colour were red or blue, or if you had given up a particular bad habit, he would be guilty of the fallacy of the <b>complex</b> <b>question,</b> if, in each case, the alternatives, as a matter of fact, were more numerous than, or were in any way different from, those stated in the question. Any leading question which complicates an issue by over simplification is fallacious for the same reason… In the petitio principii an assumption with respect to the subject-matter of an argument functions as a premise, in the <b>complex</b> <b>question</b> it is a similar assumption that shuts out some of the material possibilities of a situation and confines an issue within too narrow limits. As in the former case, so here, the only way of meeting the difficulty is to raise the previous question, that is, to call the assumption which lies back of the fallacy into question.
