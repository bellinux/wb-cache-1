At first, the problematic situations are exposed in this thesis that occur because of the different treatment of the particular legal orders and result into negative consequences which shall be eliminated by the unified European ruling. It concerns the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualifications,</b> the incidental question, the renvoi and the factor of time. In the second part, this thesis deals with the particular questions of succession. The legal orders of the EU Member States usually contain a choice of law rule referring to succession as whole, while several particular questions, such as capacity to make a will, its content and form, possibility to select the applicable law as well as admissibility of other dispositions mortis causa, are submitted to another choice of law rule. In general, the applicable law is {{the law of the}} deceased's last domicile or their nationality. Some states apply the "scission" model where the immovables are governed by their lex situs while the rest of succession underlies to the above mentioned general rule. Apart from the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Application {{of private}} {{international}} law is impossible without deciphering {{the meaning of the}} legal rules specific to this branch or without classifying the test cases on categories. This dual mental operation that the judge has to do is called <b>qualification.</b> The notion <b>of</b> <b>qualification</b> is defined by authors differently. According to a first opinion the qualification is defined as the operation performed by an authority that is required to solve a conflict, when asked to find the <b>conflict</b> category <b>of</b> the situation, in order to decide what rule should be applied. According to another opinion, the qualification establishes the meaning of the notions of legal rules on the subject of regulation and the law applicable to the legal relationship. In a reverse operation, through qualification, they determine the legal category to which a fact situation belongs and indicate the competent law. According to a last opinion, qualification is defined in two ways: starting from the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws towards the facts (legal relationship) or vice versa. Thus:a. the qualification is the logical-judicial operation of determining the exact full meaning of legal terms expressing the content and relations <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws, in order to see whether a legal relationship (a state of facts) is included (or not) among these terms;b. the qualification is the interpretation of a legal relationship (of a specific fact situation) in order to see the to which <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws, in terms of content and relationship, it belongs. In foreign literature qualification is defined differently. Thus, according to a first view, the qualification is defined as the legal operation performed to include a specific legal situation in the contents <b>of</b> a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws. This operation gives rise to a conflict between the contents <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws belonging to the same legal system, and to a qualifications conflict when another system of law, which relates to the facts, places it within the content <b>of</b> a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> laws different from that chosen by the legal system of the forum. According to another point <b>of</b> view, the <b>qualification</b> means defining the terms used by the rules of {{private international law}}: nationality (citizenship), domicile, residence, capacity, family rights, inheritance rights, etc...|$|R
