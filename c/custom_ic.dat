2500|$|Nishi's {{standard}} was {{built around the}} Spectravideo SV-328 computer. The standard consisted primarily of several off-the-shelf parts; the main CPU was a 3.58MHz Zilog Z80, the Texas Instruments TMS9918 graphics chip with 16KB of dedicated VRAM, the sound and partial I/O support {{was provided by the}} AY-3-8910 chip manufactured by General Instrument (GI), and an Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface chip was used for the parallel I/O such as the keyboard. This was a choice of components that was shared by many other home computers and games consoles of the period, such as the ColecoVision home computer (an emulator was later available with which MSX systems could run some of its software), and the Sega SG-1000 video game system. To reduce overall system cost, many MSX models used a <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> known as [...] "MSX-Engine", which integrated glue logic, 8255 PPI, YM2149 compatible soundchip and more, sometimes even the Z80 CPU. However, almost all MSX systems used a professional keyboard instead of a chiclet keyboard, driving the price up compared to the original SV-328. Consequently, these components alongside Microsoft's MSX BASIC made the MSX a competitive, though somewhat expensive, home computer package.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of standard cell based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to full <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> design. In standard cell design the designer uses cells from a standard cell library to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The standard cells form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each standard cell represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 standard cells and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|E

In one of his papers entitled [...] "Perspective: User toolkits for innovation," [...] Hippel describes how user toolkits {{can be used to}} help manufacturers and companies determine the users' need-related aspects of products and services. The users are provided with [...] "user toolkits for innovation," [...] to help the manufacturer outsource tasks that would normally take much time and effort within the company. One of the first areas that user toolkits have been used was in the design and manufacturing of custom integrated circuits. [...] In this field it was critical that manufacturers understood user needs because it could result in months of delays costing the company thousands of dollars.
