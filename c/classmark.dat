5000|$|As {{originally}} implemented, {{the shelf}} arrangement {{produced by the}} classification was supplemented by an indexed card catalogue, where index entries were created for each element in the <b>classmark,</b> in reverse order from the classification. The example Foskett and Foskett gave was: [...] "Each entry refers the reader to {{the part of the}} classified section, Rid, where all entries on Secondary modern school are filed.". [...] The 1974 second edition of the scheme was supplemented by thesaurus cross referencing between narrow terms, broad terms and related terms.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summaries}} and categories {{the information}} elements important for defining communication profiles of all relevant actors in a mobile communication scenario, where the information elements include Terminal, User, Service and Network Profiles. Those context information {{described by the}} profiles need to be retrieved before the decision process will be started for negotiation air interfaces for SDR Terminal or any other terminal adaptation. To efficiently reduce the signaling overhead, profiles data are dynamically clustered in <b>classmarks</b> by meaningful criteria. Under dynamic <b>classmarks</b> we understand the efficient coding of temporary clusters for profile data. Dynamic <b>classmarks</b> capture all {{the features of the}} information entities in an abstract and succinct manner. An XML structure is used for the profiles that reflect the different properties of a terminal, user, network or services...|$|R
50|$|His work in {{classification}} attempted {{to deal with}} the problem of the shelf arrangement of interdisciplinary works, and how to ensure that works on the same topic would be found in the same place. Part of his attempt to deal with this was to create synthesised notation (a rarity among classification systems in his day) to allow composite <b>classmarks</b> to be created.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{presents the}} new schedule of UDC Class 2 : Theology and religion, which was revised in 2000. Class 2 has been modified, in terms both of substance and of form. All religions and faiths are now {{treated as a}} coherent system. Different religious groups in the main table are ranked equally. They are arranged historically and the most related religions follow each other. Another change is a single special auxiliary table, {{which is based on}} general principles of facet analysis. All of the detail of the auxiliary schedule is available for qualification in any class in the main table and they are very clearly denoted. The new meaning for the »cancelled« classes of the old Class 2 and the large number of different faiths and cultures generating a substantial vocabulary can present a potential difficulty for the library user and for the indexer. Therefore, this contribution is intended as a guide for the implementation and possible solutions to suit local conditions. The new schedule, which is fully faceted, demonstrates the great applicability of the class and the potential for generating the <b>classmarks</b> for complex concepts within any faith system because more than one concept from auxiliary class may be used in combination for any religion...|$|R
50|$|The British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCM Classification) is a faceted {{classification}} that was commissioned from E. J. Coates by the Council of the British National Bibliography {{to organize the}} content of the British Catalogue of Music. The published schedule (1960) was considerably expanded by Patrick Mills of the British Library up until its use was abandoned in 1998. Entries in the catalogue were organized by BCM <b>classmark</b> from the catalogue's inception in 1957 until 1982. From that year the British Catalogue of Music (which from 1974 onward was published by The British Library) was organized instead by Dewey Decimal Classification number, though BCM classmarks continued to be added to entries up to the 1998 annual cumulation.|$|E

40|$|Knowing Universal decimal {{classification}} is highly desirable nowadays {{if not a}} necessity, since the use of UDC number as a search strategy leads to more relevant hits. Besides, searching for a particular piece of information without UDC {{would be very difficult}} if not even impossible. UDC is very little used in the union catalogue. <b>Classmark</b> only rarely serves as a search tool in computer environment since artificial language, in which it is written, is unintelligible to users. Researches show that the amount of users who make use of such searching and are not librarians is only about 2 %. The question is how to use UDC as an effective tool. We could look for the answer also in educating the pupils in primary schools for the use of <b>classmark</b> as a search tool. We can motivate pupils by making them remember all the nine main UDC classes {{with the help of a}} memory technique, and thus make this classification friendlier for them. This is not learning by heart but simply a more effective use of memory and about a successful recollection of information when it is needed...|$|E
40|$|Today, Learning Management Systems (LMS), both {{commercial}} and open source, {{are available to}} implement web-based learning environments, yet they require large servers, a team of support staff, and have expensive licensing costs. Open source LMS alternatives often run on leaner machines, but hiring a team to support the system can be costly. The complexity and cost of undertaking the implementation of an LMS can often be taxing on a smaller institution, but they must offer an LMS to compete with other institutions. WILE (Web-Integrated Learning Environment) is an LMS that uses combinations of either free or low-cost services already available on the Internet. WILE is available anywhere there is an Internet connection through a standard web browser. Fully exploiting the idea of Web 2. 0, WILE is a mashup of different services to create a complete web-based environment, different from {{the wide range of}} LMS products currently on the market. WILE is a mashup of Google Apps, Google Docs, Google Groups, Gmail, Engrade, and <b>ClassMarker.</b> All the required LMS services are encapsulated into a single “web desktop” using Ext JS v 2. 0. This paper describes the motivation behind the new approach of building an LMS from near zero-cost web services that resulted in WILE. The Web 2. 0 background that inspired the building of WILE is described, as well as its design and implementation. At the end of the development, it was found that WILE fulfils 87 % of the requirements of a fully functional LMS...|$|R

40|$|While by now {{feasible}} {{solutions to}} protect privacy for complex ubiquitous applications are available, very small devices, called context transponders (CTP) still lack resources to run sophisticated full scale approaches like DRM and strong encryption. These devices however, will {{play an important}} role in the success of ubiquitous computing as they support the idea of pervasiveness (small, mobile etc.). We propose a set of techniques outlined as the CTPclassmark that aims to introduce data avoidance and obfuscation strategies to enable information security in context aware applications. Using this <b>classmark,</b> the users’ privacy can be protected even on low resource devices and hence the users ’ trust in ubicomp applications will rise. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of bibliographic classification schemes, {{from the end}} of the 19 th century to our time, shows a trend of increasing possibilities to combine concepts in a <b>classmark.</b> While the early schemes, like DDC and LCC, were largely enumerative, more and more synthetic devices have appeared with common auxiliaries, facets, and phase relationships. The last editions of UDC and the UDC-derived FATKS project follow this evolution, by introducing more specific phase relationships and more common auxiliaries, like those for general properties and processes. This agrees with Farradane's principle that each concept should have a place of unique definition, instead of being re-notated in each context where it occurs. This evolution appears to be unfinished, as even in most synthetic schemes many concepts have a different notation according to the disciplinary main classes where they occur. To overcome this limitation, main classes should be defined in terms of phenomena rather than disciplines: the Integrative Level Classification (ILC) research project is currently exploring this possibility. Examples with UDC, FATKS, and ILC notations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} unknown poem by Desiderius Erasmus (1466 - 1536) {{has come to}} light in Cambridge University Library’s copy of the first collected edition of his epigrams. The book {{in which it was}} found was printed not as a separate work, but as the third part of a collection superintended by Erasmus and mainly consisting of the writings of Thomas More. For the chief item in it was More’s Utopia, supplemented first by More’s epigrams, and then by those of Erasmus. The volume is therefore catalogued at Cambridge as De optimo reip. statu, deque noua insula Vtopia (Basel: Froben, March 1518; <b>classmark</b> Rel. c. 51. 3). It is continuously paginated, and in the final section an early Tudor hand has copied into the margins three poems, all of them expressly ascribed to Erasmus. The first of them, described as an epitaph on King Henry VII (and inserted on page 319), has hitherto been unknown to modern scholars. The other two poems (inserted on page 355) both relate to Henry VIII’s meeting with the Emperor Charles V at Calais in July 1520. This is the author accepted manuscript. It is currently under an indefinite embargo pending publication by Leuven University Press...|$|E
40|$|The Integrative Level Classification (ILC) {{research}} project is {{experimenting with a}} knowledge organization system based on phenomena rather than disciplines. Each phenomenon has a constant notation, which can be combined with {{that of any other}} phenomenon in a freely faceted structure. Citation order can express differential focality of the facets. Very specific subjects can have long classmarks, although their complexity is reduced by various devices. Freely faceted classification is being tested by indexing a corpus of about 3300 papers in the interdisciplinary domain of bioacoustics. The subjects of these papers often include phenomena {{from a wide variety of}} integrative levels (mechanical waves, animals, behaviour, vessels, fishing, law, [...] .) as well as information about the methods of study, as predicted in the LeÃ³n Manifesto. The archive is recorded in a MySQL database, and can be fed and searched through PHP Web interfaces. Indexer's work is made easier by mechanisms that suggest possible classes on the basis of matching title words with terms in the ILC schedules, and synthesize automatically the verbal caption corresponding to the <b>classmark</b> being edited. Users can search the archive by selecting and combining values in each facet. Search refinement should be improved, especially for the cases where no record, or too many records, match the faceted query. However, experience is being gained progressively, showing that freely faceted classification by phenomena, theories, and methods is feasible and working...|$|E
40|$|Appendix missing. Complete copy {{held in the}} Manuscripts Reading Room, Cambridge University Library, <b>classmark</b> PhD. 33388. Functional heterojunctions {{in organic}} {{electronic}} devices are interfaces formed either between a conducting electrode and an organic semiconductor or between two different organic semiconductors in blended and multilayered structures. This thesis is primarily concerned with the energy level alignment and the interfacial electronic structures at functional heterojunctions encountered in electronic devices made with solution-processable semiconducting polymers. Investigations on the electronic structures across these heterointerfaces are performed with the combined use of electromodulation and photoemission spectroscopic techniques. Electromodulation and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic techniques enable direct determination of the surface work functions of electrodes at the electrode/semiconducting polymer interfaces. We overcame the inherent problems faced by electromodulation spectroscopy, which undermine accurate determination of interfacial electronic structures, by performing electroabsorption (EA) measurements at reduced temperatures. We showed in this thesis that low-temperature EA spectroscopy is a surface sensitive technique that can determine the interface electronic structures in electrode/polymer semiconductor/electrode diodes. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the energy level alignments in these solution-processed organic electronic devices {{are determined by the}} surface work functions of passivated metals rather than by those of clean metals encountered in ultrahigh vacuum. This thesis also discloses our studies on the electronic structures in polymeric diodes with type II donor-acceptor heterojunctions using the EA spectroscopy. We showed that minimising meausurement temperature and attenuating EA illumination intensity enable accurate determinations of the electronic structures in these devices. We demonstrated that the electronic structures and the performance characteristics of multilayered polymer light-emitting diodes are also determined by the surface work functions of passivated metals. Our investigations confirm that electronic doping of the organic active layers, rather than minimisation of the Schottky barriers at electrode/polymer contacts, holds the key in realising high-performance organic light-emitting devices...|$|E
