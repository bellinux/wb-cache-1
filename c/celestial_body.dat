5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another <b>celestial</b> <b>body.</b> Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another <b>celestial</b> <b>body,</b> while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic {{activity on the}} moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, {{as it was the}} first time an active volcano was observed on a <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> other than Earth. Together, the Voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between the Voyager encounters.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} {{would have}} considered {{a pair of}} objects to be a double planet system if each component independently satisfied the planetary criteria and the common center of gravity of the system (known as the barycenter) was located outside of both bodies. Pluto and Charon {{would have been the}} only known double planet in the Solar System. Other planetary satellites (like Earth and its moon) might be in hydrostatic equilibrium, but would still not have been defined as a component of a double planet, since the barycenter of the system lies within the more massive <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> (the Earth).|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other <b>celestial</b> <b>body.</b> In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> could bear signs of such activity.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, an {{expedition}} led by Vladimir Alexeev with {{scientists from the}} Troitsk Innovation and Nuclear Research Institute (TRINITY) used ground penetrating radar to examine the Suslov crater at the Tunguska site. What they found was that the crater {{was created by the}} violent impact of a <b>celestial</b> <b>body.</b> The layers of the crater consisted of modern permafrost on top, older damaged layers underneath, and finally, deep below, fragments of the <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> were discovered. Preliminary analysis showed that it was a huge piece of ice that shattered on impact, which seem to support the theory that a comet caused the cataclysm. In contrast, in 2013, analysis of fragments from the Tunguska site by a joint US-European team was consistent with an iron meteorite.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, spin-orbit {{coupling}} {{reflects the}} general law of conservation of angular momentum, which holds for celestial systems as well. In simple cases, {{the direction of}} the angular momentum vector is neglected, and the spin-orbit coupling is the ratio between the frequency with which a planet or other <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> spins about its own axis to that with which it orbits another body. This is more commonly known as orbital resonance. Often, the underlying physical effects are tidal forces.|$|E

25|$|As the {{smallest}} known <b>celestial</b> <b>body</b> {{with its own}} ring system, Chariklo and its rings {{are the first to}} have been fully simulated by numerically solving the N-body problem. The assumptions made included the planetoid and ring particles being spherical, and all particles having equal radii between 2.5 and 10m. Depending on parameters, the simulations involved between 21 million and 345 million particles interacting with each other through gravity and collisions. The goal of the simulations was to assess under what conditions the rings remain stable, that is do not cluster into few bigger bodies.|$|E
