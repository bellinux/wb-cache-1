40|$|BACKGROUND: Biological agents offer good {{control of}} {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, but the long-term benefits of achieving low disease activity with a biological agent plus methotrexate or methotrexate alone are unclear. The OPTIMA trial assessed different treatment adjustment strategies {{in patients with}} early rheumatoid arthritis attaining (or not) stable low disease activity with adalimumab plus methotrexate or methotrexate monotherapy. METHODS: This trial was done at 161 sites worldwide. Patients with early (< 1 year duration) rheumatoid arthritis naive to methotrexate were randomly allocated (by interactive voice response system, in a 1 : 1 ratio, block size four) to adalimumab (40 mg every other week) plus methotrexate (initiated at 7 · 5 mg/week, increased by 2 · 5 mg every 1 - 2 weeks to a maximum weekly dose of 20 mg by week 8) or placebo plus methotrexate for 26 weeks (period 1). Patients in the adalimumab plus methotrexate group who <b>completed</b> <b>period</b> 1 and achieved the stable low disease activity target (28 -joint disease activity score with C-reactive protein [DAS 28]< 3 · 2 at weeks 22 and 26) were randomised to adalimumab-continuation or adalimumab-withdrawal for an additional 52 weeks (period 2). Patients achieving the target with initial methotrexate continued methotrexate-monotherapy. Inadequate responders were offered adalimumab plus methotrexate. All patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation in period 1. During period 2, treatment reallocation of patients who achieved the target was masked to patients and investigators; patients who did not achieve the target remained masked to original randomisation, but {{were aware of the}} subsequent assignment. The primary endpoint was a composite measure of DAS 28 of less than 3 · 2 at week 78 and radiographic non-progression from baseline to week 78, compared between adalimumab-continuation and methotrexate-monotherapy. Adverse events were monitored throughout period 2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00420927. FINDINGS: The study was done between Dec 28, 2006, and Aug 3, 2010. 1636 patients were assessed and 1032 were randomised in period 1 (515 to adalimumab plus methotrexate; 517 to placebo plus methotrexate). 466 patients in the adalimumab plus methotrexate group <b>completed</b> <b>period</b> 1; 207 achieved the stable low disease activity target, of whom 105 were rerandomised to adalimumab-continuation. 460 patients in the placebo plus methotrexate group <b>completed</b> <b>period</b> 1; 112 achieved the stable low disease activity target and continued methotrexate-monotherapy. 73 of 105 (70 %) patients in the adalimumab-continuation group and 61 of 112 (54 %) patients in the methotrexate-monotherapy group achieved the primary endpoint at week 78 (mean difference 15 % [95 % CI 2 - 28 %], p= 0 · 0225). Patients achieving the stable low disease activity target on adalimumab plus methotrexate who withdrew adalimumab mostly maintained their good responses. Overall, 706 of 926 patients in period 2 had an adverse event, of which 82 were deemed serious; however, distribution of adverse events did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: Treatment to a stable low disease activity target resulted in improved clinical, functional, and structural outcomes, with both adalimumab-continuation and methotrexate-monotherapy. However, a higher proportion of patients treated with initial adalimumab plus methotrexate achieved the low disease activity target compared with those initially treated with methotrexate alone. Outcomes were much the same whether adalimumab was continued or withdrawn in patients who initially responded to adalimumab plus methotrexate. FUNDING: AbbVie...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to present the current state and basis of {{functioning}} of an academic model of forensic expert activities in Poland and perspectives of their further development. The study material included information obtained from a preliminary survey among regional consultants within the ongoing activities of the national consultant team. The recently <b>completed</b> <b>period</b> of research infrastructure support within the policy of coherence of the European Union contributed to significant advances in scientific-educational potential of the majority of university forensic medicine centres. However, the improved educational base and purchases of new diagnostic devices were not associated with a considerable increase in staff resources of individual units, which finally decides about the renown of the entire discipline. It is necessary to undertake initiatives to highlight the importance of forensic medicine as a separate medical field and to increase the number of physicians starting specialist trainings. A highly profiled nature of the speciality necessitates cooperation with other centres and receptiveness to clinical fields. The establishment of various forms of cooperation is a measure of optimal use of equipment and stimulation of multi-centre research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nutrilon Omneo (new formula; NF) {{contains}} {{high concentration}} of sn- 2 palmitic acid, a mixture of prebiotic oligosaccharides and partially hydrolyzed whey protein. It is hypothesized that NF positively affects stool characteristics in constipated infants. Methods Thirty-eight constipated infants, aged 3 – 20 weeks, were included and randomized to NF (n = 20) or a standard formula (SF; n = 18) in period 1 and crossed-over after 3 weeks to treatment period 2. Constipation was defined {{by at least one}} of the following symptoms: 1) defecation frequency Results Period 1 was completed by 35 infants. A significant increase in defecation frequency (NF: 3. 5 pre versus 5. 6 /week post treatment; SF 3. 6 pre versus 4. 9 /week post treatment) was found in both groups, but was not significantly different between the two formulas (p = 0. 36). Improvement of hard stool consistency to soft stool consistency was found more often with NF than SF, but did not reach statistical significance (90 % versus 50 %; RR, 1. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 9 – 3. 5; p = 0. 14). No difference was found in painful defecation or the presence of an abdominal or rectal mass between the two groups. Twenty-four infants <b>completed</b> <b>period</b> 2. Only stool consistency was significantly different between the two formulas (17 % had soft stools on NF and hard stools on SF; no infants had soft stools on SF and hard stools on NF, McNemar test p = 0. 046). Conclusion The addition of a high concentration sn- 2 palmitic acid, prebiotic oligosaccharides and partially hydrolyzed whey protein resulted in a strong tendency of softer stools in constipated infants, but not in a difference in defecation frequency. Formula transition to NF may be considered as treatment in constipated infants with hard stools. </p...|$|E

Due to marked hepatic transaminase elevations, predominantly with FPV 1, 400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID, the study was terminated prematurely. For FPV 1, 400 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID, the values for plasma amprenavir (APV) area under the concentration-time profile over the dosing interval (τ) at steady state [AUC(0 -τ) ], maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), and plasma concentration at the end of τ at steady state (Cτ) were 54, 81, and 26 % higher, respectively, and the values for plasma RTV AUC(0 -τ), Cmax, and Cτ were 49 % higher, 71 % higher, and 11 % lower, respectively, than those for FPV 700 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID. For FPV 1, 400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID, the values for plasma APV AUC(0 -τ), Cmax, and Cτ were 26, 48, and 32 % higher, respectively, and the values for plasma RTV AUC(0 -τ), Cmax, and Cτ increased 4. 15 -fold, 4. 17 -fold, and 3. 99 -fold, respectively, compared to those for FPV 700 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID. FPV 1, 400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID is not recommended due to an increased rate of marked hepatic transaminase elevations and lack of pharmacokinetic advantage.
