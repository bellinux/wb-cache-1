2500|$|A {{woman named}} Obavva, {{the wife of}} a soldier called Maddha Hanumappa, was {{guarding}} a fort tower, substituting for her husband during a lunch break. She was guarding the Chitradurga Fort at a <b>crack</b> <b>opening,</b> a secret opening where only one person could barely squeeze through. Her heroics have entered the annals of legendary folklore of the Karnataka State. While fetching water, she heard the muted sounds of enemy soldiers attempting to enter the fort through the crevice. With great presence of mind she immediately hid behind the crevice in the fort and hit at each soldier trying to squeeze through the crevice with onake, the name given in Kannada to a masse or pestle, a wooden rod used for pounding paddy. In this process, she bravely killed several enemy soldiers. By the time her husband appeared on the scene, she had already dragged several bodies of dead soldiers into the fort wall and was standing around the dead bodies with the blood stained onake in her hand. Maddha Hanumappa blew the bugle, and other soldiers joined him and killed all the enemy soldiers. This brave act saved the fort on that day from further attacks by Hyder Ali’s soldiers. Her heroic act was commemorated with her impressive statue (sculpted by Ashok Gudigar) erected in front of the District Commissioner’s office in Chittradurga town. The stadium in the town was named after her. This act earned her the epithet [...] "Onake Obavva" [...] and the crevice in the fort where she showed her bravery is called [...] "Onake Kindi". However, in the battle for the fort, Madakari Nayaka V lost and Chitradurga Fort eventually fell to Hyder Ali in 1779.|$|E

The opening and slip displacements increased drastically when the shear strain increased by 0.03, after which the opening and slip displacements of the HP 1 F 1 specimen were {{similar to those of the}} NP 1 F 0 specimen. This means that the resistance provided by steel fibers was significantly degraded due to the large shear strains after this point. The NP 2 F 1 specimen shown in Fig.  9 d exhibited significant differences between the <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> and <b>crack</b> slips. The magnitude of <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> was predominant, while the magnitude of slips was very low. Since the crack angle decreased as the prestress level increased, the slip displacements around the critical diagonal crack seemed to be controlled effectively in the NP 2 F 1 specimen that had the highest prestress level among the specimens.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a finite element approach {{for the analysis of}} the thermo-hygro-mechanical-hydration behaviour of concrete structures. The thermo-hygro component considers the mass balance equation of moisture as well as the enthalpy balance equation, and uses two primary variables, namely the capillary pressure and temperature. Heat of hydration is simulated using the approach of Schlinder and Folliard. The basic mechanical model simulates directional cracking, rough crack closure and crushing using a plastic-damage-contact approach. Hydration dependency is introduced into the mechanical constitutive model. The material data from the Concrack benchmark (CEOS. fr, 2013) are considered with the model. This includes data on adiabatic temperature changes during curing, changing elastic properties during curing, shrinkage and creep. The model, as implemented in the finite element program LUSAS, is used to analyse the Concrack benchmark beam RL 1. Particular attention is paid to <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> and the difference between predicted <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> from analyses with and without time dependent effects. It is concluded that ignoring time dependent effects can result in a significant under-estimate of <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> in the working load range...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (FRC) is now used in special structures subjected to dynamic loads such as airport pavements, highways overlays, bridge decks and machine foundations. The cracking-related phenomena governing the fatigue of concrete underline the potential {{benefit of the}} presence of fibres. Recent investigations have shown that the combination of different fibre types (Hybrid Fibre Reinforced Concrete or HyFRC) provides a higher toughness. In a Hybrid system, microfibres provide reinforcement mechanisms at small to medium <b>crack</b> <b>openings</b> while macro-fibres would carry stresses across cracks at medium to large <b>crack</b> <b>openings.</b> In this study the benefits caused by combination of micro and macro steel-fibres are evaluated under static and fatigue tests carried out on beams under four point bending and on cylinders under direct tension. The results show the mixture of fibre permits a more effective control of the dynamic crack development...|$|R

It is influenced by grain size, loading history,material mechanical properties and load ratio. Also, the slip of crack faces occur at low ΔK and R ratios. Ageing of the specimen also influences the crack closure. Comparing under aged and hyper overaged conditions crack closure due to roughness was greater in under aged specimens in which planar slip dominated.|$|E

50|$|The {{extended}} {{finite element}} method was developed to ease difficulties in solving problems with localized features that are not efficiently resolved by mesh refinement. One of the initial applications was the modelling of fractures in a material. In this original implementation, discontinuous basis functions are added to standard polynomial basis functions for nodes that belonged to elements that are intersected by a crack to provide a basis that included <b>crack</b> <b>opening</b> displacements. A key advantage of XFEM is that in such problems the finite element mesh {{does not need to}} be updated to track the crack path. Subsequent research has illustrated the more general use of the method for problems involving singularities, material interfaces, regular meshing of microstructural features such as voids, and other problems where a localized feature can be described by an appropriate set of basis functions.|$|E

The specimen {{is placed on the}} work table and a notch is created exactly at the centre. The crack should be generated such that the defect length is about half the depth. The load applied on the specimen is generally a three-point bending load. A strain gauge is used to measure the <b>crack</b> <b>opening.</b> Crack tip plastically deforms until a critical point after which a cleavage crack is initiated that may lead to either partial or complete failure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fatigue crack}} growth rate of {{materials}} is shown {{to be dependent on}} the testing conditions like load ratio R and testing temperature. Great interest exists in normalizing this data onto a single curve.
