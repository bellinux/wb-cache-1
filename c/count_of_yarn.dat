40|$|Abstract [...] Traveller has a {{great impact}} on yarn quality {{parameters}} specially hairiness. Yarn quality varies due to different traveller number. The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the winding operation. High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force. This research was established according to yarn parameter of hairiness, U%, IPI, i. e. imperfection index and end breakage rate per 1000 spindle-hr. It is very important for the technologist to understand this and act on them to optimize the yarn production.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method, which {{applied to the}} ring of the ring spinning machine will improve its productivity. Through the system vibra-tion is applied on the ring-traveller, which has effects on the centrifugal force of the traveller and helps the traveller to rotate around ring with intermittent contact. The effect of vibration on yarn tension as well as friction between the ring and the traveler and the corresponding raise in temperature of the ring during spinning are measured. An external facility is designed and incorporated in a miniature ring spinning frame to generate and apply vibration to the ring. The minia-ture ring spinning frame has the facility to vary twist and <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and is modified to vary the spindle speed. Study shows that the ring-traveller friction {{is affected by the}} application of vibration. Results obtained with and without the applications of vibration are compared. It is found that yarn tension and friction between the ring and the traveller reduce significantly {{depending on the type of}} vibration. Therefore it can be concluded that application of vibration may be a way to reduce friction between the ring and the traveler and thus the mechanical process of twisting and winding can be done at higher speed for higher productivity which is a limiting factor of ring spinning system...|$|E

Therefore, it is possible to produce a lightweight denim fabric that actually feels lighter when worn by using the Hanji paper yarn as the weft.
