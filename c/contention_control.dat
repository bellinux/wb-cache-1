In this scenario, the secondary users (SU) are permitted to share spectrum with the licensed primary users (SU) with a strict condition {{that they do not}} cause harmful interference to the cognitive network. In this work, we have proposed an interference model for cognitive radio network that utilizes power or <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> interference management schemes. We derived the probability density function (PDF) with the power control scheme, where the power of transmission of the CR transmitter is guided by the power control law and also with <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> scheme that has a fixed transmission power for all CR transmitter controlled by a <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> protocol. This protocol makes a decision on which CR transmitter can transmit at any point in time. In this work, we have shown that power and <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> schemes are good candidates for interference modeling in cognitive radio system. The impact of the unknown location of the primary receiver on the resulting interference generated by the CR transmitters was investigated and the results shows that the challenges of the hidden primary receivers lead to higher CR-primary interference in respect to higher mean and variance. Finally, the presented results show power control and the <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> scheme are good candidates in reducing the interference generated by the cognitive radio network.

40|$|Abstract—Incorporating {{the concept}} of TCP {{end-to-end}} congestion control for wireless networks {{is one of the}} primary concerns in designing ad hoc networks since TCP was primarily designed and optimized based on the assumptions for wired networks. In this study, our interest lies on tackling the TCP instability and in particular intra-flow instability problem since {{due to the nature of}} applications in multihop ad hoc networks, connection instability or starvation even for a short period of time can have a negative impact on the Quality of Service and may not be acceptable for the end user. Through a detailed analysis, it will be shown that the main causes of TCP intra-flow instability lies in overloading the network by sending more packets than the capacity of the channel. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel cross layer solution called “TCP <b>Contention</b> <b>Control</b> ” that dynamically adjusts the amount of outstanding data in the network based on the level of contention experienced by packets as well as the throughput achieved by connections.

We thus propose a novel medium access method derived from carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) according to distributed strategy update mechanism achieving the Nash equilibrium of random access game. We present a concrete medium access method that adapts to a continuous contention measure called conditional collision probability, stabilizes the network into a steady state that achieves optimal throughput with targeted fairness (or service differentiation), and can decouple <b>contention</b> <b>control</b> from handling failed transmissions.

40|$|Abstract — Intermittently {{connected}} mobile {{networks are}} wireless networks {{where most of}} the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of resources and suffer from <b>contention.</b> <b>Controlled</b> replication or “spraying ” methods can reduce this overhead by distributing a small number of copies to only a few relays, which then “look ” for the destination in parallel as they move into the network. Although such schemes can perform well in scenarios with high mobility (e. g. VANETs), they struggle in situations were mobility is slow and correlated in space and/or time. To route messages efficiently in such networks, we propose a scheme that also distributes a small number of copies to few relays. However, each relay can then forward its copy further using a singlecopy utility-based scheme, instead of naively waiting to deliver it to the destination itself. This scheme exploits all the advantages of controlled replication, but is also able to identify appropriate forwarding opportunities that could deliver the message faster. Simulation results for traditional mobility models, as well as for a more realistic “community-based ” model motivated by real-world traces, indicate that our scheme can outperform existing spraying techniques by up to 20 times in some scenarios.

We first show that approaches based on estimating the number of competing nodes and then setting the contention window size may not converge (and in some cases diverge) because of network dynamics. Then, by studying the optimality condition derived in our prior work [10], we identify two parameters (referred to as control references) that remain approximately constant when the network operates at the optimal operational point, regardless of the number of competing nodes in each AC. We instrument MCC to measure these control references, compare measurement results to their optimal control reference levels, and adjust the packet dequeuing rate from the interface queues in an additiveincrease-multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) fashion and with respect to prespecified bandwidth allocation ratio associated with its AC. In some sense, MCC controls the rate of passing packets from the interface queues to to the MAC access function, and thus practically controls the effective number of competing nodes. We have conducted an extensive simulation study, and demonstrated the superiority of MCC to 802. 11 e in terms of both the achievable network throughput and the capability of achieving proportional bandwidth allocation.

Prioritized channel access is designed in the proposed CREM scheme in order to increase the transmission opportunity of primary stations. Moreover, extended time intervals are granted for primary stations to ensure reliability for data transmission. The enhanced CREM (CREM-E) protocol is proposed to further opportunistically increase the channel utilization of secondary stations.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{benefits}} of multiprogramming in con-ventional systems is to allow effective use of resources. For ex-ample, when one application blocks for I/O, another can use the available CPU time, improving throughput and performance. In a multithreaded environment, contention for resources can lead to substantial interference between applications: an application with dependencies can suffer if a thread holding a critical dependency is not scheduled in time. In the HPC community, this problem is often addressed by reservation-based schedulers such as Gang scheduling. However, such schedulers cannot reap {{the benefits}} of resource multiplexing leading to underutilization of the resources and lower overall throughput of the system. In this paper, we explore the tradeoff between contention and reservation in multithreaded application scheduling on multicore systems. We show that neither approach is optimal under all conditions. We propose <b>Controlled</b> <b>Contention</b> (CC) — a scheduling algorithm that allows <b>controlled</b> <b>contention</b> for resources, allowing the benefits of contention while supporting limited reservation to reduce interference. CC provides around 25 % improvement in relative speedup over the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). We also show that CC can significantly benefit from application-level interference management while providing fairness that is not possible to achieve with application-level adaptation alone. The combined approach (CC with application-level adaptation) provides an average of 21 % improvement in throughput, 35 % improvement in relative speedup and 36 % reduction in energy for the application mixes we consider.
