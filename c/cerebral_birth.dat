40|$|Background As the {{survival}} of very preterm and low-birthweight infants increases, so does the importance of monitoring the birth prevalence of childhood impairments; disease registers provide a means {{to do so for}} these rare conditions. High levels of ascertainment for disease research registers have become increasingly difficult to achieve in the face of additional challenges posed by consent and confidentiality issues. 4 Child - Four Counties Database of Cerebral Palsy, Vision Loss and Hearing Loss in Children has been collecting data and monitoring these three major childhood impairments since 1984. Methods This study used capture-recapture and related techniques to identify areas which are particularly affected by low ascertainment, to estimate the magnitude of missing cases on the 4 Child register and to provide birth prevalence estimates of cerebral palsy which allow for these missing cases. Results Estimates suggest that while overall around 27 % of cerebral palsy cases were not reported to 4 Child, ascertainment for severely motor-impaired children (93 % complete) and those born in two of the four counties was good (Oxfordshire: 90 %, Northamptonshire: 94 %).

Some other causes of cerebral palsy are asphyxia, hypoxia of the brain, birth trauma, premature birth, multiple birth and certain infections in the mother during and before birth. Other major cause of <b>cerebral</b> palsy after <b>birth</b> in developing nations like India is medical neglect.

40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} body {{of literature}} describes compelling evidence that a subset of young children on the autism spectrum show abnormal cerebral growth trajectories.

In addition, some affected children display patches of abnormal laminar positioning of cortical projection neurons. As both cortical projection neuron numbers and their correct layering within the developing cortex requires the undisturbed proliferation of neural progenitors, it appears that neural progenitors lie in the center of the autism pathology associated with early brain overgrowth.
