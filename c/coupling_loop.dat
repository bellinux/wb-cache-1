5000|$|Coupling {{between two}} or more qubits is {{essential}} to implement many-qubit gates. The two basic coupling mechanisms are the direct inductive coupling and coupling via a microwave resonator. In the direct coupling, the circulating currents of the qubits inductively affect one another - clockwise current in one qubit induces counter-clockwise current in the other. In the Pauli Matrices formalism, a [...] term appears in the Hamiltonian, essential for the controlled NOT gate implementation. The direct coupling might be further enhanced by kinetic inductance, if the qubit loops are made to share an edge, so that the currents will flow through the same superconducting line. Inserting a Josephson junction on that joint line will add a Josephson inductance term, and increase the coupling even more. To implement a switchable coupling in the direct coupling mechanism, as required to implement a gate of finite duration, an intermediate <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> may be used. The control magnetic flux applied to the coupler loop switches the coupling on and off, as implemented, for example, in the D-Wave Systems machines. The second method of coupling utilizes an intermediate microwave cavity resonator, commonly implemented in a coplanar waveguide geometry. By tuning the energy separation of the qubits to match {{the one of the}} resonator, the phases of the loop currents are synchronized, and a [...] coupling is implemented. Tuning the qubits in and out of resonance (for example, by modifying their bias magnetic flux) controls the duration of the gate operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{voltage on}} a single-turn loop inside an {{enclosure}} characterizes the enclosure shielding effectiveness against a lightning insult. In this paper, the maximum induced voltage on a single-turn loop inside an enclosure from lightning coupling to a metal enclosure wall {{is expressed in}} terms of two multiplicative factors: (A) the normalized enclosure wall peak penetration ratio (i. e., ratio of the peak interior electric field multiplied by the sheet conductance to the exterior magnetic field) and (B) the DC voltage on an ideal optimum <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> assuming the ideal penetration ratio of one. As a result of the decomposition, the variation of the peak penetration ratio (A) for different coupling mechanisms is found to be small; the difference in the maximum voltage hence arises from the DC voltage on the optimum <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> (B). Maximum voltages on an optimum <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> inside a finite cylinder enclosure for direct attachment and a lightning line source at different distances from the enclosure are given in Table 3. 1...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Because of its characteristics, the square-loop {{magnetic}} core {{can be used}} as the basic device in a logic system. A magnetomotive force (mmf) which is below the threshold mmf of such a core will cause a negligible, nonpermanent amount of flux change in the core; and information signals can be distinguished by the amount of flux change they produce in the core. The remanent flux in a {{magnetic core}} can be in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, and the binary information signals ONE and ZERO can be represented by these two directions of flux. The transfer of information in a logic system will introduce noise and cause losses, and the ability of the circuits in a system to respond properly to degraded signals will be determined largely by the transfer characteristics of the circuits. The transfer process is shown to be basically identical for three examples of magnetic-core shift registers, and it is shown that there must be an imbalance of the number of turns on the windings in the <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> between a transmitting and a receiving core. For economic reasons this winding imbalance is undesirable, and a circuit requiring only single-turn windings in the <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> is proposed. An experimental investigation of the proposed circuit showed that its transfer characteristics are determined by the resistance and inductance in the <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> and the amplitude of the current pulse driving the circuit. Voltage waveforms of the circuit seem to indicate that the inductance, which is normally assumed to be detrimental to the circuit operation, might have an optimum value which would be beneficial to the transfer process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{biological}} networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, signaling networks, and metabolic {{networks have}} topological {{characteristics of a}} scale-free degree distribution. Preferential attachment has been considered as the most plausible evolutionary growth model to explain this topological property. Although various studies have been undertaken to investigate the structural characteristics of a network obtained using this growth model, its dynamical characteristics have received relatively less attention. Results In this paper, {{we focus on the}} robustness of a network that is acquired during its evolutionary process. Through simulations using Boolean network models, we found that preferential attachment increases the number of <b>coupled</b> feedback <b>loops</b> in the course of network evolution. Whereas, if networks evolve to have more <b>coupled</b> feedback <b>loops</b> rather than following preferential attachment, the resulting networks are more robust than those obtained through preferential attachment, although both of them have similar degree distributions. Conclusion The presented analysis demonstrates that <b>coupled</b> feedback <b>loops</b> may {{play an important role in}} network evolution to acquire robustness. The result also provides a hint as to why various biological networks have evolved to contain a number of <b>coupled</b> feedback <b>loops.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic loop type input {{couplers}} {{are used}} for coupling rf power from waveguides to the storage ring cavities: In a high rf power and high beam current accelerating cavity, the change in beam loading results in high reflected power due to input rf mismatch.

The input mismatch results in poor rf power efficiency and overheating of the ceramic window in the coupler. Therefore, coupling through the <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> must be adjustable for maximum operating power efficiency and coupler reliability. The adjustment of coupling {{can be made by}} changing the magnetic flux linkage through the loop area.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a model for}} two lasers that are mutually coupled optoelectronically by modulating the pump of one laser with the intensity deviations of the other. Signal propagation time in the optoelectronic loop causes a significant delay leading to the onset of oscillatory output. Multiscale perturbation methods are {{used to describe the}} amplitude and period of oscillations {{as a function of the}} coupling strength and delay time. For weak coupling the oscillations have the laser’s relaxation period, and the amplitude varies as the one-fourth power of the parameter deviations from the bifurcation point. For order-one coupling strength the period is determined as multiples of the delay time, and the amplitude varies with a square-root power law. Because we allow for independent control of the individual coupling constants, for certain parameter values there is an atypical amplitude-resonance phenomena. Finally, our theoretical results are consistent with recent experimental observations when the inclusion of a low-pass filter in the <b>coupling</b> <b>loop</b> is taken into account...|$|E
