25|$|So practically, at 1 {{o'clock in}} the noon, the battle ended. Although Görgei, at sunrise, than his chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer at 9 o'clock, sent order to Lieutenant-Colonel Ernő Poeltenberg, the new {{commander}} of the VII. corps (taking the place of General András Gáspár, who not long before went on permission) to <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> from Perbete, where they were stationed to Komárom. Poeltenberg hurried as he could, but his troops movements were slowed {{by the fact that}} the roads were flooded because of the spring rains, and when they arrived to the northern shores of the Danube, the raft bridge improvised by Görgei's sappers almost crumbled, and had to be strengthened before they accomplished the crossing o the Southern shores of the river. So Poeltenberg's two Hussar regiments and cavalry batteries arrived only at 3 o'clock to the battlefield, when the battle was already over, while the infantry divisions arrived only in the evening, but they departed in that night towards Győr, to pursue the enemy, and to occupy that very important city.|$|E
25|$|Booth’s {{earliest}} cricket {{was played}} at Fulneck School, and {{later he was}} associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and {{of which he was}} captain. He appeared regularly for Yorkshire Second Eleven in 1907 and the two following seasons, and in 1908 received his first trial for the county against Somerset at Dewsbury without success. He did not, however, secure a regular place in the team until two years later, but in 1911 he scored 1,125 runs for his county and took seventy-four wickets, with a highest innings of 210 against Worcestershire on the Worcester ground. Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and in 1913 made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting – it was said during the 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work – but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth’s claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. Possessed of a free, natural action, he made the ball <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to <b>come</b> <b>quickly,</b> he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E

500|$|Angel {{has said}} that, [...] "I {{stayed away from}} magicians when I was younger because I didn't want to think like them and wanted to create my own style." [...] His first {{television}} appearance was in 1994, where he performed {{as a part of}} a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, [...] "Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can’t <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> enough." [...] During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Conjuring in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a ten-minute show over the course of the [...] "World of Illusion" [...] conference in Madison Square Garden, performing sixty shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website.|$|E

2500|$|Cognitive errors {{commonly}} {{encountered in}} medicine were initially identified by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman {{in the early}} 1970s. Jerome Groopman, author of How Doctors Think, says these are [...] "cognitive pitfalls", biases which cloud our logic. For example, a practitioner may overvalue the first data encountered, skewing his thinking (or recent or dramatic cases which <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> to mind and may color judgement). Another pitfall is where stereotypes may prejudice thinking.|$|E

2500|$|On April 23, 1971 the Lady Audette radioed the trawler Apollo III, {{addressing}} its captain Roméo Michon: [...] "Roméo, <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> to us, we are sinking." [...] The Lady Audette {{is believed}} to have inexplicably sunk near the Rochers aux Oiseaux off Magdalen Islands, and could not be found. Three men drowned but, unlike the sinking of her sister ship, there were also four or five survivors. Two years later, the wreckage was discovered.|$|E

Their first single for the label [...] "Laura" [...] (with two different music videos) had a limited release in 2003 and reaching number 54 in the UK Singles Chart, receiving little attention with the exceptions of British music paper New Musical Express, Channel 4's entertainment programme V Graham Norton, and the same channel's music programme Popworld for which they were interviewed. The track also received much radio play in Australia. Their track [...] "It Can't <b>Come</b> <b>Quickly</b> Enough" [...] was also included on the soundtrack of the film Party Monster (2003), playing over its ending credits.|$|E
2500|$|After General Liu's flight, {{the remains}} of his party wandered about the city {{not knowing what to}} do, until the foreigners, afraid that they would begin plundering, managed to persuade them to lay down their arms. [...] This {{operation}} took the whole of one day, between 7,000 and 8,000 rifles being eventually placed in secure custody. [...] Then two English missionaries, Messrs. Fergusson and Barclay, went to the Japanese headquarters a few miles south of the city, bearing a letter from the Chinese residents saying that the soldiers had all laid down their arms and disappeared, and asking the Japanese to <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> and enforce order. [...] General Nogi entered the city on 21 October {{and the rest of the}} army soon followed. [...] Thus Formosa came into our possession in reality as well as in name.|$|E

2500|$|A {{tradition}} {{recorded in}} 1693 is that Hathaway [...] "greatly desired" [...] {{to be buried}} with her husband. In fact she was interred in a separate grave {{next to him in}} the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. The inscription states, [...] "Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years." [...] A Latin inscription followed which translates as [...] "Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give. Woe is me– for how great a boon shall I give stones? How much rather would I pray that the good angel should move the stone so that, like Christ's body, thine image might come forth! But my prayers are unavailing. <b>Come</b> <b>quickly,</b> Christ, that my mother, though shut within this tomb may rise again and reach the stars." [...] The inscription may have been written by John Hall on behalf of his wife, Anne's daughter, Susanna.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 I was a {{relatively}} new and young bishop when the now famous Conference of Bishops was convened at the Antiochian Village, and so together with another young bishop, His Grace Seraphim of Ottawa and Canada, I {{was appointed to the}} Conference's secretariat. Ligonier '94 was without doubt one of the brightest momentsif not THE brightest momentin the history of Holy Orthodoxy in the New World. Dozens of bishops met and prayed and deliberated on that Pennsylvania mountain-top, while hundreds of thousands of our young people across the continent prayed and fasted that we might accomplish a good for Holy Orthodoxy. And, by God's grace, a great good was indeed accomplished! The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly and all too quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be slammed shut once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again. May that breeze <b>come</b> <b>quickly!</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|While closed parishes {{around the}} diocese celebrated the Vatican decree, which struck down Lennon's ruling on both {{procedural}} and substantive grounds, the diocese waited to receive official notification from the Apostolic Nunciature. By March 8, 20122012-03-08, Tayek explained {{he was told}} the documents had been delivered Wednesday but were subsequently identified as only unofficial copies of the documents. 'The Diocese of Cleveland is awaiting official word from the Vatican concerning any decrees. We first must see the official documents in order to review them and understand what exactly is being said; only then can a response be determined,' diocesan officials said in a prepared statement. Even when the documents are received, a response from the diocese {{is not likely to}} <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> because they will first need to be translated into English from Latin, the official language of the Church. The documents must also be reviewed by the bishop and canon lawyers before a statement is issued from the diocese, which can appeal the reversal to the Church's top court in Rome.}} In what could be described as an example of , Tayek pointed out, [...] "Someone in the Vatican gave {{at least a couple of}} the documents involved to Peter Borre, and he evidently shared them" [...] in what Tayek described as part of a [...] "really unusual" [...] situation.|$|E

2500|$|Albert Einstein, himself one of {{the founders}} of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more {{philosophical}} or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of determinism and of causality. He is famously quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, [...] "God does not play with dice". He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. In that view, he is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which remains invariant under arbitrary choice of configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. He also held that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words, he insisted on the principle of locality. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He considered that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not <b>come</b> <b>quickly</b> or easily. The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox.|$|E
