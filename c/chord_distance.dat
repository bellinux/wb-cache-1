They wanted these figures to be decided upon for the upcoming construction of the A1 aircraft for Krokus-Einsatz (Operation Crocus), the field deployment of the Natter. The position of the centre of gravity is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} <b>chord</b> (<b>distance</b> between the leading and trailing edges) of the main wing. Thus 0% is the leading edge and 100% is the trailing edge. In the manned glider trials the centre of gravity had been varied between 20 and 34%. At a meeting of engineers held on 8 February, the variations in the centre of gravity expected in the A1 Krokus machine were discussed. At take-off with the weight of the four solid boosters, the centre of gravity would be brought back to 65%, but after releasing these rockets it would move forwards to 22%. The free flight by Zübert on 14 February had showed unequivocally that the little Natter had excellent flying characteristics as a glider. The centre of gravity problem was solved initially by the addition of one-metre-square auxiliary tailfins that were released simultaneously with the jettisoning of the boosters. The Krokus aircraft had vanes that would direct the Walter rocket exhaust gases so as to assist vehicle stabilisation at low speed similar to those used in the V-2 rocket.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Methods of {{interpreting}} pollen assemblages in sediment were examined using surface samples from 66 small forest hollows in Michigan and Wisconsin. All canopy {{trees in the}} surrounding 50 m were measured to provide detailed information about the source vegetation of each surface pollen assemblage. Basal area of trees in each forest sample was used to classify them into six stand types: hemlock-dominated, sugar maple/hemlock mixed, sugar maple-dominated, and ash-, oak-, and pine-dominated stands. Various statistical procedures were tested to learn which was most successful in sorting the pollen assemblages into appropriate vegetation groups. Two ordination techniques – detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) – give similar overall results, although CVA more successfully separated assemblages from hemlock stands from those of sugar maple-dominated stands. Squared <b>chord</b> <b>distance,</b> 0. 05 also successfully identified samples from the same forest type. After stand dominants have been identified from pollen assem-blages using multivariate methods, a further determination of stand composition is sometimes possible using ratios of pollen counts of individual taxa. Ratios can be calibrated by comparison with species abundances around surface samples. For instance, ratios of pine to hemlock pollen can indicate the abundance of pine within a stand dominated by hemlock, whereas pine pollen percentages alone are affected by variable abundance of other species.

This method uses a sum-of-squares test (Qb) based on the dissimilarity between groups, including a test of multiple contrasts (Pillar and Orlóci 1996). Before the analysis, species richness was rarefied {{by the number of}} individuals recorded (performed using the PAST statistical package; Hammer et al. 2001), and the abundance recorded on each transect (ordinary abundance being the number of contacts per transect) was standardized to the sampled area and survey effort (standardized abundance[*]=[*]individuals[*]·[*][10  km 2]− 1 [*]·[*]h− 1), with area indicating the sampled area and time indicating the survey effort. We created a matrix of Euclidian distances to species richness and a matrix of <b>chord</b> <b>distances</b> to the abundance as dissimilarity matrixes and ran 9, 999 random permutations to calculate the sum of squares and probability p (Qb 0 [*]≥[*]QbA). The probability p is a proportion of the sum of squares calculated in each iteration (Qb 0) that is {{greater than or equal to}} the sum of squares calculated for the sample (QbA). We found differences in raptor abundances among areas (p[*]≤[*] 0.05), so the test between methods was performed as a block design, with permutations restricted to each sample.

In this study, we examined the foraging guild structure of birds breeding in forests on three continents - Europe, North America, and Australia, with largely phylogenetically distinct avifaunas. We examined two hypotheses: (1) the bird assemblages in the three geographically separated forested study sites should have similar foraging guild patterns {{to the extent to which}} environmental resources of these forests are similar, and (2) if bird assemblages in structurally similar forest habitats have undergone adaptive evolution, then radiation of species into guilds should have been caused by analogous selective resource gradients (factors). Bootstrapped cluster analysis (UPGMA) and bootstrapped principal coordinate analysis (BPCoA) of <b>chord</b> <b>distances</b> were employed to determine foraging guild structure for each assemblage, and to extract the significantly different factors responsible for segregation of species into guilds. Cluster analyses identified three analogous foraging guilds (ground and litter foragers, foliage gleaners, and trunk foragers) in each of the bird assemblages, supporting the first hypothesis of guild structure convergence. The BPCoA determined that two environmental factors (vertical resource allocation and spatial tree morphology gradients) were primarily responsible for segregation of species into guilds in these three geographically distant but structurally similar forests. These findings support the hypothesis that guild structures in forest bird assemblages largely reflect the similarities and differences in forest structure and the distribution and abundance of foraging resources, and result from largely adaptive evolution...|$|R

The lowest-elevation sites had the highest Expected Heterozygosity (HE) values (range 0. 54 – 0. 65). AMOVA results indicated the presence of statistically significant amounts of variation within each level when populations were analyzed as one group or when they were grouped either by river basin or by their position on the east or west side of the Rocky Mountains.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of GeographyKendra K. McLauchlanFossil pollen assemblages {{are widely}} used in paleoenvironmental {{reconstruction}} of vegetation regimes and climate conditions. The modern analog technique (MAT) is a popular method used for analysis of these fossil pollen assemblages, but a large modern pollen dataset, such as the North American Pollen Database (NAPD), is needed to provide modern comparisons for interpretation of analog/no-analog situations. While many climate types are well represented within the NAPD, the climates of the southern and central Great Plains of North America are poorly represented. In this study, I collected 31 sediment samples containing pollen from these underrepresented climate types across the Great Plains in the U. S. A. Analysis of these 31 pollen assemblages, along with 504 samples classified as “prairie” from the NAPD and 24 pollen samples from the Flint Hills of Kansas, U. S. A. was conducted {{to determine if the}} three major prairie types (short grass, mixed grass, and tallgrass prairies) could be delineated from pollen records alone. Two different MAT dissimilarity metrics (Squared <b>Chord</b> <b>Distance</b> and Canberra Distance Metric) were assessed for their ability to delineate among prairie types and Squared <b>Chord</b> <b>Distance</b> (SCD) was found to a be the better prairie type classifier than Canberra Distance Metric (CDM).

Using the ratio of the proportions of Ambrosia and Artemisia pollen grains in a pollen assemblage it was found that tallgrass prairies are significantly different from the other two prairie types.

Nineteen microsatellite markers (loci) provide information on genetic variation and differentiation among studied breeds. High differentiation index (FST) and Cavalli-Sforza <b>chord</b> <b>distances</b> give genetic differentiation among breeds, including Lanyu’s inbred populations. Inbreeding values (FIS) show that Lanyu and its derived inbred breeds have significant loss of heterozygosity.

The testing assigned 99 % of the animals successfully into their correct reference populations based on 9 to 14 markers ranking D-scores, allelic number, expected heterozygosity (HE) or FST, respectively. All miss-assigned individuals came from close lineage Lanyu breeds. To improve individual assignment among close lineage breeds, microsatellite markers selected from Lanyu populations with high polymorphic, heterozygosity, FST and D-scores were used. Only 6 to 8 markers ranking HE, FST or allelic number were required to obtain 99 % assignment accuracy.
