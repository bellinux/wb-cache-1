5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>reduce</b> the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E

30|$|The ideal AFC {{solution}} {{in the new}} binaural configuration could be identified but a steady-state analysis showed that the AFC suffers from a bias in its optimum (Wiener) solution. This bias, similar to the unilateral case, {{is due to the}} correlation between feedback and external source signals. It was also demonstrated theoretically as well as experimentally that a signal enhancement algorithm <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>reducing</b> this bias. The correlation between feedback and external source signals also causes a bias of the BAF solution. But contrary to the bias encountered by the AFC, the BAF bias increases with increasing HA amplification levels. Fortunately, this bias can be reduced by applying AFC on the sensor signals directly, instead of applying it on the BAF outputs.|$|R
