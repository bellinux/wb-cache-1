The resulting planner is proved correct (it finds good plans), complete (it can find all possible plans with appropriate control) and shall always stop with a solution if there exists one. Moreover, this planner avoids some looping problems of TWEAK. This planner is implemented in Prolog and Lisp...|$|R

30|$|In a {{production}} or service system all processes are related with its predecessor and successor if available. Each process has a limited production capacity within its constraints. In almost all cases {{there is only}} one process that limits or restricts the performance of entire <b>system</b> (<b>Chapman</b> 2005). Theory of constraints is {{based on the premise that}} the rate of goal achievement by a goal oriented system is limited by at least one constraint and adopts the common idiom as “a chain is no stronger than its weakest link”. That is to say systems or part of systems are vulnerable because the weakest element or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the output. In other words if there was no obstacle that prevents a system from achieving higher throughput, its throughput would be infinite which is not possible in a real-life system. Overall throughput can be increased only by increasing the flow through the constraint (Goldratt and Cox 1984).|$|R

Formulation of the problem. Different variants of fault-tolerant redundant configurations and maintenance strategies provide equivalent {{mean time to failure}} indexes, {{but at the same time}} have different values of the probability of failure-free operation at given operation time value.

Carrying this research was made possible after the development of fault-tolerant systems models Kolmogorov - <b>Chapman</b> differential equation <b>systems.</b> Comparison of the reliability of uninterruptible power supply with different tolerant configurations. The quantitative difference between reliability indexes (operation time where probability of failure-free operation is not less than 0. 99) of corrective and ventive maintenance is shown.

Reliability analysis of fault-tolerant systems shows that the strategy of rective maintenance has higher values of operation time where probability of failure-free eration is not less than 0. 99. ? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ?????????????

25|$|Up {{until this}} point, for an attacking player to be onside, {{there had to}} be at least three {{opposing}} players closer to their goal-line than the attacker. In the 1920s, the offside rule was changed so that only two opposing players were required between the attacker and the goal-line for the attacker to still be onside. This made it easier for attackers to score against the two-man defences of the day. To combat this, Arsenal manager Herbert <b>Chapman</b> devised a <b>system</b> that utilised three defenders as opposed to the usual two. This system was complemented by a strict man-marking regime, whereby the centre-half – who had now retreated to the centre of the three man defence – would stick as close to the opposing centre-forward as possible, while the full-backs – who had moved further wide to accommodate the centre-back – would mark the wingers. This left two mid-fielders in a slightly less advanced position than before to act as wing-halves who would have the dual responsibility of loosely marking the inside forwards and providing the forwards with the ball. This was helped by the slight withdrawal of the inside forwards from the front line. Chapman's formation was referred to as the W–M formation due to its appearance on the field with all the players in their described positions.|$|R
5000|$|Tropical {{forests are}} some of the most {{beautiful}} and biodiverse ecosystem on the face of the planet, yet they are gravely threatened. Recent global assessments report that 2.3 million km2 of forest was lost between 2000 and 2012 and in the tropics forest loss increased by 2101 km2 per year. [...] Ultimately, changes in forest cover are driven by increased human population size and natural resource consumption rates. In African countries with tropical forest, human population density increased from 8 people per km2 in 1950 to 35 people per km2 in 2010. [...] This increasingly dire situation not only threatens biodiversity, but it is clear that extreme poverty and this rapid loss of biodiversity are intimately linked, with extreme poverty and biodiversity hotspots being geographically coincident. The people living next to tropical protected areas {{are some of}} the poorest people in the world and suffer from often acute health problems. For example, in Uganda the country that Chapman has worked in for the last 27+ years, 30% of all deaths among children between the ages of 2 and 4 are caused by malaria, a disease that could be easily treated or prevented; and 26% of children under the age of five are malnourished. [...] This situation means that for effective conservation to occur the local community must be involved, which often means they receive benefits. <b>Chapman</b> has implemented <b>systems</b> that link health provision and conservation. Receiving money or employment from the park is definitely beneficial and appreciated, but saving the life of a young child suffering from malaria is enormous and its benefit unmeasurable to the parent. Chapman, first established a clinic to meet the health needs of the local people and subsequently since Kibale is large and many people could not travel to the clinic, he brought an ambulance from Canada to Kibale to act as a mobile clinic. The Mobile Health Clinic travels around the park, bringing basic health care, family planning, deworming, HIV/AIDS treatment and counselling, vaccinations, and health and conservation education to remote villagers. The staff also provide public talks on disease prevention. Chapman has taken this sort of approach of working with the local community to help them obtain the needs they identify, while still administering strict wildlife protection in all of his conservation efforts.|$|R
