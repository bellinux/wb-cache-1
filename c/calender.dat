5|$|This {{same period}} of {{economic}} and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of the}} second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes <b>Calender</b> in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes <b>Calender</b> (1579).|$|E

A particular pattern was printed on PET film by means of roll-to-roll gravure printing machine. The <b>calendering</b> process was applied {{to a set of}} samples and the effect was analyzed after measuring the surface roughness and the thickness of pattern. Although only mechanical pressure provided by a nip roll was applied during the <b>calendering</b> process, the experimental results indicate that the <b>calendering</b> process should be useful for enhancing the surface quality of roll-to-roll printed electronics products...|$|R

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the <b>calender</b> rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the <b>calender</b> rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E

Co-extrudates with a metoprolol tartrate-loaded sustained-release core and a hydrochlorothiazide-loaded immediate-release coat were produced and immediately shaped into a monolithic drug delivery system via <b>calendering,</b> using chilled rolls with tablet-shaped cavities. In vitro metoprolol tartrate release from the ethylcellulose core of the <b>calendered</b> tablets was prolonged in comparison with the sustained release of a multiparticulate dosage form, prepared manually by cutting co-extrudates into mini-matrices. Analysis of the dosage forms using X-ray micro-computed tomography only detected small differences between the pore structure of the core of the <b>calendered</b> tablet and the mini-matrices. Diffusion path length was shown to be the main mechanism behind the release kinetics. Terahertz pulsed imaging visualized that adhesion between the core and coat of the <b>calendered</b> tablet was not complete and a gradient in coat thickness (varying from 200 to 600 μm) was observed.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the same Si/alloy {{electrode}} material showed very different electrochemical behavior with different <b>calendering.</b> All the <b>calendered</b> electrode cells showed stable cycling behavior compared to the not-pressed electrode cell, but the overall capacity was lower with increasing <b>calendering</b> pressure due to reduced electrolyte wettability. Although the capacities are lowered, the stable cycle behavior with <b>calendering</b> would also make it easier to design high-density full cell batteries. In this case, 3 -ton pressed Si/alloy electrode cell with a considerable capacity tradeoff showed high density and excellent cycle stability compared to the not-pressed Si/alloy electrode cell. Electrodes densification improves the particle-to-particle connections with pressing. However, the electrochemical performance is affected due to reduced electrolyte wettability and reduced electrochemical activity indicating the need for densification control and wettability optimization. Si/alloy electrodes with 5 and 8 tons pressed also showed stable cycling, but the capacities are very low to be considered. Therefore, optimization and balancing between the <b>calendering</b> pressure and electrolyte wettability property can help tune to the best electrochemical properties of the battery materials.|$|R
40|$|Controlling the {{wettability}} {{between the}} porous electrode and the electrolyte in lithium ion batteries can improve both {{the manufacturing process}} and the electrochemical performance of the cell. The wetting rate, which is the electrolyte transport rate in the porous electrode, can be quantified using the wetting balance. The effect of the <b>calendering</b> process on the wettability of anode electrodes was investigated. A graphite anode film with an as-coated thickness of 59 μm was used as baseline electrode film and was <b>calendered</b> to produce films with thickness ranging from 55 to 41 µm. Results show that wettability is improved by light <b>calendering</b> from an initial thickness of 59 μm to a <b>calendered</b> thickness of 53 μm where the wetting rate increased from 0. 375 to 0. 589 mm/s 0. 5. Further <b>calendering</b> below 53 µm resulted in a decrease in wetting rates to a minimum observed value of 0. 206 mm/s 0. 5 at a <b>calendered</b> thickness of 41 μm. Under the same electrolyte, wettability of the electrode is controlled {{to a great extent}} by the pore structure in the electrode film which includes parameters such as porosity, pore size distribution, pore geometry and topology. Relations between the wetting behavior and the pore structure as characterized by mercury intrusion and electron microscopy exist and can be used to manipulate the wetting behavior of electrodes...|$|R
