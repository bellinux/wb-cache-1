30|$|Probiotics are viable {{microorganisms}} gaining {{importance for}} optimum health benefits {{to alleviate the}} gut related disorders and modulate immune response (Morelli and Capurso 2012). Generally, commercialized probiotic products invariably consist of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and also some yeasts for positive outcomes (Devi et al. 2015; Hudson et al. 2016; Shokri et al. 2015). The probiotic activity is shown by inhibiting the adherence of previously harbored bacteria, changing luminal pH, and reinforcing the body’s natural defense by producing antibacterial peptides (Marchesi et al. 2015). In recent days, some clinical practitioners have begun to use probiotics {{for the treatment of}} many diseases (Hickson 2013; Hungin et al. 2013). The comparable outcome of the data between the in vitro models and in vivo human trials has substantiated that more attention on the strain specificity, therapeutic potential and promising methodologies in culturing the strains has to be paid to meet the commercial demand (Shanahan et al. 2012). The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics, states that any commercialized product or even marketable probiotic product must contain at least 106 – 107 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>unit)</b> of viable probiotic per gram of the product during the time of consumption to exert probiotic effects on human health (Hill et al. 2014).|$|E

In this study, different thicknesses of silver nanoparticles with proper adhesion were deposited on poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) and polyethersulfone (PES) surfaces by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The crystalline and structural properties of modified and pure membranes were investigated by carrying out X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were employed to examine the surface morphology and the bacteria anti-adhesion property of the membranes. The morphology measurements confirmed that even though after silver grafting the surface became more hydrophobic, the homogeneity increased and the flux reduction decreased after coating. Moreover a comparison between PVDF and PES revealed that <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>units)</b> reduced 64. 5 % on PVDF surface and 31. 1 % on PES surface after modification.

The present article deals with preliminary studies on the effects of some LAB inocula (Lactobacillus alimentarius or Pediococcus pentosaceus) on fermenting sour cabbage. The effect of LAB on yeast growth, a problem in sour vegetables, was also studied {{through the use}} of dual yeast and LAB inocula. The pH of cabbage juice decreased to levels under pH 4 during the first 10 days of fermentation, which is near the final values, pediococci decreasing the pH to the lowest values. The LAB count in inoculated cabbages increased by 0. 5 - 2. 0 log <b>cfu</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>unit)</b> /g during the first 10 days of fermentation and thereafter decreased. Pediococci formed predominant part of microbial flora almost in all experimental batches. In cabbage challenged with yeasts, yeast counts rose only when the pH was < 3. 5. Yeasts appeared almost regularly also in cabbages inoculated only with LAB. Pediococci fermented cabbage effectively decreasing the pH to lower levels than lactobacilli or natural LAB. However, too strong a decrease in pH may result in a decrease of LAB count which may subsequently lead to yeast growth. The yeast problem could not be solved with the LAB inocula used in our study. ...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{presence}} of Candida albicans in extensive carious lesions before and after treatment of the carious lesions and to evaluate the carriage of Candida albicans in children with and without caries. Materials and methods: The study was conducted on 60 childrens who were divided into two groups: Experimental group (group 1) and controlled group (group 2). Each group was further divided into 3 subgroups according to the dentition as: Group A (Deciduous), group B (Mixed) and group C (Permanent). Swab samples for mycological studies were collected from the dorsum of the tongue, vestibular sulcus and peak of the palatal vault. All samples were cultured directly on SDA plate (Sabouraud’s dextrose agar). Number of Candida colonies was determined by counting colony forming unit on SDA plates. Further identification of Candida albicans was done by germ-tube test and corn-meal agar. Result: Overall prevalence of Candida albicans carriage was significantly higher and mean value of Candida albicans <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>unit)</b> was remarkably higher in group 1 (experimental group) as compare to group 2 (control group). Significant reduction in the frequency and mean value of Candida albicans CFU/plate was seen in children after treatment of carious lesions.

The in situ total metabolic activity of C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata biofilms was determined using 2, 3 -(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulphophenyl) - 5 - [(phenylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay, and the number of cultivable cells was also established by <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>unit)</b> counts.

Aim of the study: The research objective was to evaluate the extent of mycological air pollution in selected student hostels at Wroclaw, through {{the determination of the}} species number and species composition of the fungi assemblages found there, using different culture media. Material and methods: Air samples were taken from 15 selected rooms of the student hostels at Wroclaw. To examine the air, the impact method was used in Air Ideal 3 P sampler, using two different culture media: Sabouraud Agar and Czapek-Dox Agar. Results: Mycological air pollution analysis has shown that <b>CFU</b> (<b>Colony</b> <b>Forming</b> <b>Unit)</b> values for different culture media varied, and that in many cases these differences were statistically significant. For Sabouraud Agar the CFU values in 1 m 3 ranged from 184 to 889, and for Czapek-Dox Agar – they were 139 to 978. The most ubiquitous fungi isolated from both the culture media were Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium herbarium and Candida albicans. The temperature in the rooms from which the air was sampled oscillated between 22. 3 and 24. 5 °C, whereas their humidity was 35. 5 to 49. 2 %.

The study sample comprises 60 children who fit with the criteria. 30 subjects as a control group (rinsed with distilled water) and 30 subjects as a treatment group (rinsed with lime extract 40 %). Each sample was given the same intervention, the first step was the collection of saliva before intervention (pretest), in the second step, subjects were given 10 ml of lime extract 40 % to rinse their mouth for about 30 seconds. After that, saliva was collected twice in 15 minutes (post 1) and 30 minutes (post 2) after rinse. Furthermore, saliva was taken to the laboratory to count the number of colonies of mutans streptococci bacteria using the Colony Counter method and measured in <b>CFU</b> (<b>Colony</b> <b>Forming</b> <b>Unit).</b> Data processing and analysis was done using the SPSS 22. 0 software for windows version. Results: The results of repeated ANOVA and paired t-test showed a significant reduction of the number of mutans streptococci colonies from before rinse to 30 minutes after rinse with lime extract 40 %. The number of bacterial colonies on the pre was 72. 23 CFU, on post 1 as 103. 36 CFU, and the post 2 was 14. 03 CFU. Statistical value showed p = 0. 000, that means th...|$|E
40|$|The Red River is {{the second}} largest river in Viet Nam and {{constitutes}} the main water source for {{a large percentage of}} the population of North Viet Nam. Here we present the results of an annual survey of Escherichia coli (EC) and Total Coliforms (TC) in the Red River basin, North Viet Nam. The objective of this work was to obtain information on faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) numbers over an annual cycle and, secondly, to determine the die-off rates of these bacterial indicators. Monthly observations at 10 stations from July 2013 -June 2014 showed that TC and EC reached as high as 39100 <b>cfu</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>units)</b> 100 ml(- 1) and 15300 colonies 100 ml(- 1), respectively. We observed a significant seasonal differencefor TC (p < 0. 05) with numbers being higher during the wet season. In contrast, no significant seasonal difference was found for EC. The FIB die-off rates ranged from 0. 01 d(- 1) to a maximum of 1. 13 d(- 1) for EC and from 0. 17 d(- 1) to 1. 33 d(- 1) for TC. Die-off rates were significantly higher for free bacteria than for total (free + particle attached) bacteria, suggesting that particle attachment provided a certain level of protection to FIB in this system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to adapt MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl {{tetrazolium}} bromide] colorimetric assay (MCA) (Wang et al., 2010) for determination of lactic acid bacteria cell count. Our study is helpful in developing protocols for measuring the viability of other lactic acid bacteria. We determined the cell concentration range which gives linear regression of <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>units)</b> and formazan production. In our experiment three authentic lactic acid bacteria strains were investigated: Lactobacillus rhamnosus VT 1, L. plantarum 2142, and L. sakei DSM 2001. As data show beside the strain also the growth medium has influence on the MTT reduction activity, this means that for each special case separate calibration curve has to be prepared. Based on MTT reduction we also developed an improved microtiter plate assay which proved to be reliable for a rapid cell count determination. So our methods are only applicable for estimate cell number with fixed parameters, but under given circumstances they are fast and sensitive methods. With the modified methods we can rapidly measure the dehydrogenase enzyme activity of the lactic acid bacteria cells. With the microplate assay we can measure many conditions and strains at the same time...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the effects of the combination of a lactoperoxidase system (LP-s) and lactoferrin (LF) added to a milk replacer diet on severity of diarrhoea, the morphology of the small intestinal mucosa, and the microbiology of digesta and faeces in young calves, in comparison with a control diet. The experiment was conducted with 30 young calves, 15 per treatment, during the period of 7 - 21 days of age. During this period, calves are sensitive to gastrointestinal disturbances that can cause diarrhoea. The results showed a significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced severity of diarrhoea in the LP-s/LF group compared to the control group as assessed by faecal consistency scores. Numbers of <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>units)</b> of Escherichia coli in jejunal and colonic digesta and in faeces were lower in the LP-s/LF group compared with the control group. The differences were significant in both colonic digesta (p < 0. 1) and in faeces (p < 0. 05). Examination of the small intestinal mucosa, using a dissecting microscope, indicated more finger shaped villi in the distal jejunum of LP-s/LF-treated calves compared with the control group (p < 0. 05). Histometrical measurements showed that these villi were significantly (p < 0. 05) longer...|$|R

Cento e doze ratos machos Wistar diabÃticos com peso mÃdio de 180 g foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em dois experimentos. Cada experimento foi dividido em dois procedimentos que avaliaram a atividade antibacteriana de soluÃÃes dos Ãleos essenciais a 5 %, em dois diferentes procedimentos: um no ato da administraÃÃo do inÃculo bacteriano e outro apÃs vinte e quatro horas de administraÃÃo. A administraÃÃo tanto do inÃculo 108 ufc/ml quanto da suspensÃo dos Ãleos foi por via subcutÃnea no membro pÃlvico dos ratos diabÃticos. CinqÃenta e seis ratos Wistar foram utilizados para cada experimento, no qual os mesmos foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em 8 (oito) diferentes grupos: 4 grupos por experimento, apresentando 7 ratos por grupo (G 1 -Branco; G 2 -Controle negativo; G 3 -Controle positivo; G 4 -Teste). Foi verificado que no procedimento 1 (S. aureus sem Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 698 versus S. aureus com Lippia aff gracilis 293, 1 Â 79, 07; S. aureus sem Lippia gracilis 108 Â 873 versus S. aureus com Lippia gracilis 302 Â 57, 2) e no procedimento 2 (S. aureus sem Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 313 versus S. aureus com Lippia aff gracilis 13, 28 Â 4, 03; S. aureus sem Lippia gracilis 108 Â 818 versus S. aureus com Lippia gracilis 13, 14 Â 4, 27); houve reduÃÃo na contagem bacteriana tanto para Lippia aff. gracilis quanto para Lippia gracilis. Quando comparados os grupos G 4 com G 3, observou-se que esta suspensÃo a 5 % nÃo apresentou efeito prÃ-inflamatÃrio. Para a validaÃÃo destes resultados, foram utilizados os testes Mann-Whitney e Bartletts &Newman-Keuls (MÃdia Â - E. P. M) com nÃvel de significÃncia de (p< 0, 05). Ainda neste estudo foi avaliado a aÃÃo antioxidante e imunomoduladora da L-glutamina em modelos de ratos Wistar diabÃticos quando administrada por gavagem a uma concentraÃÃo de 0, 7 g/kg em um perÃodo de 30 dias. Quarenta ratos Wistar machos foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em 5 grupos (GI-nÃo diabÃtico; GII-diabÃtico; GIII-diabÃtico com salina; GIV-diabÃtico com L-glutamina; GV-diabÃtico com ProteÃna do Soro do Leite). Passado este perÃodo, foram determinadas as concentraÃÃes de substÃncias reativas ao Ãcido tiobarbitÃrico (TBARS) e glutationa reduzida (GSH) no soro e nos tecidos hepÃticos, pancreÃticos, mÃsculo esquelÃtico, rins e tecido adiposo. Para as comparaÃÃes entre o grupo tratado com L-glutamina com os demais, utilizou-se a anÃlise de variÃncia (ANOVA-teste Tukey). As comparaÃÃes entre grupos foram feitas utilizando-se o teste t de Student. Valores de p< 0, 05 foram considerados significantes. A suplementaÃÃo com L-glutamina induziu ao aumento nas concentraÃÃes de GSH (MÃdia Â E. P. M) e reduÃÃo significante nas concentraÃÃes de TBARS (MÃdia Â E. P. M), quando comparadas com o grupo controle, nos espÃcimes analisados. A aÃÃo imunomoduladora foi avaliada atravÃs da quantificaÃÃo de linfÃcitos CD 4 + e CD 8 + em sangue total. Vinte e quatro ratos Wistar machos diabÃticos foram distribuÃdos igualmente em 3 grupos (G 1 -diabÃtico com salina; G 2 -diabÃtico com L-glutamina; G 3 - diabÃtico com ProteÃna do Soro do Leite). Observou-se um aumento significante nas populaÃÃes de linfÃcitos CD 4 + (MÃdia Â E. P. M) com reduÃÃo nas populaÃÃes de linfÃcitos CD 8 + (MÃdia Â -E. P. M) do grupo G 2 quando comparado com o grupo controle, ressaltando a importÃncia da L-glutamina como imunonutrienteThe antibacterial effect of essential oils extracted from {{leaves of the}} species of Lippia aff. gracilis and Lippia gracilis against strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with diabetic foot ulcers were evaluated in vitro and in vivo experimetation utilizing an experimental model of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. One hundred and twelve male diabetic Wistar rats with mean weight of 180 g were distributed by chance into two experiments. Each experiment was divided in two procedures with evaluation of antibacterial activity of essential oils at 5 % solutions; one procedure {{in the act of}} administration of bacterial inoculums and the other one 24 hours later. 108 <b>CFU</b> (<b>Colony</b> <b>Forming</b> <b>Unit)</b> /mL, as well as oils suspension inoculated in the subcutaneous tissue of the pelvic member of diabetic rats. Lower than 5 % concentration of administered solution presented antibacterial effect in the in vitro experiment. Fifty-six Wistar rats were utilized in each experiment, randomly distributed in 08 different groups: 04 groups per experiment, each group with 07 rats (G 1 -White; G 2 -Negative Control; G 3 - Positive control; G 4 -Test). There was decrease in CFU/mL in procedure 1 (S. aureus without Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 698 versus S. aureus with Lippia aff gracilis 293, 1 Â 9, 07; S. aureus without Lippia gracilis 108 Â 873 versus S. aureus with Lippia gracilis 302 Â 57, 2), which evaluated antibacterial effect of oils concomitantly with the administration of inocula as well as in procedure 2 (S. aureus without Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 313 versus S. aureus with Lippia aff gracilis 13, 28 Â 4, 03; S. aureus without Lippia gracilis 108 Â 818 versus S. aureus with Lippia gracilis 13, 14 Â 4, 27), which evaluated antibacterial effect of oils 24 hours after the administration of the inoculum. When comparing group G 4 with G 3, it was observed that 5 % solution presented no pro-inflammatory effect, for analysis of these results, the tests of Mann-Whitney and Bartletts & Newman-Keuls (X Â S. E. M) with level of significance (p< 0, 05) were used. Part of this study evaluated the antioxidant and immunomodulating effect of L-glutamine in models of Wistar diabetic rats when administered by gavages at a 0, 7 g/kg during 30 days. Fourty Wistar male rats were randomly distributed in 5 groups (GI- non diabetic; GII-diabetic; GIII-diabetic with saline; GIV- diabetic with L-glutamine; GV- diabetic with Whey Protein). After 30 days concentrations of TBARS and GSH in serum and in hepatic, pancreatic, skeletal muscles, kidneys and fat tissues were determined. For comparisons between the group treated with L-glutamine with the others, the ANOVA â Tukey test was utilized and the comparisons between groups were done using Studentâs t test. Values of p< 0. 05 were considered significant. The supplementation with L-glutamine induced an increase in the concentrations of GSH (Mean&# 61617;S. E. M) and significant reduction in the TBARS (mean Â S. E. M) concentrations, when compared to the control group, in the analyzed specimens. The immunomodulating effect was evaluated by quantification of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes in total blood. Twenty-four Wistar male diabetic rats were distributed equally in 3 groups (G 1 -diabetic with saline; G 2 -diabetic with L-glutamine; G 3 - diabetic with Whey Protein). It was seen a significant increase of CD 4 + (mean Â S. E. M) lymphocytes with reduction of CD 8 + (mean Â S. E. M) lymphocytes in group G 2 when compared to the control group, showing the importance of L-glutamine as an immunonutrien...|$|E
40|$|The {{esterase}} {{activity in}} the bursa of Fabricius in 10 -day-old chicks is examined by means of serial sections obtained by cutting along the major axis of the lymphoid follicles. The positivity for this enzymatic reaction is not only confined to the FAE (follicle associated epithelial) cells of the epithelial frame-work and to isolated cells belonging to the medullary part of the follicle, but it extends in a club-shaped morphological continuity from the FAE cells towards {{the centre of the}} follicle. A similar image with a high affinity for acid stainings was also found by means of the H and E technique in suitably orientated sections. Morphological continuity between the FAE cells and the centre-medullary part leads us to suppose the FAE cells and the cells of the centre-medullary part may have a common origin. In the present work, we consider the possibility of FAE cells being of mesenchymatic origin because, besides {{the fact that they are}} in continuity with the centre-medullary cells, they appear after <b>CFU</b> (<b>Colony</b> <b>Forming</b> <b>Units)</b> migration, they have no basal lamina, they have certain features which are present in mesenchymatic cells belonging to the histiocytic line, like high esterase activity and micropinocytotic capability and, finally, they are sensitive to carrageenan and silica, which is a peculiarity of macrophages...|$|R

Twenty male and female patients, aged 12 to 20 years, participated in the study. Saliva was collected before and after placement of appliances. Plaque was collected from areas adjacent to brackets and saliva was again collected on the 15 th, 30 th, and 45 th day after placement. On the 30 th day, 0. 4 % stannous fluoride gel was applied for 4 minutes. No significant modification {{in the number of}} Streptococcus mutans CFU in saliva was observed after placement of the fixed orthodontic appliances. On the 15 th day, the percentage of Streptococcus mutans CFU in plaque was statistically lower in sites adjacent to GIC-bonded brackets (mean = 0. 365) than in those adjacent to RC-bonded brackets (mean = 0. 935). No evidence was found of a contribution of GIC to the reduction of CFU in plaque after the 15 th day. Topical application of stannous fluoride gel on the 30 th day reduced the number of CFU in saliva, but not in plaque. This study suggests that the antimicrobial activity of GIC occurs only in the initial phase and is not responsible for a long-term anticariogenic property...|$|R

Despite the normal structure of seeds containing a viable embryo and compliance with all International Seed Testing Association recommendations, no germination in A. victorialis was observed. Additionally, the scarification and stratification treatments applied did not improve the dynamics of germination of A. victorialis seeds. Microbiological analyses of soil sampled from natural localities of the plant revealed a typical composition of bacteria and fungi. The high number of fungi [4. 5 log 10 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>units)</b> of fungi × g− 1 dry mass of soil] and various groups of bacteria (about 7. 0 log 10 CFU of bacteria × g− 1 dry mass of soil) were detected in the root-free-soil around garlic roots.

Through modeling the freezing within a fish fillet, the process of storing and distributing this product is better understood. The purpose of this experiment {{is to determine the}} time to freeze a fillet of tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) of known shape and properties. Then through utilizing the fillet temperature, the shelf life or freshness is determined through a consumer based freshness test that provides a nominal shelf life for common species, including tilapia. Another objective is to determine the bacteria concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, common bacteria found on fish and other seafoods, during and after freezing. Using Gambit and FIDAP, a three dimensional slab of 10 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm was modeled in a - 4 ?C freezer where each side was exposed to convection except for the bottom which was simulated as resting on a surface (a shelf in the freezer).
