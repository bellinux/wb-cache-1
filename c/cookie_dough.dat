25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many <b>cookie</b> <b>doughs</b> and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|R

40|$|The oleogels of {{canola oil}} with {{candelilla}} wax were prepared and utilized as a shortening replacer to produce cookies {{with a high}} level of unsaturated fatty acids. The incorporation of candelilla wax (3 % and 6 % by weight) to canola oil produced the oleogels with solid-like properties. The firmness of the oleogels was lower than that of the shortening at room temperature. A more rapid change in the viscosity with temperature was observed with increasing levels of candelilla wax in the steady shear measurements. The replacement of shortening with oleogels in the cookie formulation reduced both viscoelastic parameters (G′ and G″) of the <b>cookie</b> <b>doughs.</b> The level of unsaturated fatty acids in the oleogel cookies was distinctly increased up to around 92 %, compared to the shortening cookies (47. 2 %). The cookies with the oleogels showed desirable spreadable property and the replacement of shortening with the oleogels produced cookies with soft eating characteristics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the fluorine concentration [F] of the chocolates bars (CB) Baton, Confeti, Garoto Ball, Kinder Ovo, M&M?s, Milkybar, Nescau, Nescau Ball, Surpresa, Surpresa Bichos, Tortuguita; and of the chocolate cookies (CC) Danyt?s, Hipopó, Nescau, Passatempo, Pokémon, Sítio do Pica-Pau Amarelo and Trakinas. Samples were purchased in Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil. Three grams of each product were previously ashed at 525 °C (CB and cookies fillings) and at 550 °C (<b>cookies</b> <b>dough),</b> during 4 hours. Fluorine was separated from the ash by hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) -facilitated diffusion. Fluorine analysis was carried out with the specific electrode. Mean [F]s ± SD and amplitude (unit mg/g) were: CB = 0. 30 ± 0. 45 (0. 07 - 1. 60, n = 12) and CC = 1. 08 ± 2. 64 (0. 04 - 7. 10, n = 7). It was concluded that some of the analyzed foods may be important contributors to the total daily F intake.

40|$|Emulsifying {{agents have}} an effect on cookies and the {{finished}} product partially, depending on the system and the type of emulsifier used. Lecithin’s molecular structure makes it an effective emulsifier for the interaction of water and oil. Phospholipids, the major component of lecithin, are partly hydrophilic (attracted to water) and partly hydrophobic (repelled from water). Fat is particularly important in the texture of a low-moisture cookie. The present study has desirable significance which relates to practical issues like <b>cookies</b> <b>dough</b> emulsions, optimization of manufacturing, quality control and effects on prolonging shelf life prediction. The investigation revealed that the method applied was very suitable for determining the effects of lecithin on cookie production. According to the method 0. 27, 0. 21, 0. 19 and 0. 16 % lecithin were mixed based on dough weight by using a Horizontal-Z-Drum mixture machine in four different cookie samples (S- 1, S- 2, S- 3 and S- 4 respectively) and the moisture absorption rate of four samples were analyzed by using Scaltec auto moisture analyzer. The moisture absorption rate at 30 minutes for S- 1, S- 2, S- 3 and S- 4 were 2. 10, 3. 11, 3. 19 and 3. 23 % respectively. For S- 1, 0. 27 % lecithin shown minimal moisture absorption at 30 min. Therefore, it is clear that increase of emulsifying agent decreases the rate of moisture absorption in cookies and lecithin might have a great effect on preservation of cookies. The study recommends that further enthusiastic investigation may continue for the prediction of optimum dose of lecithin for maximum shelf-life of cookies...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{knowledge}} of regularities of deformation {{behavior of the}} processed confectionery masses with certain rheological properties allows to calculate parameters of shaping process and to select processing equipment for its carrying out. The article studies the obtaining of the rheological equation of deformation behavior of sugar dough in the conditions of monoaxial compression which is realized in sugar <b>cookies</b> <b>dough</b> pieces formation processes. The results of the pilot studies confirming adequacy of the offered rheological equation are presented. The behavior of an elastic-, viscous- and plastic body in the conditions of quasistatic test for creeping during which the set size is tension, and the measured one is relative deformation is considered. The main rheological properties of sugar dough received experimentally are given. Values of rheological constants are received and it is revealed that at 95 % confidential probability, the rheological equation for the general deformation of an elastic-, viscous- and plastic body adequately describes experimental data. The maximum fault thus makes 2, 3 %. It is established that dough pieces shaping processes from the sugar dough possessing visco- and plastic properties should be realized at an external tension (power impact from the forming body) which exceeds a limit of fluidity of the dough formed. The level of external tension, {{as well as the}} duration of its influence (that is formation duration) should be chosen taking into account the residual deformations in the processed mass which guarantee giving of a certain geometrical form and drawing on a surface of dough pieces. The rheological model of sugar dough allows to predict its deformation behavior in the formation conditions, and to calculate the parameters of sugar dough formation process...|$|R
