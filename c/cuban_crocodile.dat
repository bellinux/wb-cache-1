25|$|The American {{crocodile}} is saltwater-tolerant {{and have}} thus been capable of colonizing {{a multitude of}} islands within the Caribbean islands and on some coastal Pacific islands as well. They coexist with the rather smaller spectacled caiman within Central America. The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile's range are two species smaller than this species on average: the critically endangered <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile,</b> along with the Morelet's crocodile in southern Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E
25|$|The park houses {{many species}} of {{crocodiles}} such as the gharial, the marsh crocodile, the salt water crocodile and the American spectacled caiman. Except the <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the park has all other six major varieties, namely, Indo-Pacific or the salt water crocodile, swamp crocodile, Nile crocodile of Africa, Orinoco crocodile, Morelet's crocodile and American crocodile. The eight enclaves for crocodiles comprise about 220 individuals, including 125 adult specimens belonging to the six varieties. This includes two pairs of adult fresh water crocodiles. Many of the species also breed here.|$|E
25|$|Adult American {{crocodiles}} have {{no natural}} predators and almost any terrestrial or riparian animal they encounter is potential prey. American crocodiles are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with American crocodiles. Usually American crocodiles are dominant over American alligators. However, on one occasion, an American crocodile in a Florida zoo escaped its cage {{and started a}} fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen and was killed by the American alligator. Conversely, there is one confirmed case of an American crocodile preying on a sub-adult American alligator in the wild in Florida. American alligators and American crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild normally, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions. There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus) in South America as well as additional records of cannibalism there. Areas with healthy American crocodile populations often hold only limited numbers of spectacled caimans, while conversely areas that formerly held American crocodiles but {{where they are now}} heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation. In areas where the two species coexist, the smaller but more aggressive <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile. In Mexico some Morelet's crocodile individuals have escaped from captivity, establishing feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of American crocodile, which must compete with this invasive species.|$|E

These include Burmese pythons, <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> saltwater crocodiles, boa constrictors, matamata turtles, dwarf caimans, green anacondas, tokay geckos and several species of poison dart frog.|$|R
50|$|Morelet's {{crocodile}} {{was discovered}} in Mexico in 1850 and named after the French naturalist who made the discovery, Pierre Marie Arthur Morelet (1809-1892). It was long confused with the American and <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles</b> because of similar characteristics and an ambiguous type locality. It was not generally accepted as a separate species until the 1920s.|$|R

500|$|The American Museum of Natural History {{incorporated}} {{the skull and}} jaw fragments into a plaster restoration, modeled after the present-day <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile.</b> Colbert and Bird stated this was a [...] "conservative" [...] reconstruction, since an even greater length could have been obtained if a long-skulled modern species, such as the saltwater crocodile had been used as the template. Because it was not then known that Deinosuchus had a broad snout, Colbert and Bird miscalculated the proportions of the skull, and the reconstruction greatly exaggerated its overall width and length. Despite its inaccuracies, the reconstructed skull became the best-known specimen of Deinosuchus, and brought public attention to this giant crocodilian for the first time.|$|E
500|$|The {{large size}} of Deinosuchus has {{generally}} been recognized despite the fragmentary nature of the fossils assigned to it.

2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile,</b> false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{distributed}} throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, stray dogs {{entered the}} zoo during off-hours and killed five Thomson's gazelles and two Grant's gazelles. In 1996, a brush fire burned 100 {{acres in the}} {{southeast}} portion of the zoo's undeveloped land. Nearly 30 animals from neighboring exhibits were evacuated. The Falcon Batchelor Komodo Dragon Encounter opened that same year, followed by Andean Condor (1999), Meerkats (2000), <b>Cuban</b> <b>Crocodiles</b> and Squirrel Monkeys (2001), and Dr. Wilde's World, which is an indoor facility for traveling zoological exhibits. The rebuilt Wings of Asia aviary, housing more than 300 individuals representing 70 species of birds, opened {{in the spring of}} 2003.|$|R
5000|$|The large {{proportion}} of extinctions {{can be attributed to}} the isolated and therefore somewhat less competitive nature of the islands' ecosystems, and to the fact that carnivorans never colonized most of the region. These factors made the islands' native fauna particularly vulnerable to disruption by humans and the invasive species they introduced. (The large predator niches of the Caribbean islands were formerly occupied by endemic outsize hawks, falcons, caracaras, teratorns and owls—e.g. Titanohierax, Gigantohierax, Buteogallus borrasi, Caracara tellustris, Oscaravis olsoni, Ornimegalonyx and Tyto pollens—all of which are now extinct. <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles</b> also have more terrestrial habits than other extant crocodilians.) ...|$|R
2500|$|American {{crocodiles}} {{are dangerous}} to humans; attacks in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama are not unprecedented. These attacks rarely make international news, so this species {{is not as}} well-documented as a man-eater, as are its relatives. The species is often reportedly timid, and seemingly lacks the propensity to attack people as regularly as Old World crocodiles do. Crocodiles are, as a general rule, more aggressive than alligators, at least towards humans. The American crocodile rates, temperamentally {{somewhere in the middle}} of all crocodilians. A study by the IUCN found that the American crocodile has the highest incidence of reported attacks on humans of any of the crocodilians from the Americas, but fatalities were rare. The estimated number of attacks is considerably smaller than those by the saltwater and Nile crocodiles (C. niloticus). The saltwater and Nile crocodiles are considered to be the most aggressive and dangerous species towards humans, with their large sizes and aggressive behavior combined with low-income socio-economic situations of local people in Africa and Asia resulting in frequent unsafe encounters and high numbers of fatal attacks that may annually range into the hundreds. Reportedly, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> (C. rhombifer) is rather more aggressive in interspecies interactions than the American crocodile and apparently attacks and displaces American crocodiles when they are kept in mixed species enclosures at zoos or at crocodile farms together, even though it is smaller than the American species. However, attacks on humans are rarely reportedly in Cuban crocodiles, undoubtedly due its much more limited habitat and range. In May 2007, two instances occurred within one week of children being attacked and killed by this species—one in Mexico just south of Puerto Vallarta and one in Costa Rica. On August 24, 2014, a man and a woman were swimming in a canal in Gables by the Sea, a community in Coral Gables, Florida, at 2:00 AM, in a canal where crocodiles were known to occur, when they were bitten in the shoulder and the hand by an American crocodile. Although the crocodile was 12' 1" [...] in length, and weighed an estimated 550 lbs, it did not press the attack, but released and moved away from its victims. (Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Crocodile Response Program) This was the first documented wild crocodile attack on humans in Florida since records of human-crocodile conflict have been kept. On May 19, 2015, a seven-year-old boy was attacked and killed by an American Crocodile in the Barra Santa Ana estuary near the city of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico. This was reportedly the eighth crocodile attack in the Barra Santa Ana estuary in the last two years. There have reportedly been 36 American crocodile attacks on humans [...] from 1995 to 2017 in the Cancun area of southeastern Mexico.|$|E

5000|$|Brazaitis {{has contributed}} to {{multiple}} projects on crocodilian biology and the conservation of commercially utilized reptiles. In 1967 he developed a methodology for sexing crocodilians, an essential technique for successful captive breeding of these animals.

[...] Under the leadership of Behler, it later {{became the basis for}} the first AZA Species Survival Plan and a collaborative captive breeding program for the species at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in Grand Chenier, Louisiana. During Brazaitis’s tenure in the Bronx Zoo, the Reptile Department bred nine species of crocodilians, producing numerous founder stocks of endangered <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> Siamese crocodiles, and the first Malayan false gharials to be captive bred in a US zoo.|$|R

50|$|Today, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{can only}} be found in Cuba's Zapata Swamp and the Isle of Youth, and it is highly endangered. It {{formerly}} ranged elsewhere in the Caribbean. Fossils of this species {{have been found in}} the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas.|$|E
50|$|The {{mating season}} of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus rhombifer) is between the months of May and July. This {{is thought to be}} related to {{environmental}} changes, such as rainfall and temperature. In the wild, crocodiles will nest in wet marshes; where they will create trenches and cover the eggs with organic material. In captivity, crocodiles will create mounds. During the nesting period the Cuban crocodiles will lay between 30-40 eggs and the estimated incubation period is 58-70 days. Hatching can occur from late August to early September. Due to the predation of humans, raccoons, and other animals, many eggs will not hatch. At birth, hatchlings are approximately 2-3 inches in length, and are 1/4th of a pound in weight. As with other crocodilians the sex of the Cuban crocodile’s offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest. In conservations, the eggs are kept in incubators that provide a constant environment of 32 degrees Celsius in order to produce males. Cuban crocodiles are an aggressive species and are known to have performed acts of cannibalism. This is a contributing cause for the majority of offspring not surviving to the juvenile stage. In 2012, two <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> hatchlings were born in conservation at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. This {{was the first time in}} 25 years that the <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodile</b> had been successfully bred at this zoo.|$|E
500|$|Mating {{occurs in}} May and June, and females lay single {{clutches}} {{of three to}} 30 eggs in June or July. According to field research, females deposit their eggs at the same nesting sites each year. The nests are built near each other as suitable nesting sites are becoming rare. On Cuba's Isla de la Juventud, Cuban iguanas nest in pockets of earth exposed to the sun by <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> after the crocodiles' eggs have hatched. [...] These nests are separate from where adult iguanas live. In areas without crocodiles, the iguanas excavate nests in sandy beaches. At the San Diego Zoo, a female built a nest {{at the end of}} a long chamber she excavated in the sand. She stood near it for weeks, defending it by shaking her head and hissing at anyone who approached; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites. The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests; dispersing individually after emergence.|$|R

The 14 crocodile species available in the bank are mugger (Crocodylus palustris), salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), tomistoma (Tomistoma schlegelii), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus Moreletii), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), Australian fresh water crocodile (Crocodylus Johnsoni), African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus), dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis). The bank currently houses over 2,400 crocodiles and also many species of turtles, snakes, and lizards which are viewable by the public. The bank houses 12 endangered species of turtles and tortoises and 5 species of snakes, including king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator salvator), two species of pythons, and albino cobras. Of the 5,000 reptiles bred at the bank, 3,000 represent the native Indian species Crocodylus palustris, known as muggers. One of the biggest attractions of the park is a fierce salt-water crocodile known as Jaws III. This species, believed to be the biggest in southern Asia, is [...] long and weighs over a ton. The bank is also going to get four new species of crocodiles. These are black caimans, smooth-fronted caimans, <b>Cuban</b> <b>crocodiles</b> and broad-snouted caimans. Anacondas will also appear at the bank. Since April, 2016 four Komodo dragons - three male, one female - {{have been added to the}} list of exhibits.
