50|$|Permissive {{hypotension}} {{relies on}} the heart's ability to pump fluid through the body efficiently. Less intravascular fluid results in a less fluid filling the heart (lower end diastolic volume) which results in a lower amount of volume pumped out of the heart (stroke volume). This {{is based on the}} Frank-Starling law of the heart. Healthy patients should be able to compensate for lower volumes to some extent, but patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease limiting myocardial function (such as angina pectoris) may not. Applying permissive hypotension to the latter patient category may result in decreased <b>coronary</b> <b>perfusion</b> and result in ischemic damage to the heart and potentially myocardial infarction (heart attack).|$|E
50|$|Modern {{interest}} in vasopressors {{as a treatment}} for cardiac arrest stem mostly from canine studies performed in the 1960s by anesthesiologists Dr. John W. Pearson and Dr. Joseph Stafford Redding in which they demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of adjunct intracardiac epinephrine injection during resuscitation attempts after induced cardiac arrest. Also contributing to the idea that vasopressors may be useful treatments in cardiac arrest are studies performed in the early to mid 1990's that found significantly higher levels of endogenous serum vasopressin in adults after successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared to those who did not live. Results of animal models have supported the use of either vasopressin or epinephrine in cardiac arrest resuscitation attempts, showing improved <b>coronary</b> <b>perfusion</b> pressure and overall improvement in short-term survival as well as neurological outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the heart}} is a very aerobic organ, needing oxygen for the {{efficient}} production of ATP & Creatine Phosphate from fatty acids (and to a smaller extent, glucose & very little lactate), the coronary circulation is auto regulated so that the heart receives the right flow of blood & hence sufficient supply of oxygen. If a sufficient flow of oxygen is met and the resistance in the coronary circulation rises (perhaps due to vasoconstriction), then the <b>coronary</b> <b>perfusion</b> pressure (CPP) increases proportionally, to maintain the same flow. In this way, the same flow through the coronary circulation is maintained over a range of pressures. This part of coronary circulatory regulation is known as auto regulation and it occurs over a plateau, reflecting the constant blood flow at varying CPP & resistance. The slope of a CBF (coronary blood flow) vs. CPP graph gives 1/Resistance.|$|E

50|$|A common {{finding in}} those with heart failure is an {{increased}} heart rate, stimulated by increased sympathetic activity {{in order to maintain}} an adequate cardiac output. Initially, this helps compensate for heart failure by maintaining blood pressure and perfusion, but places further strain on the myocardium, increasing <b>coronary</b> <b>perfusion</b> requirements, which can lead to worsening of ischemic heart disease. Sympathetic activity may also cause potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms. An increase in the physical size of the heart's muscular layer may occur. This is caused by the terminally differentiated heart muscle fibers increasing in size in an attempt to improve contractility. This may contribute to the increased stiffness and thus decrease the ability to relax during diastole. Enlargement of the ventricles can also occur and contributes to the enlargement and spherical shape of the failing heart. The increase in ventricular volume also causes a reduction in stroke volume due to mechanical and inefficient contraction of the heart.|$|E
50|$|The Impella heart {{pumps are}} {{designed}} to provide hemodynamic support when the patient's heart is unable to produce sufficient cardiac output. The Impella family of heart pumps can supply 1.0 L/min-5.0 L/min of blood flow, {{depending on the size}} and power setting of the individual pump. The physiological consequences of left-sided support are threefold. First, it unloads the left ventricle by reducing left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, which decreases ventricular wall stress. Subsequently, left ventricular work and myocardial oxygen demand decrease. Second, Impella pump flow increases mean arterial pressure, diastolic pressure, and cardiac output. This increases cardiac power output and cardiac index. The combined effects of the Impella on wall stress and perfusion pressure (especially diastolic pressure) augment <b>coronary</b> <b>perfusion.</b> Lastly, augmented cardiac output and forward flow from the left ventricle has secondary benefits related to right ventricular function. Impella support decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and reduces right ventricular afterload.|$|E

Exercise performance was assessed using treadmill exercise tests. No period or treatment sequence effects were observed for BP, heart rate and exercise performance.
