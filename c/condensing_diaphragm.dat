50|$|Adjusting the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> alters sample contrast. Furthermore, {{altering}} {{the size of}} the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> allows adjustment of sample depth of field by {{altering the}} effective numerical aperture of the microscope. The role of the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is analogous to the aperture in photography although the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of a microscope functions by controlling illumination of the specimen, while the aperture of a camera functions by controlling illumination of the detector.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} test the {{alignment}} of components on the light source image plane, the eyepiece must be removed to allow observation of the intermediate image plane (the position of the eyepiece diaphragm) either directly or by using a phase telescope/Bertrand lens. The light source (e.g. the bulb filament) and {{the edges of the}} <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> should appear in focus. Any optical components at the back focal plane of the objective (e.g. the phase ring for phase contrast microscopy) and at the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> (e.g. the annulus for phase contrast microscopy) should also appear in focus.|$|R
50|$|Lapel {{microphones}} {{date from}} 1932. Various models were made, including ones with <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> ribbons, moving coils, and carbon buttons. The term referred to any small microphone {{that could be}} hooked into the buttonhole of the lapel of a coat. The lapel microphone offered freedom of movement.|$|R
50|$|Phase telescopes are {{primarily}} used for aligning the optical components required for Köhler illumination and phase contrast microscopy. For Köhler illumination the light source and <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> should appear in focus {{at the back}} focal plane of the objective lens. For phase contrast microscopy the phase ring (at the back focal plane of the objective) and the annulus (at the back focal plane of the condenser lens) should appear in focus and in alignment.|$|R
50|$|Altering the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{allows the}} amount of light {{entering}} the sample to be freely adjusted without altering the wavelengths of light present, in contrast to reducing power to the light source with critical illumination (which changes the color temperature of the lamp). However, this adjustment is always coupled to an alteration of the numerical aperture of the system, as stated above, and so adjustment of the illumination source intensity by other means is still necessary.|$|R
5000|$|These {{components}} lie in {{this order}} between the light source and the specimen {{and control the}} illumination of the specimen. The collector/field lenses act to collect light from the light source and focus it at {{the plane of the}} <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The <b>condenser</b> lens acts to project this light, without focusing it, through the sample. This illumination scheme creates two sets of conjugate image planes, one with the light source image and one with the specimen. These two sets of image planes are found at the following points: ...|$|R

40|$|Nuclei {{from nearly}} ripe eggs of Rana pipiens were {{isolated}} and cleaned in 0. 1 M KC 1. The whole nucleus was then digested to various degrees with ribonuclease or trypsin, followed by washing and fixation in either osmium tetroxide or potassium permanganate. The nuclear envelope was dissected off, {{placed on a}} grid, air dried, and compared with undigested controls in the electron microscope. Some envelopes were dehydrated, embedded in methacrylate, and sectioned. Annuli around "pores " are composed of a substance or substances, at least partially fibrillar, which is preserved by osmium but lost during permanganate fixation. Material within the "pores " is also preserved by osmium but partially lost after permanganate. No evidence of granules or tubules in the annuli was found in air dried mounts although a granular appearance {{could be seen in}} tangentially oriented thin sections. Thin sections of isolated envelopes give evidence of diffuse material within the "pores " as well as a more <b>condensed</b> <b>diaphragm</b> across their waists. In whole mounts of the envelope the total density within "pores " is relatively constant from "pore " to "pore. " All material within "pores, " including the <b>condensed</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> is removable by trypsin digestion. Wispy material from the "pore " structure projects into the nucleus and annular material extends into the cytoplasm. Both annular and diaphragm materials remain with the envelope when it is isolated and are thus considered a part of its structure, not merely evidences of material passing through. There is no evidence of ribonuclease-removable material in any part of the "pore " complex...|$|R

40|$|Living {{organisms and}} tissues reveal little of their complex {{structure}} with the ordinary brightfield mi-croscope. To see them, the <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of the microscope must be nearly closed {{so that only}} a narrow cone of light is used for illumination. As the illuminating cone is decreased, contrast improves until the diffraction patterns become so large that the finer details are obscured and the resolving power is lost. Small specimens may never be seen, because the resolving power may be lost before enough contrast is developed for visibility. Conse-quently, elaborate staining procedures have been de-vised for seeing the finer structure with the micro-scope. Vital staining is limited, and most of our knowledge has been restricted to post-mortem ob...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{capacitor}} microphone (commonly {{known as a}} <b>condenser</b> microphone), the <b>diaphragm</b> acts as one plate of {{a capacitor}}, and vibrations produce changes in {{the distance between the}} diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates.|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{crystal display}} (LCD) {{technology}} has enjoyed significant advances {{in just a}} few short years. The quality of LCD panels has improved dramatically {{while at the same time}} costs have gradually come down. LCDs are now found in products as small as mobile phones and as large as 42 -inch flat panel screens. The thesis will introduces and discusses two new applications of Liquid crystal display. Anti-headlamp digital glass: In recent years, public concerns regarding headlamp glare have substantially increased and become one of the most active dockets in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. We report an innovative design of a digital wearable glass that can reduce the discomforting glare and improve human’s night vision. Microscopy illumination engineering using a low-cost liquid crystal display: In a typical microscope, the condenser lens provides sample illumination that is uniform and free from glare. The associated <b>condenser</b> <b>diaphragm</b> can be manually adjusted to obtain the optimal illumination numerical aperture. We report a programmable condenser lens for active illumination control. In our prototype setup, we used a $ 15 liquid crystal display as a transparent spatial light modulator and placed it at the back focal plane of the condenser lens...|$|R
2500|$|Schweitzer {{developed}} a technique for recording {{the performances of}} Bach's music. Known as [...] "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what {{is commonly known as}} mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small <b>diaphragm</b> <b>condenser</b> microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large <b>diaphragm</b> <b>condenser.</b> The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.|$|R
50|$|Alignment {{of optical}} {{components}} on the specimen image plane is typically performed by first loading a test specimen and bringing it into focus {{by moving the}} objective or the specimen. The field diaphragm is then partially closed; {{the edges of the}} diaphragm should be in the same conjugate image planes as the specimen, therefore should appear in focus. The focus can be adjusted by raising or lowering the <b>condenser</b> lenses and <b>diaphragm.</b> Finally, the field diaphragm is reopened to just beyond the field of view.|$|R
5000|$|Microphones can {{be thought}} of as {{speakers}} in reverse. The sound waves strike the thin diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. [...] Microphone diaphragms, unlike speaker diaphragms, tend to be thin and flexible, since they need to absorb as much sound as possible. In a <b>condenser</b> microphone, the <b>diaphragm</b> is placed in front of a plate and is charged. [...] In a dynamic microphone, the diaphragm is glued to a magnetic coil, similar to the one in a dynamic loudspeaker. (In fact, a dynamic speaker can be used as a rudimentary microphone, and vice versa.) ...|$|R
40|$|Capacitive {{microphones}} (condenser microphones) work on {{a principle}} of variable capacitance and voltage by the movement of its electrically charged diaphragm and back plate in response to sound pressure. There has been considerable research carried out to increase the sensing performance of microphones while reducing their size to cater for various modern applications such as mobile communication and hearing aid devices. This paper reviews the development and current performance of several condenser MEMS microphone designs, and introduces a microphone with spring supported diaphragm to further improve condenser microphone performance. The numerical analysis using Coventor FEM software shows that this new microphone design has a higher mechanical sensitivity compared to the existing edge clamped flat <b>diaphragm</b> <b>condenser</b> MEMS microphone. The spring supported diaphragm is shown to have a flat frequency response up to 7 kHz and more stable under the variations of the diaphragm residual stress. The microphone {{is designed to be}} easily fabricated using the existing silicon fabrication technology and the stability against the residual stress increases its reproducibility...|$|R
50|$|Røde first {{introduced}} small <b>diaphragm</b> <b>condenser</b> microphones into its product range in 2000 with the NT3, which featured an end-address ¾” cardioid condenser capsule. It was {{followed closely by}} the NT4 stereo microphone and the NT5 ‘pencil’ condenser microphone. Both featured ½” cardioid true condenser capsules, with the NT4 having a matched pair fixed in 90 degree alignment for XY stereo recording and the NT5 capsule being interchangeable with an omnidirectional version.The NT5 (and later NT55) are available as an acoustically matched pair, a common practice that involves matching the sensitivity of two individual microphones to within a very small sensitivity tolerance, and selling them as a pair {{to be used for}} stereo recording techniques.Røde entered the live vocal performance space in 2006 with the S1 (and black S1-B variety) microphone. It features a ¾” super-cardioid condenser capsule, designed for feedback rejection in live situations.In 2009 Røde released the M2 and M3 microphones that featured permanently polarised condenser capsules, a more cost effective solution to the true condenser capsules found in other Røde studio microphones.|$|R

The company manufactures both valve/tube and solid state varieties, as well as models that offer variable polar patterns and equalisation filters.The NT1-A is Røde’s biggest selling microphone, and the company claims it to be the world’s quietest studio microphone website with a published self-noise of 5dBA.The company has retired the NTV, Classic, NT1 and NT2 microphones from production. The Classic II microphone was announced as ceasing production in October 2011. It was commemorated with a limited edition black version of which only 500 were ever made, and came with a series of exclusive items including an additional JAN6072 valve, a titanium lifetime warranty card engraved with the owner’s name, and a leather bound book detailing the history of the Røde Classic and Classic II microphones.Its large <b>diaphragm</b> <b>condenser</b> studio microphones are primarily side-address, {{with the exception of the}} Broadcaster microphone which, due to its application in broadcast and radio environments, is end-address.|$|R
