50|$|A {{single-axis}} <b>clinostat</b> only {{produces the}} effect of weightlessness along its axis of rotation. A 3D or two-axis <b>clinostat</b> (generally called a random positioning machine or RPM), can average gravitational pull over all directions.

The two conditions used, <b>clinostats</b> and flotation, induced changes differing in magnitude but qualitatively similar. Most responses on <b>clinostats</b> required correction for vertical axis rotational effects, thus limiting {{the value of}} these instruments in free-fall simulation. These findings extend earlier observations suggesting that increased peroxidase and decreased lignin are characteristic of growth under experimental hypogravity...|$|R

50|$|A plant only {{reacts to}} gravity if the gravistimulation is {{maintained}} {{for longer than}} a critical amount of time, called the minimal presentation time (MPT). For many plant organs the MPT lies somewhere between 10 and 200 seconds, and therefore a <b>clinostat</b> should rotate on a comparable timescale {{in order to avoid}} a gravitropic response. However, presentation time is cumulative, and if a clinostat's rotation is repeatedly stopped at a single position, even for periods as short as 0.5 s, a gravitropic response can result. The presentation time for animals is one or two orders of magnitude faster than this, thus precluding the use of the slow rotation <b>clinostat</b> for most animal studies. However the fast rotation <b>clinostat</b> can be, and is, used for the study of animal cell cultures and embryos.|$|E
50|$|A single axis (or horizontal) <b>clinostat</b> {{consists}} of a disc attached to a motor. They were originally clockwork but nowadays an electric motor is used. The disc is held vertically and the motor rotates it slowly at rates {{in the order of}} one revolution per minute. A plant is attached to the disc so that it is held horizontally. The slow rotation means that the plant experiences a gravitational pull that is averaged over 360 degrees, thus approximating a weightless environment. Clinostats have also been used to cancel out effects of sunlight and other stimuli besides gravity. This type of <b>clinostat</b> must be exactly horizontal to simulate absence of gravity. If the <b>clinostat</b> is at an angle from horizontal, a net gravity vector is perceived, the magnitude of which depends on the angle. This can be used to simulate lunar gravity (ca. 1/6 g) which requires an angle from the horizontal of ca. 10 deg., i.e. sin−1(1/6).|$|E
40|$|Mung beans (Vigna radiata L.) {{seedlings}} {{grown on}} the third Space Transport Mission (STS- 3) showed marked orientation problems (some of the stems elongated horizontally {{and many of the}} roots were growing upward) and had a lower lignin content than the ground based controls. This research was initiated to determine if the atypical growth characteristics of mung beans grown in microgravity could be simulated using horizontal <b>clinostats.</b> Most of the effort focused on the design, construction and testing of the <b>clinostats.</b> In order to closely approximate the growth conditions of the plants grown in the plant growth unit on STS- 3, cylindrical lexan minichambers were constructed. Results showed that plants grown using these <b>clinostats</b> in the horizontal position exhibit similar growth characteristics to the plants grown on STS- 3 (disorientation of both stems and roots), while the vertical stationary and vertical rotating controls exhibit normal growth...|$|R
40|$|Dark-grown, 4 -day old, Helianthus annuus {{seedlings}} were rotated for 20 hr on horizontal <b>clinostats</b> {{to minimize}} the amplitude of circumnutation. Then a Plexiglas sheet was placed gently against {{the tip of the}} cotyledons. By time-lapse video imaging (using intermittent IR illumination to which the plants were insensitive) movements of the <b>clinostatted</b> plants were observed before, during, and after the period of mechanical contact. Immediately after the Plexiglas sheet was removed residual nutation increased in amplitude almost three-fold, then declined over the next 7 hr to the prestimulation level. This demonstration of enhancement of circumnutation by mechanical contact is consistent with the model of an endogeneous oscillator that can be stimulated by factors other than gravity...|$|R
40|$|Cells in {{microgravity}} {{are subject}} to mechanical unloading and changes to the surrounding chemical environment. How these factors jointly influence cellular function is not well understood. We can investigate their role using ground-based analogues to spaceflight, where mechanical unloading is simulated through the time-averaged nullification of gravity. The prevailing method for cellular microgravity simulation is to use fluid-filled containers called <b>clinostats.</b> However, conventional <b>clinostats</b> are not designed for temporally tracking cell response, nor are they able to establish dynamic fluid environments. To address these needs, we developed a Clinorotation Time-lapse Microscopy (CTM) system that accommodates lab-on- chip cell culture devices for visualizing time-dependent alterations to cellular behavior. For the purpose of demonstrating CTM, we present preliminary results showing time-dependent differences in cell area between human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) under modeled microgravity and normal gravity...|$|R
50|$|A <b>clinostat</b> is {{a device}} which uses {{rotation}} to negate {{the effects of}} gravitational pull on plant growth (gravitropism) and development (gravimorphism). It has also been used to {{study the effects of}} microgravity on cell cultures and animal embryos.|$|E
50|$|The fast {{rotating}} <b>clinostat</b> (generally turning {{at between}} 30 and 150 rpm) {{can only be}} used for small samples (cell cultures in vials a few mm in diameter) typically in liquid media. Under these conditions excessive centrifugal effects, which precludes its use on larger samples, are avoided.|$|E
5000|$|The {{free fall}} machine (FFM) {{addresses}} {{some of the}} problems of the simple horizontal <b>clinostat.</b> In a typical machine samples are allowed to cycle between free fall for about a metre down a column (0 g) and a [...] "bounce" [...] back {{to the top of the}} column that is intended to be so fast (20 g) that it is undetected by the biological sample. The sample therefore effectively grows at 0 g.|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} research reported here {{was to determine whether}} a plant's periodic growth oscillations, called circumnutations, would persist {{in the absence of a}} significant gravitational or inertial force. The definitive experiment was made possible by access to the condition of protracted near weightlessness in an earth satellite. The experiment, performed during the first flight of Spacelab on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shuttle, Columbia, in November and December, 1983, tested a biophysical model, proposed in 1967, that might account for circumnutation as a gravity-dependent growth response. However, circumnutations were observed in microgravity. They continued for many hours without stimulation by a significant g-force. Therefore, neither a gravitational nor an inertial g-force was an absolute requirement for initation or continuation of circumnutation. On average, circumnutation was significantly more vigorous in satellite orbit than on earth-based <b>clinostats.</b> Therefore, at least for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) circumnutation, <b>clinostatting</b> is not the functional equivalent of weightlessness...|$|R
40|$|The gravity {{dependence}} of circumnutational {{activity in the}} sunflower hypocotyl is investigated under conditions of simulated weightlessness. Seedling cultures of the sunflower Helianthus annuus were placed four days after planting in <b>clinostats</b> rotating {{at a rate of}} 1. 0 rpm in the horizontal or somersaulting configurations, and plant movements around their growth axes were recorded in infrared light by a time-lapse closed-circuit video system. The amplitudes and mean cycle durations of the plant nutations in the horizontal and tumbling <b>clinostats</b> are observed to be 20 % and 72 %, and 32 % and 74 %, respectively, of the values observed in stationary plants; extrapolations to a state of zero g by the imposition of small centripetal forces on horizontally clinostated plants also indicate some nutational motion in the absence of gravity. It is concluded that the results are incompatible with the model of Israelsson and Johnsson (1967) of geotropic response with overshoot for sunflower circumnutation; however, results of the Spacelab 1 mission experiment are needed to unambiguously define the role of gravitation...|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which mammalian cells respond to changes in gravitational stress. This paper summarizes studies designed to clarify the effects of hypergravity on the cultured human HeLa cells and to investigate the mechanism of hypergravity signal transduction in these cells...|$|R
5000|$|The RPM {{is a more}} {{sophisticated}} development of the single-axis <b>clinostat.</b> RPMs usually consist of two independently rotating frames. One frame is positioned inside the other giving a very complex net change of orientation to a biological sample mounted in the middle. The RPM is sometimes wrongly {{referred to as the}} [...] "3-D clinostat(which rotates both axis in the same direction, i.e. both clockwise)". It is a microweight ('microgravity') simulator that is based on the principle of 'gravity-vector-averaging'. RPM provides a functional volume which is 'exposed' to simulated microweight..|$|E
5000|$|The usual type of <b>clinostat</b> turns {{slowly to}} avoid {{centrifugal}} effects {{and this is}} called the [...] "slow rotation clinostat". There has been debate as to the most suitable speed of rotation: if it is too slow the plant has time to begin physiological responses to gravity; if it is too fast, centrifugal forces and mechanical strains introduce artifacts. The optimal rotational speed has been investigated by comparison to 'true' responses to microgravity as seen in space-grown plants, and determined to be between 0.3 and 3 rpm for most plant systems.|$|E

This equipment was all donated by CNES. In addition, NASA has loaned a training model of the ISS Advanced Life Support Pack (ALSP) and ESA has loaned a training model of the ISS 3DSPACE experiment. The Human Spaceflight Laboratory is also equipped with a <b>clinostat,</b> an autoclave, a laminar flow cabinet, microscopes, medical diagnosis and surgery tools, and other laboratory equipment to provide realistic hands-on training on the experiments performed in space by astronauts.|$|E

Coleoptile segments from such seedlings showed an enhanced absorption of apically applied exogenous auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid), compared to segments from vertically rotated or stationary controls. Absorption of basally applied auxin and auxin transport were unaffected by the gravity treatments. Horizontal rotation did not materially change the amount of auxin produced and transported from excised coleoptile tips: however, plants so rotated showed an enhanced curvature response to unilaterally applied auxin...|$|R
40|$|Our group {{provides}} experimental platforms {{to simulate}} the conditions of microgravity on ground. <b>Clinostats,</b> a Random Positioning Machine and a Rotating Wall Vessel have been adapted to allow investigations employing {{a variety of different}} model organisms like larval fish, plants, algae, and unicellular organisms as well as adherent or suspended cells in culture. Different types of <b>clinostats</b> have been developed which meet a broad variety of scientific requirements in providing various kinds of experimental applications such as parallel operation of up to ten sample containments in a defined environment, direct microscopical observations of sample, their fixation during clinorotation, bioluminescence kinetic measurements within cell cultures and submersion of aquatic systems during rotation. Correspondingly, various centrifuge devices complete our experimental scenario, enabling hypergravity studies from cells to humans. Ground-based data should ideally be validated in the course of experiments carried out under real microgravity, which is regularly performed by us. Currently, our studies focus on the effects of simulated microgravity on macrophage signaling and stem cell development and differentiation. Simulation of microgravity as well as increased gravitational stimulation provide new insights how Biosystems cope with altered gravity conditions, showing changes in signaling pathways. Our results support the necessity of a ground-based facility program, which – at low costs in comparison to space flight – give scientists the opportunity to intensively prepare their space experiments and get sufficient and statistically reliable and relevant data...|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>clinostat</b> for simulating microgravity is the free fall machine (FFM). Small samples (such as cell suspensions) are allowed to free fall under gravity for about a metre, with the period of free fall lasting just under a second. They are then pushed {{back to the top}} of the apparatus by a briefly applied large force (c. 20 g for 20 ms - the [...] "bounce"), and allowed to fall again, and so on. The principle of the machine is that most of the time is spent in zero g free fall. The periods spent under high g are assumed to be too short to be detected by the physiological mechanism of the biological samples, which consequently only perceive the time spent in free fall.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{goal was}} to {{construct}} a <b>clinostat</b> which could support mammalian cell culture. The <b>clinostat</b> was selected as {{a means by which}} to simulate microgravity conditions within the laboratory, by constant re-orientation of cells with respect to the gravity vector. The effects of this simulated microgravity on in-vitro meiotic maturation of oocytes, using mouse as the model system, was investigated. The effects of <b>clinostat</b> rotation on fertilization in-vitro was then examined. Specific endpoints included examining the timely appearance of male and female pronuclei (indicating fertilization) and the efficiency of extrusion of the second polar body. Particular attention was paid to detecting anomalies of fertilization, including parthenogenetic activation and multiple pronuclei. Finally, for the preliminary studies on mouse embryogenesis, a key feature of the <b>clinostat</b> was modified, that of the position of the cells during rotation. A means was found to immobilize the cells during the <b>clinostat</b> reotation, permitting the cells to remain at the axis of rotation yet not interfering with cellular development...|$|E

Attention is {{presently}} given to progress made {{in the understanding of}} gravitational effects through studies employing centrifuges, <b>clinostats,</b> inverted preparations, linear devices, water immersion, free fall, and short- and long-term spaceflight. The cardiovascular changes which cause malaise and illness during {{the first few days of}} extended space missions are the direct result of fluid translocation from the lower extremities. Upon reentry, there is hypovolumnia and a cardiovascular deconditioning that can include tachycardia, changes in arterial blood pressure, narrow pulse pressure, and syncope.

Theoretical {{issues related to the}} effect of gravity on various physiological systems are discused together with the future research goals concerning human life in space. It is noted that life in space (after adaptation to near-weightlessness) might be significantly prolonged due to a reduction in metabolic rate and a concomitant decrease in oxygen radical reactions...|$|R
40|$|Soluble protein {{expression}} in Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Heynh.) leaf and stem tissue was examined after chronic clinorotation. Seeds of Arabidopsis were germinated and plants grown to maturity on horizontal or vertical slow-rotating <b>clinostats</b> (1 rpm) or in stationary vertical control units. Total soluble proteins and in vivo-labeled soluble proteins isolated from these plants {{were analyzed by}} two-dimensional SDS PAGE and subsequent fluorography.

40|$|Hypogravity {{effects on}} the {{biochemistry}} of living organisms are surveyed, and the differences found under orbital, <b>clinostat,</b> and flotation conditions are examined. Changes can be transient - such as altered serum hormone and electrolyte levels in man - and disappear shortly after return to earth, or changes can be more persistent or permanent, as {{seems to be the}} case for changes in the skeletal system mineral and protein constituents for humans who have been in space. While plant ethylene and peroxidase both increase under orbital, <b>clinostat,</b> or flotation conditions, 3 -PGA-dehydrogenase increases under orbital but not <b>clinostat</b> conditions and cytochrome C reductase and malic dehydrogenase are affected by <b>clinostat</b> but not actual free fall conditions. Reasons for these discrepancies are considered...|$|E

By examining the concordance between results from space flight and the <b>clinostat,</b> we tested whether the slow <b>clinostat</b> is a relevant simulation paradigm. Space-flown cells showed marked changes in the distribution and organization of actin filaments and had a reduced incidence of acetylcholine receptor aggregates at the site of contact with polystyrene beads. Similar effects were found after <b>clinostat</b> rotation. The sensitivity of synaptic receptor aggregation and cytoskeletal morphology suggests that in the microgravity of space cell behavior may be importantly altered...|$|E
40|$|The use of clinostats and {{centrifuges}} {{to explore}} the hypogravity range between zero and 1 g is described. Different types of <b>clinostat</b> configurations and clinostat-centrifuge combinations are compared. Some examples selected from the literature and current research in gravitational physiology are presented to show plant responses in the simulated hypogravity region of the g-parameter (0 is greater than g is greater than 1). The validation of <b>clinostat</b> simulation is discussed. Examples in which flight data {{can be compared to}} <b>clinostat</b> data are presented. The data from 3 different laboratories using 3 different plant species indicate that <b>clinostat</b> simulation in some cases were qualitatively similar to flight data, but that in all cases were quantitatively different. The need to conduct additional tests in weightlessness is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|It {{is useful}} {{to be able to}} measure when and whether cells detect gravity during spaceflights. For {{studying}} gravitational physiology, gravity perception is the response the experimentalist needs to measure. Also, for growing plants in space, plant cells may have a non-directional requirement for gravity as a development cue. The main goals of spaceflight experiments in which gravity perception would be measured are to determine the properties of the gravity receptor and how it is activated, and to determine fundamental characteristics of the signal generated. The main practical difficulty with measuring gravity sensing in space is that gravity sensing cannot be measured with certainty on earth. Almost all experiments measure gravitropic curvature. Reciprocity and intermittent stimulation are measurements which were made to some degree on earth using <b>clinostatting,</b> but which would provide clearer results if done with microgravity rather than <b>clinostatting.</b> These would be important uses of the space laboratory for determining the nature of gravity sensing in plants. Those techniques which do not use gravitropic curvature to measure gravity sensing are electrophysiological. The vibrating probe would be somewhat easier to adapt to space conditions than the intracellular microelectrode because it can be positioned with less precision. Ideally, a non-invasive technique would be best suited if an appropriate measure could be developed. Thus, the effect of microgravity on cultured cells {{is more likely to be}} by large-scale physical events than gravity sensing in the culture cells. It is not expected that it will be necessary to determine whether individual cultured cells perceive gravity unless cells grow abnormally even after the obvious microgravity effects on the culture as a whole can be ruled out as the cause...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the role}} of gravity in {{fundamental}} biological processes and, consequently, the impact of exposure to microgravity conditions provide insight into the basics of the development of life as well as enabling long-term space exploration missions. However, experimentation in real microgravity is expensive and scarcely available; thus, a variety of platforms have been developed to provide, on Earth, an experimental condition comparable to real microgravity. With the aim of simulating microgravity conditions, different ground-based facilities (GBF) have been constructed such as <b>clinostats</b> and random positioning machines as well as magnets for magnetic levitation.
