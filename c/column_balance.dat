40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{uniformity}} of two- and three-level U-type designs {{based on the}} centered and wrap-around L 2 -discrepancies. By analyzing the known formulae, we find it possible to reexpress them as functions of <b>column</b> <b>balance,</b> and also as functions of Hamming distances of the rows. These new representations allow to obtain two kinds of lower bounds, {{which can be used}} as bench marks in searching uniform U-type designs. An efficient updating procedure for the local search heuristic threshold accepting is developed based on these novel formulations of the centered and wrap-around L 2 -discrepancies. Our implementation of this heuristic for the two- and three-level case efficiently generates low discrepancy U-type designs. Their quality is assessed using the available lower bounds...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design problem for {{recovering}} a response surface by using a nonparametric Bayesian approach. The criterion for selecting the designs {{is based on the}} asymptotic average estimation variance, and three priors for the response are specified. We found the optimal design that minimizes the criterion over the lattice designs with s q-level factors and N runs. The approach we used is similar to that in Ma et al. (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 113 (2003) 323). We also obtained alternative expressions and lower bounds for the criterion corresponding to each of the three Bayes models for the two-level U-type design by using the <b>column</b> <b>balance</b> and row distance proposed in Fang et al. (J. Complexity 19 (2003) 692). These results mat be used to construct the two-level U-type designs for the nonparametric Bayesian models.
