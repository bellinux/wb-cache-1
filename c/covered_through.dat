5|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} owned as an inter-municipal enterprise by Gaular and Førde. Operating deficits were <b>covered</b> <b>through</b> various subsidies from the state, often with unclear responsibilities and little financial {{risk for the}} owners. Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 and transferred to the CAA, later renamed Avinor. Widerøe lost the public service obligation contract to fly to Florø Airport in 2000, and therefore moved its technical base for Western Norway to Førde, which included a new hangar.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, {{health care}} is a {{responsibility}} of the provinces.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber {{did not have to}} be air-dried for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was <b>covered</b> <b>through</b> procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E

2500|$|Remaining challenges. In 2000, almost 10 years later, {{things had}} not much changed. A report by NOPWASD stated that {{institutional}} capacity and cost {{recovery in the}} sector remained low. Infrastructure continued to fall into disrepair, while the entities in charge of {{water supply and sewerage}} systems ran large deficits that were only partly <b>covered</b> <b>through</b> subsidies. At that time, the Alexandria Water Company was the only water company in Egypt to cover its operating costs. The report concluded that there was a [...] "duplication of administrative entities, low cost recovery ratios, and lack of qualified management and modern management systems".|$|E
