50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> (Arion rufus), {{also known}} as the large <b>red</b> <b>slug,</b> {{chocolate}} arion and European <b>red</b> <b>slug,</b> is a species of land slug in the family Arionidae, the roundback slugs.|$|R

50|$|Like {{most other}} <b>slug</b> species, the <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> elongates while in locomotion, and at rest it {{contracts}} into a hemispherical shape. It performs a rocking motion when disturbed. It is an omnivore.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the Spanish slug has bred with the indigenous black slug Arion ater to produce a more frost-resistant variety in the more northerly regions. Danish authorities maintain that the Spanish slug, black <b>slug</b> and <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> are in fact subspecies of the same species.|$|R
50|$|Triboniophorus aff. graeffei {{is related}} but not {{identical}} to Triboniophorus graeffei, the <b>red</b> triangle <b>slug.</b> Taxonomists have confirmed the fluorescent pink species' distinction from the <b>red</b> triangle <b>slug.</b> The slug has relatives in New Guinea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and eastern Africa. These land masses once connected with Australia as the Gondwanaland supercontinent.|$|R

50|$|Often such {{complexes}} {{only become}} evident {{when a new}} species is introduced into the system, breaking down existing species barriers. An example is {{the introduction of the}} Spanish slug in Northern Europe, where interbreeding with the local black <b>slug</b> and <b>red</b> <b>slug,</b> traditionally considered clearly separate species that did not interbreed, shows they may be actually just subspecies of the same species.|$|R
40|$|Several {{thousand}} {{plant species}} worldwide are adapted to seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) {{and they are}} a dominant part of many plant communities, {{as is the case in}} European beech forests. Ants, however, are often rare in beech forests. The consequence of this paradox might be that the majority of seeds fall prey to seed predators and myrmecochores migrate mostly by vegetative spread. I compared ant, gastropod and myrmecochore abundance data from beech forests and I conducted seed removal experiments. Gastropods contributed most to the seed removal. Therefore I offered seeds to four gastropod species in the laboratory and I collected <b>red</b> <b>slugs</b> (Arion rufus) in beech forests and searched for seeds in their feces. I tested their dispersal potential by assessing germination rates of slug-defecated seeds and distances <b>red</b> <b>slugs</b> move in the field. The cover and species richness of myrmecochores in beech forests was negatively correlated with the abundance of ants but positively with the abundance of gastropods, supporting my assumption of a discrepancy in the presence of plants and their ant-dispersers. Gastropods were most important for seed removal in my removal experiments, while rodents and insects including ants played only a minor role. Laboratory feeding experiments showed that gastropods consumed seeds of all plant species offered. Swallowed seeds were defecated undamaged and germinated as well as control seeds. I also discovered seeds in the feces of wild-caught <b>red</b> <b>slugs.</b> Thus, gastropods may act as seed dispersers. Red slugs moved up to 14. 6 m in 15 hours, the median gut passage time of seeds, and thus, might transport seeds even further than ants. The results of my experiments indicate that myrmecochores might lack ants as their seed dispersers in beech forests, but they also suggest that ants could be substituted by gastropods...|$|R
