5|$|As noted below, such a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> {{collectors}} would {{alter the}} light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption {{compared to a}} star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.|$|E
5|$|Before the Voyager 1 {{encounter}} with Io on March 5, 1979, Io {{was thought to}} be a dead world much like the Moon. The discovery of a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> sodium surrounding Io led to theories that the satellite would be covered in evaporites.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such.

5|$|Many cephalopods, {{including}} at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent. Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries {{in the same way}} as many squid use ink. A <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E

Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|E

5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries.

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars.
