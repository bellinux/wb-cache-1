50|$|MI8, or Military Intelligence, Section 8 was a British Military Intelligence group {{responsible}} for signals intelligence and {{was created in}} 1914. It originally consisted of four sections: MI8(a), which dealt with wireless policy; MI8(b), based at the General Post Office, dealt with commercial and trade cables; MI8(c) dealt with the distribution of intelligence derived from censorship; and MI8(d), which liaised with the cable companies. During World War I MI8 officers were posted to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> at Poldhu Point and Mullion in Cornwall and Clifden in County Galway, continued until 1917 when the work {{was taken over by}} the Admiralty. In WW2, MI8 was {{responsible for}} the extensive War Office Y Group and briefly, for the Radio Security Service.|$|R
50|$|Dangerous rusting {{strands of}} the old cable could still {{be seen on the}} beach in the early 1950s. These have since been removed and a careful search of the {{terminal}} building in 2004 revealed no vestiges whatsoever of <b>cable</b> or <b>terminal</b> equipment.|$|R

40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection of three-phase belted medium voltage cable connections {{results in a}} number of interpretation differences as compared to off-line measurements where only one phase is energized. The induced currents and charges in the phase conductors and earth screen upon a PD not only depend on the discharge site, but also become phase angle dependent. Furthermore, simulations show that the PD distribution itself varies with the amount of eccentricity of the rotating electric field and may differ from the off-line distributions obtained with a linear field. Finally, the PD propagation in a multi-conductor cable also alters the signals measured at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals.</b> In this paper, induced charges and PD distributions are studied by means of computer simulation. The cable propagation characteristics are verified by measurements...|$|R

50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The {{first generation of}} these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway <b>cable</b> <b>terminals,</b> in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs {{between the first and}} second posts (which are often breakaway posts). The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the guide rail, dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the guide rail sections. A guide rail may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.|$|R

50|$|On the Danish side, the {{converter}} station used as well by Konti-Skan 1 and 2 {{is close to}} Vester Hassing near Aalborg. From Vester Hassing a 34 km long overhead line with two conductors runs to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> at the Danish coast near Staesnaes. This line, which {{is only in the}} proximity of {{the converter}} station and the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> equipped with a ground conductor, was originally used by the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1 and from Vester Hassing until a point a few kilometres south of the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> by the electrode line, which turned there eastwards to the ground electrode at Soera. At implementation of Konti-Skan 2 the whole overhead electrode line was replaced by two 27 km long underground cables and the second conductor of the overhead line got the high-voltage pole of Konti-Skan 2. The 23 km long submarine cable to the Danish island of Laeso starts at Stensnaes and consists of 3 parallel cables. Each of these cables has two copper conductors with a copper cross section of 310 square millimeters. One of these cables was used by Kontiskan 1 and one is used by Kontiskan 2. From the third cable, one conductor was used by Kontiskan 1 and the other is used by Kontiskan 2. Konti-Skan crosses Laeso-Island on a 17 km long overhead line with two conductors. Before the implementation of Konti-Skan 2 both conductors were switched parallel, today one conductor is used for the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1, while the other is used by that of Konti-Skan 2. Between Laeso and Sweden each high voltage pole of Konti-Skan uses a monopolar copper cable with a cross section of 1200 square millimetres.|$|E
50|$|Connecting two {{high-voltage}} cables {{with one}} another poses two main problems. First, the outer conducting layers in both cables shall be terminated without causing a field concentration, similar as with {{the making of a}} <b>cable</b> <b>terminal.</b> Secondly, a field free space shall be created where the cut-down cable insulation and the connector of the two conductors safely can be accommodated. These problems have been solved by NKF in Delft in 1965 by introducing a device called bi-manchet.|$|E

50|$|Locating faults in a {{cable system}} can be done either with the circuit de-energized, or in some cases, with the circuit under power. Fault {{location}} techniques can be broadly divided into terminal methods, which use voltages and currents measured {{at the ends of}} the cable, and tracer methods, which require inspection {{along the length of the}} <b>cable.</b> <b>Terminal</b> methods can be used to locate the general area of the fault, to expedite tracing on a long or buried cable.|$|E
50|$|The line {{passes through}} Weka Pass into the Amuri district, {{travelling}} north through the region, west of Culverden, to Hanmer Springs. From here, the line turns north-east and travels through Molesworth Station into Marlborough {{and down the}} Awatere River valley, before turning north to meet State Highway 1 through the Dashwood and Wards Passes. The line travels east of Blenheim, meeting the eastern coast of the island at Cloudy Bay, and travelling up the coast into the Marlborough Sounds. The line turns east and then south-east around Port Underwood, before crossing to Fighting Bay on the coast, where the South Island <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> is located.|$|E
50|$|Figure 4 shows a {{photograph}} of the cross-section of such a device. At one side of this photograph the contours of a high-voltage cable are drawn. Here red represents the conductor of that cable and blue the insulation of the cable. The black parts in this picture are semi-conducting rubber parts. The outer one is at earth potential and spreads the electric field in a similar way as in a <b>cable</b> <b>terminal.</b> The inner one is at high-voltage and shields the connector of the conductors from the electric field.

40|$|A jet {{aircraft}} noise and sonic boom measuring device which converts sound pressure into electric current is described. An electric current {{proportional to the}} sound pressure level at a condenser microphone is produced and transmitted over a cable, amplified by a zero drive amplifier and recorded on magnetic tape. The converter is comprised of a local oscillator, a dual-gate field-effect transistor (FET) mixer and a voltage regulator/impedance translator. A carrier voltage that is applied {{to one of the}} gates of the FET mixer is generated by the local oscillator. The microphone signal is mixed with the carrier to produce an electrical current at the frequency of vibration of the microphone diaphragm by the FET mixer. The voltage of the local oscillator and mixer stages is regulated, the carrier at the output is eliminated, and a low output impedance at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> is provided by the voltage regulator/impedance translator...|$|R
30|$|Classification {{based on}} the dynamic and static {{characteristics}} of relay protection devices. It divides hidden failures of protection devices into dynamic hidden failures and static hidden failures. The static characteristic of protection devices {{is that if the}} protection device doesn’t fulfill the starting conditions, it will only do electric-parameter measurement and calculation or do data collection and start judgment; while the logic comparison and tripping output are not in consideration, mainly with the hardware devices, mutual-inductor measurement circuit, connecting <b>cables,</b> <b>terminals,</b> pre-process circuit of relay protection, sampling and sampling-value calculation. The hidden failures in these links are called static hidden failures. Dynamic characteristic of protection is that when the protection meets with the starting conditions, the fault parameters will be measured and logic comparison will be done, mainly with links of measurement, calculation, and blocking-signal inspection. The hidden failures in these links are called dynamic hidden failures.|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of failure mechanisms in electrical systems due to electrical connector in a vibrating media often relies {{on only one}} type of electrical environment, i. e. resistive load. However, these are not capable of digging out the behavior of connectors when the electrical system includes other electrical environments, for instance inductive load. The aim of the thesis is to fill this gap, by studying how the damages of electrical contacts in a vibrating environment depend on the electrical environments, in heavy vehicles. The purpose is to investigate, what effects current and voltage have in each electrical environment related to connector’s lifespan and reliability. The main failure mechanism in the connector with tin coated <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> are fretting corrosion which is induced by micro oscillatory motion due to vibration and thermal fluctuation. To do so a serie of experimental studies has been conducted for different samples of electrical connectors...|$|R
