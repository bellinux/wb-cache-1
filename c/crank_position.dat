These systems can {{be integrated into the}} engine management or existing anti-lag system, or can be fitted as a standalone unit. The basic method of operation is to artificially lower the engine rev limiter to hold the engine at a speed where the turbo can produce usable boost, by altering the ignition.

The sensor was replaced overnight and a new wheel was welded on. The engine was not fired until the 2nd day of the competition after the technical inspections. On the 3rd day, the engine fired ok for the first acceleration event but the starter wheel gave out (possibly due to a misalignment during installation). The team replaced the engine within 1.5 hours {{to make it to the}} AutoX event in the afternoon, but had to skip Skid-Pad event. First driver successfully completed the AutoX run and the second driver did not complete his 2nd run after the engine started over-heating due to an electrical failure on the radiator fan. FSAE Michigan 2011 EnduranceThe first driver completed the first half of the event with no problems. As he was getting out of the car, he instructed the second driver to be cautious and take it slow. The second driver conducted his stint at mainly part throttle and through corners would hold the clutch in and then keep the RPMs high due to the belief that the engine was dying. The car was running ok but the 2nd driver was black flagged and had to pull in because of a malfunctioning brake light switch. As pulling in the pit lane, the driver quickly realized the problem and was able to pull back the brake pedal with his foot in order to be able to finish the rest of the race. For the remaining of the race, the driver pulled the brake pedal back with his foot every time he hit the brakes, which resulted him with very slow laptimes. Since the car was not tuned well for the RPM range that the driver was keeping the car at, the car ran out of fuel and DNF'ed from Endurance 2 laps before it could finish.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Configuration of bicycle {{components}} to the cyclist (bicycle fitting) commonly uses static poses of the cyclist on the bicycle at the 6 o’clock <b>crank</b> <b>position</b> to represent dynamic cycling positions. However, {{the validity of}} this approach and the potential use of the different <b>crank</b> <b>position</b> (e. g. 3 o’clock) have not been fully explored. Therefore, this study compared lower limb joint angles of cyclists in static poses (3 and 6 o’clock) compared to dynamic cycling. Methods. Using a digital camera, right sagittal plane images were taken of thirty cyclists seated on their own bicycles mounted on a stationary trainer with the crank at 3 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions. Video was then recorded during pedalling at a self-selected gear ratio and pedalling cadence. Sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle angles were digitised. Results. Differences between static and dynamic angles were large at the 6 o’clock <b>crank</b> <b>position</b> with greater mean hip angle (4. 9 ± 3 °), smaller knee angle (8. 2 ± 5 °) and smaller ankle angle (8. 2 ± 5. 3 °) for static angles.

To perform bicycle fitting, joint angles should be measured dynamically or with the cyclist in a static pose at the 3 o’clock <b>crank</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{optimize}} training {{relating to}} the coordinative skills of athletes, a special cycle ergometer ARES with decoupled cranks was developed. The system {{is equipped with a}} measurement system to measure radial and tangential forces on the pedals, additionally to the acquisition of angle velocities of the two crank wheels. Due to the decoupled cranks, every leg performs its own revolution, and has to be active even at the pulling phase, without direct support of the opposite legs downstroke. To explore the unique possibilities of ARES, 4 subjects were tested on the ergometer in a first trial. After a short acclimatization phase to get familiar with the characteristics of the bike, the following tests were performed: (1) normal biking at different numbers of revolution with the challenge to keep a 180 ° phase angle, and (2) special coordination tasks: a) biking with 0 ° phase angle, b) Stop-and-go procedures with re-synchronization of the movement, c) counter-movement with both legs moving into opposite direction, and d) a lower half circle swing. During the exercises, forces on the pedals, the <b>crank</b> <b>positions</b> and current cadence were acquired. Out of this data, torque, power, angle velocities and an efficiency parameter were determined for the left and right leg. Variations in cadence, forces and torque as a function of pedal angle are clearly visible.

If the TF curve shape is alike to the shape of a sine curve, the balance torque will decrease the peak torque and eliminate the negative torque, and achieves a better balance effect than before. To overcome the inherent shortcomings of conventional pumping units, the researchers designed the phased pumping units and the dual-horsehead pumping units with a more reasonable TF curve that can greatly improve the balance effect and the system efficiency.|$|R

The model based synthesis of velocity reference cam functions is performed at increasing mech-anism actuation speeds. The performance of the system using the proposed velocity demand cam function is compared with the conventional constant speed reference case at different running speeds. ...|$|E

Several studies have been performed to investigate different design parameters of handcycles (e. g. crank length) already; however, most of those were done with able-bodied subjects, widely unfamiliar to handcycling. In this study bilateral surface electromyography (sEMG) of several muscles of the upper body and arms of an elite handcyclist (multiple medal-winner in Paralympic Games and World Championships) is performed with different crank lengths, crank positions and backrest positions at power levels of 130, 160 and 190 W resulting in a total of 22 measurements. sEMG data were recorded bilaterally at a recording frequency of 1000 Hz using Ag/AgCl electrodes. Concurrently the <b>crank</b> <b>position</b> was acquired with ten Vicon Bonita infrared cameras recording at 100 Hz. EMG data were rectiﬁed, smoothed and normalized to crank-cycle duration (0 - 360 deg) for each single crank-cycle. Phases of activity for each muscle (i. e.

Results showed that amplitude and iEMG were higher for higher power output and shorter cranks, crank and backrest position inﬂuenced several muscles but results were always similar for similar shoulder-crank-distances.

40|$|It {{is known}} to {{internal}} combustion researcher that the correct determination of the <b>crank</b> <b>position</b> when the piston is at Top Dead Centre (TDC) is very important, since an error of 1 crank angle degree (CAD) can cause up to a 10 % evaluation error on indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and a 25 % error on the heat released by the combustion: the TDC position should be then known within a precision of 0. 1 CAD. This task {{can be accomplished by}} means of a dedicated capacitive sensor, which allows a measurement within the required 0. 1 degrees precision. Such a sensor has a substantial cost and its use is not really fast; a different approach can be followed using a thermodynamic method, whose input is the pressure curve sampled during the compression and expansion strokes of a “motored” (i. e. without combustion) cylinder. In this work the authors compare an original thermodynamic method with other ones available in literature, by means of both experimental and simulated pressure curves. A zero dimensional thermodynamic model was employed to obtain an extensive collection of numeric pressure curves by changing engine geometry (e. g. compression ratios from 10 to 20 were adopted), operative conditions and wall heat transfer laws. The in-cylinder mass leakage has been taken into account in the model. Moreover, in order to assess the reliability and robustness of each method, the typical measurement errors and disturbances related to indicating analysis have been taken into account.

Corticospinal and spinal excitability were assessed using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cervicomedullary-evoked potentials (CMEPs) elicited via transmastoid electrical stimulation (TMES), respectively. Participants were seated upright in front on arm cycle ergometer. Responses were recorded from the biceps brachii at two different <b>crank</b> <b>positions</b> (6 and 12 o’clock positions relative to a clock face) while arm cycling with neutral and pronated handgrip positions. Responses were also elicited during tonic elbow flexion to compare/contrast the results to a non-rhythmic motor output. MEP and CMEP amplitudes were significantly larger at the 6 o’clock position while arm cycling with a neutral handgrip position compared to pronated (45. 6 and 29. 9 %, respectively). There were no differences in MEP and CMEP amplitudes at the 12 o’clock position for either handgrip position. For the tonic contractions, MEPs were significantly larger with a neutral versus pronated handgrip position (32. 6 % greater) while there were no difference in CMEPs. Corticospinal excitability was higher with a neutral handgrip position for both arm cycling and tonic elbow flexion. While spinal excitability was also higher with a neutral handgrip position during arm cycling, no difference was observed during tonic elbow flexion. These findings suggest that not only is corticospinal excitability to the biceps brachii modulated at both the supraspinal and spinal level, but that it is influenced differently between rhythmic arm cycling and tonic elbow flexion...|$|R

However, its 2 ̆ 2 one-size-fits-all 2 ̆ 2 design is faced with a number of shortcomings. Purpose. To study strategies to improve FES-LCE exercise for individuals with SCI. Specific aims were to (1) compare pedaling dynamics of persons with SCI with able-bodied individuals; (2) identify stimulation patterns that minimize individual muscle force requirements; (3) measure force contribution of thigh and shank muscles involved in pedaling at different stimulation intensities and crank positions; and (4) develop, test, and compare a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model as a predictor of thigh muscle strength sufficient for FES-LCE with other well-known statistical methods. Methodology. Six male SCI subjects between ages 20 [...] 54 years (mean 32 ± 12 years) participated in FES-LCE. Twelve able-bodied subjects between ages 18 [...] 50 years (mean 27 ± 12 years) participated in LCE without FES.
