A study of <b>cauliflower</b> plant and nitrogen nutrition relations was conducted in a commercial production field in Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia. The objectives were {{to determine the effects}} of nitrogen nutrition on <b>cauliflower</b> plant development and to quantify <b>cauliflower</b> plant N uptake ability among different varieties. The treatments consisted of three <b>cauliflower</b> varieties (‘Minuteman’, ‘Sevilla’ and ‘Whistler’) and three post-transplanting rates of N (0, 45 and 90 kg ha- 1), arranged in a split-block design in the field. Results showed that the N uptake ability of <b>cauliflower</b> plants varied between 6. 2 and 9. 0 g plant- 1, depending on varieties. The <b>cauliflower</b> varieties ‘Sevilla’ and ‘Minuteman’ had a significantly higher ability of N uptake than the cultivar ‘Whistler’ (P < 0. 05). All three varieties responded significantly to the reduced post-transplanting input (45 kg N ha- 1). There was a significant correlation between <b>cauliflower</b> head yield and whole plant N uptake (R 2 = 0. 64, P < 0. 05). It was suggested that increasing N assimilation in whole plant could stimulate <b>cauliflower</b> head development, which could also lead to a reduction of 50 % post-transplanting inputs.

40|$|A {{protocol}} for <b>cauliflower</b> micro-propagule production {{was developed and}} optimised for both micropropagation and artificial seed production techniques using meristematic tissues from <b>cauliflower</b> curd. All steps in the protocol were empirically optimised including: blending, sieving, culture methods, liquid culture media composition and plant growth regulator combinations and concentrations. The cost of the micro-propagules could be reduced {{by as much as}} 50 % on the initial costings reported previously since treatments doubled the number of microshoots produced per culture unit. The research confirmed the suitability of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots to be encapsulated as artificial seeds and an effective {{protocol for}} microshoot encapsulation was designed through the optimization of 1) the production of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots suitable for encapsulation, 2) encapsulation procedures, 3) artificial seed artificial endosperm structure, 4) conversion materials. The possibility of culturing <b>cauliflower</b> artificial seeds in commercial substrates such as perlite, sand, vermiculite and compost was confirmed. The use of plant preservative mixture (PPM) for the control of contamination in <b>cauliflower</b> culture media and artificial seeds was optimised and the effect of this material on the development of plant material was assessed. It was confirmed that <b>cauliflower</b> artificial seed could be stored in a domestic refrigerator for up to 6 months which could have a great impact in <b>cauliflower</b> breeding programmes. The huge number of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots that could be produced using this protocol and the homogeneity of the culture system, provided a tool for the molecular analysis of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots (and artificial seed) abiotic stress tolerance analysis. Various treatments were conducted to improve microshoot cold tolerance and the up-regulation of the CBF/DREB 1 transcription factor including low temperature acclimation, mannitol, ABA (abscisic acid) and Mo (molybdenum). Microshoots were confirmed to acclimate successfully using low temperature. Mo was shown to improve the cold tolerance of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots and to up-regulate CBF/DREB 1 in the absence of low temperature acclimation. Acclimation did not increase the accumulation of dehydrin proteins and it is concluded that dehydrins do not {{play a significant role in}} the cold tolerance of <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots. Since <b>cauliflower</b> breeding and seed multiplication protocols make extensive use of micropropagation, the studies reported in this research could make a significant impact by decreasing the cost of micropropagation and increasing its reliability. It also opens new perspectives for further research for <b>cauliflower</b> artificial seed production and the possibility of sowing these seeds directly in the field. Furthermore, this research helps to facilitate <b>cauliflower</b> breeding programmes by improving the understanding of abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms and the relationship between different types of abiotic stresses such as cold and drought.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>cauliflower</b> extract on alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and on the hepatocyte morphology induced by theophylline in Wistar rats. Methods Twenty Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups. Group I was given only theophylline 20 mg/kg BW. Groups II, III, and IV were given <b>cauliflower</b> extract 200 g/kg BW, for 5, 10, 15 days, and on the last day were given theophylline 20 mg/kg BW. On days 5, 10, and 15 the animals were terminated, their livers taken and observed for microscopic appearance, while blood samples were taken for measuring ALT levels. Results <b>Cauliflower</b> affected a reduction in ALT levels, mean serum ALT concentration in rats given <b>cauliflower</b> for 5 days (109. 86 ± 2. 20 IU/L was significant higher compared to rats given <b>cauliflower</b> for 15 days (71. 58 ± 3. 17 IU/L) (p= 0. 000).

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the comparative profitability of selected winter vegetables like potato, <b>cauliflower</b> and tomato. To achieve this objective, total of 75 farmers, 25 producing potato, 25 producing <b>cauliflower</b> and 25 producing tomato were selected. For this purpose, Cobb-douglas production function model was used. Per hectare total cost of production of potato, <b>cauliflower</b> and tomato were 51396. 79, 64406. 06 and 61663. 87 TK., respectively and the corresponding gross incomes were 99401. 44, 119165. 12 and 93442. 24 TK., respectively. The estimated net return of producing potato, <b>cauliflower</b> and tomato were 48004. 65, 54759. 06 and 31778. 37 TK., respectively. For producing the three alternate winter vegetables net return was the highest for <b>cauliflower</b> followed by potato and tomato. It was also found that there was a large variation of yield in producing these winter vegetables among different categories of farms. In the case producing potato and <b>cauliflower,</b> per hectare yield was the highest for small farms followed by medium and large farms.

40|$|<b>Cauliflower</b> (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) {{has high}} {{nitrogen}} (N) demand during growing, {{but due to}} its low N use efficiency and N-rich residues, it may cause N losses by leaching after harvest. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of overwintering grass-clover as an intercrop and moderately reduced N fertilization on organic <b>cauliflower</b> yield and risk of nitrate leaching. The experiment tested sole-cropped (S) and intercropped (I) systems using a substitution design and two N fertilizer rates (180 and 230 kg N ha− 1). To investigate the competition between <b>cauliflower</b> and grass-clover, <b>cauliflower</b> grown alone with empty grass-clover rows (Semp) and grass-clover grown alone with empty <b>cauliflower</b> rows (GCemp) were included. The results showed that marketable yield was maintained in the I system compared to in the S system when calculated per meter crop row, and when N fertilization was moderately reduced. The Relative Competition Index (RCI) values in the I system were lower than 0, indicating that <b>cauliflower</b> growth was not interfered in the I system. The ability for aboveground N accumulation in the S and I systems was similar, but the N content of <b>cauliflower</b> residues in the S system was 33 and 23 kg ha− 1 {{higher than in the}} I system in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
