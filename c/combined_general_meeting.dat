40|$|The {{course of}} the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> of a joint-stock company The aim of this thesis is to {{describe}} the procedure of the convening and the {{course of the}} <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> of a joint-stock company according to the new Law No. 90 / 2012 Coll., on commercial companies and cooperatives. The regulation of the convening and {{the course of the}} <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> is highly important, because the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> is the supreme body of joint stock company, which is exclusively authorized to decide on the fundamental corporate issues. Structure of this thesis is divided into 5 chapters. The first chapter is general, introductory and it describes the definition, the regulation and the organization of the joint stock company. The second chapter is devoted {{to the question of the}} proper convention of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting,</b> which is the basic assumption to the valid course of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting.</b> In the first part of this chapter are defined reasons for convention of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> and bodies of the company entitled to this step.

The company acts by shareholders and directors voting and passing resolutions in <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> and board meetings respectively. Controlling sufficient votes to pass resolutions in <b>general</b> and board <b>meetings</b> is therefore the essence of corporate control. A shareholder's right to vote in <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> is a proprietary legal right, severable from the other incidents of share ownership.

40|$|The {{course of}} <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> of a joint-stock company The topic of this thesis is {{the course of}} <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> of a joint-stock company. A joint stock-company is a limited company (a stock corporation), that means a company when {{membership}} in this company is connected with the obligation of investment contribution, either monetary or non-monetary, and that upon its formation, or when increasing its registered capital. The supreme body of a joint-stock company is the <b>general</b> <b>meeting.</b> The <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> is a compulsory formed body regardless of the internal system of joint-stock companies, no matter {{if it is a}} monistic or dualistic board structure joint-stock company. With regard {{to the fact that it}} is compulsory, it is evident that the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> plays an important role in the functioning of the company itself. Within this thesis attention is also devoted to situations which are closely related to the course of <b>general</b> <b>meetings.</b> These are situations that precede <b>general</b> <b>meetings,</b> e. g. convening, and also situations after their closing.

40|$|Resolution of the <b>General</b> <b>Meeting</b> of Limited Liability Company The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is Resolution of the <b>General</b> <b>Meeting</b> of Limited Liability Company. Since legal {{character}} of a resolution is mainly determined by how a legal order defines legal persons and juridical acts, {{the first part of}} this thesis discusses the theoretical grounds of legal (artificial) persons. The specifics of the current legal regulation are also mentioned afterwards. These general conceptions are then applied to the specifics of the Czech legal order and limited liability company respectively. The second chapter looks into the function of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting.</b> Specifically, issues such as convening and powers of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> or attendace and voting at the <b>general</b> <b>meeting,</b> are dealt with. The third chapter analyzes the resolution of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> itself. It begins with a brief historical excursion to the concept of the legal nature of the resolution. Then it looks for an answer on how the resolution is percieved nowadays. It follows the conclusions found in chapter one, when it deals in more detail with the question of whose will is manifested in the resolution of the <b>general</b> <b>meeting.</b> Furthermore, a short explanation of the juridical acts is provided.
