Before the equation merge, correlation coefficient of <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> for nitrogen content on each rice parts was 0. 945 (Leaf), 0. 928 (Stem), and 0. 864 (Whole plant), respectively. In the cali-bration models created by each part in the rice plant under the various regression method, the calibration model for the leaf was recorded with relatively high accuracy. Among of those, the <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> developed by Partial least squares (PLS) method was more accurate than the Multiple linear regression (MLR) method. The <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> was sensitive based on variety and location variations. How-ever, we have merged and enlarged various of the samples that made not only to measure the nitrogen content more accurately, but also later sampling populations became more diversified. After merging, R 2 value becomes more accurate and significantly to 0. 950 (L.), 0. 974 (S.), 0. 940 (W.). Also, after removal of outlier, R 2 values increased into 0. 998, 0. 995, and 0. 997. In view of the results so far achieved, Standard error of prediction (SEP) and SEP (C) were reduced in the stem and whole plant. Biases were reduced in the leaf, stem as well as whole plant.

The {{objective of this}} research was to evaluate the potential of near infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for the analysis of these traits in almond flour. Ground kernels of 181 accessions collected in 2009 were used for developing <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> for oil content and concentrations of individual fatty acids. <b>Calibration</b> <b>equations</b> were developed using second derivative transformation and modified partial least squares regression. They were validated with samples from 179 accessions collected in 2010. The accuracy of <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> was measured through the coefficient of determination (r 2) in external validation and the ratio of the SD in the validation set to the standard error of prediction (RPD). Both r 2 and RPD were high for oil content (r 2 = 0. 99; RPD= 9. 24) and concentrations of oleic (r 2 = 0. 97; RPD= 5. 37) and linoleic acids (r 2 = 0. 98; RPD= 7. 35), revealing that <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> for these traits are highly accurate. Conversely, the accuracy of the <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> for palmitic (r 2 = 0. 54; RPD= 1. 41) and stearic acids (r 2 = 0. 52; RPD= 1. 44) was too low for allowing their application in practice. NIRS discrimination of oil content and concentrations of oleic and linoleic acids was mainly based on the spectral region from 2240 to 2380 nm. Practical applications: NIRS is a high-throughput analytical technique that allows fast measurement of several traits in a single analysis without using chemical reagents. We evaluated the feasibility of analyzing oil content and concentrations of palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids in almond flour using fruits collected during 2 years from a world germplasm collection. The fruits collected in 2009 were used for NIRS calibration, whereas the fruits collected in 2010 were used for validation. NIRS equations were highly accurate for measuring oil content and concentrations of oleic and linoleic acids, which are important traits defining the quality of almond flour for specific uses in the food industry. These results have applications both in the research laboratory and the food industry, where NIRS is becoming a widely used technique for quality control.

40|$|Based on the {{operating}} characteristics of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> have been developed that allow conversion of the counts from the radiometer into Earth-existing radiances. These radiances are the geophysical properties the instrument {{has been designed to}} measure. SeaWiFS uses bilinear gains to allow high sensitivity measurements of ocean-leaving radiances and low sensitivity measurements of radiances from clouds, which are much brighter than the ocean. The calculation of these bilinear gains is central to the <b>calibration</b> <b>equations.</b> Several other factors within these equations are also included. Among these are the spectral responses of the eight SeaWiFS bands. A band's spectral response includes the ability of the band to isolate a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and the amount of light that lies outside of that region. The latter is termed out-of-band response. In the calibration procedure, some of the counts from the instrument are produced by radiance in the out-of-band region. The number of those counts for each band {{is a function of the}} spectral shape of the source. For the SeaWiFS <b>calibration</b> <b>equations,</b> the out-of-band responses are converted from those for the laboratory source into those for a source with the spectral shape of solar flux. The solar flux, unlike the laboratory calibration, approximates the spectral shape of the Earth-existing radiance from the oceans. This conversion modifies the results from the laboratory radiometric calibration by 1 - 4 percent, depending on the band. These and other factors in the SeaWiFS <b>calibration</b> <b>equations</b> are presented here, both for users of the SeaWiFS data set and for researchers making ground-based radiance measurements in support of Sea WiFS...|$|R

A total of 72 hand-clipped samples of each species was taken from seeded monocultures in eastern Nebraska throughout the 1992, 1993, and 1994 growing seasons.

40|$|Grass (monocots) and non-grass (dicots) {{proportions}} in ruminant diets {{are important}} nutritionally because the non-grasses are usually higher in nutritive value, particularly protein, than the grasses, especially in tropical pastures. For ruminants grazing tropical pastures where the grasses are C- 4 species and most non-grasses are C- 3 species, {{the ratio of}} C- 13 /C- 12 in diet and faeces, measured as delta C- 13 parts per thousand, is proportional to dietary non-grass%. This paper describes {{the development of a}} faecal near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> for predicting faecal delta C- 13 from which dietary grass and non-grass proportions can be calculated. Calibration development used cattle faeces derived from diets containing only C- 3 non-grass and C- 4 grass components, and a series of expansion and validation steps was employed to develop robustness and predictive reliability. The final <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> contained 1637 samples and faecal delta C- 13 range (parts per thousand) of [12. 27]-[27. 65]. Calibration statistics were: standard error of calibration (SEC) of 0. 78, standard error of cross-validation (SECV) of 0. 80, standard deviation (SD) of reference values of 3. 11 and R- 2 of 0. 94. Validation statistics for the final <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> applied to 60 samples were: standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0. 87, bias of - 0. 15, R- 2 of 0. 92 and RPD of 3. 16. The <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> was also tested on faeces from diets containing C- 4 non-grass species or temperate C- 3 grass species. Faecal delta C- 13 predictions indicated that the spectral basis of the calibration was not related to C- 13 /C- 12 ratios per se but to consistent differences between grasses and non-grasses in chemical composition and that the differences were modified by photosynthetic pathway. Thus, although the <b>calibration</b> <b>equation</b> could not be used to make valid faecal delta C- 13 predictions when the diet contained either C- 3 grass or C- 4 non-grass, it could be used to make useful estimates of dietary non-grass proportions. It could also be ut :sed to make useful estimates of non-grass in mixed C- 3 grass/non-grass diets by applying a modified formula to calculate non-grass from predicted faecal delta C- 13.
