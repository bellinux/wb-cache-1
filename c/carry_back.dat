5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> mount cylinders. They {{may be used}} in conjunction with other side mounted stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E

After two further defeats, Price replaced Sellers with Manuel Ycaza but <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> was beaten again when third in the Gulfstream Park Handicap in March. After a short break, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> moved north and recorded his first win {{of the year when}} taking the $10,000 Marriage Purse at Aqueduct by five lengths from Garwol. With that win, he overtook Stymie to become the fifth biggest money winner in American racing.

25|$|Price ran <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> twenty-one {{times as}} a two-year-old juvenile, {{beginning}} in Florida in January, winning five times, with four seconds and four thirds.

In his first sixteen starts, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> won two minor races, attracting some press attention when setting a track record for five furlongs at Gulfstream Park in April. He finished third to Hail to Reason in the Sapling Stakes at Oceanport in August and second by a nose to the same colt in the World's Playground Stakes at Atlantic City in September.|$|E

25|$|A {{success by}} ship of line {{fighting}} alone against {{a squadron of}} well armed frigates was not common during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. For example, in the Action of 8 March 1795, the 74-gun HMS Berwick was captured in just 15 minutes by the French frigate Alceste, supported by the frigates Minerve and Vestale. As a reward for his victory, Captain Alonso de Torres y Guerra was given the encomienda of Corral de Caracuel in the Order of Alcántara, which included, asides of the title of knight, an income of 15.800 reales.

25|$|<b>Carry</b> <b>Back,</b> a {{dark brown}} horse, raced {{in the blue}} and silver colors of retired {{manufacturer}} Jack Price, who bred the colt at the Ocala Stud in Marion County, Florida. Price trained the colt for his wife, Katherine. In early 1958, Price took over ownership of an obscure mare named Joppy for a fee of $150 plus a $150 overdue board bill at his Ohio farm. Joppy's racing record was poor. In seven starts, she finished second twice and earned only $325. Joppy was eventually banned from racing, {{a result of her}} frequent refusals to leave the starting gate. For a modest $400 stud fee, Price bred Joppy to a stallion named Saggy. Saggy's only real claim to fame was that in April 1948 he handed Citation the only loss of his Triple Crown winning season with a one length win in the Chesapeake Trial at Havre de Grace Racetrack.|$|E

25|$|Problems also arose between Diogo and the Portuguese {{settlers}} at Sao Tome {{known as}} Tomistas. According to a treaty between Kongo and Portugal, the former were only to trade within the latter's realm for slaves. That meant the Portuguese were {{restricted to the}} slaves offered by King Diogo or those he authorized to sell slaves. Every year the Tomistas would come with 12 to 15 ships to <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> between 400 and 700 slaves (5,000–10,000 slaves a year). This {{was not enough to}} take advantage of Kongo's ever-growing supply of slaves thanks to wars on its eastern frontier. The captains would try to overload their cargos, resulting in revolts. However, the factor that actually broke the deal was the Tomista habit of sailing upriver to the Malebo Pool to purchase slaves from BaTeke traders who were increasingly taken with European goods over the nzimbu shells the manikongo offered them. Enraged by this breach of contract, King Diogo broke off relations in 1555 and expelled 70 or so Portuguese living in his realm (many of whom had lived {{there for a long time}} with African wives and mixed-race children).|$|E

2500|$|On 28 May (Memorial Day), <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> contested the Metropolitan Mile {{for which}} the American Horse of the Year Kelso was made 3/5 {{favorite}} despite carrying 133 pounds. Ridden by Johnny Rotz (Ycaza had been suspended for his ride on Ridan in the Preakness), <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> took the lead well inside the final furlong and won by {{two and a half}} lengths from Merry Ruler with Kelso in sixth. The prize money of $72,735 enabled him to become the fourth millionaire thoroughbred in American racing history. Carry Back's winning time of 1:33.6 for the mile equaled the track record but Price admitted that Kelso, who was making his first appearance of the year, had not given his true running and was still the better horse. On July 4, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> and Kelso met again in what was expected to be a virtual match race for the Suburban Handicap, but both were well beaten by the surprise winner Beau Purple. Ten days later, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back,</b> Kelso and Beau Purple all ran in the Monmouth Handicap. <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> showed his well-being as he [...] "kicked and squirmed" [...] in the paddock before the race and went on to produce his best performance of the year. Rotz produced <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> with a late challenge to take the lead halfway down the stretch and win by three lengths from Kelso in a track record time of 2:00.4 for the mile and a quarter. A week later, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> started favorite for the Brooklyn Handicap but finished fourth to Beau Purple, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. With Rotz suspended, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> was reunited with John Sellers in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga in August. Carrying top weight of 130 pounds, <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> started odds-on favorite and won by two lengths from Crozier. By this time, Carry Back's winnings of $1,128,150 had taken him to third place in the all-time earners list, behind only Round Table and Nashua. On August 28 <b>Carry</b> <b>Back</b> easily defeated Beau Purple by eight lengths in the one mile Wilderness Handicap at Aqueduct, but ran a disappointing fourth to Crozier in the Aqueduct Stakes a week later.|$|E
