After applications, the animals were killed and the testes were excised for determination of tissue malondialdehyde, Glutation Peroxidase (GSH-Px), the activity of superoxide dismutase and determination of tissue fatty acids compositions. The activites of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) in testicular tissue specimens were determined spectrophotometrically.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{observational}} data for OB {{stars in the}} SMC concentrating on those aspects of their spectra which provide information on processes which may strongly influence their evolution, namely mass-loss, rotational mixing and mass-transfer. We illustrate the very weak winds now thought to pertain to late O-dwarfs in the SMC, using HST/STIS observations of the main sequence in the very young cluster NGC 346, briefly discussing the quantitative results for these stars, and the difficulties involved in their determination. We show how stars with similar luminosities can have different luminosity classes while stars with similar spectral types and luminosity classes can have significantly different luminosities. While the weak winds of the dwarfs present serious difficulties for the determination of wind terminal velocities we show that the supergiants have terminal velocities comparable to OB supergiants in the Milky Way, agreement with theory. We also summarize recent work demonstrating that the temperature dependence of wind terminal velocities does not follow the widely adopted step-like approximation. Finally we review surface <b>compositons</b> of OB stars in the SMC finding that 42 out of 45 OB stars with detailed surface abundances are enriched in nitrogen by a factor 1 ̃ 0 or more. While these enhancements {{are consistent with those}} produced by models with rotational mixing the rotational velocities of the sample are significantly lower than the values predicted by the modesls, indicating a possible problem with the evolution of angular momentum in the models or possibly in the efficiency of mixing.

40|$|Peridotite xenoliths {{erupted in}} late Miocene basalts (~ 8 Ma) {{in the central}} Sierra Nevada sample a {{lithosphere}} that is vertically stratified in terms of age and thermal history. The deeper portions (~ 45 - 100 km) have asthenospheric osmium isotopic <b>compositons</b> and possess textural and chemical evidence for cooling from > 1100 ° to 700 - 820 °C. The shallower portions (< 60 km) have unradiogenic Os isotopic compositions, which yield Proterozoic model ages, and contain orthopyroxenes that record temperatures as low as 670 °C in their cores and heating up to 900 °C on their rims. These observations suggest that the deeper xenoliths represent fragments of hot asthenosphere that upwelled to intrude and/or underplate the overlying Proterozoic lithosphere represented by the shallower xenoliths. The contrasting thermal histories between the shallow and deep xenoliths suggest that hot asthenosphere and cold lithosphere were suddenly juxtaposed, a feature consistent with the aftermath of rapid lithospheric removal or sudden intrusion of asthenospheric mantle into the lithosphere rather than passive extension. On the basis of regional tectonics and various time constraints, {{it is possible that}} this lithospheric removal event was associated with the generation of the Sierra Nevada granitic batholith during Mesozoic subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America. Pleistocene basalt-hosted xenoliths record a different chapter in the geodynamic history of the Sierras. These xenoliths are relatively fertile, come from depths shallower than 45 - 60 km, are characterized by asthenospheric Os isotopic compositions, record hot equilibration temperatures (1000 °- 1100 °C), and show no evidence for cooling. The strong contrast in composition and thermal history between the Pleistocene and late Miocene suites indicate that the post-Mesozoic lithospheric mantle, as represented by the latter, was entirely replaced by the former. The hot Pleistocene peridotites may thus represent new lithospheric additions associated with a post-Miocene lithospheric removal event or extension. High elevations, low sub-Moho seismic velocities, and the presence of fast velocity anomalies at 200 km depth may be manifestations of this event. If lithospheric removal occurred in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the observations presented here place constraints on the styles of lithospheric removal. In the Mesozoic, the lithospheric mantle was only partially removed, whereas in the Pliocene, the entire lithospheric mantle and probably the mafic lower crust were removed...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the solid-solution formation between pre-existing BaSO 4 and radium released from spent fuel is already well accepted and addressed in assessments regarding the safety of long-term disposal of high-level nuclear waste in deep geological formations [1, 2]. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant incorporation of Ra(aq) into a pure barite [3, 4, 5, 6]. However, in natural systems, barite is often accompanied by celestine, SrSO 4, or is represented by intermediate <b>compositons</b> of the (Ba,Sr) SO 4 solid solution. Earlier studies are contradictory {{with regard to the}} effect of strontium on the uptake of radium: Ceccarello et al. (2004) [7] report an inhibiting effect of strontium whereas Jucker and Treadwell (1954) [8] and Zhang et al. (2014) [9] report on significant radium uptake during the co-precipitation of (Sr,Ra) SO 4 or (Sr,Ba,Ra) SO 4. Here, we are reporting new experimental results on the uptake of radium (1) by a pre-existing celestite and (2) by a pre-existing (Sr,Ba) SO 4 solid solution. A high purity synthetic celestine (99. 99 + %), was put into a contact with an aqueous solution containing 5. 0. 10 - 6 mol/L of RaBr 2 and 0. 1 mol/L of NaCl. In these batch experiments (solid/liquid ratios: 5 g/L or 0. 5 g/L), a significant Ra uptake was not expected, considering that the formation of a solid solution between celestine and RaSO 4 should be disfavoured by a large difference in the radii of Sr 2 + and Ra 2 + ions. Contrary to this expectation, an uptake of up to 92 % of the initial Ra was observed within 200 days in these experiments. The SEM investigation showed the formation of a tiny amount of idiomorphic Ba- and Ra-rich crystals {{on the surface of the}} celestine, which remained stable for more than 200 days. The formation of these crystals suggested that traces of Ba were present in the celestine. Interestingly, no Ba-rich crystals were formed in the reference experiments without Ra, while the addition of Ra into the system has caused the release of Ba from the celestine. The formation of the Ba- and Ra-rich crystals was coincident with a significant increase in Ba(aq). The concentration of Ba in the aqueous phase was thus controlled by the presence or absence of the Ra-rich phase. Similar results were observed in all radium uptake experiments with (Ba,Sr) SO 4 solid solutions. In one experiment where small amounts of barite were added to the high purity celestine, a clear replacement according to a dissolution-precipitation mechanism was observed, while the rim zone consisted of a ternary (Ra,Sr,Ba) SO 4 solid solution. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results: 1) RaSO 4 mixes very favourably with BaSO 4, 2) RaSO 4 can still mix (but less favourably) with a dilute solid solution of SrSO 4 in BaSO 4, 3) the mixing of RaSO 4 with SrSO 4 is totally unfavourable, 4) the mixing between BaSO 4 and SrSO 4 is more favourable than between RaSO 4 and SrSO 4.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The San Gabriel anorthosite-syenite body {{is part of}} large layered intrusive, part of which underlies about 250 square kilometers in the western San Gabriel Mountains between the San Gabriel and San Andreas fault zones 30 kilometers north of Los Angeles. Although not subjected to post-emplacement regional metamorphism, the Precambrian anorthosite is intruded by the early Triassic Mt. Lowe granodiorite and the late Cretaceous Mt. Josephine granodiorite, and is deformed by broad folds {{of at least two}} ages (Triassic(?) and mid-Cenozoic), which have produced several kilometers of structural relief within the body. Several sets of faults in the area were active in Teritiary time, but none of them show evidence of Holocene activity. From oldest to youngest, these faults include: (1) several more or less east-west faults with major apparent right-lateral or left-lateral and dip-slip displacements; (2) a NE-trending fault set with important left-lateral displacements; and (3) younger NW-trending faults with small dip-slip and right-lateral displacements. The San Gabriel fault, which lies 1 - 4 kilometers southwest of its margin, must cut the anorthosite-syenite body at depth and may offset anorthositic rocks at least 28 - 46 kilometers in a right-lateral sense. The San Gabriel anorthosite-syenite body is part of a large allochthonous sheet which is floored by a zone of unusual cataclastic gneisses, exposed in the northeastern part of the area in and near to Mill Canyon. Slickensides, lineations and minor folds within this zone suggest latest movement parallel to a N-S or NE-SW direction. Strongly deformed and mylonitized gneisses below the anorthosite include lineated granodioritic gneiss possibly equivalent to the late-Cretaceous Mt. Josephine granodiorite, gabbroic to anorthositic gneisses, and layered amphibolitic gneisses unlike any others seen in the western San Gabriel Mountains. Large thrust displacements probably occurred within this zone as well as along the Vincent thrust 45 kilometers to the east, which resembles this zone and may be related to it. The anorthosite-syenite body was intruded into previously metamorphosed, granulite-grade Mendenhall gneiss about 1200 million years ago. The body is a large, layered intrusive in which bottom crystal accumulation produced the observed anorthosite-gabbro-syenite differentiation suite. The part of this body now exposed was at least 10 kilometers in thickness and about 15 kilometers in diameter. It probably had the form of an inverted cone, with a sub-horizontal, concordant uppper contact. Primary quartz is rare in rocks of this suite; the following lithologies have been distinguished {{on the basis of the}} percentage and composition of their constituent feldspars: anorthosite, leucogabbro, gabbro, ferrogabbro (all with calcic andesine), ultramafite (olivine, augite, ilmenite and apatite), jotunite (predominantly antiperthitic sodic andesine), mangerite (antiperthite and mesoperthite) and syenite (predominantly mesoperthite). The San Gabriel anorthosite-syenite body has been subdivided into three main stratigraphic units (from oldest to youngest) : (1) The lowest, largest unit consists of thick sequences of massive anorthosite alternating with layered leucogabbro. This unit is at least 7 kilometers in thickness and becomes more mafic near its top. (2) The overlying syenite unit locally attains thickness of at least 3 - 5 kilometers, but is commonly much thinner or absent. In some areas, the basal 100 - 1000 meters of this unit is extremely mafic, but otherwise it is farily homogeneous and massive, with no cyclic or cryptic layering. (3) The uppermost jotunite unit is a highly compositionally variable unit which intruded overlying granulite gneiss and has been subdivided into 5 subunits. This unit is at least 3 - 4 kilometers in maximum thickness. It is apparently younger than the syenite, and in places grades downward into syenite. Several masses of hornblende-bytownite gabbro within anorthosite are probably not directly related to the anorthosite-syenite body. Primary cumulate structures and textures in these rocks have greatly aided the structural interpretation of this body and provide strong evidence of its origin by bottom crystal accumulation. Large, 6 to 25 -centimeter hypersthene crystals, which ophitically enclose numerous well-oriented 1 to 3 -centimeter plagioclase tablets, indicate a cumulate origin of the leucogabbro. Occasional crescumulate layers in leucogabbro, especially near the margin of the body, formed when first plagioclase and then hypersthene grew from the floor upward into the magma. Slump structures are poorly defined in leucogabbro, but are excellently developed in the mafic lower part of the syenite unit and in some parts of the jotunite unit, and include 1 to 20 -meter slump blocks and deformed compositional layers. Many 3 -centimeter to 3 -meter layers in the mafic lower part of the syenite unit and in the jotunite unit are both size- and density-graded, with coarser, ferromagnesian-mineral-enriched bases, and are extremely useful structural indicators. Large angular blocks of anorthosite (to 20 meters) are abundant in layered mafic rocks at the base of the syenite unit and in some parts of the jotunite unit. These are slump blocks, which indicate that parts of the syenite and jotunite units accumulated at the base of major tectonic scarps which developed in rocks of the anorthosite-leucogabbro unit which formed the floor of the chambers of the later magmas. All of the 20 chemical analyses of rocks from this body are iron-rich; the lowest FeO+[ [...] . ]/[ [...] . ] ratio (wt. %) is 0. 61 and most are between 0. 70 and 0. 95, which suggest that the original magma was probably similarly iron-rich. Chemical analyses of these rocks define general trends with substantial scatter on variation diagrams, and in detail those from each of the three units define individual fields with little or no overlap. Thus a common line of descent for all rocks of the body seems somewhat unlikely. The estimated makeup of the entire body is about 46 % anorthosite, 23 % leucogabbro, 4 % gabbro, 12 % syenite, 11 % jotunite and 4 % ultramafite, giving the following suggested average composition: SiO 2, 53. 73 %, TiO 2, 1. 17 %, Al 2 O 3, 22. 33 %, Fe 2 O 3, 1. 66 %, FeO, 4. 54 %, MgO, 1. 72 %, CaO, 8. 08 %, Na 2 O, 5. 05 %, K 2 O, 1. 18 %, P 2 O 5, 0. 42 %. Limited mineral composition data show that: (1) Plagioclase in anorthosite and leucogabbro ranges between about An 35 and An 55 with most between An 40 and An 50. Plagioclase in not concentrically zoned, but is inhomogeneous with a range of about 3 - 4 % anorthite in individual crystals. (2) There are cyclic compositional variations of plagioclase in the anorthosite-leucogabbro unit, with more albite-rich and more anorthite-rich <b>compositons</b> alternating over hundreds of meters of the stratigraphic section. (3) There is no apparent consistent cryptic variation of proxene and olivine compositions within the syenite and jotunite units. Postcumulous recrystallization has drastically altered the fabric of most anorthositic and leucogabbroic rocks and has produced extremely coarse grained textures. Pervasive deuteric uralitic alteration of the primary ferromagnesian minerals in all but a few rocks of the syenite and jotunite units suggests that the magma probably had a relatively high water content. It is possible that all of the rocks of the San Gabriel anorthosite-syenite body could have been produced by differentiation by fractional crystallization of a trachyandesitic parent magma, successive fractions of which were intruded into the magma chamber. However, the detailed sequence of lithologies, mineral compositions and the compositions of the three units suggest that at least two independently generated magmas may have combined to produce the San Gabriel anorthosite-syenite body. Some important contributions of this study are: (1) the detailed geologic map of the anorthosite-syenite body and determination of its post-emplacement structural history; (2) the description of the complete suite of lithologies and their contact relationships; (3) the description of the mineralogical compositions of each lithology and the recognition of cryptic variation of plagioclase in the anorthosite-leucogabbro unit; (4) the description of the sequence of post-accumulation processes including recrystallization and the hydration of most primary ferromagnesian minerals; (5) the recognition of uninverted pigeonite in rocks of the jotunite and syenite units; and (6) recognition that this andesine anorthosite massif is actually a large deformed stratiform pluton...|$|R

A total of 6, 000 leptocephali of various size classes were sorted out form 255 samples. The {{spatial distribution of}} leptocephali based on these observations showed that species <b>compositon</b> as well as abundance were maximum on the west coast, between Goa and Cochin, beyond 1000 meters line. The distribution of larvae coincided very well with the depth of DSL and no regular seasonality was noticed. The total length of the leptocephali varied from 2 to 70 cm for different stages of metamorphosis...|$|E

According {{to the results of}} XRD, quartz, illite, calcite and albite were all found in three samples; Dolomite was found only in dustfall; Clinochlore was existed in both PM 2. 5 and soil. From the results of XRF, elemental <b>compositon</b> of three samples were focused on elemental Na, Si, Al, S, Ca, Fe, Mg, K. Based on the grain size analysis, the size distribution of dustfall mainly ranges from 1 µm to 40 µm. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma work is a look on {{creating}} contemporary music using computer. It asks a question wheater using digital technologies could effect the compositional thinking of the composer. In the front of consideration is sound as 'form-creator' of composition and shortly set ups {{the historical development of}} electroacoustic music studios in context with development of electroacustic music. Part of this thesis are analyses of compositions, on which computer tegnologies have been involved in. The last part of this thesis dissertates about the personal approach to this issue and to changes in own <b>compositon</b> paradigms within the time frame...|$|E

Selected streams were monitored on the Great pokrusnohorska dump, and streams unaffected by dumps. Values of pH, conductivity, alkalinity, oxygen saturation and temperature were measured, and quantitative and qualitative samples of macrozoobethos were taken too. The dump?s water are characterized by high concentrations of dissolved solids and alkalinity. Species diverzity of these waters is lower and is affected not only by chemical <b>compositon</b> of the water, but also by the character of the bottom substrate...|$|E

Infrared transmission measurements were performed on HgCdTe material using an infrared beam diameter of 9 μm. Line scans and area maps of transmission spectra were obtained to investigate statistical variations in infrared absorption. The HgCdTe material demonstrates {{a high degree of}} uniformity, with a standard deviation in absorption coefficient near the sensitive turn-on region of less than 3 % and standard deviation in extracted Hg 1 -xCdxTeHg 1 -xCdxTe <b>compositon</b> of 3 × 10 − 4. 3 × 10 − 4. © 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

The present study tests the proposition that these fractions should also exhibit features of translational complementarity with respect to the DNA-dependent or the RNA-dependent incorporation of amino acids into ribosomes. This {{has been shown to be}} the case with the use of two pairs of amino acids: (1) lysine and phenylalanine; (2) proline and glycine...|$|E
