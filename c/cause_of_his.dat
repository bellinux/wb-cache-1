5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death have since {{been a matter of}} discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E

5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During {{the latter part of}} 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E
5|$|Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was {{afflicted by}} acute pain {{all over his}} body, {{especially}} in his arms. He then composed the Hanuman Bahuk, where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by Bartod boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by {{pulling out of the}} hair), which may have been the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation {{was created}} at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide {{postgraduate}} scholarships to African students.

He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS as the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son Makgatho's death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years, White {{and his wife}} resided in St. Petersburg, Florida during the winter season. White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. {{at the age of}} 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The medical {{certification}} of White's death stated the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart failure was due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of his}} life, George III had recurrent, and {{eventually}} permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested {{that he had the}} blood disease porphyria, the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did not help the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm {{thought that they were}} a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E

5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon after, {{taking the}} hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage was the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{death has}} been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of}} death to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. In April 1962, he {{collapsed in the}} middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various checks, but were unable to determine the exact <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> headaches. On 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's right hemisphere.|$|E

50|$|On 6 August 1917, Zimmermann {{resigned}} as foreign secretary and was succeeded by Richard von Kühlmann. One <b>of</b> the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> resignation was the famous Zimmermann Telegram he sent on 16 January 1917. He died in Berlin in 1940 of pneumonia.|$|R
5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never {{received}} the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body was lost in the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain {{and had to be}} helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E
50|$|It {{was during}} these {{negotiations}} that O'Higgins met José Antonio Rodríguez Aldea, {{who was the}} secretary of the Royalist Commander, and who later went on to become O'Higgins' minister of finance and one <b>of</b> the main <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unpopularity and eventual downfall.|$|R
