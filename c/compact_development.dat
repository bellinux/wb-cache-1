Research has shown that low-density development can exacerbate non-point source pollutant loadings by consuming absorbent open space and increasing impervious surface area relative to <b>compact</b> <b>development.</b> While increasing densities regionally can better protect water resources at a regional level, higher-density development can create more impervious cover, which increases water quality problems in nearby or adjacent water bodies.|$|E

40|$|Cities are {{the main}} {{consumers}} of energy and resources {{but at the same}} time are considered as centres for innovation which can provide solutions to unsustainable development. An important concept regarding energy and resource efficiency on the scale of the city and city-region is the compact city. Compact cities and <b>compact</b> urban <b>development</b> are thought to decrease energy and resource demand per capita and increase efficiency. At the same time trade-offs and potential rebound effects of increased resource efficiency question certain achievements of a compact urban structure. This paper reviews aspects of resource and energy efficiency in <b>compact</b> city <b>development</b> in a European context. We conclude that, if the idea of the compact city should have any effect on resource and energy efficiency, accompanying measures have to be implemented, such as e. g. efficient public transport systems to offer alternative travel modes.

5000|$|An {{extensive}} 2009 {{report on}} the effects of <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> by the United States National Research Council of the Academy of Sciences, commissioned by the United States Congress, stated six main findings. First, that <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> is likely to reduce [...] "Vehicle Miles Traveled" [...] (VMT) throughout the country. Second, that doubling residential density in a given area could reduce VMT by as much as 25% if coupled with measures such as increased employment density and improved public transportation. Third, that higher density, mixed-use developments would produce both direct reductions in [...] emissions (from less driving), and indirect reductions (such as from lower amounts of materials used per housing unit, higher efficiency climate control, longer vehicle lifespans, and higher efficiency delivery of goods and services). Fourth, that although short term reductions in energy use and [...] emissions would be modest, that these reductions would become more significant over time. Fifth, that a major obstacle to more <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> in the United States is political resistance from local zoning regulators, which would hamper efforts by state and regional governments to participate in land-use planning. Sixth, the committee agreed that changes in development that would alter driving patterns and building efficiency would have various secondary costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify. The report recommends that policies supporting <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> (and especially its ability to reduce driving, energy use, and [...] emissions) should be encouraged.|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{forms of}} urban {{development}} such as high-density or in-fill development are often promoted for their significant environmental benefits. South Florida presents an excellent testing ground for this assumption, as the region grapples {{with issues of}} rapid urbanization and degradation of the Everglades, a unique ecosystem containing the largest freshwater wetlands in the United States. Resolving the competition for water between growing urban populations, the agriculture sector, and the plants and animals of the Everglades {{is one of the}} fundamental challenges of Everglades restoration. Hydrologists claim that sufficient water is available for all three if the water is managed properly and sufficient water storage can be found. In recent years, South Florida has adopted <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> as a means of managing its urban growth and curbing the historical patterns of low-density urban sprawl, so that future urban growth is compatible with ecosystem restoration. However the hydrologic benefits of <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> have yet to be quantified and proven. By using Palm Beach County as an example, this study evaluates the impact of <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> on aquifer recharge, which is an important means of storing water for the region. This analysis models the spatial distribution of future urban development under sprawl and <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> scenarios and evaluates potential aquifer recharge under the two development patterns. The results of this analysis indicate that while <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> confers some benefits to water storage, these benefits will pale in light of the growing water needs of the region's burgeoning population. Therefore, while the county should adopt <b>compact</b> <b>development</b> for its benefits, however small, policy makers should not count on this policy alone to ameliorate the negative environmental impacts of future population growth in the region. by Ambika Anand Prokop.

In this paper, we use a multivariate two-part model with instrumental variables, which corrects for residential location self-selection bias. We use a much larger and more geographically representative travel survey on household travel patterns and socio-economic characteristics than represented in previous California studies; this allows us to robustly consider other influences on travel. Our results indicate that, all else equal, a 10 % in residential density would reduce VMT by 1. 9 %. This elasticity is larger than the reported in previous econometric studies for the US, and specifically for California. However, as we show, the magnitude of this impact is still low considering reasonable ranges for policies aimed to increase residential density.
