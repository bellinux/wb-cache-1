50|$|Even if the {{production}} function variables of profitability and volume {{were in the}} model, in practice the calculation can also be carried out {{in compliance with the}} cost function. This is the case in models C & T as well as Gollop. <b>Calculating</b> <b>methods</b> differ in the use of either output volume or input volume for measuring the volume of activity. The former solution complies with the cost function and the latter with {{the production}} function. It is obvious that the calculation produces different results from the same material. A recommendation is to apply calculation in accordance with the production function. According to the definition of the production function used in the productivity models Saari and Kurosawa, productivity means {{the quantity and quality of}} output per one unit of input.|$|E

In part this was to demonstrate that Scheiner was wrong in comparing sunspots with the moons. More generally, Galileo was using his predictions to establish the validity of his ideas - if he could be demonstrably right about the complex movements of many small moons, his readers could take that as a token of his wider credibility. This approach was the opposite of the method of Aristotelian astronomers, who did not build theoretical models based on data, but looked for ways of explaining how the available data could be accommodated within existing theory.|$|E
