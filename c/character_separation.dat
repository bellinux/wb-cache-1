Combination {{of the proposed}} methods is relatively fast and the resulting strokes are more acceptable. 1. INTRODUCTION To extract strokes from gray-scale character images, we should obtain a thinline representation of the character image. Combination of binarization and thinning has been widely used for this purpose. However, binarization often fails in <b>character</b> <b>separation</b> from the background, and, therefore, produces bumpy boundaries. Pixels on the bumpy boundaries add some spurious strokes and holes with conventional thinning algorithms. It causes significant error in consequent stroke matching process. On the contrary, combination of {{topographic feature}} classification and stroke extraction can produce strokes more very similar to character models in human mind. In addition, extracted topographic features can be utilized in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Hamming Neural {{networks}} are employed for cursive text <b>character</b> <b>separation</b> and recognition. The digitized {{image of the}} scanned text is first enhanced by applying simple contrast stretching algorithm. Image registration is then performed to eliminate the white margins. Lines are separated by rows of white pixels and the morphological components identified. The projection method in conjunction with histogram analysis is used to estimate the width of each character in a word. The word is approximately decomposed into its constituent characters. The Hamming net is used to identify thus separated characters, while supposing the included portions of the adjacent characters as noise. The property of the trained Hamming net, i. e., the associative feature for detecting the best matched patterns from the prototype in a mean square sense, {{is the basis for}} constructing the recognition algorithm. Illustrative examples are presented and it is shown that the proposed approach is fast and efficient to provide an on-line separation and classification system for cursive texts such as Persian (Farsi), Arabic, Urdu and English script...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} programme {{described in this}} thesis examines the theoretical and practical aspects of visual degradation caused by vibration. Initially, the published literature was reviewed in two areas: the effects of vibration on visual performance {{and the influence of}} display parameters on legibility under normal and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. A series of eight experiments were then conducted to assess visual performance and display legibility with reading and threshold detection tasks presented on cathode ray tube displays. The first experiment compared the visual degradation caused by sinusoidal and narrow-band random vibration in the frequency range 2. 5 to 31. 5 Hz. Random vibration produced a significantly smaller reading performance decrement than sinusoidal vibration. This finding was attributed to the greater probability of low image velocity with the random vibration stimuli and, in a follow-up experiment, velocity-based predictions accounted for the visual performance decrements due to laboratory-simulated aircraft vibration. A comparison of the effects of whole-body, display and simultaneous whole-body and display vibration showed that at frequencies below 4 Hz, vibration of the display resulted in the largest performance decrement and simultaneous vibration of observer and display, the least. In a second series of experiments, display parameters (horizontal and vertical <b>character</b> <b>separation,</b> contrast, font and symbol definition) were manipulated during static and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. Vertical separation was found to be a more significant variable than horizontal separation and tentative guidelines for <b>character</b> <b>separation</b> were stated. The relationship between contrast and legibility was shown to be quadratic during static and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. Optimum legibility occurred in the contrast range 60 to 88 %. The determination of font and symbol definition requirements showed that for characters of equal subtense, 7 x 9 dot-matrix characters were significantly more legible than 5 x 7 characters during whole-body vibration. Differences between two frequently recommended fonts, the Huddleston and Lincoln Mitre, were not apparent at 7 x 9 definition although at 5 x 7 definition the Huddleston font was responsible for significantly fewer reading errors. In the final experiment, the spatial filtering characteristics of vibration were examined. In addition to an alphanumeric reading task, contrast thresholds for sinusoidally modulated grating patterns were determined during whole-body vibration. It was shown that the effects of vibration could be conceived as low-pass spatial filtering and the implications of this finding for simulating the effects of vibration were discussed. The overall findings of the experimental programme have been summarised and areas for future research discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{character}} state {{data obtained}} for clusters defined {{in a previous}} phenetic classification were used to construct two probabilistic matrices for Streptomyces species. These superseded an original published identification matrix by exclusion of other genera and the inclusion of more Streptomyces species. Separate matrices were constructed for major and minor clusters. The minimum number of diagnostic characters for each matrix was selected by computer programs for determination of <b>character</b> <b>separation</b> indices (CHARSEP) and a selection of group diagnostic properties (DIACHAR). The resulting matrices consisted of 26 phena x 50 characters (major clusters) and 28 phena x 39 characters (minor clusters). Cluster overlap (OVERMAT program) was small in both matrices. Identification scores were used to evaluate both matrices. The theoretically best scores for the most typical example of each cluster (MOSTTYP program) were all satisfactory. Input of test data for randomly selected cluster representatives resulted in correct identification with high scores. The major cluster matrix was shown to be practically sound by its application to 35 unknown soil isolates, 77 % of which were clearly identified. The minor cluster matrix provides tentative probabilistic identifications as {{the small number of}} strains in each cluster reduces its ability to withstand test variation. A diagnostic table for single-membered clusters, constructed using the CHARSEP and DIACHAR programs, was also produced...|$|E
40|$|Ecologists {{have often}} {{compared}} ecological communities in different areas, for example on different continents. The main interest {{is that the}} communities might be more similar in the characters of their species than expected under a null model of random species assortment. We suggest that such a null model should be based only on the species observed across the samples. Species-level convergence and community-level convergence must be distinguished. Physical filters (limitation to growth by the physical environment) can give species-level convergence, but only biotic filtering (based on species interactions) can give community-level convergence. Matching to species and species mutual matching must also be distinguished; the process is different, but the same tests work for both. Evolutionary convergence and ecological convergence have been distinguished in the past, {{but there is little}} value in this distinction. Even if evolutionary <b>character</b> <b>separation</b> is occurring, the selection involved must be based on ecological sorting, by elimination of genotypes that are too similar. Although ecotypes can be distinguished, the results of evolution by whole species are impossible to distinguish, by present-day observation, from those of ecological sorting. Fortunately, tests for present-day evidence of evolution also work for ecological sorting, and vice-versa. Contrary to suggestions that community convergence is untestable, valid tests do exist. They have already produced some evidence of convergence, but evidence that community-level convergence is a common and general phenomenon remains to be produced...|$|E

A novel LP segmentation technique with three sets of feature vectors was used with template matching to form the two main modules: license plate localization module and LPR module. This method was tested on more than 238 vehicle images taken from various scenes with different fonts and backgrounds from two Arab countries. The segmentation accuracy of the implemented system was 97. 5 % with a recognition accuracy of 99 % for fairly distorted images. The presented model shows that despite {{the negative impact of}} shadows, cracks, dirt, and <b>character</b> <b>separations,</b> the system demonstrated an overall success rate of 92 % for plate localization, 95 % for plates segmentation, 92 % for country and city recognition, and 99 % for number segmentation and recognition.
