5000|$|Marketers and {{retailers}} tend to exploit these impulses which {{are tied to}} the basic want for instant gratification. For example, a shopper in a supermarket might not specifically be shopping for confectionery. However, candy, gum, mints and chocolate are prominently displayed at the checkout aisles to trigger impulse buyers - and / or their children - to buy what they might not have otherwise considered. Alternatively, impulse buying can occur when a potential <b>consumer</b> <b>spots</b> something related to a product that stirs a particular passion in them, such as seeing a certain country's flag on the cover of a certain DVD. Sale items are displayed in much the same fashion.|$|R

5000|$|In 1976, Rantzen {{devised the}} {{documentary}} series The Big Time, which launched Sheena Easton's singing career. She briefly hosted a junior version of That's Life in the 1980s. Rantzen {{was one of}} the founders of TV-am, the company selected to launch ITV's breakfast television service, but before the station went on air in 1983, Rantzen dropped out, opting to remain with the BBC. She later briefly took a <b>consumer</b> <b>spot</b> on the BBC's own Breakfast Time. Having made programmes about stillbirth (The Lost Babies), and mental health (Trouble in Mind), in 1985 Rantzen presented a BBC One programme on drug abuse, Drugwatch. In 1986 she produced and presented Childwatch, which alerted the British public to the prevalence of child abuse, and successfully campaigned for a number of legal reforms in this area.|$|R

40|$|As a {{cost-effective}} option for Cloud <b>consumers,</b> <b>spot</b> {{service has been}} {{considered to be a}} significant supplement for building a full-fledged market economy for the Cloud ecosystem. However, unlike the static and straightforward way of trading on-demand and reserved Cloud services, the market-driven regulations of employing spot service could be too complicated for Cloud consumers to comprehensively understand. In particular, it would be both difficult and tedious for potential consumers to determine suitable bids from time to time. To reduce the complexity in applying spot resources, we propose to use a feedback control to help make bidding decisions. Based on an arccotangent-function-type system model, our novel bidding mechanism imitates fuzzy and intuitive human activities to refine and issue new bids according to previous errors. The validation is conducted by using Amazon’s historical spot price trace to perform a set of simulations and comparisons. The result shows that the feedback control-based mechanism obtains a better trade-off between bidding rationality and success rate than the other five comparable strategies. Although this mechanism is only for black-box bidding (price prediction) at this current stage, it can be conveniently and gradually upgraded to take into account external constraints in the future...|$|R

40|$|In a local {{grocery store}} in middle-America, a chocolate-loving {{consumer}} contemplates two substantially identical candy bars. The hungry shopper has no particular brand loyalty and both sweets are of a comparable price. Before proceeding to the checkout line, the <b>consumer</b> <b>spots</b> a seal on the wrapper {{of one of the}} candy bars, indicating that the chocolate has been certified by the United States government for having been produced in a socially responsible manner. This seal, if credible and easily recognizable, has added a new dimension to the consumer’s choice by allowing her to make a decision based on information that goes beyond nutrition, ingredients, taste or any other properties associated with the candy bar itself. Instead, the consumer is empowered to make a choice based on how the candy bar was produced. As a consequence of this information, the consumer can elect to use her buying power to effectively cast a vote in favor of socially responsible production by giving the certified chocolate a competitive edge. On {{the other side of the}} globe, in West Africa, a child works long hours harvesting cocoa beans, one of an estimated 12, 000 children trafficked for this purpose in Cote d’Ivoire alone. Approximately 40 % of world cocoa production originates in Cote d’Ivoire, where the pressure to keep production prices as low as possible stems from the easy substitutability and high competition in the market for this agricultural good. Stories of children being trafficked to work in “horrific” conditions in the West African cocoa fields were brought to the public’s attention in 2000, yet consumers in the United States are still unwittingly buying chocolate produced by trafficked children. Pressure from the public and from Congress shamed the chocolate industry into agreeing to a comprehensive protocol aimed at creating a certification process for a “no child slavery” label, but stalled negotiations have left chocolate unlabeled and consumers uninformed...|$|R
25|$|A basic {{reference}} chart used for <b>consumers</b> to <b>spot</b> suspicious moles {{is found in}} the mnemonic A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute. The letters stand for asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for elevation or evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.|$|R

30|$|Chickens {{present at}} each market were {{estimated}} to be 300 – 500 {{on the days of}} visit. They are originated from different districts across the country, most of which were collected by traders from big towns such as: Sodo, Dessie, Shashemane, Jimma, Ambo, Hosaina and transported on public transport (bus) to Addis Ababa. The majority (99 %) of traders mentioned that there is no habit of cleaning buses before loading and after unloading chickens owing to the fact that no vehicles is designed for poultry transportation alone. After arrival at the market sites, chickens are sold to wholesalers in the biggest live bird market site (Merkato) where birds from different origins are placed in the same cages (mixed) and sold either to traders in other live poultry markets in the city or to the <b>consumers</b> on <b>spot.</b> Ninety nine percent of the traders clean the holding cages once a week with clean water and the remaining 1 % clean every day. All the traders responded that they dispose manure and dead birds either within the markets or on roadside. None of them seek for veterinary services when chickens are sick.|$|R

The future smart and efficient power systems will treat completely different {{compare with the}} existing power systems. This paper discusses the effect of emerging smart grids on the consumer's behavior. It investigates the responses {{of different types of}} <b>consumers</b> to the <b>spot</b> electricity price and the price elasticity of demand in the smart grid environment. Smart technologies could bring all of the consumers with any level of demand to the market actively, and results in increasing the efficiency of the market in a fully competitive electricity market. This paper also describes the effect of Demand Response (DR) on some electricity market issues like short-term load and price forecasting, generation expansion, and imperfect competition, in the smart grid environment. The qualitative discussions show that by emerging the smart grids the market efficiency, costumer's benefits, and Demand Response of the power system are improved and the ability of strategic players to exert market power will be reduced...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{an innovation}} product i. e. paid socket, {{not on the}} market yet, and aimed at the feasibility analysis of paid socket market. We used survey method to investigate the end users. Firstly, {{in view of the}} "public", we surveyed people about what factors affecting the consumers' willingness to use this socket. The Second part was to understand merchants' ideas about the socket by in-depth interviews. Through SEM analysis, we found that safety and environmental friendliness are two important factors for the users to use the socket, and through in-depth interviews, we found the "installation convenience" and "marketing activities" are most considered by the stores. The implication of the results show that business opportunities behind the paid socket are large, whether in public area or stores, and the viewpoints of using the paid socket were different. Enhanced design and development of the socket could solve the two sides' problems and meet needs of the public and merchants by recovering the cost and expending marketing <b>spots.</b> <b>Consumers</b> didn't have {{to spend a lot of}} money to enjoy convenience, fairness and justice caused by paid sockets...|$|R
5000|$|The Mod 4 {{series was}} {{introduced}} in 1974, but was generally not successful in the marketplace. However, in post-mortem <b>consumer</b> research, the <b>Spot</b> Vac was highly successful with women, who borrowed it from their husband's workbench in the basement to clean up minor spills {{in the kitchen and}} upstairs. This inspired the design of a new household product specifically for use upstairs by women. The product appearance was completely re-designed by Gantz's design patent, the first design patent ever filed by B&D, renamed the Dustbuster, and introduced in January 1979 as a household product, not a power tool. Gantz was Manager of the Black & Decker United States Consumer Power Tool Division's Industrial Design Department at the time. Over a million Dustbusters were sold in its first year, four times that of the traditional handheld vacuum market and its success enabled B&D to establish a new Household Products Division, which in 1983, acquired and merged with General Electric Housewares Operations in Bridgeport, CT. By 1985, B&D had the lion's share of cordless vacuum cleaner market and the Dustbuster sold 7 million units annually. [...] It also came in 110 volts with an attachable hose and tools. The device used suction power to pick up fine dirt and debris including pet hair.|$|R
40|$|Should a firm advance sell when {{operating}} in a competitive environment? Advance selling occurs when customers purchase at a time preceding the actual consumption, when they are uncertain of their valuation of the product or service. This comes in contrast to selling to <b>consumers</b> on the <b>spot</b> thereby allowing them to pay after the uncertainty in valuation is resolved. There exist many examples of firms who employ advance selling strategies: Ticketmaster sells concert tickets both in advance and {{on the day of}} the show; airlines sell discounted advance flight tickets; and advance registration to a conference usually costs less when purchased in advance, then if bought closer to the conference date. By buying in advance, customers risk purchasing a product which they might not value in the future. Clearly, there must be an incentive for consumers to purchase in advance rather than on the spot market- such as a discounted price in the advance period or limited availability on the spot. The main result of the advance-selling literature is that by selling in advance firms can earn more revenue than when selling on the spot market (e. g. Xie and Shugan 2001). When customers purchase in advance, they do not know their exact valuation and are willing to pay at most their expected value for the service. In contrast, when consumers purchase on the spot, they know their exact realized values...|$|R
