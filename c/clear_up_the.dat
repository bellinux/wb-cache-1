5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer {{takes out the}} garbage, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - the result of recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> question.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, {{to the point that the}} company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Peter drowned while {{crossing}} the English Channel {{on the way}} to Gaul, at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611. This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by Chlothar II. It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{succession}} crisis, the Qizilbash chieftains agreed to appoint the future shah after a conference {{with each other}} and then notify Pari Khan Khanum of their settled choice. At first, they discussed the resolution that Shoja al-Din Mohammad Safavi, the eight-month-old infant son of Ismail II, should be crowned as shah while in reality state affairs would be taken care of by Pari Khan Khanum. This suggestion, however, did not get the green light of most of the assembly since it would have swayed the balance of power among many Qizilbash clans. Ultimately the assembly agreed to appoint Mohammad Khodabanda, the elder brother of Ismail II, as shah.|$|E
25|$|Cora Lansquenet was {{an artist}} and {{collector}} of paintings from local sales. Niece Susan Banks, heir to Cora's property, goes to her cottage to <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> possessions and prepare them for auction, {{on the day of}} the inquest into Cora's murder. Miss Gilchrist claims that Cora always painted from life, yet Susan finds one quite recent painting featuring a pier that was destroyed in the war, a view that has been published on picture postcards. The next day, after Cora's funeral, art critic Alexander Guthrie, arrives to look through Mrs Lansquenet's recent purchases as previously scheduled. He finds nothing of any value there. That evening, Miss Gilchrist is poisoned by arsenic in a slice of wedding cake apparently sent to her through the post. She ate just a small portion of it, which saved her. Inspector Morton investigates the Lansquenet murder along with Poirot.|$|E
25|$|As in Egypt and {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, {{radiocarbon}} dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It {{is not at all}} clear which group is right, if either. Mechanisms have been proposed for explaining why radiocarbon dates in the region might be skewed. Equally logical arguments have been made suggesting that the archaeological dates are too late. Time will tell. The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help <b>clear</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures. Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of Ebla have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BCE), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BCE), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.|$|E
