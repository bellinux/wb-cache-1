Bicknell's thrush was first observed on the summit of Slide in 1881; today, after recently being declared a separate species from the gray-cheeked thrush, it is considered a threatened species and its summer breeding areas in the boreal forests important enough that in 1999, New York governor George Pataki augmented the wilderness status of the area with Bird Conservation Area status that applied to almost all the Catskill High Peaks. This protects not only the Bicknell's but other species such as the black-and-white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, <b>Canada</b> <b>warbler,</b> red-eyed vireo, Louisiana waterthrush, scarlet tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak, some of which require large unbroken forests to nest.|$|E

5000|$|In both {{summer and}} winter seasons the <b>Canada</b> <b>warbler</b> inhabits moist thickets.

In the winter it prefers mid- and upper-elevation habitats. In northern Minnesota a study found that Canada warblers inhabited the shrub-forest edge, rather than marture forests or open fields with shrub. In New England the <b>Canada</b> <b>warbler</b> was found to be [...] "disturbance specialists" [...] moving into patches of forests recovering from wind throw or timber removal.

50|$|The <b>Canada</b> <b>Warbler</b> eats insects for {{the most}} part, {{including}} beetles, mosquitoes, flies, moths, and smooth caterpillars such as cankerworms, supplemented by spiders, snails, worms, and, at least seasonally, fruit.

When they occasionally hover glean, males tend to fly higher than females on breeding grounds. In the tropics of South America, it forages in mixed flocks with other birds, usually 3-30 feet above ground in denser foliage.|$|E

50|$|During the {{two years}} he {{traveled}} with Audubon (October 1820 to August 1822), Mason painted, by his own reckoning, between 150 and 200 background watercolors for Audubon.

For example, for Audubon's study of two blue yellow-backed warblers (now known as northern parula birds; plate 15 of Birds of America), Mason painted an image of Iris fulva, the copper iris, which Audubon called Louisiana flag. Similarly, plate 73 shows Mason's painting of a branch of Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia, called by Audubon great magnolia) on which is perched a <b>Canada</b> <b>warbler</b> (called by Audubon Bonaparte's flycatching warbler).

The Clear Fork River and Pine Run are the major streams that run through Mohican-Memorial State Forest. These streams then merge to make the large Mohican River. The forest has many types of trees like oak, hickory, cherry, white and red pine, maple, aspen, sycamore, hemlock, and other types of trees. Many species of animals thrive in Mohican-Memorial State Forest. White-tailed deer and wild turkey have been successfully reintroduced. Ruffed grouse and pheasant are occasionally seen. Fox, coyote, raccoon, striped skunk, rabbit, red and gray squirrel, amphibians, black rat snake, owl, heron, and bald eagle are among the many species reported.
