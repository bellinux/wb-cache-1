5000|$|The most {{addressing}} {{reason for}} shifting the urban governance into local and institutional networks is economic globalization and global spectacle, thus {{the emergence of}} world-wide institutions. Cities as {{a key element of}} urban governance due to changes in political, social, spatial spheres and growing complexity of social life are trying to “delink” themselves from their national economies. City governments had to become more entrepreneurial and able to attract a business investments. New lifestyle and social differentiation appears as impossible to govern at one level and the governance response to these circumstances therefore includes new combinations of people-based and place-based policies. Community capacity-building remains a “cornerstone of area committee” and is likely to increase its appearance in the future.Institutional frameworks can influence positively to regional and urban challenges in terms of innovative processes. By institutions, institutionalists we understand rules, norms and practices which structure areas of social endeavour and not formal organisations, which focus on interactions and not decisions.The way of governing has shifted from those of “hierarchies and bureaucracy” to selforganising networks of heterarchy.” [...] Private firms are seeking more political engagement and want to achieve better functioning of urban and economic system. On the other hand, the state wants to influence firms to achieve better overall economic performance.In the European Union the urban governance at the national scale requires except network influences and financial <b>capital,</b> <b>sufficiency</b> of knowledge for policy makers, otherwise “one solution model suitable to one region” does not necessarily guarantee successful outcome of the policy in the other region. The issue of multilevel governance in cities occurs in such cases when, the local governance activity “can mask the inefficiency” of social and political implementation policies to support and encourage citizens.Another cause of urban governance shift is arising a social justice, greater consciousness of the diversity of basic needs and cultural identities, and a stronger awareness of environmental resource management and sustainability limits.|$|E
40|$|Can {{variations}} in the expected future return on a portfolio of sovereign bonds itself have real effects on a small open economy? We build a model where banks face a <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency</b> requirement to demonstrate that news about a fall in the expected return on a portfolio of international long bonds held by the bank can lead to an immediate and persistent fall in economic activity. Even if the news never materializes, the model can generate several periods of below steady state investment, hours worked and production followed by a recovery. The presence of long bonds in bank portfolios enable the news to have an immediate impact on bank capital via an immediate fall in bond prices. The portfolio adjustment induced by the <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency</b> requirements leads to a rise in loan rates and tighter credit conditions which trigger the fall in activity. The model contributes to the news-shock literature by showing that imperfect signals about future financial returns can create business cycles without relying on the usual suspects: variation in domestic fundamentals such as technology shocks, preference shocks and fiscal policy. It also contributes to the emerging economy business cycle literature in that disturbances in world financial markets can lead to domestic business cycles without relying on shocks to the world interest rate or to country spreads...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{descriptive}} analysis of China futures trading mechanism {{and the structure}} of China futures exchange, this paper defines the risk of futures exchange as uncertainties in the futures market that cause the futures exchange to suffer loss due to the default of its members. Several risk factors such as price fluctuations, market monopoly, <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency</b> and market manipulation can be identified when the development of China futures market is more closely observed. By setting up a risk-warning model for China futures exchange through multivariate analysis using data from SHFE, an empirical study indicates that as the most important risk factor the price fluctuation has a great influence on China futures exchange. The effectiveness of the risk-warning model is supported by the analysis results from the latest data...|$|E

In addition, there is a negative relationship between process capital and customer capital in the financial service sector. It suggests that in the financial service sector, customer satisfaction relies on a sufficient degree of training and R&D density.

40|$|The wave {{of mergers}} and {{acquisitions}} of financial institutions which was observed in the United States and Europe in the 1980 s and 1990 s seems to have affected the Greek banking market {{by the end of}} the 1990 s. The result was the emergence of new significant players in the market. Despite the fact that scale economies should lead to the improvement of their efficiency, this fact was not confirmed by empirical research and, moreover in several cases there has been an adverse effect. We are focus on financial statement analysis by examining the profitability and performance ratios. Mergers and acquisitions in the Greek banking system contributed to an increase in profitability of banks but they did not lead to improvement to their efficiency. It is an undeniable fact that the development and expansion of banks had a positive effect on the markets, resulting in the attraction of new capital which improved their <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency</b> and of course on their extroversion, their internationalization and their successful expansion to other markets-particularly to Balkan countries...|$|E

40|$|The paper studies risk {{mitigation}} associated with capital regulation, {{in a context}} where banks may choose tail risk asserts. We show that this undermines the traditional result that high capital reduces excess risk-taking driven by limited liability. Moreover, higher capital may have an unintended effect of enabling banks to take more tail risk without the fear of breaching the minimal capital ratio in non-tail risky project realizations. The {{results are consistent with}} stylized facts about pre-crisis bank behavior, and suggest implications for the optimal design of capital regulation.

Proposed by authors theoretical concept of integral bank’s financial security index has in its basis indicators of <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency,</b> capital growth, liquidity and return on assets. Bringing {{together all the}} mentioned values is appropriate to do using the reliability function. As an input data for setting this function serve expert evaluations regarding {{the stability of the}} object that is under consideration. It was found out, that typically system of expert evaluations has couple of features (advantages), which don’t exclude and also don’t complement each other. These features authors consider by separating them as compensational, non-compensational and partly compensational advantages. It was proved, that in banking it is extremely important itself the realistic setup of the ratio between partial and integral indicators, which are partly inherent to-compensational advantage.

40|$|Among {{the activists}} {{of the money}} market, banks as the most {{important}} financial institutions undertake an important role in optimal appropriation of financial short-term resources. Furthermore, they allocate the short-term surplus funds to enterprises, which have a short-term need. Holding a main part of the funds in economy circulation, banks have a critical role in adjustment of economic relations. Banks are facing different types of risks in their daily operations. In the banking system, the CAMELS indictors are used to evaluate and rate of the performance of banks. The CAMELS rating model {{is one of the most}} effective systems of financial assessment in banks. Therefore, in this research, the effects of CAMELS indicators of banks on risk taking of Iranian banks are studied. The statistical population of the national banking system includes all governmental and private banks. The whole statistical population is studied as a research sample during 2006 - 2011. Taking into consideration the fact that the research data or section-bounded and time-bounded, a combinational regression analysis has been used. The results of the combinational regression analysis have supported the presence of a reverse and meaningful effect of the indicators of assets quality and sensitivity of market risk on risk taking in national banks. In addition, the results have supported the direct and meaningful effects of <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency</b> and quality of profit-making on risk taking, however, the effects of the indicators of management quality and liquidity quality on risk taking have been rejected...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though there}} are several {{differences}} and disadvantages for SMEs, {{there are also some}} advantageous aspects for them, including the possibility of adopting simpler life cycle engineering methods and avoiding organisational problems that are typical in large-sized company. They should make their own suitable strategies based on understanding the relation of economical, technical, and environmental aspects. The framework with economical, technical, and environmental aspects is an approach for analysing environmental activity of general organisations. Relative importance of three aspects is dependent on several conditions of company such as <b>capital</b> <b>sufficiency,</b> technical outstandingness, and strictness of governmental legislation. In any case all the three aspect should not be ignored; the temporal situation will be changed and three aspects ultimately act as basic axes for environmental management. The environmental decision support system (DSS) can be a relatively cheap and cost-effective tool to SMEs, to find the information flows to describe the requirement of decision support. The information is used for the environmental improvement of product systems, to support corporate policy detail targets via appropriate documentation and communication. The characteristics of DSS for small and larger organisations would be quite different, because the situation of problem is different. DSS for SMEs should be simple, act as information acquisition tool, and it must consider the technical side. For SMEs it is valuable to recommend to start an environmental design pilot project, to ask for external assistance, and to join forces horizontally as well as verticall...|$|E
