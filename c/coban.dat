5|$|In 1555 Spanish friar Domingo de Vico {{offended}} a local Ch'ol ruler and {{was killed}} by the Acala Ch'ol and their Lakandon allies. In response to the killing, a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q'eqchi' leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q'eqchi' expedition were taken back to <b>Cobán</b> and resettled in Santo Tomás Apóstol.|$|E
5|$|In 1543 the new colonial reducción of Santo Domingo de <b>Cobán</b> {{was founded}} at Chi Mon'a {{to house the}} {{relocated}} Q'eqchi' from Chichen, Xucaneb and Al Run Tax Aj. Santo Tomás Apóstol was founded nearby the same year at Chi Nim Xol, it was used in 1560 as a reducción to resettle Ch'ol communities from Topiltepeque and Lacandon in the Usumacinta Valley. In 1555 the Acala Ch'ol and their Lacandon allies killed the Spanish friar Domingo de Vico. De Vico had established a small church among the inhabitants of San Marcos, a region that lay between the territories of the Lacandon and the Manche Ch'ol (an area unrelated {{to the department of}} San Marcos). De Vico had offended the local ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives. The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then seized him, cut open his chest and extracted his heart. His corpse was then decapitated; the natives carried off his head, which was never recovered by the Spanish. In response a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q'eqchi' leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q'eqchi' expedition were taken back to <b>Cobán</b> and resettled in Santo Tomás Apóstol.|$|E
5|$|In 1695, a {{three-way}} {{invasion of the}} Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, <b>Cobán</b> and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo itself. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left <b>Cobán</b> in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|In 1695 {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} decided to act upon {{a plan to}} connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, <b>Cobán</b> and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and joined up with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of Manche Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; everyone else had {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, and the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch'ol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in <b>Cobán.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because {{of the fact that the}} land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and <b>Cobán,</b> and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with <b>Cobán</b> and Cahabón).|$|E
5|$|The first Catholic missionaries entered {{southern}} Petén in 1596 {{to convert}} the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan. The Q'eqchi' of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Ch'ol. The colonial Maya towns of <b>Cobán</b> and Cahabón, in Alta Verapaz, traded quetzal feathers, copal, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol neighbours, receiving cacao and achiote in exchange. Many Q'eqchi' from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and Manche Ch'ol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Ch'ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious syncretism that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent. This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Q'eqchi' to help conquer and reduce the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|Conquistador Hernán Cortés {{passed through}} Manche Ch'ol {{territory}} in 1525, and {{described it as}} sparsely populated. In the 16th century, the coastal towns of Campin and Tzoite were given in encomienda to Hernando Sánchez de Aguilar; they fell within the jurisdiction of colonial Bacalar, on the Yucatán coast near Chetumal. Although some Manche Ch'ols visited the Dominican friars in <b>Cobán,</b> Verapaz, in 1564, the central Manche were not contacted by the Spanish again until 1603, when Dominican missionaries first attempted to evangelise them, and started to gather the scattered inhabitants into towns. In {{the second half of}} the 16th century, the still-independent Manche Ch'ol became a refuge for Christianised Maya living under Spanish domination in Verapaz, who wished to escape and live as apostates among them and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. In 1596, Dominican friar Juan Esguerra reported seeing eleven Manche traders in Cahabón; he claimed that the Manche Ch'ol were frequent visitors to the town. In 1600 the regular presence of Manche Ch'ol traders in Cahabón was again reported, and they were said to arrive in greater numbers for the town's festivities in honour of its patron saint. Friar Esguerra complained in 1605 of the great number of Christianised Q'eqchi' Maya of Cahabón that were fleeing the town to live as apostates among the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alston first {{described}} Oryzomys couesi in 1877, using three specimens from Mexico and Guatemala. He named the animal Hesperomys couesi, {{placing it in}} the now-defunct genus Hesperomys, and noted similarities to the marsh rice rat (then called Hesperomys palustris) and two species now placed in Tylomys. The specific name, couesi, honors American naturalist Elliott Coues, who had done much work on North American rodents. In 1893, Oldfield Thomas wrote that the species, by then placed in the genus Oryzomys as Oryzomys couesi, had caused much confusion about its identity, because the three specimens (one from <b>Cobán,</b> Guatemala, and two from Mexico) used by Alston in fact belonged {{to two or three}} different species. He restricted the name couesi to the animal from Guatemala, and introduced the new name Oryzomys fulgens for one of the Mexican animals. Several other related species were described from the early 1890s onwards and in 1901 Clinton Hart Merriam united many of those into a palustris-mexicanus group of species, which also included the marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of <b>Cobán,</b> San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century Spanish {{priorities}} changed, and {{the failure}} of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Ch'ol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region; military options were also viewed more favourably. Between 1685 and 1689, the Q'eqchi' of <b>Cobán</b> and Cahabón were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche Ch'ol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Petén and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Petén. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor López were active among the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol. They were eventually expelled by the Ch'ol; upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Petén and neighbouring Chiapas. Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to Rabinal in the modern department of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the Manche Ch'ol ceased to play any part in the history of Petén.|$|E

25|$|La Tinta {{settlement}} {{was founded on}} 14 August 1896 by German immigrant Erwin Pablo Dieseldorf, who lived in <b>Cobán,</b> Alta Verapaz, and whom owned the land where the town was settled.

25|$|The {{city was}} {{developed}} by German coffee growers {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and was operated as a largely independent dominion until WWII. In 1888 a German club was founded and in 1935 a German school opened its doors in <b>Cobán.</b> Until 1930, about 2000 Germans populated the city. In 1941, all Germans were expelled by the Guatemalan government, led at the time by Jorge Ubico because of pressure from the United States; it has also been suggested Ubico's motivation was to seize control of the vast amounts of land Germans owned in the area. Many ended up in internment camps in Texas and were later traded for American POW's held in Germany. A sizable resident German population persists though most having been completely assimilated into the Guatemalan culture through intermarriage. Multiple German architectonic elements can still be appreciated throughout <b>Cobán.</b>|$|E
25|$|This was the {{political}} and economic situation of the country when on 29 March 1953 the anticommunist opposition assaulted Salamá at dawn: approximately 100 rebels invaded Salamá and neighboring San Jerónimo. The invasion was not properly organized and by 6:00 am was completedly defeated by army forces that arrived from <b>Cobán.</b> This event however began government prosecution of anticommunist elements, which gradually escalated until it became pure repression in May 1954, when CIA Operation PBSUCCESS and the Carlos Castillo Armas invasion were well in progress and the Arbenz regime was practically doomed.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, 18.5% of Guatemalans {{belonged to}} the white ethnic group, with 41.7% of the {{population}} being mestizo, and 39.8% of the population belonging to the 23 Indigenous groups. It is difficult to make an accurate census of whites in Guatemala, because the country categorizes all non-indigenous people are mestizo or ladino and {{a large majority of}} white Guatemalans consider themselves as mestizos or ladinos. By the 19th century the majority of immigrants were Germans, many who were bestowed fincas and coffee plantations in <b>Cobán,</b> while others went to Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City. Many young Germans married mestiza and indigenous Q'eqchi' women, which caused a gradual whitening. There was also immigration of Belgians to Santo Tomas and this contributed to the mixture of black and mestiza women in that region.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of his father in battle against the K'oja, his son and heir K'iq'ab swore vengeance, and two years later he led the K'iche'-Kaqchikel {{alliance}} against his enemies, together with the Ajpop K'amha (king-elect). The K'iche'-led army entered K'oja at first light, killed Tekum Sik'om and captured his son. K'iq'ab recovered the bones of his father and returned to Q'umarkaj with many prisoners and all the jade and metal that the K'oja possessed, after conquering various settlements in the Sacapulas area, and the Mam people near Zaculeu. During the reign of K'iq'ab, who was particularly warlike, the K'iche' kingdom expanded to include Rabinal, <b>Cobán</b> and Quetzaltenango, and extended as far west as the Okos River, near the modern border between the Chiapas coast of Mexico and Guatemalan Pacific coast. With Kaqchikel help, the eastern frontier of the kingdom was pushed as far as the Motagua River and south as far as Escuintla.|$|E

500|$|Las Casas {{returned}} to Guatemala in 1537 wanting to employ his new method of conversion {{based on two}} principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on {{knowledge and understanding of}} the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because {{of the fact that the}} land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and <b>Cobán.</b> Through the efforts of Las Casas's missionaries the so-called [...] "Land of War" [...] came to be called [...] "Verapaz", [...] "True Peace". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitlán and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Marroquín who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission. Las Casas left Guatemala for Mexico, where he stayed for more than a year before setting out for Spain in 1540.|$|E

2500|$|As of 1850, <b>Cobán</b> {{population}} {{was estimated to}} be at 12000. Ca. 1890, British archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay and his wife moved to Guatemala, and visited <b>Cobán.</b> Around the time the Maudslays visited Verapaz, a German colony had settled in the area thanks to generous concessions granted by liberal presidents Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, José María Reyna Barrios and Manuel Estrada Cabrera. The Germans had a very united and solid community and had several activities in the German Club (Deutsche Verein), in <b>Cobán,</b> which they had founded in 1888. [...] Their main commercial activity was coffee plantations. Maudslay described the Germans like this: [...] "There is a larger proportion of foreigners in <b>Coban</b> than in any other town in the Republic: they are almost exclusively Germans engaged in coffee-planting, and some few of them in cattle-ranching and other industries; although complaints of isolation and of housekeeping and labour troubles are not unheard of amongst them, they {{seemed to me to be}} fortunate from a business point of view in the high reputation that the Vera Paz coffee holds in the market, and the very considerable commercial importance which their industry and foresight has brought to the district; and, from a personal point of view, in the enjoyment of a delicious climate in which their rosy-cheeked children can be reared in health and strength, and in all the comforts which pertain to a life half European and half tropical. Hotels or fondas appear to be scarce but the hospitality of the foreign residents is proverbial." ...|$|E
