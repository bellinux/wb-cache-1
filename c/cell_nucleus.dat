Hum Reprod 2009; 24 (1) : 45 – 54. The diagnosis involves detection and counting of stromal and uNK <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> in endometrial biopsy slides immunohistochemically stained with haematoxylin for staining <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and CD 56 as a marker for the uNK cells. However, manual diagnosis is a laborious process, fraught with subjective errors. In this paper, we present a novel method for detection of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the human female uterus lining and localisation of the luminal epithelium edge in endometrial biopsies. Specifically, we employ a local phase symmetry based method to detect stromal <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and propose an adaptive background removal method that significantly eases the segmentation of uNK <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> regions. We also propose a novel method using alpha shapes for the identification of epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and B-Spline curve fitting on identified <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> to localise the luminal epithelium edge. The objective of edge localisation is to avoid <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> near the luminal epithelium edge being counted in the diagnosis process due to their non-relevance to the calculation of stromal to uNK cell ratio that determines the diagnosis {{of recurrent}} miscarriages in the end.

40|$|Infection of {{mammalian}} {{skeletal muscle}} cells by Trichinella spiralis causes host nuclei to become polyploid (ca. 4 N) and abnormally enlarged. It has been postulated that this enlargement reflects an infection-induced elevation of host transcription. Anthelmintic treatment of T. spiralis-infected rodents with mebendazole (MBZ) causes {{a reduction in}} the size of infected <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and a significant reduction in the total RNA content of individual infected muscle cells. A monoclonal antibody to the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was used here to assess the effects of infection on Pol II levels in isolated infected <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Pol II was localized to speckle domains in isolated infected <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Similar domains have been previously localized to sites of RNA synthesis or processing. When compared to the levels in nuclei from other, uninfected host cells, speckle-localized Pol II (SL-Pol II) levels were significantly elevated in infected <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> by a mean of 3. 9 - to 6. 8 -fold. Nuclear antigens (NA) recognized by antibodies against T. spiralis localized to infected <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei.</b> By use of confocal microscopy, a subpopulation of NA was found colocalized with most speckle domains defined by Pol II.

In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus,</b> or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Results: No GI wereobserved in control fiber tracts. Densities of vacuoles and glial <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> were greater in PSP than in controls. In PSP, density of vacuoles was greatest in the alveus, frontopontine fibers (FPF), and central tegmental tract (CTT), and densities of glial <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> were greater in cortical than subcortical regions.

Conclusions: The data suggest significant degeneration of white matter in PSP, vacuolation being related to neuronal loss in adjacent gray matterregions,GI the result of abnormal tau released from damaged axons, and gliosis a responseto these changes. © 2013...|$|R

Accurate results of <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> segmentation are often adapted to a variety of applications such as the detection of cancerous <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the observation of overlapping cellular events occurring during wound healing process in the human body.

The proposed translational computation system aims to integrate clinical insight and computational analysis by identifying and segmenting objects of interest within histological images. Objects of interest and background regions are automatically distinguished by dynamically determining 3 optimal threshold values for the 3 color components of an input image. The threshold values are determined by means of entropy computations that are based on probability distributions of the color intensities of pixels and the spatial similarity of pixel intensities within neighborhoods.

5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. Mitochondrial genes are transcribed as multigenic transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs.

The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome differs between species. Most mitochondrial genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, mitochondrial DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human mitochondrial genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, such as that of yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of mitochondrial tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus</b> and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus.</b> The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
