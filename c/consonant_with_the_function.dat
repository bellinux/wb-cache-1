The output responses of most electronic systems under test operation is the waveforms they generate on a scope; in <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> generator waveform responses which {{could be in the}} standardized or non-standardized format. The continuous clamour for an easily re-programmable, simplified hardware, decreased power consumption, and high in performance function generation is the major set out goal of this paper. Practical results obtained show an appreciable degree of accuracy and repeatability of the system moreover, the microcontroller makes the system user-friendly.

40|$|Abstract. – Higher {{filamentous}} fungi are {{the primary}} degraders of lignin in nature. Research has shown that fungi employ several types of free radical chemistry to break down this abundant and recalcitrant wood polymer. Fungal ligninolytic mechanisms play {{an essential role in}} global carbon cycling, and may also serve as inspiration for new, environmentally friendly biomimetic catalysts. Lignin is the most abundant aromatic chemical on earth, comprising roughly 15 % of all terrestrial biomass. Formed through the free radical polymerization of several p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols, it is a heterogeneous, highly crosslinked polymer that encases the structural polysaccharides of higher plant cell walls. The intermonomer linkages of lignin consist of alkyl aryl ether, arylpropane, biphenyl, and other bonds that resist cleavage by most biochemical agents 1, 2. These properties are <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> polymer’s <b>functions,</b> which are to give vascular plants the rigidity the...|$|R
