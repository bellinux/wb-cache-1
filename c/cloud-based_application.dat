40|$|With the {{tremendous}} growth of mobile devices, e. g, smartphones, tablets and PDAs in recent years, users {{are looking for}} more advanced platforms {{in order to use}} their computational applications (e. g., processing and storage) in a faster and more convenient way. In addition, mobile devices are capable of using <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> and the use of such technology is growing in popularity. However, one major concern is how to efficiently access these <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> when using a resource-constraint mobile device. Essentially applications require a continuous Internet connection which is difficult to obtain in challenged environments that lack an infrastructure for communication (e. g., in sparse or rural areas) or areas with infrastructure (e. g., urban or high density areas) with restricted/full of interference access networks and even areas with high costs of Internet roaming. In these situations the use of mobile opportunistic networks may be extended to avail <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> to the user. In this thesis we explore the emergence of extending <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> with mobile opportunistic networks in challenged environments and observe how local user’s social interactions and collaborations help to improve the overall message delivery performance in the network. With real-world trace-driven simulations, we compare and contrast the different user’s behaviours in message forwarding, the impact of the various network loads (e. g., number of messages) along with the long-sized messages and the impact of different wireless networking technologies, in various opportunistic routing protocols in a challenged environment...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{assessment}} of <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> requires new methodologies {{to deal with}} the complexity of software systems and the variability of cloud resources. In this paper, we address the problem of reducing the total costs for running <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> while fulfilling servicelevel objectives (SLOs). To this end, we define an approach to refactor a cloud application in such a way that, when it is deployed, it requires less computational capacity and therefore less resources. We experimented our approach on top of a modified optimal provisioning heuristic designed for preemptible cloud resources and the results show that it reduces deployment costs, up to 60 % when compared to the same approach, but without model-driven application refactoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Software-as-a-Service(SaaS) services available in the cloud market make them plausible and attractive for building <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications.</b> However, performance instability is common in the cloud environment due to changes in supply and demand of shared computational infrastructure and resources. Candidate services are vulnerable to such instability. Current service selection and composition approaches do not explicitly address performance fluctuations when building <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications.</b> This thesis proposes a novel approach to improve performance stability by leveraging {{on the principles of}} design diversity and portfolio-based thinking when selecting and composing <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications.</b> The objective is to minimize the risks that could stem from selecting and composing cloud-based services that are vulnerable to performance instability. In this thesis, we use two scenarios to illustrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the approach. As scalability is of paramount importance for efficient dynamic and adaptive selection and composition, the thesis adapt a systematic method to identify the various scalability dimensions that can affect the working of the approach and consequently evaluate the sensitivity of the approach to the identified dimensions. The thesis concludes with possible directions for future work...|$|R

30|$|The one {{application}} {{which is}} identified by most respondents as {{not suitable for}} cloud deployment is accounting and finance (39  %), perhaps due to data security concerns. Moreover, further data analysis in cloud adoption rate across organisations, realised that larger enterprises find disaster recovery, (ERP) and business process management applications (BPM) as the best fit for cloud migration. However, for smaller enterprises, the adoption of (non-mission critical) <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> mirrors their use of email messaging, desktop hosting and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications for collaboration. Remarkably, the lower cost and flexibility that <b>cloud-based</b> <b>applications</b> offer is ideal for small businesses, as they are agile and often run with teams that are spread over wide geographical regions. In essence, these applications are better suited for online delivery [42].|$|R
