25|$|Historian Kazimierz Jasiński, {{based on}} the {{tympanum}} from Ołbin made in 1172, supposed that at that time Leszek was around 10 years old, so he was born around 1162. These idea is accepted by some historians. Borys Paszkiewicz considered that date of birth written by Długosz <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
25|$|New to Soulblighter {{were moving}} 3D models within the gaming world, {{something}} none of Bungie staff had ever created before. For example, the opening level features a fully functional windmill, and a later level features a drawbridge that closes as the level begins, {{and which the}} player must then lower so their army can gain access to a castle. Although the original game featured {{the same kind of}} 3D polygonal models, none of them moved, and implementing this feature proved {{to be one of the}} biggest challenges the team encountered in making the game. Another challenge also involved something not seen in the first game; a level set indoors. For this level, which is set in a large castle, the AI had to be rewritten as two enemy units <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> beside one another but not be able to see each other because of a wall between them. Previously, two units standing beside one another would automatically attack. Writing this new code into the AI scripting language proved especially difficult for the programmers.|$|E

He memorably stated, [...] "The Fatherland denoted me as a Nazi, the Nazis as a Bolshevik, and the Bolsheviks as a conservative idealist. Certainly {{only one of the}} three <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> and that one is the Bolsheviks." [...] He escaped from Vienna frequently by extended consulting trips to major construction projects in England, Italy, France, Algeria, and Latvia, adding greatly to his engineering experience.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho {{announced}} {{his return to}} Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal. He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans. Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, [...] "Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn't feel {{he was able to}} perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That's not something you say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person." ...|$|E
2500|$|As is {{traditionally}} depicted, the group wished {{to escape the}} intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life during {{the tail end of}} the politically fraught Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history and into the early period of the newly established Jin dynasty. According to tradition, the members, Liu Ling (221 - 300), Ruan Ji (210–263), Ruan Xian (fl. 3rd century), Xiang Xiu, Wang Rong (234–305) and Shan Tao (205–283) gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of Xi Kang (aka Ji Kang) (223–262), in Shanyang (now in Henan province) where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the simple, rustic life. Modern criticism suggests that these gatherings may have been to some extent virtual. Either way, this way of living was contrasted with the life of politics at court. The Seven Sages stressed the enjoyment of ale, personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of nature. The various 7 sages had their own specialties. However, they shared philosophical discussion, musical production, and drinking. Burton Watson considers Ruan Ji (whose name he transcribes as Juan Chi) to be the [...] "first important poet" [...] following the Jian'an poetry style. Ruan Ji helped to define the Six Dynasties poetic development of the themes of reclusion and friendship. He helped to develop the five-character shi poetry form which had just newly developed with the Jian'an poets, but he moved it away from its initial starkly realistic descriptions of particular scenes which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> before the poets' eyes towards more generalized, abstract, and symbolic poetic statement. Ruan Ji also developed the nature theme, focusing on [...] "the passing of time and the cycle of the seasons", which lead towards the death of the individual. Ruan Ji was also used to deploy the imagery of birds as symbols of freedom and ability to escape their given situation. Burton Watson further notes the evident lack of the imagery of wine in Ruan's surviving poems. Not that he was unacquainted with it, even recorded as having remained continuously drunk for 2 months to avoid an undesirable marriage which was urged upon him with great political pressure such that he could not overtly refuse.|$|E

5000|$|Johnson {{planned to}} carry out his voyage as a celebration of the first centennial of the United States; his aim was to sail to Liverpool, hoping to make the 3,000-mile journey in under 90 days. He bought a 20-foot (6.1 m) dory, named her Centennial, and {{prepared}} and provisioned her for sea. She was fitted out with a centreboard, to improve her sailing qualities, and three watertight compartments which would help her float if capsized, until she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>righted.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{seems to}} me that the only reason for our Lord's using the words of the text, must be, that the master was right, not wrong, in commending the steward.

50|$|The sailing club {{originated}} in 1939 as an all-volunteer club whose members maintained boats and taught each other how to sail on wooden dinghies. Peter Barrett brought the first wooden Tech dinghy from M.I.T. in the 1950s, {{and it became}} the club's signature boat. Peter and Olaf Harken modified M.I.T.'s fiberglass Tech design with air tanks under the gunwales, so that a capsized boat <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>righted</b> and come up mostly dry, to create the Badger Tech dinghy. The two brothers founded their first company, Vanguard Sailboats, to construct a fleet of these boats.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{he began}} to think that perhaps he had not done right, after all, in running away from Aunt Harriet. In Miss Salome's code nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> that was underhanded, and Chester was very swiftly coming to look at things through Miss Salome's eyes. He felt sure that Johnny would never have acted as he had, and if Chester now had one dear {{ambition}} on earth, it was to be as good and manly a fellow as Johnny must have been. But he could never be that as long as he kept the truth about himself from Miss Salome.|$|E

It certainly hadn't foreseen such a case as this. [...] "It's as plain as day that Mr. Burrage intends to marry her--if he can," [...] he said in a minute; that remark being better calculated than any other he could think of to dissimulate his real state of mind.|$|E

60|$|Our {{friends at}} home may well rejoice with us, for {{we are at}} our goal, and up to a point, at least, we {{have shown that the}} {{statement}} of Professor Challenger can be verified.

60|$|Roger did {{not again}} see Hetta {{before he left}} the house, nor did he see his cousin Felix at all. He had now done all that he could do by his journey up to London, and he {{returned}} on that day back to Carbury. Would it not be better for him, in spite of the protestations which he had made, to dismiss the whole family from his mind? There could be no other love for him. He must be desolate and alone. But he might then save himself from a world of cares, and might gradually teach himself to live as though there were no such woman as Hetta Carbury in the world. But no! He would not allow himself to believe that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> The very fact of his love made it a duty to him,--made it almost the first of his duties,--to watch over the interests of her he loved and of those who belonged to her.|$|E
60|$|The {{temperament}} of Mrs. Browning had in it {{a decidedly}} mystical vein, which predisposed her {{to believe in}} any communication between our world {{and that of the}} spirits. Hence when a number of people professed to have such communication, she was not merely ready to listen to their claims, but was by temperament inclined to accept them. The immense vogue which spiritualism had during 'the fifties' tended to confirm her belief. It was easy to say that where there was so much smoke there must be fire. And what she believed, she believed strongly and with a perfect conviction that no other view <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> Just as her faith in Louis Napoleon survived the coup d'état, and even Villafranca, so her belief in communications with the spirit world was proof against any exposure of fraud {{on the part of the}} mediums. Not that she was guilty of the absurdities which marked many of the devotees of spiritualism. She had a great horror of submitting herself to mesmeric influences. She recognised that very many of the supposed revelations of the spirits were trivial, perhaps false; but to the fact that communications did exist she adhered constantly.|$|E
