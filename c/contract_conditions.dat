2500|$|Although Otis Redding {{originally}} {{wrote the}} song, Joss Stone sampled Aretha Franklin's version instead. [...] "Headturner" [...] appeared on her third album, Introducing Joss Stone in 2007. She approached her song {{by taking the}} texture and sound of Franklin's song, but keeping her own composition. Aretha's version became an icon for the feminist movement, demanding for a little respect. Stone's version also portrayed the same message, as well as expressing self-confidence {{and a little bit}} of sass. Stone was inspired and highly influenced by Aretha Franklin. She would mimic Franklin's singing style growing up. Stone has such an amazing voice that her [...] "soulful vocals have seen her described as 'the white Aretha Franklin'". In fact, Stone reached out to Franklin to sing one of her written songs and Franklin agreed to do it, but Stone believed the <b>contract</b> <b>conditions</b> were too impeding. Although, many loved Joss Stone, she did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background. Her audience expected soul artists to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life in order to sing soul music because of how emotional it is; people also expected someone with a voice like Stone's to be black.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that children’s pain is underestimated in clinical settings. Nurses in particular have been highlighted as the professional group most likely to underestimate their pain. Contemporary theories of evolutionary psychology propose that pain assessment is a social exchange situation (e. g. Kappeser et al. 2006), whereby benefits (analgesia) are exchanged with another person when they have paid a cost (pain). A social contract is the cognitive mechanism that supports the exchange of benefits between people. It was proposed in this study, that nurses enter into a social contract with their patient in a pain assessment scenario. Additionally {{it was suggested that}} the underestimation of pain occurs in response to cheater-detection; a cognitive mechanism that has developed to ensure the fair distribution of benefits to people in need. It was hypothesised that when rating in a social <b>contract</b> <b>condition,</b> nursing students would impute less pain than when they were rating in a non-social <b>contract</b> <b>condition.</b> This effect would be strengthend when the participant suspected cheating. It was also proposed that participants in the social <b>contract</b> <b>condition</b> would rate higher levels of exaggeration and {{would be less likely to}} reduce pain when they suspected cheating.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{fresh evidence}} on CEO stock option awards. We identify several <b>contracting</b> <b>conditions</b> that are applied at either plan adoption or a subsequent award. We show empirically that option awards cannot be evaluated without controlling for CEO pre-award stock ownership. Although options potentially augment CEO incentive, {{they may not}} when the stock position is large relative to the award size. We also find that option grants are most successful from a shareholder perspective when awards occur within the top quartile of awarded options/pre-award stock, particularly when the award is made at a discount to market in tandem with vesting requirements. Empirical analysis of CEO stock option awards requires more complete specification of contracting variables than generally exhibited in the extant empirical literature. Of the <b>contracting</b> <b>conditions</b> studied, those having the most important incentive and hence wealth consequences are stock dividend protection, vesting requirements, award discounts/premiums and term to expiry.

40|$|Background: Sensory {{conflict}} may be {{a factor}} in simulator sickness(SS) given that visual input is often inconsistent with other sensoryinputs. It was predicted that an expanding optical flow pattern wouldlead to more sensory conflict, and subsequently more SS than a contractingpattern. Methods: There were 16 individuals who participatedin the experiment (6 men, 10 women, mean age 24. 4 yrs). Subjectsviewed a steadily expanding pattern of blue squares displayed on acomputer monitor. In a second condition the pattern steadily contracted. Subjects completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) designedby Kennedy and colleagues both before and after a trial (5 minexposure to optic flow). A total SSQ score and three SSQ sub-scores(nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation) were obtained. Results: Meanpost-treatment total SSQ scores (mean 28) in the expanding conditionwere higher than those obtained in the <b>contracting</b> <b>condition</b> (mean 17). Nausea and oculomotor SSQ sub-scores were also higher in theexpanding condition compared with the <b>contracting</b> <b>condition.</b> Conclusions:Experience with expanding flow patterns that result during forwardself-motion, and the sensory inputs that usually accompany them,have resulted in a central nervous system expectancy about what theappropriate inputs should be during forward self-motion. Less experiencewith backwards self-motion (and contracting patterns) may resultin a lower level of expectation regarding what the appropriate sensoryinputs should be for contracting flow patterns. This lower level of neuralexpectancy may subsequently lead to less sensory conflict and less SSgenerated by contracting flow patterns...|$|R

5000|$|When using contracts, a {{supplier}} should {{not try to}} verify that the <b>contract</b> <b>conditions</b> are satisfied; the general idea is that code should [...] "fail hard", with contract verification being the safety net. DbC's [...] "fail hard" [...] property simplifies the debugging of contract behavior, as the intended behaviour of each routine is clearly specified. This distinguishes it markedly from a related practice known as defensive programming, where the supplier is responsible for figuring {{out what to do}} when a precondition is broken. More often than not, the supplier throws an exception to inform the client that the precondition has been broken, and in both cases—DbC and defensive programming—the client must figure out how to respond to that. DbC makes the supplier's job easier.|$|E
50|$|Lee {{worked with}} the other railway brotherhoods for {{legislation}} to limit working hours on interstate railroads to eight-hour days, resulting in the 1916 Adamson Act.

In 1921 the Railway Labor Board made a wage decision that fell short of union expectations, but Lee helped persuade the railway brotherhoods to accept the decision. The classical Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen Building in Cleveland was built in 1921, designed by Charles Sumner Schneider. Lee stepped down as president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen in 1928.|$|E
50|$|A {{breach of}} Contract A may occur if the owner (or an owner's officer or representative, see vicarious liability), {{provides}} information, changes specification during the tendering process to unfairly benefit a particular bidder, enters into closed negotiations {{with an individual}} bidder {{in an effort to}} obtain more desirable <b>contract</b> <b>conditions,</b> etc. The most common situation in which an owner is accused of having breached Contract A occurs when a bidder is selected who is not the lowest bidder. This contravenes established custom and practice, which would normally dictate that the lowest bid be awarded the contract, but is not normally a source of a breach if handled properly. The successful suits for breach typically occur if the lowest bidder has been excluded based on a stipulation not clearly outlined in the tender documents (such as preference for local bidders) or when the Privilege Clause employed by the owner to exclude a principle of custom and practice is judged by the courts to be too broadly worded to have any meaning.|$|E
