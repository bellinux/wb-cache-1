25|$|Initially, McKinney kept a {{low profile}} upon her return to Congress. However, on July 22, 2005, {{the first anniversary of}} the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, McKinney held a {{briefing}} on Capitol Hill to address alleged outstanding issues regarding the 2001 attacks on the US. The day-long briefing featured family members of victims, scholars, former intelligence officers and others who critiqued the 9/11 <b>Commission</b> <b>account</b> of 9/11 and its recommendations. The four morning panels addressed flaws, omissions, and a lack of historical and political analysis in the commission's report. Three afternoon panels critiqued the commission's recommendations in the areas of foreign and domestic policy and intelligence reform. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial maintained that the purpose of the event was to discuss whether or not the Bush administration was involved in the 9/11 attacks, expressing surprise that McKinney was once again taking on the issue that was widely believed to have cost her House seat. The Journal-Constitution declined to publish McKinney's reply. The 9/11 Commission has sealed all the notes and transcripts of some 2,000 interviews, all the forensic evidence, and both classified and non-classified documents used in compiling its final report until January 2, 2009. McKinney's interest in 9/11 relates specifically to what she expresses as her opposition to excessive government secrecy, which she has challenged with numerous pieces of legislation.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} Is 6 and 1 Kings 22, 19 – 22 {{reveals that the}} two texts substantially differ in their worlds of thought and intentions. They are not based on {{a common set of}} ideas – a characteristic which would be required if they were to constitute a single genre. As a visionary <b>commission</b> <b>account,</b> 1 Kings 22, 19 – 22 is the objective testimony of an independent prophet who was granted insight into the heavenly council. The text represents JHWH as an unostentatious king with superior dominion over history. He defeats his sworn enemy Ahab by turning the latter’s own eagerness for power into a deadly weapon against him. Is 6, on the other hand, is a vocation account where the prophet gives a personal testimony of how he saw the holy and divine king of kings ruling from his lofty throne. In the course of this visionary experience, the prophet is saved from his people’s mortal entanglement in sin and impurity by accepting the commission of hardening. JHWH appears as the centre of the cosmos, the master of a divine and life-engendering order. Anything alive, from the seraphim to the creatures populating the earth, is oriented towards him. This "fullness of all the earth" (Isa 6, 3) is, at the same time, passively filled with and actively praising his glory. JHWH’s people do not participate in this abundance of life since their sin and impurity imply the practical rejection of JHWH’s rule and its benefits. With the help of divine grace, the prophet is removed from his people’s way to death when he recognizes JHWH as king and serves him as an envoy. By fulfilling the commission of hardening, the prophet ultimately reestablishes JHWH’s rule in his people’s heart - although this paradoxically results in their complete alienation from JHWH and brings them from the sphere of life to that of death and chaos. The above-outlined substantial differences of the two texts go along with formal and structural divergencies which outweigh the similarities on the textual surfaces. All in all, the comparison shows that the two texts do not follow the same generic pattern but use a number of traditional narrative elements independent of any specific genre. ...|$|E

However, the relevance of DNWR depends on whether firms have other margins besides base wages to adjust labour costs when needed. Many firms use a combination of different remuneration methods and motivation, so despite the fact that base or bargained wages typically display features of downward rigidity, it is possible that firms are able to vary other forms of remuneration—which may be less important or less visible to workers than base wages—to achieve desired adjustments in total labour costs. In many firms, particularly larger ones, performance-related benefits such as bonuses and <b>commissions</b> <b>account</b> for a large and growing share of total compensation. 1 [...]...|$|R

50|$|Within {{the history}} of China, every dynasty instituted a salt {{monopoly}} system, originally intended mainly for taxation purposes. Since salt was an essential and irreplaceable commodity used in everyday life, and therefore was viable as a stable source of government revenue, various historical rulers employed a salt monopoly which forbade the production and sales of salt by commoners. The practice of monopolizing salt began during the rule of Emperor Wu of Han, and during the Tang dynasty, income obtained from salt taxes by the salt <b>commission</b> <b>accounted</b> for greater than half the government revenue; during the Yuan dynasty, this figure reached 80%. With {{the founding of the}} People's Republic of China in 1949, the practice of state monopolization of salt persisted; the salt tax continued to form a significant proportion of government revenue, representing 5.49% of the total national tax in 1950, however with a shift in economic development, this has diminished to 0.04% in 2006.|$|R
