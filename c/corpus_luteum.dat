5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cysts appear after ovulation. The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is {{the remnant}} of the {{follicle}} after the ovum has moved to the fallopian tubes. This normally degrades within 5 to 9 days. A <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> {{that is more than}} 3cm is defined as cystic.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> has been confirmed by laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|In medical {{abortion}} regimens, mifepristone {{blockade of}} progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, {{and an increase}} in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone-induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> through the first nine weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased enough {{to take the place of}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200mg is (100mg may be, but 50mg is not) as effective as 600mg in producing a medical abortion.|$|E
25|$|Diestrus, or Luteal, phase: 14–15 days in length, {{the mare}} is not sexually {{receptive}} to the stallion. The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> secretes progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin is {{synthesized}} by corpora lutea {{of several}} species, including ruminants and primates. Along with estrogen, it {{is involved in}} inducing the endometrial synthesis of prostaglandinF2α to cause regression of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Progesterone: {{prevents}} {{conception and}} decreases sexual receptibility of the mare to the stallion. Progesterone is therefore lowest during the estrus phase, and increases during diestrus. It decreases 12–15 days after ovulation, when the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> begins to decrease in size.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} surgery on {{pregnancy}} are not well-known including {{the effects of}} bariatric surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to {{increase the risk of}} miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Most ovarian cysts {{are related}} to ovulation, being either {{follicular}} cysts or <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cysts. Other types include cysts due to endometriosis, dermoid cysts, and cystadenomas. Many small cysts occur in both ovaries in polycystic ovarian syndrome. Pelvic inflammatory disease may also result in cysts. Rarely, cysts may {{be a form of}} ovarian cancer. Diagnosis is undertaken by pelvic examination with an ultrasound or other testing used to gather further details.|$|E
25|$|Although the body's maximal {{store of}} vitamin C is largely {{determined}} by the renal threshold for blood, there are many tissues that maintain vitamin C concentrations far higher than in blood. Biological tissues that accumulate over 100 times the level in blood plasma of vitamin C are the adrenal glands, pituitary, thymus, <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> and retina. Those with 10 to 50 times the concentration present in blood plasma include the brain, spleen, lung, testicle, lymph nodes, liver, thyroid, small intestinal mucosa, leukocytes, pancreas, kidney, and salivary glands.|$|E
25|$|Luteal {{support is}} the {{administration}} of medication, generally progesterone, progestins or GnRH agonists, to increase the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing and/or supporting {{the function of the}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> A Cochrane review found that hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be associated with higher rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, but that the evidence is not conclusive. Co-treatment with GnRH agonists appears to improve outcomes, by a live birth rate RD of +16% (95% confidence interval +10 to +22%).|$|E
25|$|Up to 10% {{of women}} with ectopic {{pregnancy}} have no symptoms, and one-third have no medical signs. In many cases the symptoms have low specificity, and can be {{similar to those of}} other genitourinary and gastrointestinal disorders, such as appendicitis, salpingitis, rupture of a <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cyst, miscarriage, ovarian torsion or urinary tract infection. Clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy occurs at a mean of 7.2 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, with a range of 4 to 8 weeks. Later presentations are more common in communities deprived of modern diagnostic ability.|$|E
25|$|Relaxin is {{a hormone}} {{produced}} mainly by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy {{it is also}} produced by the placenta, chorion, and decidua. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer forms when {{errors in}} normal ovarian cell growth occur. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms {{a mass of}} tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively. When an ovary releases an egg, the egg follicle bursts open and becomes the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> This structure needs to be repaired by dividing cells in the ovary. Continuous ovulation {{for a long time}} means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells, which can acquire mutations in each division.|$|E
25|$|Follow-up imaging {{in women}} of {{reproductive}} age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound {{is not needed}} until 5cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5to 7cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because {{it may be difficult}} to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of the ultrasound beam. For the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3cm in diameter. In postmenopausal patients, any simple cyst greater than 1cm but less than 7cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.|$|E
500|$|The {{loss of the}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is {{prevented}} by fertilization of the egg. [...] The syncytiotrophoblast, which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the blastocyst) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which {{is very similar to}} LH and which preserves the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> [...] The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy. [...] Most pregnancy tests look for the presence of hCG.|$|E
500|$|In a study, {{the blood}} serum of female addax was {{analyzed}} through immunoassay {{to know about}} their luteal phase. Estrous cycle duration was of about 33 days. During pregnancy, ultrasonography showed the uterine horns as coiled. The maximum diameters of the ovarian follicle and the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> were [...] and [...] Each female underwent an anovulatory period lasting 39 to 131 days, during {{which there was no}} ovulation. Anovulation was rare in winter, which suggested the effect of seasons on the estrous cycle.|$|E
2500|$|Prostaglandin: {{secreted}} by the endrometrium 13–15 {{days following}} ovulation, causes luteolysis and prevents the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> from secreting progesterone ...|$|E

2500|$|The main {{function}} of hCG is {{to sustain the}} ovarian <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> during pregnancy past the time it would normally decay {{as part of the}} regular menstrual cycle. For the first 7–9 weeks in humans, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> secretes the progesterone necessary to maintain the viability of the endometrium for pregnancy. Therefore, immunity against hCG during this time frame would function as an abortifacient, as confirmed by experiments in baboons. In the scientific literature the more inclusive term [...] "birth control vaccine" [...] rather than [...] "contraceptive vaccine" [...] is used to refer to hCG vaccines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{follicle}} proper has met [...] {{the end of}} its lifespan. Without the oocyte, the follicle folds inward on [...] itself, transforming {{into the}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> (pl. corpora lutea), a [...] steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces estrogen and progesterone. These hormones induce the [...] endometrial glands to begin production of the proliferative endometrium and later [...] into secretory endometrium, the site of embryonic growth if [...] implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases basal body temperature by one-quarter to one-half degree [...] Celsius (one-half [...] to one degree Fahrenheit). [...] The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> continues this paracrine [...] action {{for the remainder of the}} menstrual cycle, maintaining the [...] endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses.|$|E
2500|$|Outside the brain, oxytocin-containing {{cells have}} been {{identified}} in several diverse tissues, including in females in the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> [...] and the placenta, in males in the testicles' interstitial cells of Leydig, the retina, the adrenal medulla, the thymus and the pancreas. The finding of significant amounts of this classically [...] "neurohypophysial" [...] hormone outside the central nervous system raises many questions regarding its possible importance in these different tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Gynecologic ultrasonography, {{specifically}} {{looking for}} small ovarian follicles. These {{are believed to}} be the result of disturbed ovarian function with failed ovulation, reflected by the infrequent or absent menstruation that is typical of the condition. In a normal menstrual cycle, one egg is released from a dominant follicle– in essence, a cyst that bursts to release the egg. After ovulation, the follicle remnant is transformed into a progesterone-producing <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> which shrinks and disappears after approximately 12–14 days. In PCOS, there is a so-called [...] "follicular arrest"; i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16mm or more). According to the Rotterdam criteria, which are widely used for diagnosis, 12 or more small follicles should be seen in an ovary on ultrasound examination. More recent research suggests that there should be at least 25 follicles in an ovary to designate it as having polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in women aged 18–35 years. The follicles may be oriented in the periphery, giving the appearance of a 'string of pearls'. If a high resolution transvaginal ultrasonography machine is not available, an ovarian volume of at least 10 ml is regarded as an acceptable definition of having polycystic ovarian morphology instead of follicle count.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Corpus</b> <b>Luteum</b> cyst: {{hemorrhage}} into persistent <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> Commonly regresses spontaneously.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cysts appear after ovulation. The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is {{the remnant}} of the {{follicle}} after the ovum has moved to the fallopian tubes. This normally degrades within 5-9 days. A <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> {{that is more than}} 3 cm is defined as cystic.|$|E
50|$|Human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin {{signals the}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) {{of the uterus}} and providing an area rich in blood vessels in which the zygote(s) can develop. From this point on, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is called the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> graviditatis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> (the {{remains of}} an ovulated ovarian follicle) is {{responsible}} for the development of maternal behavior and lactation, which are mediated by the continued production of progesterone by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> through some or all of pregnancy. In most species, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is degraded {{in the absence of a}} pregnancy. However, in some species, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> may persist in the absence of pregnancy and cause [...] "pseudopregnancy", in which the female will exhibit clinical signs of pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cyst {{is a type}} {{of ovarian}} cyst which may rupture about the time of menstruation, and take up to three months to {{disappear}} entirely. A <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cyst rarely occurs at age 50+, because eggs are no longer being released in menopausal women. <b>Corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cysts may contain blood and other fluids. The physical shape of a <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cyst may appear as an enlargement of the ovary itself, rather than a distinct mass -like growth {{on the surface of the}} ovary.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} called luteinization, {{and the total}} mass of cells {{together}} is called the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> A well-developed vascular supply also grows into the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hormones {{produced}} by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> needs to maintain itself. With continued low levels of FSH and LH, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> will atrophy. The death of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> results in falling levels of progesterone and oestrogen. These falling levels of ovarian hormones cause increased levels of FSH, which begins recruiting follicles for the next cycle. Continued drops in levels of oestrogen and progesterone trigger {{the end of the}} luteal phase: menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle.|$|E
50|$|This {{phase is}} {{characterized}} by the activity of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> which produces progesterone. The signs of estrogen stimulation subside and the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> starts to form. The uterine lining begins to appear. In the absence of pregnancy the diestrus phase (also termed pseudo-pregnancy) terminates with the regression of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> The lining in the uterus is not shed, but is reorganized for the next cycle.|$|E
50|$|Very rarely, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> may form a cyst. A <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> cyst {{will cause}} BBTs to stay {{elevated}} and prevent menstruation from occurring until it resolves, which could take weeks or months.|$|E
5000|$|The corpus albicans (Latin for [...] "whitening body"; {{also known}} as atretic <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum,</b> corpus candicans, or simply as albicans) is the regressed form of the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> As the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is being broken down by macrophages, {{fibroblasts}} lay down type I collagen, forming the corpus albicans. This process is called [...] "luteolysis". The remains of the corpus albicans may persist as a scar {{on the surface of}} the ovary.|$|E
50|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{does not}} occur, {{the disintegration of}} the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> causes a drop in BBTs that roughly coincides with the onset of the next menstruation. If pregnancy does occur, the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> continues to function (and maintain high BBTs) for the first trimester of the pregnancy. After the first trimester, the woman's body temperature drops to her pre-ovulatory normal as the placenta takes over functions previously performed by the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{loss of the}} <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> is {{prevented}} by fertilization of the egg. The syncytiotrophoblast, which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the blastocyst) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which {{is very similar to}} LH and which preserves the <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum.</b> The <b>corpus</b> <b>luteum</b> can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy. Most pregnancy tests look for the presence of hCG.|$|E
