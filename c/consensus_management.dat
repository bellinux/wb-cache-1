This practice is not encouraged because of insufficient evidence of cost-benefit in gastric cancer prevention, the potential for increases in antibiotic resistance and the controversial hypothesis of potential negative effects of eradication in certain clinical entities. For example, there is insufficient evidence to recommend against eradicating H pylori discovered in a patient with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

40|$|Objectives: To develop European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) {{recommendations}} {{for the management of}} large vessel vasculitis. Methods: An expert group (10 rheumatologists, 3 nephrologists, 2 immunolgists, 2 internists representing 8 European countries and the USA, a clinical epidemiologist and a representative from a drug regulatory agency) identified 10 topics for a systematic literature search through a modified Delphi technique. In accordance with standardised EULAR operating procedures, recommendations were derived for the management of large vessel vasculitis. In the absence of evidence, recommendations were formulated {{on the basis of a}} consensus opinion. Results: Seven recommendations were made relating to the assessment, investigation and treatment of patients with large vessel vasculitis.

40|$|Abstract- Situational {{analysis}} of chronic violence occurring between police and spectators at the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix led to formulation of hypotheses {{about the causes}} of the violence. These hypotheses proposed a relationship between the violence and: (1) police tactics, (2) spectator and police frustration, (3) facilities at the event and its organization, and (4) media sensationalism. Working with the Victoria Police, the authors developed and implemented a situational crime prevention plan to both prevent violence and maintain large crowd numbers attending the event. The plan's effectiveness is assessed by comparing pre- and post-intervention arrests, spectators ' satisfaction with police, and residents ' satisfaction with the event. These comparisons demonstrate that violence is preventable at some public events using <b>consensus</b> <b>management</b> techniques, and that the result is greater public satisfaction with police. Through use of these techniques, alienation of the public can be minimized, thus avoiding unintended consequences of a more authoritarian approach...|$|E

40|$|Background: Effective {{management}} of psoriasis {{is a cause}} for much concern. In Taiwan, {{there is a lack}} of <b>consensus</b> on <b>management</b> strategies for psoriasis, especially the principles of drug prescribing in psoriatic patients. Objectives: The Taiwanese Dermatological Association convened Expert Panel meetings three times between 2012 and 2015 to discuss the management strategies for treatment of psoriasis in order to fill the knowledge gap and provide a reference tool for Taiwanese dermatologists. Results: This paper reports the final output from the three meetings, with the aim of aiding clinical decision making in terms of principles of prescribing, including dosing strategies, efficacy profiles, and safety concerns in connection with eight categories of antipsoriatic treatment: topical agents, phototherapy, nonbiologic conventional systemic agents, licensed biologic systemic agents, newly emerging therapies, combination therapy, transitional therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine.

40|$|Guidelines for the {{management}} of either hypertension or hyperlipidaemia have been widely published. However, recent data have shown the high frequency of an abnormal lipid profile in hypertensive subjects. We have therefore surveyed 195 general practitioners throughout Britain to determine current community-based attitudes and management approaches to hypertension with coexistent hypercholesterolaemia. Routine screening for lipids in hypertensive subjects was recommended by 40 % of respondents. First-line antihypertensive drug choices were influenced by the knowledge of a hypercholesterolaemia, with preference for drugs known to have no adverse effects on the lipid profile. When first-choice drug failed to effectively lower blood pressure, the additional drug or the substitute choices were not influenced by the metabolic profiles of the alternative selected. The current wide choice of antihypertensive drugs and the complexity of metabolic complications of treatment plus the relationship of risk factor clustering has made the formulation of management strategies very difficult. This was supported by the finding that 88 % of respondents in our survey felt that there was a clear need for <b>consensus</b> <b>management</b> guidelines for the treatment of hypertension with coexistent hypercholesterolaemia...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine deaminase {{deficiency}} is {{a disorder}} of purine metabolism leading to {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} (ADA-SCID). Without treatment, the condition is fatal and requires early intervention. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the major treatment for ADA-SCID, although survival following different donor sources varies considerably. Unlike other SCID forms, 2 other options are available for ADA-SCID: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with pegylated bovine ADA, and autologous haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT). Due to the rarity of the condition, the lack of large scale outcome studies, and availability of different treatments, guidance on treatment strategies is limited. We have reviewed the currently available evidence and together with our experience of managing this condition propose a <b>consensus</b> <b>management</b> strategy. Matched sibling donor transplants represent a successful treatment option with high survival rates and excellent immune recovery. Mismatched parental donor transplants have a poor survival outcome and should be avoided unless other treatments are unavailable. ERT and GT both show excellent survival, and therefore the choice between ERT, MUD transplant, or GT is difficult and dependent on several factors, including accessibility to the different modalities, response of patients to long-term ERT, and the attitudes of physicians and parents to the short- and potential long-term risks associated with different treatments.

40|$|The soybean aphid {{continues}} to be an important pest in the major soybean growing regions around the country. The current <b>consensus</b> <b>management</b> recommendations that have been developed over {{more than a decade of}} research include cultural, genetic, economic and chemical controls. Although, these strategies reduce the threat they do not completely eliminate soybean aphid as a pest. As a complement to current management practices, we propose utilizing a biotechnological approach to enhance plant immunity. The genetic manipulation of components of the plants own defense signaling pathways offers an attractive strategy for boosting plant defenses. Regulatory genes that control the expression of multiple defenses are excellent targets for developing broad‐spectrum of pathogens. This approach has several important advantages including a minimal impact on crop yield and economically important plant, reduced impact of the environment and on natural enemies of the aphid due to reduced insecticide sprays. A defense regulatory gene PHYTOALEXIN DEFICINT 4 (PAD 4), is an excellent candidate for over‐expression soybean plants due to its important role in plant defenses against a broad‐spectrum of pathogens. We therefore, propose to develop transgenic soybean plants that over‐express the PAD 4 gene. We expect that PAD 4 will provide a measure of resistance not only against the soybean aphid but also against other important soybean pests. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{inherent}} {{conflicts between}} objectives in fisheries management (e. g. yield max-imization vs. conservation interests) often create problems for managers, scientists and stake-holders. However, some seemingly contrasting objectives may be compatible (e. g. economic yield and ecosystem preservation) and could promote stakeholder consensus. Formalized scientific facilitation through the framework we present here aids stakeholders in objective-setting and {{managers in the}} policy-making process. The {{purpose of this study}} is to outline a quantitative approach to defining fisheries management objectives through stakeholder-specific utility functions. To achieve this, we link a biological model with a socio-economic model, both calibrated for a capelin fishery and a cod fishery. Second, we define multiple objectives in a quantified utility function for each stakeholder group. Finally, we conduct simulations that calculated the resulting stakeholder groups’ utility for different levels of harvest and minimum sizes. Our results illustrate that low harvest rates and minimum-size regulations that select for bigger fish represent a management consensus zone among five modeled stakeholders. We put forward a new technique of scientific facilitation through quantification of bio-socio-economic objectives leading to sustainable resource use through stakeholder consensus.

40|$|Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) {{problem is}} a {{management}} science technique, which is popularly used to rank the priority of alternatives {{with respect to their}} competing attributes. It is popularly used in diverse fields such as engineering management, portfolio selection, transportation planning, and performance evaluation. Weights form the core of MADM: it is obvious that different weights lead to various evaluation results and decisions. Several approaches have been developed for assessing the weights of MADM problems, e. g., the eigenvector method, ELECTRE, and TOPSIS. However, an assessment approach of weights in MADM, which meets both the need of simplicity interface for practitioners and concrete theory for scholars is not easy, and balancing these two aspects is a challenging and tough task. Since the pay-off matrix in game theory could be regarded as a simple interface for data input/output, and very few scholars had ever explored the two-person zero-sum game on MADM problems. In this paper, the weights of a MADM problem are obtained by formulating it as a two-person zero-sum game with multiple decision makers. The group equilibrium solution, i. e., consensus of weights and the resolution steps for such a group MADM game has also been originally developed and validated in this study. Finally, an actual case of selecting the appropriate portfolio decision for a paper company is illustrated.
