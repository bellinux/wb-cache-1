5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b> The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding around the room on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
25|$|That {{entrance}} {{leads to}} a vestibule and then inside to the sanctuary. It features wainscoting beneath the <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> as well as paneling on the gallery parapet, and painted and grained pews. The gallery and ceiling are supported by Doric columns, and the original 19th-century light fixtures.|$|E
50|$|The two-story, second-floor {{courtroom}} also retains some historic features. Details include original oak panel {{doors with}} classical surrounds, wainscot, baseboards, plaster walls with classically inspired panel molding, and ornamental plaster ceilings. Second-floor corridors have plaster walls with marble baseboards and oak <b>chair</b> <b>rails.</b> Square 1940 light fixtures remain.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the {{building}} has much of an interior added in the early 19th century, such as its wooden doors, lath and plaster walls, <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> and exposed ceiling beams. The central hallway has a curved wall to accommodate the staircase. There is evidence of the expansions that have taken place, such as bricked-over former fireplaces.|$|R
50|$|In 1837, John Madison Chapman (1810-1879), a local lawyer, {{acquired}} the property. Chapman {{lived in the}} house until his death. During his lengthy ownership, Chapman completed numerous Greek Revival and Victorian-era upgrades, including new moulding, <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> wooden mantels, door frames, and a black and gold Port D'Oro (also called Portor or Portoro) Italian marble mantel.|$|R
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{itself is}} painted off-white, with {{the stained glass}} windows, red carpeting, gilding and mahogany trim of the pews providing a contrast. Corinthian columns, creating lateral arcades, provide corbeled support to groin vaults. The arcading partially encloses the balcony. A simulated clerestory level is illuminated by the skylights supplemented by electric lighting in the original wall sconces. The walls themselves are plaster on lath with beaded wainscoting ending in a <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and molded <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between {{the walls and}} ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|E
25|$|All three entrances use heavy opaque modern metal doors. On the inside, the {{sanctuary}} has curved rows of wooden pews on a hardwood floor divided by a central aisle that offer seating for 350. Laminated wooden buttresses flank all the windows; in between {{them are the}} painted Stations of the Cross. Every third buttress is heavier and thicker. The walls are finished in shiplap below the windowsill level; above that a <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> sets off a finish of grooved rectangles similar to those on the exterior.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{corridor}} in the Convent of Domican Sisters at Mission San Jose de Guadalupe, ca. 1904. About 14 doors {{face each other}} in the long corridor. They are separated by short expanses of wall with <b>chair</b> <b>rails.</b> Pctures topped with crosses hang in each section of wall. A statue, "Ecce Homo", is visible {{at the far end of}} the corridor. The floor glows from polish...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a modest}} 1-1/2 story, Cape style cottage, five bays wide, {{with a side}} gable roof and central chimney. An ell, added around 1910, extends to the rear. The {{interior}} retains original features, including beaded <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> and fireplace mantels. The house was built c. 1770-80, although its early ownership is uncertain. It may have belonged {{to members of the}} Peck family who operated an iron forge and grist mill nearby.|$|R
50|$|The tavern {{was built}} about 1780, {{in what was}} known {{at the time as}} Stevens Corner. Its {{interior}} retains a number of important period features, including paneled fireplace surrounds, <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> and wainscoting, and splayed window lintels; the latter is a particularly rare feature in early Rehoboth architecture. The ell was added to the left side in the 19th century. The tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|R
2500|$|The walls have marble reredos, made by Leake and Greene of Pittsburgh, with {{bands of}} mosaic in the chancel. [...] In the nave, {{the walls are}} random width beaded board wainscoting with <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b> Above the <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> pink plaster rises up to the heavily molded wood cornice. The wood-truss system is exposed to the ceiling.|$|E

6000|$|Some time {{afterwards}} Jardine came in and, seeing Jimmy, {{stopped and}} turned to Margaret. It was typical that he said nothing, but his glance was keen. Margaret smiled and {{in a low voice}} narrated all she knew. Jardine nodded, and sitting down, waited until Jimmy's head slipped from the <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and the jerk woke him up. He looked about as if he were puzzled, and then said, [...] "Hello, Mr. Jardine! I didn't understand your sitting opposite me. I expect I was asleep." ...|$|E
50|$|While the {{interior}} was renovated {{in the early nineteenth}} century, many original features still exist. These include the triple-run walnut staircase, pine floors, <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> and doors, which feature both HL and foliated H hinges. The brick exterior, which was constructed in both Flemish and English bond, remains largely untouched. The half-hipped roof was originally built without the current dormers, which were added on subsequent renovations. The original cedar shingles have been replaced with slate.|$|R
50|$|The two-story main {{courtroom}} is on {{the second}} floor. The courtroom lobby retains historic terrazzo floors, marble baseboards, wooden <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> and paneled doors. The courtroom itself features wood wainscoting and fluted Ionic pilasters supporting a massive wood entablature with a dentil cornice, all of painted white pine. Arched windows on the south wall have wood trim with a keystone and rosette corner blocks. Original furnishings include the judge's bench, jury box, court rail, and spectators' benches.|$|R
50|$|The Solomon Piper Farm is a {{historic}} farmhouse at 227 Valley Road in Dublin, New Hampshire. The 1-1/2 story vernacular Cape style house was built c. 1794 by Solomon Piper, progenitor of the locally prominent Piper family, and is an excellent local example of a typical early 19th century farmhouse. It is five bays wide, with narrow windows, and a small extension added to the east end. Interior details which have been retained include wainscoting, <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> and fireplace mantels.|$|R
60|$|They {{found the}} landlord's son on one side, and the hostler on the other, holding the man {{down in his}} chair. Young, slim, and undersized, he was strong enough at that moment {{to make it a}} matter of {{difficulty}} for the two to master him. His tawny complexion, his large, bright brown eyes, and his black beard gave him something of a foreign look. His dress was a little worn, but his linen was clean. His dusky hands were wiry and nervous, and were lividly discolored in more places than one by the scars of old wounds. The toes of one of his feet, off which he had kicked the shoe, grasped at the <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> through his stocking, with the sensitive muscular action which is only seen in those who have been accustomed to go barefoot. In the frenzy that now possessed him, it was impossible to notice, to any useful purpose, more than this. After a whispered consultation with Mr. Brock, the surgeon personally superintended the patient's removal to a quiet bedroom {{at the back of the}} house. Shortly afterward his clothes and his carpet-bag were sent downstairs, and were searched, on the chance of finding a clew by which to communicate with his friends, in the magistrate's presence.|$|E

50|$|When the Shelburne Museum {{dismantled}} and reassembled Stagecoach Inn on {{the grounds}} in 1949, it needed restoration. Museum contractors removed the dividing walls in the second-story ballroom, returning it to its former dimensions; they rebuilt ten fireplaces, two brick ovens, and two ham-smoking chambers; applied paneling and plaster finishes that approximated those found in New England in the late 18th century; and fashioned replacement window casings and <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> with antique carpenter’s planes. Finally, they reconstructed the broad porch that had originally wrapped around the building’s exterior to re-create the Inn’s early appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Folkston, Georgia has a {{small but}} {{well-appointed}} viewing area, overlooking the [...] "Folkston Funnel", a stretch of track where two CSX lines have combined for {{a large amount of}} rail traffic. The shelter itself has some <b>chairs,</b> <b>rail</b> radio broadcasts, ample parking and electrical outlets for charging camera batteries. The only amenity it lacks is a restroom, but there is a McDonald's within a block that is railfan friendly. Highlights of viewing include up to 60 trains a day, including the auto train and the Tropicana juice train.|$|R
50|$|The front {{entrance}} leads into a hall {{with a central}} arch way and stairway. The walls are painted a soft green with decorative stencils lining the cornices and <b>chair</b> <b>rails.</b> The stencils have been reproduced from late 19th century styles. The front door is framed by lead-light windows, a fanlight above and rectangular panels on either side {{as well as two}} panels in the door itself. Another lead-light window is visible on the landing of the first flight of stairs. The hall leads off to rooms on either side and then through to an extension at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second floor}} is less elaborately {{detailed}} than the first. The wood trim {{is simple and}} is not moulded, though the chair rails are original. Mantels are of wood and are simply detailed with pilasters and shelves. The {{north end of the}} hall has been enclosed to accommodate two bathrooms. A ladder propped-up to a small door in the ceiling provides access to the attic. The southeast chamber has no <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and a simple mantel flanked on the left by a closet and on the right by book shelves. The northeast chamber has a heavy moulded <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and closet. The most elaborate mantel on the second floor is found in the southwest room which is connected to the northwest chamber by a closet passage with shelving. The northwest room has a simple beaded <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|A dado rail, {{also known}} as a <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> is a type of {{moulding}} fixed horizontally to the wall around the perimeter of a room.|$|E

50|$|A $1.3 million {{rehabilitation}} {{was completed}} in 2009 to bring the home to its historic condition. While the house was in decay, restoration-construction experts had much original material to work with: exterior brick, stone foundation, floor joists, walnut flooring, cabinets, sills, interior molding and <b>chair</b> <b>rails.</b> Rehabilitation efforts included pouring a new foundation; restoring original window size and replacing panes and sashes; re-shingling the roof in period materials; removing paint from and stabilizing exterior brick; refinishing original floors and woodwork; and restoring interior plaster. In addition, the four chimneys were rebuilt from a state of disrepair, and a summer kitchen was reconstructed based on archaeological and historical information.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the office}} spaces include plaster {{finishes}} with oak baseboards, <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> and picture moldings. Although initial plans in 1897 called for two-story courtrooms {{in the large}} spaces {{at each end of}} the central wing at the third floor, these were omitted from the design after construction began in 1900. While the courtroom spaces were simplified, their large, central skylights in the paneled ceilings above were retained. The interiors were rehabilitated in 1977, removing obtrusive firewalls that had been installed in the stairwells. In 1992, GSA undertook an extensive exterior preservation project to clean, repair, and restore the historic building to its original condition.|$|R
50|$|Pilasters also {{frame the}} windows within the auditorium, with picture panels between them. A molded cornice {{is at the}} ceiling line. The stage also has wainscoting and a molded <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{bathroom}} has the baseboard molding. The {{lower section}} of its two-over-two sash {{is larger than}} the upper. The wall separating it and a hallway closet curves, and there is a <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> around the room.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northeast}} room on {{the first}} floor functions as the parlor. This room has a dentilled cornice and <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> added by the current owners. A Federal wood mantel is not original to the house. A door {{to the left of the}} fireplace leads to the library situated at the southeast corner of the first floor. The finishes in this room are similar, with added cornice and <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and bookcases on the east and west walls. The mantel is green and black Vermont slate and is original to the house. It is likely that the original parlor mantel was similar. A closet,is located to the left of the fireplace is an original feature of the room.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the house is a typical 19th-century Cape house, with ells on either side, and a wing {{extending}} south on from the western ell. The house is finished in clapboards and rests on a cut stone foundation. The interiors were substantially altered by Arthur McFarland's designs during the 1920s, although some early Federal and Greek Revival features have been retained. McFarland's Colonial Revival features include extensive use of wood paneling, as well as the use of <b>chair</b> <b>rails,</b> picture rails, and crown molding. The property also includes a caretaker's cottage, built in 1929 to a McFarland design, and a later, more modern garage.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the main}} {{entrance}} leads to an 8-foot-wide (2.4 m) central hallway, the axis of a symmetrical floor plan. The rooms on the west are a double parlor; those on the east are {{the dining room and}} library. All have most of their original trim, including baseboards, cornices, molded <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> and diagonally oriented corner fireplaces that share a chimney with the other room on that side. Paneled doors lead between all spaces. Flooring is random-width wide pine boards, and those in the southwest parlor are clear-grained. All first-story rooms share 9 ft ceilings with the hallway. All windows have paneled shutters that recess into the 24-inch-deep (61 cm) walls with window seats below.|$|R
50|$|The {{main block}} of the Osgood House is a two story wood frame structure, five bays in width and depth, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. A two-story gable-roofed ell {{extends to the}} west, ending in a small shed which {{replicates}} an earlier, similar structure. The main entrance, facing east, is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a louvered fan. A secondary entrance is centered on the south facade, framed by pilasters and a transom window and entablature. The interior follows a fairly typical Federal period central hall plan, with turned newel post and balusters, and applied sawn ornamentation. Federal style paneling, door and window molding, and <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> decorate the public rooms.|$|R
