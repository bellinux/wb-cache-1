5|$|The first divine act is the <b>creation</b> of the cosmos, {{described}} in several <b>creation</b> myths. They focus on different gods, {{each of which}} may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes <b>creation,</b> give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions {{of the events of}} <b>creation</b> were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following <b>creation,</b> in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E
