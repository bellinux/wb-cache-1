It is not {{until late in the}} play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E

Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E

25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have <b>captured</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of {{scholars}} as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To be, {{or not to}} be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.|$|E
25|$|Mary Ware Dennett <b>captured</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of {{the public}} and media for her sex {{education}} pamphlet, “The Sex Side of Life.” Dennett wrote it in 1915 to educate her sons, because she was unable to find any adequate books on the subject. Many of the books on sex either contained inaccurate information or used fear and shame tactics to dissuade the youth from having sex. Therefore, she decided to write her own explanation using research and interviews with doctors. She passed the writing on to her friends with adolescent children. In 1918, it was published in Medical Review of Reviews, and a year later it was published as a pamphlet.|$|E

Malcolm X describes 'jam circles' in his autobiography as a loose circle forming around a couple or individual whose dancing was so impressive it <b>captured</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of dancers around them, who would stop and watch, cheering and clapping. This tradition continues in most lindy hop communities today, with other couples interrupting, joining, or replacing the original couple in the cleared 'circle'.

The Berengaria arrived in New York on 28 October. On this visit, Günther and Magda travelled to conduct business with the H.

25|$|Van Leeuwenhoek's work fully <b>captured</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the Royal Society, and {{he began}} {{corresponding}} regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work. By the time van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings {{in a wide variety}} of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance. The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. Despite the initial success of van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. In 1676, his credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{outlines}} how attention metadata {{enables a}} tight integration between organisational knowledge stores and {{human resource management}} {{on the one hand}} and learning management system in corporate contexts on the other hand. The approach relies on an extension of AttentionXML, a metadata standard to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> a user spends on digital content. We suggest relying on attention metadata to unobtrusively <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of employees at the workplace (e. g. through workflow systems, knowledge management systems, human resource management systems, etc.) and use <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> information to enable a targeted steering of learning process of the employee in companies in accordance with company’s and employee’s aims and goals...|$|R
