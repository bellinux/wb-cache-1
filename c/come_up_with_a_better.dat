5|$|Trying to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced {{it at the}} Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out {{through a series of}} ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution {{to generate}} electricity.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called {{the scene where}} the office realizes Michael's loneliness [...] "absolutely one of the saddest moments I've seen in recent memory" [...] and noted that [...] "you can't help but feel for him". M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict called the entry [...] "another great episode" [...] for the series and awarded it an [...] "A–". He noted that by bringing the supporting characters' kids into the office [...] "hilarity ensues". Babish applauded {{the lack of an}} arching plot, allowing [...] "Michael's faux pas" [...] to take center stage. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called [...] "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" [...] the [...] "best episode yet this season" [...] and noted that [...] "the writers will be hard-pressed to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> story than this one." [...] Sciannamea called [...] "the transformation of Michael's indifference over the kids to one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around" [...] as the [...] "most interesting aspect of the episode". He also called Dwight and Michael's sing-along near the end [...] "the single funniest moment of the season".|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team trying to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E

If we lost in the Committee of the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that.

2500|$|Martin {{attracted}} the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. He met comic Jerry Lewis at the Glass Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to [...] "go for broke", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material. Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew {{a lot of people who}} are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars. [...] "It struck me that our understanding of success was really crude — and there was an opportunity to dig down and <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> set of explanations." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{addition}} to being the head of Radio's comedy shorts division, Marcus was given the title of associate producer for features {{by the end of the}} summer of 1934. Associate producers during this time were the supervising producers for film production at RKO, and were given on-screen credit as either an associate producer, or simply, producer. Marcus' first feature was Kentucky Kernels, starring the comedy duo of Wheeler and Woolsey, and directed by George Stevens. He would work with the comedy team again the following year, once more with Stevens at the helm, [...] on The Nitwits. The film's original title was Mellodicks, which Marcus found repugnant. He offered $50 to any employee of RKO who could <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> title. While he received numerous suggestions, he finally settled on the picture's final title, which had been a generic title around the RKO lot for years. In all, Marcus produced the final six films made by duo between 1934 and 1937, the others being The Rainmakers (1935), Silly Billies (1936), Mummy's Boys (1936), and High Flyers (1937).|$|E
2500|$|The {{central market}} of Paris, Les Halles, {{had been in}} the same {{location}} on the Right Bank between the Louvre and the Hôtel de Ville since it was established by King Philip II of France in 1183. [...] The first market had walls and gates, but no covering other than tents and umbrellas. It sold food, clothing, weapons, and a wide range of merchandise. By the middle of the 19th century, the open-air market was overcrowded, unsanitary, and inadequate for the needs of the growing city. On September 25, 1851, Napoleon III, then Prince-President, placed the first stone for a new market. [...] The first building looked like a grim stone medieval fortress and was criticised by the merchants, public and the Prince-President himself. [...] He stopped construction and commissioned a different architect, Victor Baltard, to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> design. [...] Baltard took his inspiration from The Crystal Palace in London, a revolutionary glass and cast-iron structure that had been built in 1851. [...] Baltard's new design had fourteen enormous pavilions with glass and cast-iron roofs resting on brick walls. It covered an area of 70 hectares and cost 60 million francs to build. [...] By 1870, ten of the fourteen pavilions were finished and in use. [...] Les Halles was the major architectural achievement of the Second Empire and became the model for covered markets around the world.|$|E
