60|$|It is well to take, {{if not to}} make, {{a proper}} needle for putting the wicks into the moulds. It should be a hooked piece of wire, like a <b>crochet</b> <b>needle,</b> which catches the wick by its middle and pulls it doubled through the hole. A stick across {{the mouth of the}} mould secures the other end. When the tallow is setting, give an {{additional}} pull downwards. A gun-barrel, with a cork or wad put the required distance down the barrel, has been used for a mould. Pull the candle out by the wick after heating the barrel. Two wads might be used; the one strongly rammed in, to prevent the tallow from running too far, the other merely as a support for the wick. Perhaps, even paper moulds might be used; they could be made by gumming or pasting paper in a roll.|$|E
50|$|A {{crochet hook}} (or <b>crochet</b> <b>needle)</b> is an {{implement}} {{used to make}} loops in thread or yarn and to interlock them into crochet stitches. It is basically a round shaft pointed on one end, with a lateral groove behind it. The point eases the insertion of the hook through the material being crocheted and the groove {{makes it possible to}} pull a loop back through the material. The shaft is then divided into a working area that determines the hook's nominal diameter and ensures the uniform sizing of the loops formed on it, and a handle.|$|E
40|$|Self-insertion {{of foreign}} bodies into the urethra and urinary bladder for autoerotic {{stimulation}} {{is a rather}} rare urological emergency condition. We present a case of 41 -year-old lady who self-inserted a <b>crochet</b> <b>needle</b> into the urethra for sexual pleasure, which was successfully retrieved during examination under general anaesthetic and endoscopic bladder evaluation. Foreign bodies in the urinary bladder are rarely encountered yet represent a urological challenge that requires prompt management in view of possible sequellae if left untreated...|$|E
50|$|In {{the textile}} arts, a stitch {{is a single}} turn or loop of thread, or yarn. Stitches are the {{fundamental}} elements of sewing, knitting, embroidery, <b>crochet,</b> and <b>needle</b> lace-making, whether by hand or machine. A variety of stitches, each {{with one or more}} names, are used for specific purposes.|$|R

25|$|Any yarn can {{be either}} knitted or <b>crocheted,</b> {{provided}} <b>needles</b> or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties {{should be taken into}} account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|R
50|$|Robineau began seriously making {{ceramics}} around 1901, {{by which}} time she already {{had a reputation as}} a china painter. She became convinced that painting over the glaze — then a common technique — was the wrong approach and began to experiment with other procedures. She worked primarily in porcelain, experimenting with American clays to create a true high-fire porcelain. She also experimented {{with a wide range of}} forms, decorations, and glazes, with frequent use of multicolored, opalescent, and iridescent glazes. Her mature work shows Art Nouveau and Japonisme influences in the use of stylized botanical and animal elements. At a time when many noted china painters worked with blanks made by other people, she handled all phases of the process herself, from forming the pots to incising and painting them. Some of the detail work on her pieces was so fine that she employed <b>crochet</b> <b>needles</b> and dental tools to get the desired effect.|$|R
6000|$|So they began, {{and for an}} hour one {{pleasant}} voice {{after the}} other read aloud those sad, true stories of workingwomen and their hard lives, showing these gay young creatures what their pretty clothes cost the real makers of them, and how much injustice, suffering, and wasted strength went into them. It was very sober reading, but most absorbing; for the <b>crochet</b> <b>needles</b> went slower and slower, the lace-work lay idle, and a great tear shone like a drop of dew on the apple blossoms as Ella listened to [...] "Rose's Story." [...] They skipped the statistics, and dipped here and there as each took her turn; but when the two hours were over, {{and it was time}} for the club to adjourn, all the members were deeply interested in that pathetic book, and more in earnest than before; for this glimpse into other lives showed them how much help was needed, and made them anxious to lend a hand, ...|$|R
50|$|Casey is {{the home}} to several Guinness World Record constructions. #BigThingsInASmallTown include Wind Chime, Rocking Chair, Knitting <b>Needles,</b> <b>Crochet</b> Hook, Pitchfork, Golf Tee, Yardstick, Wooden Token, Dutch Wooden Shoes, Mailbox, Pencil and Birdcage.|$|R
25|$|A needle gauge {{makes it}} {{possible}} to determine the size of a knitting needle. Some may also be used to gauge the size of <b>crochet</b> hooks. Most <b>needles</b> come with the size written on them, but with use and time, the label often wears off, and many needles (like double-pointed needles) tend not to be labelled.|$|R
50|$|The shop stocks a {{range of}} {{materials}} for knitters and crocheters, including varying types of yarn; knitting <b>needles,</b> <b>crochet</b> hooks and accessories; patterns and books. The shop is regularly used as a venue for the knitting club and other events, including classes, film nights, a book group (The Kniterati), late night opening and is the first knitting shop in the UK with a licensed bar selling alcoholic drinks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{familiar}} {{symbol of}} illegal abortion is the infamous [...] "coat hanger" [...] — {{which may be}} the symbol, but is in no way a myth. In my years in New York, several women arrived with a hanger still in place. Whoever put it in — perhaps the patient herself — found it trapped in the cervix and could not remove it....However, not simply coat hangers were used.Almost any implement you can imagine had been and was used to start an abortion — darning <b>needles,</b> <b>crochet</b> hooks, cut-glass salt shakers, soda bottles, sometimes intact, sometimes with the top broken off.|$|R
5000|$|Cro-tatting {{combines}} <b>needle</b> tatting with <b>crochet.</b> The cro-tatting tool is a tatting <b>needle</b> with a <b>crochet</b> hook at the end. One {{can also}} cro-tat with a bullion crochet hook {{or a very}} straight crochet hook. In the 19th century, [...] "crochet tatting" [...] patterns were published which simply called for a crochet hook. One of the earliest patterns is for a crocheted afghan with tatted rings forming a raised design. [...] Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are tatted with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle tatting. In modern patterns, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, the rings are tatted and the arches or chains are crocheted. Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than <b>crochet</b> or <b>needle</b> tatting. Some tatting instructors recommend using a tatting <b>needle</b> and a <b>crochet</b> hook to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and needle tatting before a ring is closed) unravel easily, unlike tatting made with a shuttle.|$|R
50|$|Deep River Manufacturing {{had begun}} in the 1860s as J.A. Smith & Co., a firm which made hooks and other bent-wire objects in a shop in Deep River. In 1885, the firm was bought by Henry Snell and Mathewson Potter, who used its {{equipment}} to manufacture <b>crochet</b> hooks, knitting <b>needles,</b> and button hooks. The partnership operated until 1927, when it was sold {{to one of the}} employees, but went bankrupt within a year; the eclipse of high-button shoes and gloves in fashion had largely destroyed the company's market. Ernest Prann and other local men formed the Deep River Manufacturing Company and bought the firm, but sold the company to another partnership, which included Messerschmidt, Sr., in 1929. Messerschmidt's son, Charles, Jr., who had obtained a bookkeeping certificate from Baypath Institute in 1928, was also brought into the partnership.|$|R
6000|$|Another of my few rambles {{took me to}} the Senate Chamber, {{hoping to}} hear and see if this large machine was run any better than some small ones I knew of. I was too late, and found the Speaker's chair {{occupied}} by a colored gentleman of ten; while two others were [...] "on their legs," [...] having a hot debate on the cornball question, as they gathered the waste paper strewn about the floor into bags; and several white members played leap-frog over the desks, a much wholesomer relaxation than some of the older Senators indulge in, I fancy. Finding the coast clear, I likewise gambolled up and down, from gallery to gallery; sat in Sumner's chair, and cudgelled an imaginary Brooks within an inch of his life; examined Wilson's books in the coolest possible manner; warmed my feet at one of the national registers; read people's names on scattered envelopes, and pocketed a castaway autograph or two; watched the somewhat unparliamentary proceedings going on about me, and wondered who in the world all the sedate gentlemen were, who kept popping out of odd doors here and there, like respectable Jacks-in-the-box. Then I wandered over the [...] "palatial residence" [...] of Mrs. Columbia, and examined its many beauties, though I can't say I thought her a tidy housekeeper, and didn't admire her taste in pictures, for the eye of this humble individual soon wearied of expiring patriots, who all appeared to be quitting their earthly tabernacles in convulsions, ruffled shirts, and a whirl of torn banners, bomb shells, and buff and blue arms and legs. The statuary also was massive and concrete, but rather wearying to examine; for the colossal ladies and gentlemen, carried no cards of introduction in face or figure; so, whether the meditative party in a kilt, with well-developed legs, shoes like army slippers, and a ponderous nose, was Columbus, Cato, or Cockelorum Tibby, the tragedian, was more than I could tell. Several robust ladies attracted me; but which was America and which Pocahontas was a mystery; for all affected much looseness of costume, dishevelment of hair, swords, arrows, lances, scales, and other ornaments quite passe with damsels of our day, whose effigies should go down to posterity armed with fans, <b>crochet</b> <b>needles,</b> riding whips, and parasols, with here and there one holding pen or pencil, rolling-pin or broom. The statue of Liberty I recognized at once, for it had no pedestal as yet, but stood flat in the mud, with Young America most symbolically making dirt pies, and chip forts, in its shadow. But high above the squabbling little throng and their petty plans, the sun shone full on Liberty's broad forehead, and, in her hand, some summer bird had built its nest. I accepted the good omen then, and, on the first of January, the Emancipation Act gave the statue a nobler and more enduring pedestal than any marble or granite ever carved and quarried by human bands.|$|R
6000|$|My friend, {{though in}} easy circumstances, was {{somewhat}} old-fashioned in his notions. He never allowed his children spending money, except {{such as they}} fairly earned by some exertions of their own. [...] "Let them do something," [...] he would say, [...] "to make it fairly theirs, and their generosity will then have some significance--it is very easy for children to be generous on their parents' money." [...] Great were the comparing of resources and estimates of property at this time. Tom and Ned, who were big enough to saw wood, and hoe in the garden, had accumulated the vast sum of three dollars each, and walked about with their hands in their pockets, and talked largely of purchases, like gentlemen of substance. They thought of getting mamma a new muff, and papa a writing desk, besides trinkets innumerable for sisters, and a big doll for Ally; but after they had made one expedition to a neighboring town to inquire prices, I observed that their expectations were greatly moderated. As to little Willie, him of the checked apron, his whole earthly substance amounted to thirty-seven cents; yet {{there was not a}} member of the whole family circle, including the servants, that he could find it in his heart to leave out of his remembrance. I ingratiated myself with him immediately; and twenty times a day did I count over his money to him, and did sums innumerable to show how much would be left if he got this, that, or the other article, which he was longing to buy for father or mother. I proved to him most invaluable, by helping him to think of certain small sixpenny and fourpenny articles that would be pretty to give to sisters, making out with marbles for Tom and Ned, and a very valiant-looking sugar horse for Ally. Miss Emma had the usual resource of young ladies, flosses, worsted, and knitting, and <b>crochet</b> <b>needles,</b> and busy fingers, and she was giving private lessons daily to Eliza, to enable her to get up some napkin rings, and book marks for the all-important occasion. A gentle air of bustle and mystery pervaded the whole circle. I was intrusted with so many secrets that I could scarcely make an observation, or take a turn about the room, without being implored to [...] "remember"--"not to tell"--not to let papa know this, or mamma that. I was not to let papa know how the boys were going to buy him a new inkstand, with a pen rack upon it, which was entirely to outshine all previous inkstands; nor tell mamma about the crochet bag that Emma was knitting for her. On all sides were mysterious whisperings, and showing of things wrapped in brown paper, glimpses of which, through some inadvertence, were always appearing to the public eye. There were close counsels held behind doors and in corners, and suddenly broken off when some particular member of the family appeared. There were flutters of vanishing book marks, which were always whisked away when a door opened; and incessant ejaculations of admiration and astonishment from one privileged looker or another on things which might not be mentioned to or beheld by others.|$|R
