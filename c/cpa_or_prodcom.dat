40|$|Cell death {{suppressor}} Bax inhibitor- 1 (BI- 1), an {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane protein, {{exists in a}} wide range of organisms. The split-ubiquitin system, overlay assay, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis demonstrated that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BI- 1 (AtBI- 1) interacted with calmodulin in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in plant cells. Furthermore, AtBI- 1 failed to rescue yeast mutants lacking Ca 2 + ATPase (Pmr 1 or Spf 1) from Bax-induced cell death. Pmr 1 and Spf 1, p-type ATPases localized at the inner membrane, are believed to be involved in transmembrane movement of calcium ions in yeast. Thus, the presence of intact Ca 2 + ATPases was essential for AtBI- 1 -mediated cell death suppression in yeast. To investigate the effect of AtBI- 1 on calcium homeostasis, we evaluated sensitivity against cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase in AtBI- 1 -overexpressing or knock-down transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These plants demonstrated altered <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> ion stress sensitivity. Furthermore, AtBI- 1 -overexpressing cells demonstrated an attenuated rise in cytosolic calcium following <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> H 2 O 2 treatment, suggesting that AtBI- 1 affects ion homeostasis in plant cell death regulation...|$|R
40|$|The Ca 2 + {{buffering}} {{function of}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the resting state of arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was examined. Differences in {{the effects of}} cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin, agents which inhibit the Ca 2 +-ATPase of SR, on tension and cellular Ca 2 + level were assessed in endothelium-denuded strips of femoral arteries from 13 -week-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In resting strips preloaded with fura-PE 3, the addition of <b>CPA</b> (10 [*]μM) <b>or</b> thapsigargin (100 [*]nM) caused an elevation of cytosolic Ca 2 + level ([Ca 2 +]i) and a contraction. These responses were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. The addition of verapamil (3 [*]μM) to the resting strips caused a decrease in resting [Ca 2 +]i, which was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. In SHR, but not in WKY, this decrease {{was accompanied by a}} relaxation from the resting tone, suggesting the maintenance of myogenic tone in the SHR artery. Verapamil (3 [*]μM) abolished differences between SHR and WKY. The effects of verapamil were much greater on the contraction than on the [Ca 2 +]i. The resting Ca 2 + influx in arteries measured after a 5 [*]min incubation of the artery with 45 Ca was not increased by <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> thapsigargin in either SHR or WKY. The net Ca 2 + entry measured after a 30 [*]min incubation of the artery with 45 Ca was decreased by <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> thapsigargin in both SHR and WKY. The resting Ca 2 + influx was significantly higher in SHR than in WKY, and was decreased by nifedipine (100 [*]nM) in the SHR artery, but was unchanged in the WKY artery. The resting 45 Ca efflux from the artery was increased during the addition of CPA (10 [*]μM). This increase was less in SHR than in WKY. The resting 45 Ca efflux was the same in SHR and WKY. These results suggest that (1) the Ca 2 + influx via L-type voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels (VDCCs) was increased in the resting state of the SHR femoral artery, (2) the greater part of the increased Ca 2 + influx was buffered by Ca 2 + uptake into the SR and some Ca 2 + reached the myofilaments resulting in the maintenance of the myogenic tone, and (3) therefore the functional elimination of SR by <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> thapsigargin caused a large elevation of [Ca 2 +]i and a potent contraction in this artery. During this process, the contraction was mainly due to the basal Ca 2 + influx via L-type VDCCs. The present study also showed the existence of a relatively large compartment of [Ca 2 +]i which does not contribute to the contraction during the addition of <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> thapsigargin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The oxazaphosphorine {{cyclophosphamide}} (CPA) and ifosfamide (IFO) are two {{commonly used}} DNAalkylating agents in cancer chemotherapy. This review highlights the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics {{of the two}} important agents. As alkylating agents, CPA and IFO are usually combined with other anticancer drugs in the chemotherapy of solid tumors and hematological malignancies to obtain synergistic or additive anticancer effect due to complementary mechanism of action. Both compounds are prodrugs that are activated via 4 -hydroxylation by cytochrome P 450 s such as CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 3 A 4 to generate alkylating nitrogen mustards (phosphoramide mustard and ifosforamide mustard) and the byproduct acrolein. The resultant mustards can alkylate DNA to form DNA-DNA cross-links, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell apoptosis. Both CPA and IFO are also inactivated by N-dechloroethylation, resulting in N-dechloroethylated metabolites and the byproduct chloroacetaldehyde. Acrolein is the causative agent for hemorrhagic cystitis, whereas chloroacetaldehyde induces nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Pharmacokinetics of CPA and IFO is markedly influenced by route of administration and duration of treatment, age, comedication, liver and renal function. Large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics, clinical response rate and toxicity has been observed in cancer patients treated with <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> IFO. Resistance to <b>CPA</b> <b>or</b> IFO occurs due to decreased activation by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 B 6, increased deactivation of the agents, decreased entry into or increased efflux from tumor cells, increased cellular thiol level, increased DNA repair capacity, and/or deficient apoptotic response to DNA damage. A full understanding of factors affecting the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicology and pharmacogenetics of CPA and IFO is important to optimize the dose and regimens of CPA and IFO in cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
