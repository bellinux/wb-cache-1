50|$|Warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> {{are easily}} {{observed}} in the Gulf of Mexico or elsewhere {{through the use of}} infrared imagery by weather satellites. Since the ocean water temperature of the ring is significantly higher than the surrounding waters, these rings show up easily in infrared images. This, coupled with models of ring movement, allow well-developed tracking of the <b>rings.</b> Because warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> include warm water to a significant depth, infrared satellites can differentiate the temperature, unlike cold <b>core</b> <b>rings,</b> which cannot be easily detected.|$|R

5000|$|Many fish species’ {{life cycle}} {{involves}} two distinct habitats. The adults live in warmer temperate waters south of Cape Hatteras, NC while the juveniles {{are found in}} estuaries of cooler waters north of Cape Hatteras. Warm Core Rings {{play an important role}} in the transport of larvae between the two habitats. Species like the bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) spawn near the western edge of the Gulf Stream just south of Cape Hatteras. [...] Because of the convergence of the Gulf Stream from the south and cooler coastal water current from the north, most water around Cape Hatteras flows into the Gulf Stream. [...] The larvae released near this convergence is swept into the Gulf Stream and flows north. Since the larvae are planktonic, they don’t swim into the center of the Gulf Stream but stay near the western edge. [...] This is beneficial for when warm core rings form. Warm core rings are formed when the crest of a meander breaks off from the Gulf Stream. Any larvae in the crest of the meanders are then entrapped in the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] Once the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> breaks way, it takes a southwesternly path towards the coast. The interaction between warm core rings and the continental shelf creates a weakening of the ring and enables the larvae to escape and continue their journey to nearby estuaries. The warm core rings formed along the northeastern states can last between 4 and 5 months. [...] During this time the larvae grow so that by the time they reach the estuaries, they are able to swim away from the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> into the estuaries.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{modifications of}} the <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> system A can putatively {{be understood as}} a series of oxidation reactions to form a poly-ol B which is then further oxidized and esterified to form the ketone and acetate ester moieties seen in forskolin. However, because the biosynthetic gene cluster has not been described, this putative synthesis could be incorrect in the sequence of oxidation/esterification events, which could occur in almost any order.|$|E
50|$|A warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> {{is a type}} of {{mesoscale}} eddy which {{breaks off}} from an ocean current, e.g. the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current. The ring is an independent circulatory system of warm water which can persist for several months. The rest of this article will use the Gulf Stream by way of an example but these mesoscale eddies also form in most powerful ocean currents, such as the Kuroshio or Agulhas currents.|$|E

50|$|Warm core rings {{typically}} include {{far less}} biological specimens than the surrounding ocean. When the rings approach continental shelves, coastal currents are affected, {{which can cause}} organisms to drift onto the shelf that ordinarily would not be there. In fact, there are human accounts of sea turtles and tropical fish which normally live in much warmer waters coming near the coastal shelf due to the deep, warm waters of a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{heterocyclic ring}} is {{synthesized}} after {{the formation of}} the trans-fused carbon ring systems formed by a carbocation mediated cyclization. The remaining tertiary carbocation is quenched by a molecule of water. After deprotonation, the remaining hydroxy group is free to form the heterocyclic ring. This cyclization can occur either by attack of the alcohol oxygen onto the allylic carbocation formed by loss of diphosphate, or by an analogous SN2' like displacement of the diphosphate. [...] This forms the <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> system A of forskolin.|$|E

50|$|Warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> {{are also}} {{detected}} by sea surface height anomalies. Since warm water takes up more space as it expands than cold water, {{the large amount}} of warm water causes an upwelling in sea height which can be detected by buoys.|$|R
50|$|As the Gulf Stream {{flows and}} moves over time, it can develop large loops which can {{eventually}} be pinched {{off from the}} current, forming an independent eddy of warmer Sargasso Sea water circulating clockwise similar to {{the direction of the}} Gulf Stream. While many warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> are created in the Gulf of Mexico, they can develop anywhere along the eastern coast of the United States north of the Gulf Stream. Rings are anywhere from 100-200 km across and can include warmer waters as deep as 1500 meters. These rings develop every 6-11 months on average. However, rings in the Gulf of Mexico can last much longer and are formed at much more irregular intervals than along the eastern U.S. coast. In an active year, up to 15 warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> can form due to the Gulf Stream.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{widespread}} occurrence of the 2,5-diketopiperazine core in biologically active natural products. The most structurally diverse 2,5-diketopiperazine natural products are based on tryptophan and proline modified by heterocyclisation and isoprenyl addition. These range from the hepatoxic brevianamide F (cyclo(L-Trp-L-Pro)) to the annulated tremorogenic verruculogen and the spiro-annulated spirotryprostatin B which represent a promising class of antimitotic arrest agents, to the structurally complex (+)-stephacidin A, a bridged 2,5-diketopiperazine that possess a unique bicyclo2.2.2diazaoctane <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> system and is active against the human colon HCT-116 cell line.Other bridged 2,5-diketopiperazines include bicyclomycin, an antibacterial agent used as food additives to prevent diarrhea in animals while the thio derivatives such as the cytotoxic bridged epipolythiodioxopiperazine are represented by gliotoxin. The unsaturated derivatives are illustrated by phenylahistin the anti-cancer microtubule binding agent, and the mycotoxin roquefortine C found in blue cheeses.|$|E
50|$|While not as infamous as Katrina, Hurricane Opal most {{definitively}} {{illustrates the}} deepening abilities of a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring.</b> After crossing the Yucatan peninsula, Opal reentered the Gulf of Mexico and passed over an eddy shed by the Loop Current. Within a fourteen-hour period, sea surface pressure dropped from 965 to 916 hectaPasals, surface winds increased from 35 to 60 meters/second, and the storm condensed from a radius of 40 kilometers to 25 kilometers. Prior to the storm, the 20 °C isotherm was located {{at a depth}} between 175 and 200 meters, but was found 50 meters shallower after the storm had passed. While the majority of this hurricane induced cooling of the mixed layer was attributed to upwelling (due to Ekman divergence), another 2000 to 3000 watts/meter squared were estimated to be lost through heat flux at the air-water interface of the storm’s core. Furthermore, buoy-derived sea surface temperature readings recorded temperature dropping 2° to 3 °C as Opal passed over Gulf Common Waters, but only 0.5° to 1 °C as the storm encountered the more massive ocean mixed layer associated with the warm core eddy.|$|E

5000|$|Stephacidin A [...] and B are {{antitumor}} alkaloids {{isolated from}} the fungus Aspergillus ochraceus [...] that belong to a class of naturally occurring 2,5-diketopiperazines. [...] This unusual family of fungal metabolites are complex bridged 2,5-diketopiperazine alkaloids that possess a unique bicyclo2.2.2diazaoctane <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> system and are constituted mainly from tryptophan, proline, and substituted proline derivatives where the olefinic unit of the isoprene moiety has been formally oxidatively cyclized across the α-carbon atoms of a 2,5-diketopiperazine ring.The molecular architecture of stephacidin B, formally a dimer of avrainvillamide, reveals a complex dimeric prenylated N-hydroxyindole alkaloid that contains 15 rings and 9 stereogenic centers {{and is one of}} the most complex indole alkaloids isolated from fungi. Stephacidin B rapidly converts into the electrophilic monomer avrainvillamide in cell culture, and there is evidence that the monomer avrainvillamide interacts with intracellular thiol-containing proteins, most likely by covalent modification.Avrainvillamide, which contains a 3-alkylidene-3H-indole 1-oxide function, was identified in culture media from various strains of Aspergillus and is reported to exhibitantimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria.The avrainvillamide and stephacidins family of structurally complex anticancer natural products are active against the human colon HCT-116 cell line.The signature bicyclo2.2.2diazaoctane ring system common to these alkaloids has inspired numerous synthetic approaches.|$|E
40|$|The Gulf Stream {{is not a}} rigidly {{contained}} ocean current; it {{curves and}} meanders {{in a manner that}} causes portions of it to go unstable, breaking off to form warm core rings. These rings travel west – due to the earth’s rotation - through the Slope Sea and onto the southern New England shelfbreak, affecting various physical parameters of our coastal waters as well as the biogeochemical and ecological properties (i. e. the ‘health’) of the those waters. Where a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> lands along the east coast and the time of year it appears varies with each ring, causing each ring to have a different affect on the southern New England coastal waters. Guided by observations, a numerical model can examine multiple scenarios of ring/coastal current interactions to determine how the affect of a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> on our coastal waters changes with varying parameters. The scientific understanding gained from a well-cast hierarchy of these numerical experiments can be used as an important component for informing sustainable management of the health of our coastal waters. The numerical modeling system chosen for this study is the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). It is designed to represent realistic ocean physics by using Newton’s equations of motion, {{in the form of the}} Navier-Stokes equations, to derive the relationship between velocity, pressure, temperature and salinity for the constantly moving ocean. ROMS is first used in an attempt to recreate the seasonal cycle of circulation along the Atlantic coast of the United States, which is then further focused on the southern New England coast. Important properties of the New England coastal circulation are well represented by the model, as determined by a detailed comparison with all available observations. This realistic coastal circulation is then used as the ‘background physics’ into which a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> is numerically introduced, thus accomplishing the objectives of the study – the numerical modeling of the dynamics of warm core ring/coastal current interactions. Since ROMS is based on the Navier-Stokes equations any anomaly introduced into ROMS, such as a warm <b>core</b> <b>ring,</b> will also need to be a solution to this set of equations. Because of this the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> is assumed to be in thermal wind (geostrophic and hydrostatic) balance, which is an known to be an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, i. e. the numerically imposed warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> will be stable. A specified temperature field, using parameters based upon the observations, is used to derive the velocity, pressure and density of the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring,</b> providing a solution that ROMS recognizes and thus creating an idealized, yet reasonably realistic warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> to be used in the numerical study. The warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> is then embedded in the ROMS seasonal cycle of circulation in multiple places to determine how the different locations of warm core rings have different effects of the physical properties of the southern New England coastal shelf...|$|E

40|$|Gulf Stream (GS) {{separation}} {{near its}} observed Cape Hatteras (CH) separation location, and its ensuing path and dynamics, is a challenging ocean modeling problem. If a model GS separates much farther north than CH, then northward GS meanders, which pinch off warm <b>core</b> eddies (<b>rings),</b> are not possible or are strongly {{constrained by the}} Grand Banks shelfbreak. Cold <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> pinch off the southward GS meanders. The rings are often re-absorbed by the GS. The important warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> enhance heat exchange and, especially, affect the northern GS branch after GS bifurcation near the New England Seamount Chain. This northern branch gains heat by contact with the southern branch water upstream of bifurcation, and warms the Arctic Ocean and northern seas, thus playing {{a major role in}} ice dynamics, thermohaline circulation and possible global climate warming. These rings transport heat northward between the separated GS and shelf slope/Deep Western Boundary Current system (DWBC). This region has nearly level time mean isopycnals. The eddy heat transport convergence/divergence enhances the shelfbreak and GS front intensities and thus also increases watermass transformation. The fronts are maintained by warm advection by the Florida Current and cool advection by the DWBC. Thus, the GS interaction with the DWBC through the intermediate eddy field is climatologically important...|$|R
