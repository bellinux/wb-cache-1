60|$|But his practised eye {{was soon}} aware of {{something}} artistic in this rude object. To relieve the anxious tedium of his situation, he cleared {{away some of}} the soil, which seemed to have fallen very recently, and discovered a headless figure of marble. It was earth stained, as well it might be, and had a slightly <b>corroded</b> <b>surface,</b> but at once impressed the sculptor as a Greek production, and wonderfully delicate and beautiful. The head was gone; both arms were broken off at the elbow. Protruding from the loose earth, however, Kenyon beheld the fingers of a marble hand; it was still appended to its arm, and a little further search enabled him to find the other. Placing these limbs in what the nice adjustment of the fractures proved to be their true position, the poor, fragmentary woman forthwith showed that she retained her modest instincts to the last. She had perished with them, and snatched them back at the moment of revival. For these long-buried hands immediately disposed themselves in the manner that nature prompts, as the antique artist knew, and as all the world has seen, in the Venus de' Medici.|$|E
60|$|May 12th.--To-day we {{have been}} to the Villa Albani, to which we had a ticket of {{admission}} through the agency of Mr. Cass (the American Minister). We set out between ten and eleven o'clock, and walked through the Via Felice, the Piazza Barberini, and a long, heavy, dusty range of streets beyond, to the Porta Salara, whence the road extends, white and sunny, between two high blank walls to the gate of the villa, which is at no great distance. We were admitted by a girl, and went first to the casino, along an aisle of overshadowing trees, the branches of which met above our heads. In the portico of the casino, which extends along its whole front, there are many busts and statues, and, among them, one of Julius Caesar, representing him at an earlier period of life than others which I have seen. His aspect is not particularly impressive; {{there is a lack of}} chin, though not so much as in the older statues and busts. Within the edifice there is a large hall, not so brilliant, perhaps, with frescos and gilding as those at the Villa Borghese, but lined with the most beautiful variety of marbles. But, in fact, each new splendor of this sort outshines the last, and unless we could pass from one to another all in the same suite, we cannot remember them well enough to compare the Borghese with the Albani, the effect being more on the fancy than on the intellect. I do not recall any of the sculpture, except a colossal bas-relief of Antinous, crowned with flowers, and holding flowers in his hand, which was found in the ruins of Hadrian's Villa. This is said to be the finest relic of antiquity next to the Apollo and the Laocoon; but I could not feel it to be so, partly, I suppose, because the features of Autinous do not seem to me beautiful in themselves; and that heavy, downward look is repeated till I am more weary of it than of anything else in sculpture. We went up stairs and down stairs, and saw a good many beautiful things, but none, perhaps, of the very best and beautifullest; and second-rate statues, with the <b>corroded</b> <b>surface</b> of old marble that has been dozens of centuries under the ground, depress the spirits of the beholder. The bas-relief of Antinous has at least the merit of being almost as white and fresh, and quite as smooth, as if it had never been buried and dug up again. The real treasures of this villa, to the number of nearly three hundred, were removed to Paris by Napoleon, and, except the Antinous, not one of them ever came back.|$|E

40|$|The time {{evolution}} of microscopic topography on <b>corroding</b> a luminum <b>surfaces</b> during oxide film passivation was characterized. Passivation was studied after galvanostatic etching in IN HCI at 65 ~ in both a luminum etch tunnels (by scanning electron microscopy) and micron-size cubic etch pits (by atomic force microscopy). Step reductions of applied current initiated passivation. At times of 1 to 300 ms after current steps, the <b>corroding</b> <b>surface</b> was microscopically heterogeneous, {{consisting of a}} number of small corroding patches 0. 1 to i pure in width, wh ich were surrounded by passive surface. As some patches grew by dissolution, others were passivated, until eventually only one patch remained on the pit or tunnel surface. The topography of the <b>corroding</b> <b>surface</b> was controlled by the potential: the surface dissolved uniformly at the repassivation potential Ea, while partial passivation to produce patches occurred at potentials more cathodic than E~. Patches were unstable at potentials be low ER and wou ld ultimately passivate. Topographic evolution during passivation was very similar for pits as for tunnels, except that the t ime scale of the process is much longer for tunnels than for pits (200 - 300 ms vs. 11 - 20 ms). The difference of t ime scales was due to the different <b>corroding</b> <b>surface</b> areas of pits and tunnels. Patches are probably defined by a surface layer wh ich inhibits passivation. Passivation is the process by wh ich a film covers a sur-face, and inhibits dissolution of the underlying material...|$|R
60|$|April 14th.--Yesterday {{afternoon}} I drove with Mr. and Mrs. Story and Mr. Wilde to see {{a statue}} of Venus, which has just been discovered, outside of the Porta Portese, {{on the other side}} of the Tiber. A little distance beyond the gate we came to the entrance of a vineyard, with a wheel-track through the midst of it; and, following this, we soon came to a hillside, in which an excavation had been made with the purpose of building a grotto for keeping and storing wine. They had dug down into what seemed to be an ancient bathroom, or some structure of that kind, the excavation being square and cellar-like, and built round with old subterranean walls of brick and stone. Within this hollow space the statue had been found, and it was now standing against one of the walls, covered with a coarse cloth, or a canvas bag. This being removed, there appeared a headless marble figure, earth-stained, of course, and with a slightly <b>corroded</b> <b>surface,</b> but wonderfully delicate and beautiful, the shape, size, and attitude, apparently, of the Venus de' Medici, but, as we all thought, more beautiful than that. It is supposed to be the original, from which the Venus de' Medici was copied. Both arms were broken off, but the greater part of both, and nearly the whole of one hand, had been found, and these being adjusted to the figure, they took the well-known position before the bosom and the middle, as if the fragmentary woman retained her instinct of modesty to the last. There were the marks on the bosom and thigh where the fingers had touched; whereas in the Venus de' Medici, if I remember rightly, the fingers are sculptured quite free of the person. The man who showed the statue now lifted from a corner a round block of marble, which had been lying there among other fragments, and this he placed upon the shattered neck of the Venus; and behold, it was her head and face, perfect, all but the nose! Even in spite of this mutilation, it seemed immediately to light up and vivify the entire figure; and, whatever I may heretofore have written about the countenance of the Venus de' Medici, I here record my belief that that head has been wrongfully foisted upon the statue; at all events, it is unspeakably inferior to this newly discovered one. This face has a breadth and front which are strangely deficient in the other. The eyes are well opened, most unlike the buttonhole lids of the Venus de' Medici; the whole head is so much larger as to entirely obviate the criticism that has always been made on the diminutive head of the De' Medici statue. If it had but a nose! They ought to sift every handful of earth that has been thrown out of the excavation, for the nose and the missing hand and fingers must needs be there; and, if they were found, the effect would be like the reappearance of a divinity upon earth. Mutilated as we saw her, it was strangely interesting to be present at the moment, as it were, when she had just risen from her long burial, and was shedding the unquenchable lustre around her which no eye had seen for twenty or more centuries. The earth still clung about her; her beautiful lips were full of it, till Mr. Story took a thin chip of wood and cleared it away from between them.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to detect and characterize localized corrosion in 2024 T 3 Aluminum alloy using non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Ultrasonic lamb wave inspection and fractal geometry are the two NDE techniques considered to detect and characterize <b>corroded</b> <b>surfaces</b> in aluminum plates respectively. Lamb wave scanning approach requires generation of ultrasonic So mode Lamb wave using an incident transducer with a tone burst centered at a near non-dispersive frequency. A receiving transducer scans the sections of the thin plate along a line parallel to the propagating lamb wave {{on the face of}} plate free from defect. Corrosion damage is localized by comparing relative normalized wave energy the propagating wave in a plate with damage with that of relative normalized energy variation of propagating wave in a plate without any damage. To demonstrate Lamb wave approach experiments were performed on 1. 6 mm-thick Al plates with corrosion induced artificially using FeCl 3 solution. Fractal geometry is a NDE technique to characterize <b>corroded</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a parameter called the fractal dimension. Image analysis was performed by obtaining microscopic and macroscopic digitized images of the <b>corroded</b> aluminum alloy <b>surface.</b> Box-counting algorithm was implemented on binary images to obtain fractal dimension, a parameter used to characterize corrosion.

40|$|Passivation of <b>corroding</b> <b>surfaces</b> in {{aluminum}} etch pits and tunnels was investigated by step reductions and cathodic pulses in applied etching current. Morphology study shows that, {{in the early}} stage of passivation, the <b>corroding</b> <b>surface</b> consisted of recessed patches, which are actively dissolving surface, and flat passive area. These active patches are found within the potential range between the potential of zero charge (E[subscript]PZC) and the repassivation potential, and the actively corroding area increases with potential, from zero near E[subscript]PZC to the entire surface at the repassivation potential. A mathematical model describing the progress of passivation was developed and compared to experimental measurements. The calculation indicated that patchwise passivation takes place in times less than 100 [mu]s and the fractional active area {{is a function of}} potential below the repassivation potential. It thus suggests that the patches are islands of specifically adsorbed chloride ions, so that the passivation is controlled by desorption of these ions.

40|$|The {{early stages}} of oxide film {{passivation}} of <b>corroding</b> <b>surfaces</b> in aluminum etch tunnels and pits were investigated. Passivation was initiated by step reductions in applied current. A mathematical model for passivation was used to predict experimentally measured potential transients during the first millisecond after the current step. The experimental transients had a characteristic potential undershoot at about 70 μs after the current step; according to the model, the undershoot was {{directly related to the}} partial coverage of the <b>corroding</b> <b>surface</b> with an oxide layer. The time and extent of the undershoot were in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions, suggesting that the fractional actively dissolving area in the pit at these times is a linear function of potential and adjusts rapidly to changes of the potential. This reconfiguration of the active area occurs at times when the extent of passive film formation is still small.

Under these conditions, we observed the initial formation of 'green rust' (hydroxychlorides and/or hydroxycarbonates), followed by the formation of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and then a mixture of the alpha- and gamma-FeOOH (goethite and lepidocrocite, respectively). These data are consistent with a model for corrosion during which the initially formed magnetite is either covered, or replaced, by layers of the FeOOH oxidation products. Fitting of the data {{as a function of}} time and potential shows that, although the product range is independent of potential, the relative kinetics of formation of magnetite and its subsequent conversion to the gamma-FeOOH were potential and time dependent. Analysis by mapping of the dry <b>corroded</b> <b>surface</b> showed a variety of species, including green rust, some Fe(OH) (3), as well as the gamma-FeOOH, and possibly some beta-FeOOH. But no surface magnetite was found, indicating that this material had been either covered up or converted to FeOOH. We noted several complications during this work, including the interference of resonance effects (on the Raman intensities) and the heterogeneity of the corrosion process (and hence distribution of species on the <b>corroded</b> <b>surface).</b> However, we believe that the use of un-enhanced Raman methods has led to conclusions more likely to be relevant to 'real' corrosion processes.
