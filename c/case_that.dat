30|$|Figure 3 {{also shows}} that the {{participation}} of lawyers in settlements is larger. This indicates that some lawyers have only participated in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> have been settled through an agreement. Also note that {{the tail of the}} distribution of participation in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> were lost is heavier than participation in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> were won. Intuitively, it is more “easy” (common) to lose a case than to win a case. In addition, the tail of the distribution of participation of lawyers in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> were settled is even heavier—it is more “easy” (common) to settle a case than to lose a case. This analysis indicates that lawyers do participate in many cases both winning and losing, and thus this could give rise to an interesting network.|$|R
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> p, it is at least the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
