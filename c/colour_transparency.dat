50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1970, Wyn Hobson decided to found a circle where {{photographs}} of the modern traction done with creativity could be discussed and to further the use and acceptance of a more artistic approach to the subject. Accordingly, he wrote to sixty photographers whose work with modern traction had been appearing in the railway media {{over the last five}} or six years to see if they were amenable to the idea.The PRPC commenced operations in the spring of 1971 and towards the end of 1972 a sufficiently large nucleus of interested members existed {{for the creation of a}} small <b>Colour</b> <b>Transparency</b> Portfolio running in parallel with the main black-and-white folios. Since then, the circle has published several books and its work has appeared in a number of publications and many public exhibitions including a 2005 display at the National Railway Museum in York. The circle currently consists of 35 members, many of whom are among the UK's most well known railway photographers and is extremely active today, photographing the current railway scene in the UK and abroad. Members circulate portfolos of prints, slides and digital images amongst the membership and comment on each other's work in an attempt to improve each other's photographs.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of nuclear transparency in hard nuclear reactions is studied by {{an expansion of}} the correlator of the hard scattering operator on a hadronic basis. <b>Colour</b> <b>transparency</b> appears as an effect of interference between the amplitudes corresponding to the final state interaction of different intermediate baryonic states. We find that <b>colour</b> <b>transparency</b> occurs even at moderate momentum transfers if one chooses the missing momentum of the struck nucleon by appropriate kinematics. In general, the role of the Fermi-motion is found to be crucial; without it, any effect of anomalous nuclear transparency would be impossible. 1 On leave from Moscow University, Moscow, Russian Federation 1 The concept of <b>colour</b> <b>transparency</b> [1 - 5] has attracted great interest {{in the past few years}} (see, for example, [6 - 10]).

Forty patients were photographed, giving a total of 75 eyes including non-diabetic eyes as controls. Images were graded according to the validated European guidelines. There was exact agreement between grades obtained from both the 2 field 45 degrees 35 mm <b>colour</b> <b>transparencies</b> and digital images in 93. 3 % (70 / 75) of eyes, with Cohen's Kappa statistic for the comparison being 0. 92. Overall, when grading from the digital images 5. 3 % (4 / 75) eyes were undergraded with three cases of sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) graded as non-sight threatening (NSTDR) (3 / 48, 6. 3 %). One eye was overgraded (1 / 75, 1. 3 %). Two of the three cases of STDR undergraded as NSTDR had small numbers of intra-retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) discernible on the <b>colour</b> <b>transparencies</b> but which were not visible from the digital image. The third had multiple small cotton wool spots graded as laser photocoagulation scars from the digital images. In conclusion there is good to excellent agreement between retinopathy grades using the Canon CR 5 digital retinal imaging system compared to 35 mm <b>colour</b> <b>transparencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Retinal {{photography}} is {{an adjunct to}} ophthalmoscopy in screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Digital retinal cameras allow a retinal image to be displayed immediately on a high resolution video display monitor. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the agreement in retinopathy grading from digitized images in comparison to original <b>colour</b> <b>transparencies</b> as 35 mm slides. One hundred and fifty macula-centred, 45 degree, non-stereoscopic retinal images were digitized onto CD ROM by Kodak at base resolution of 768 x 512 pixels. The anonymized images were displayed on a 17 " monitor running Windows at 800 x 600 resolution in 64, 000 colours (PC images) and graded in random order. Alternatively the transparencies were graded on a Slidex viewer. A quality control set were also graded with exact agreement in 93 % of cases (91 % (73 / 80) of PC images and 94 % (75 / 80) of slide images). Compared to <b>colour</b> <b>transparencies,</b> 95 % (84 / 88) of sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) and 100 % (62 / 62) of non-STDR cases were diagnosed using the PC.
