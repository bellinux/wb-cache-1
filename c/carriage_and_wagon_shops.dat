50|$|Under Robinson, new {{erecting}} shops were built, {{and the old}} erecting shop (the original <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>shops)</b> {{were converted}} into machine and fitting shops, {{and the construction of}} a new carriage and wagon works at Dukinfield in 1910 enabled additional locomotive work to be carried out in the former <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Met (Metropolitan) Shed was put {{together}} in 1932 following the demolition of the Roundhouse. The front half {{was part of the}} original 1850 running shed whilst the rear was formed by the 1862 extension to the <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops.</b> It housed the tank engines and locomotives which worked the inner and outer suburban services from Kings Cross.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1880s it {{was clear}} that further {{expansion}} at Nine Elms would be impossible. The <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops</b> were therefore transferred to Eastleigh in Hampshire in 1891, allowing for the temporary expansion of the locomotive works and the nearby motive power depot. Ultimately the locomotive works were transferred to Eastleigh between 1908 and December 1909.|$|E
50|$|But by 1861 the Midland {{had decided}} that they wanted their own Goods and Minerals Station, which they {{subsequently}} built at Agar Town. When they left the Great Northern took the Roundhouse over as a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shop,</b> <b>and</b> then as a running shed for their tank locos. In 1931 it was demolished and the tracks were then used for open air stabling until the Met Shed was built.|$|R
50|$|Other major {{construction}} {{during the}} 1900 expansion period include the huge Boiler <b>Shop,</b> (R.14), <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Shop</b> (R.12) <b>and</b> Machine and Erecting Shop (R.13)on the southern {{side of the}} traverser, and a new Smithy (R.7), Store (R.6), Foundry (R.8), Forge and Pattern Shop (R.9) on the northern side. Buildings such as the Blacksmiths Shop (R.7) and the Foundry (R.8) were about three times bigger than the earlier buildings. Some of the construction work was done by contract but some was also done by day labour with up to 360 men employed, the average being 100.|$|R

50|$|A small {{establishment}} for {{the maintenance}} of the company's locomotives was built at Tuxford; it employed about 130 men; only four locomotives could be maintained at once. Nearby there were <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops</b> which could handle four carriages and 20 wagons simultaneously. The loco works was kept fully utilised by the GCR, but the LNER closed it in May 1927.|$|E
50|$|In 1880 Sacré's Carriage and Wagon Superintendent, Thomas Parker {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of new <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops</b> on the site thereby enabling the original shops to be converted into a new enlarged Erecting shop the following year. Following Sacré's retirement and suicide in 1889, Parker took over as Locomotive Superintendent until his own retirement in 1893. He was responsible for {{the construction of}} a new machine shop and stores in 1889, and the enlargement of the motive power depot to accommodate 120 locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{motive power}} depot at Gorton, {{in the form}} of a roundhouse was unique in that it had two roads instead of the customary one with a pillar in the centre supporting the glazed roof. It was later replaced by a larger facility but was converted to a smithy. The locomotive workshops were adjacent to the roundhouse on its Western side, with the <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops</b> and a paint shop on the other side of the loco shops. A reservoir was constructed adjacent to the nearby Ashton Canal.|$|E
50|$|However, {{around this}} area, {{there were several}} dozen villages more or less prosperous, such as Mallickerbaag, Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara, Bhabanipur, Ghoshpara Chandua and Kampa. This area was opened to {{development}} in 1862, when the Sealdaha Kusthia Broad Gauge Railway Line, and the 1863 construction of a 132000 m² locomotive workshop and railway station on the northernmost tip of Bizpur Mouza, were completed by the Eastern Bengal State Railway. In 1914 a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shop</b> were added. Subsequently, a planned Railway Township was laid and built to the East & South West of the Workshops {{with a wide range}} of infrastructure - roads, drains, bridges, street lights, internal Railway lines, parks, Institutes, Administrative Buildings, Technical School, Hospital, Co-operative shopping stores, Bazaar, playgrounds for football, Tennis, golf, theatres attached to each institute (Hindmarsh, Institute, Bell Institute, Spalding Institute), Officers’ Club etc. The resulting population increase caused the construction of huts and pucca buildings, necessitating laying out Municipal infrastructure beyond the Railway area.|$|R
50|$|Then {{plans to}} use the new site for the {{locomotive}} running shed were abandoned. The idea of moving the engine sheds to Newmarket from the Auckland Railway Station was mooted as early as 1912, and cited as {{one of the reasons why}} the Parnell Tunnel would have to be duplicated. General Manager E. H. Hiley reported on 1 August 1914 that because its reclaimed land at Mechanics Bay would all be required for an extension of the station yard and other traffic sidings, the locomotive depot would be sited on reclaimed land in Hobson Bay and that the land that had been designated for this purpose at Newmarket would be used to extend the workshops. The extension of the Newmarket site was delayed by the war, but the land was eventually used for the construction of a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> workshop, which freed space in some of the other workshops for locomotive maintenance. It was reported on 21 July 1916 that work on the new workshops was well underway, and the new buildings were ready for use towards the end of the year. They included a timber drying shed, a wood mill, a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shop,</b> a lifting shop, a blacksmiths' shop, a tarpaulin shop and a trimming shop.|$|R

5000|$|Newburgh (...) , {{formerly}} an incorporated village, {{retains the}} status of a designated place in the Canadian census data. It is situated on the Napanee River, and was first founded in 1822 by Benjamin Files and Wm. V. P. Detlor. It quickly became a thriving community and home to numerous mills. Two saw mills were first built along the river in 1822 and 1825, followed by a grist mill in 1828, two flour mills in 1840, an oatmeal mill in 1861, two carding mills and a woollen mill in 1864. Other businesses such as a tannery, two axe factories, a sash, blind and door factory, a hub and rake factory, three <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>shops</b> and two cabinet factories were also established.|$|E
