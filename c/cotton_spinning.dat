40|$|ABSTRACT: The garment {{stretch and}} {{recovery}} characteristics due to body movements can be indirectly assessed by the dynamic elastic recovery (DER) value of the fabrics at different extension levels. In order to study DER of elastic fabrics, a comparative analysis was made between spandex-plated cotton fabric and spandex core <b>cotton</b> <b>spun</b> (SCCS) fabric. It {{was found that the}} spandex-plated cotton fabric has higher DER value than that of SCCS fabric. The results of this study show that this phenomenon is due to the residual energy of the elastane unraveled from these fabrics. The stress values of these fabrics have no significant effect at 95 % confidence level. It is concluded that the spandex-plated cotton fabric is suitable than SCCS fabric, for the tight fit garments meant for the sports like Javelin, shot-put, and athletics.

5|$|Royton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> {{to be carried}} out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> for mass production for the global market. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the cotton factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre. The Manchester, Oldham and Royton Railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged {{of the largest and most}} productive mill town in the world) had begun to encroach upon Royton's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E

When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{fewer than}} a dozen mills are still standing, the {{majority}} of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres.

5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Royton's {{economy was}} closely tied {{with that of}} Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in {{as early as the}} 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{textiles}} and related trades {{were the main}} source of employment in the town. Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25bleachers around Salford, most {{to the west of the}} township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other {{textiles and}} to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.|$|E
5|$|The first mill on the site, Old Mill, {{was begun}} in 1797, {{and is the}} world's oldest {{surviving}} urban steam-powered <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> factory. After Old Mill opened, the company continued to expand and prosper, and by 1806 the complex was {{the largest in the}} world, employing about 1,000 people at its peak: Decker Mill was opened in 1802, New Mill in 1804, Little Mill in 1822, and Doubling and Fireproof Mill in 1842. The main complex formed a quadrangle surrounding a private canal basin linked under the road to the Rochdale Canal, which opened in 1804. The canal basin was used to deliver raw cotton and coal and to transport spun cotton away from the complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} cotton mills in Manchester itself reached {{a peak of}} 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided {{with the rise of}} the city as the {{financial}} centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing {{in other parts of the}} world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{spinning}} mills {{are mainly}} built around {{open end spinning}} techniques using rotors or ring spinning techniques using spindles.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the {{technology}} of cotton-spinning machinery improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The profitability of <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built weavers' cottages. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two water powered cotton factories (two or three times the size of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from Yorkshire and Lancashire looking for employment in the cotton mills.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning.</b> In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Supplies of {{raw cotton}} from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of the Crompton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Shaw and Crompton. Although the industry endured, as imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Shaw and Crompton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the final cotton was spun in Shaw and Crompton in 1989, in Lilac and Park mills. Of the 48 cotton mills that have occupied Shaw and Crompton, only six are still standing, all of which are now used as distribution centres.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTotal and lobar {{depositions}} of fungal {{particles in}} the human lung were calculated for the workers in a <b>cotton</b> <b>spin</b> factory using {{an updated version of}} the Monte Carlo transport and deposition code IDEAL. The study is based on nasal breathing under light exercises activity with a standard functional residual capacity (FRC) of 3300 ml, tidal volume (VT) of 1250 ml and breathing frequency (f) of 20 min− 1. The present calculation is based on our previous measurements of the size distribution of fungal {{particles in the}} <b>cotton</b> <b>spin</b> factory using six-stage Andersen impactor as a viable sampler. The measurements were carried out in the two main working departments: carding department (Dept 1) as a model for high dust concentration area and spinning department (Dept 2) as a model for low dust concentration area. It was found that the total deposition of fungal particles is higher in the carding and blowing department (Dept 1) than that in the spinning department (Dept 2). For lobar deposition, {{it was found that the}} deposition of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium has the highest deposition in the RL and LL lobes. These predictions show two distinct deposition maxima at the bronchial and the acinar regions with the highest deposition being in the acinar region. In all cases, the deposition reaches its maximum at generation 12 in the bronchial region and at generation 22 in the acinar region. The results reveal a positive relationship between the deposition of biological particles and some respiratory diseases...|$|R
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution, the River Beal was used to power large weaving mills. Within one {{generation}} during the late-19th century, and following a boom in nearby Oldham, Milnrow's staple industry changed from wool weaving to <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning.</b> Soon, distinctive rectangular brick-built mills dominated Milnrow's landscape. Milnrow, the location of some of the earliest ring spinning companies, had many of the characteristics of a company town. The Heaps of Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E
5|$|The boomtown of Chadderton {{reached its}} {{industrial}} zenith in the 1910s, with over 50cotton mills within the town limits. A social {{consequence of this}} industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts {{to increase the efficiency}} and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.|$|E
