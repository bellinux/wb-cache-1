50|$|Flat track racing looks {{similar to}} Speedway racing but {{is in no}} way related. Flat track {{motorcycles}} can have either <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> engines in amateur competition. Flat track bikes have front and rear suspension, and rear brakes. The brakes are what make it completely distinct from speedway, as the brakes allow for a different cornering technique. Four-stroke motorcycles dominate professional competition and depending on the venue, can be single or multi-cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{propulsion}} systems generally {{consist of a}} motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, {{and there have been}} attempts to utilize them to power commercial vessels (see NS Savannah).|$|R
5000|$|Motocross — Such bikes (once called [...] "scramblers") are raced on short, closed {{off-road}} tracks with {{a variety}} of obstacles. The motorcycles have a small fuel tank for lightness and compactness. Long-travel suspension allows riders to take jumps at high speed. Motocross engines are usually single-cylinder <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> units, which vary in size from 50cc up to about 650cc. Motocross sidecar outfits have bigger engines, usually four-stroke and often twin-cylinder. Motocross bikes are also used in freestyle motocross.|$|R

Recent development in liquified natural gas (LNG) fueled engines are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages.|$|R
25|$|MotoGP, {{the premier}} class of GP {{motorcycle}} racing, {{has changed dramatically}} in recent years. From the mid-1970s through to 2001, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc displacement with a maximum of four cylinders, {{regardless of whether the}} engine was a <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke.</b> Consequently, all machines were two-strokes, due to the greater power output for a given engine capacity. Some two- and three-cylinder two-stroke 500s were seen, but though they had a minimum-weight advantage under the rules, typically attained higher corner speed and could qualify well, they lacked the power of the four-cylinder machines.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle {{engines are}} {{typically}} <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> internal combustion engines, but other engine types (such as Wankels and electric motors) {{have been used}} in small numbers. Although some mopeds had friction drive to the front tyre, a motorcycle engine invariably drives the rear wheel, power being sent to the driven wheel by belt, chain or shaft [...] Most engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy tourers [...] and sidecar motorcycles. [...] Gear changes are normally effected using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers. Some bikes have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines may be {{designed}} as either <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> They were originally {{used as a}} more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines. Since the 1910s they {{have been used in}} submarines and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, heavy equipment and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few automobiles. Since the 1970s, the use of diesel engines in larger on-road and off-road vehicles in the US increased. According to the British Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders, the EU average for diesel cars accounts for 50% of the total sold, including 70% in France and 38% in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, the Husqvarna {{motorcycle}} division (not {{the other}} {{arms of the}} brand such as chainsaw production) was sold to Italian motorcycle manufacturer Cagiva and became part of MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. The motorcycles, widely known as [...] "Huskies"/ [...] "Husky", were then produced in Varese. Husqvarna produces a diverse range of motocross, enduro and supermoto machines using their own <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> engines, ranging in capacity from 125 cc to 576 cc. Racing continues to be important to Husqvarna, competing in world enduro and world supermoto championships. Gerald Delepine, riding a Husqvarna SMR660, became supermoto world champion in 2005. In 2008, Adrien Chareyre took the title, riding an SM530RR.|$|R

50|$|Full-size diesel engines, such {{as those}} found in a truck, are fuel {{injected}} and either <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke.</b> They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring any external ignition source. A fundamental feature of such engines, unlike petrol (gasoline) engines, is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately. Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for charge-air compression. The carburetor supplies a mixture of fuel and air into the engine, with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power. Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has {{more in common with}} a small <b>two-stroke</b> motorcycle <b>or</b> lawnmower engine.|$|R
5000|$|Marine {{steam engines}} {{were the first}} {{mechanical}} engines used in marine propulsion, however they have mostly been replaced by <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers. Nuclear reactors to power commercial vessels has not been adopted by the marine industry.

Development in liquefied natural gas (LNG) fueled engines are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages. Stirling engines, which are more efficient, quieter, smoother running producing less harmful emissions than diesel engines, propel a number of small submarines. The Stirling engine has yet to be upscaled for larger surface ships.|$|R
50|$|Facing {{tightening}} emissions regulations, in 1997, the A.M.A. {{increased the}} allowable displacement capacity for four-stroke engines, {{in an effort}} to encourage manufacturers to develop environmentally friendlier four-stroke machines. In 2006, the 250 cc division was renamed the MX Class, with an engine formula allowing for 150-250 cc <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> 250-450 cc <b>four-stroke</b> machines. The 125 cc class was renamed the MX Lites Class, allowing 0-125 cc <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> 150-250 cc <b>four-stroke</b> engines. In 2009, the MX class was renamed the 450 Class and the MX Lites class was renamed the 250 Class, to reflect the fact that all the competing manufacturers had adopted four-stroke machinery.|$|R

The enormous power advantage of the twice as large displacement four-stroke engine over the half the size two-stroke meant that by the following season, no two-stroke bikes were racing. In 2007, the maximum engine capacity was reduced to 800cc without reducing the existing weight restriction.|$|R
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke.</b> Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|R
50|$|The free-piston linear generator's great {{versatility}} {{comes from}} {{the absence of a}} crankshaft, removing a great pumping loss, giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be <b>two-stroke</b> engine <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> engine. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to propel the piston through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the <b>two-strokes</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Full-size diesel engines, such {{as those}} found in a truck, are fuel {{injected}} and either <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke.</b> They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring an applied ignition source.

Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for compression.

Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has {{more in common with}} a small <b>two-stroke</b> motorcycle <b>or</b> lawnmower engine. In addition to this, model diesels have variable compression ratios. This variable compression is achieved by a [...] "contra-piston," [...] {{at the top of the}} cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed [...] "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead centre is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.|$|R
40|$|Currently the {{increase}} in fuel costs {{and the need to}} reduce CO 2 emissions have encouraged the search for even more efficient solutions to be adopted in energy conversion systems for ship installations. These systems generally include thermal prime movers consisting mainly of <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> diesel engines, a waste heat recovery (WHR) plant, a steam turbine and possibly a gas turbine, as well as electric machinery. These components may be used in various ways and through different plant configurations, whose optimization is under investigation by researchers and diesel engine manufacturers. In this paper four schemes of ship propulsion plants, using a two-stroke diesel engine equipped with waste heat recovery system are presented, analyzed and compared by simulation. Some of the considered layouts can include also an electric motor to support the main engine in providing power to the propeller. On the other hand the electric power can be generated from both the diesel generators and the WHR plant. The considered propulsion plant schemes are compared in order to identify the configuration that meets in the best way the request of propulsive, electrical and thermal power of a 158000 dead weight tonnes DWT crude oil tanker ship, belonging to Premuda company, taken as a reference unit in this study. The comparison is carried out taking into account the payback time of the installation, the annual saving in the fuel outlay and the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This last parameter is considered through the evaluation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of power {{generated}} by an engine {{is determined by the}} {{maximum amount of}} air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a <b>two-stroke</b> engine <b>or</b> <b>four-stroke</b> design, volumetric efficiency, losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed (RPM). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication. Valves, pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as 'valve float', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10 m/s.|$|R
50|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis of}} the actual <b>four-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycles</b> {{is not a simple}} task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.|$|R
50|$|SCORE Class 20: 125cc <b>or</b> smaller <b>two-stroke</b> and 250cc <b>or</b> smaller <b>four-stroke</b> motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new MotoGP era in 2002, 500 cc <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> 990 cc <b>four-stroke</b> bikes were specified to race. The enormous power advantage of the twice as large displacement four-stroke engine over the half the size two-stroke meant that by the following season, no two-stroke bikes were racing. In 2007, the maximum engine capacity was reduced to 800 cc without reducing the existing weight restriction. MotoGP-class motorcycles are not restricted to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; the weight of the extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|R

5000|$|An {{example is}} {{lubricating}} oil for <b>four-stroke</b> <b>or</b> four-cycle internal combustion engines {{such as those}} used in portable electricity generators and [...] "walk behind" [...] lawn mowers. Another example is two-stroke oil for lubrication of <b>two-stroke</b> <b>or</b> two-cycle internal combustion engines found in snow blowers, chain saws, model air planes, gasoline powered gardening equipment like hedge trimmers, leaf blowers and soil cultivators. Often, these motors are not exposed to as wide service temperature ranges as in vehicles, so these oils may be single viscosity oils.|$|R
5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} <b>four-stroke</b> <b>or</b> <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle.</b> [...] Their normal {{operation}} was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression <b>cycle</b> afterwards. A <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate scavenge air valve.|$|R
