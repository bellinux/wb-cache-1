40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) characteristics of agr-titanium sheets in a bromine-methanol solution have been studied in the annealed and <b>cold-rolled</b> conditions using longitudinal and transverse specimens. The times to failure for annealed longitudinal specimens were longer than those for similarly tested transverse specimens. The <b>cold-rolled</b> specimens developed resistance to SCC, but failed by cleavage when notched, unlike the intergranular separation in annealed titanium. The apparent activation energy {{was found to be}} texture dependent and was in the range 30 to 51 kJ mol– 1 for annealed titanium, and 15 kJ mol– 1 for <b>cold-rolled</b> titanium. The dependence of SCC behaviour on the texture is related to the changes in the crack initiation times. These are caused by changes in the passivation and repassivation characteristics of the particular thickness plane. The thickness planes are identified with the help of X-ray pole figures obtained on annealed and <b>cold-rolled</b> material. On the basis of the activation energy and the electrochemical measurements, the mechanism of SCC in annealed titanium is identified to be the one involving stress-aided anodic dissolution.

The texture of the phase in the hot-rolled and annealed sheet had a strong -fiber texture, and this was stable even in <b>cold-rolled</b> and annealed sheet.
