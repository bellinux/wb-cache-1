40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} general {{mechanism}} for the construction of codes and to extract general properties of <b>classes</b> of <b>codes.</b> This mechanism makes it unnecessary to study various <b>classes</b> of <b>codes</b> separately [...] at least to some extent [...] by different constructions and properties.;To achieve this goal, the mechanism of characterizing classes of languages by binary relations is studied. Some general properties related to binary relations and languages are obtained. Moreover, three new <b>classes</b> of <b>codes,</b> n-shuffle codes, solid codes, and intercodes are constructed. Solid codes and intercodes have the synchronous decoding property which is very useful in the design of circuits of coders and decoders.;The studies of codes, n-codes, and intercodes indicate that these three <b>classes</b> of <b>codes</b> cannot be characterized by binary relations. We introduce a more general mechanism, that is, to characterize classes of languages by finitary relations. This mechanism can be used to characterize more classes of languages, such as the classes of n-codes and intercodes. Sometimes, it is difficult to show inclusion relations between <b>classes</b> of <b>codes</b> and hierarchy properties of <b>classes</b> of <b>codes.</b> Results derived in this thesis provide a mechanism which can simplify this task...|$|R

In this contribution an algorithmic method testing whether a convolutional code over an Abelian group admits a systematic or a minimal homomorphic encoder is provided. This test consists in verifying whether a subgroup splits in a group. Through this method, the <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> admitting systematic encoders and the <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> admitting minimal encoders can be compared. Finally this test is applied to some examples of practical relevance...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{construction}} of a family of erasure correcting codes for distributed storage systems that achieve low repair bandwidth and low repair complexity. The construction is based on two <b>classes</b> of <b>codes,</b> where the primary goal of the first <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> is to achieve a good fault tolerance, while the second <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> aims at reducing the repair bandwidth and the repair complexity. The repair procedure is a two-step procedure where parts of the failed node are repaired in the first step using the first code. The downloaded symbols during the first step are cached in the memory and used to repair the remaining erased data symbols at no additional read cost during the second step of the repair process. The first <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> is based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes modified using piggybacks, while the second <b>class</b> of <b>codes</b> is designed {{to reduce the number of}} additional symbols that need to be downloaded to repair the remaining erased symbols. We show that the proposed codes achieve better repair bandwidth compared to MDS, Piggyback, and local reconstruction codes, while a better repair complexity is achieved when compared to MDS, Zigzag, and Piggyback codes...|$|R

We give an actual construction algorithm, and explain the principles behind it. We handle a few specific examples in detail.

We detect 29 code smells in 9 releases of Azureus and in 13 releases of Eclipse, {{and study the}} relation between <b>classes</b> with these <b>code</b> smells and <b>class</b> change-proneness. We show that, in almost all releases of Azureus and Eclipse, <b>classes</b> with <b>code</b> smells are more change-prone than others, and that specific smells are more correlated than others to change-proneness.
