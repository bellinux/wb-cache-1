His debut {{came in a}} 1–0 win away to Northwich Victoria on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008. Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying [...] "It will put the added responsibility on me to start shooting and take some pressure off the forwards. If the midfield <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> goals as well, then {{that will help the}} team". He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against Weymouth in a 1–0 home win on 11 October 2008, coming from a low right-footed shot into the corner from 25yards.|$|E

On arrival, Celestia takes them to a grand hall with stained-glass windows, including one heralding the ponies' defeat of Nightmare Moon, and to the vault where the Elements of Harmony are kept. Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named , the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue (the Draconequus statue that stood in the sculpture garden). But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony (as they previously did to defeat Nightmare Moon) to defeat Discord. However, as she offers the Elements to them, they are shocked to find that the box that normally holds the Elements is completely empty.|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It {{is going to be}} very cinematic and about as non-linear as you <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> <b>Some</b> levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E

2500|$|In Don Quixote, {{there are}} {{basically}} {{two different types}} of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, {{while the rest of the}} roles speak a modern version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource – he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.) ...|$|E
