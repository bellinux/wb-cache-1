5|$|In 1942, {{the campus}} became a War Information Center, one of 140 in the nation. The center was {{established}} to boost civilian morale and practice air raid drills. Rationing on campus of sugar, gas, soft drinks, and paper became common throughout the war. Classes were cut back due to the limited staff and the <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> shifted to more scientific and technological emphasis. The majority of the sports were canceled {{during the war and}} various drives were held to increase supplies sent to troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{membership}} {{dropped to}} a low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program underwent a transformation to reflect the changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted to be focused on the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons were in existence and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.|$|E

5|$|Business <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> first {{offered at}} the Massachusetts Agricultural College {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century, {{expanding}} rapidly during the 1930s and 1940s in response to student demand. The Board of Trustees established the School of Business Administration in 1947, and within seven years, it was conferring graduate degrees, including doctorates after 1967. The school was accredited at the undergraduate level by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in May 1958, and in March 1959, the Board of Trustees authorized the establishment of four academic departments within the school: Accounting, General Business and Finance, Management, and Marketing. In September 1967, a program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{curriculum}} was widened {{so that it}} comprised reading, writing, arithmetic, English, mathematics, history, geography, Latin, a foreign language, music, natural science and drawing, with Greek as an optional extra. The County Council supported technical and commercial subjects in the late 19th century, but after 1904 it was empowered to support secondary education in general, allowing Latin and other classical components of {{the curriculum}} to remain intact. After World War I, sixth form <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> developed allowing students to commence advanced studies {{in the arts and}} sciences. By the 1950s, a wide range were available: English language and literature, mathematics, French, German, Latin, Greek, art, history, geography, physics, chemistry and woodwork; biology was taught at Kesteven and Sleaford High School.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Kilburn entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, {{with a state}} scholarship, {{a county}} major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship, where he studied mathematics. Although many {{university}} dons were absent performing war work at places like Bletchley Park, and the University of Cambridge maintained a vigorous mathematical community, and Kilburn became the Sidney Sussex College representative in the New Pythagoreans, a clique with the Cambridge University Mathematical Society that also numbered Gordon Welchman and Geoff Tootill among its members. Due to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> compressed to two years, and he graduated in 1942 with First Class Honours in Part I of the Mathematical Tripos and preliminary examinations for Part II.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the German closure and censorship of Polish schools, resistance among teachers led almost immediately {{to the creation of}} large-scale underground educational activities. Most notably, the Secret Teaching Organization (Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska, TON) was created as early as in October 1939. Other organizations were created locally; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the TON, working closely with the Underground's State Department of Culture and Education, which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by Czesław Wycech, creator of the TON. Classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people, and university level <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> attended by about 10,000 students (for comparison, the pre-war enrollment at Polish universities was about 30,000 for the 1938/1939 year). More than 90,000 secondary-school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6,000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the General Government (centered on the cities of Warsaw, Kraków, Radom and Lublin). Overall, in that period in the General Government, one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations; the number rose to about 70% for children old enough to attend secondary school. It is estimated that in some rural areas, the educational coverage was actually improved (most likely as <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities). Compared to pre-war classes, the absence of Polish Jewish students was notable, as they were confined by the Nazi Germans to ghettos; there was, however, underground Jewish education in the ghettos, often organized with support from Polish organizations like TON. Students at the underground schools were often also members of the Polish resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Omnem {{constitution}} at {{the beginning}} of the Digest is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> based on the works of Gaius, Ulpian, Papinian and Paulus. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.|$|E

5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union.

5|$|Thirty-two nations—the {{largest number}} of {{participating}} Winter Olympic countries to that point—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became {{the first person to}} sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> adequately covered.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
