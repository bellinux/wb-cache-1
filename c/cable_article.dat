NBC was the only network named in connection to a possible partnership in the article. The setup being suggested was similar to the last time NBC had the rights to baseball, that being the network would get the rights to some League Championship Series games and alternate rights to the World Series and All-Star Game with Fox, {{which may or may not}} have kept the Game of the Week. After weeks of speculation and rumors, on July 11, 2006, at the All-Star Game, Major League Baseball announced a renewal of its existing current with Fox Sports through 2013, allowing the Fox network to retain exclusivity of the television rights to the World Series and the All-Star Game (the World Series would begin the Wednesday after the League Championship Series are completed). The deal also allowed Fox to retain the Saturday Game of the Week and gave it broadcast rights to one League Championship Series annually. This ruled out baseball returning to NBC, as the two annual showpiece events were not be available in any contract the network might obtain before then.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the causes and}} motives behind the Soviet decision {{to hand over the}} Vyshinskii note to the Swedish government in August 1947. In this note, signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Ia. Vyshinskii, it was falsely claimed that the whereabouts of the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who had been arrested by the Soviet military counterespionage death to the spies (Smersh) on 17 January 1945, were unknown to the Soviet government. Wallenberg had presumably, the note laid down, died during the battle of Budapest in January 1945. On the basis of Soviet and Swedish documents, including recently declassified Soviet encrypted <b>cables,</b> this <b>article</b> examines the chain of events that preceded the decision to hand over the note. New findings among the Soviet encrypted cables suggest that the note may have had no link whatsoever to Wallenberg’s purported death on 17 July 1947. Instead a series of incidents, in particular a crisis in the relations between Sweden and the USSR following the disclosure in late July and early August 1947 of two cases of suspected Soviet military espionage in Sweden, may have been of critical importance for the decision to hand over the note...|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to explain causes {{and events that}} led to the 2011 Bahraini protests at the Pearl Roundabout. In this article, I argue that the most common explanation – i. e. : the Sunni-Shiite rivalry – has to be understood in a wider historical and geopolitical context that has been determining the actions of the regime. Where the opposition calls for domestic democratic reforms, the regime thinks in the framework of an Arab-Irani/Sunni-Shiite strife over the dominance in the Persian Gulf and treats its Shiite majority as possible “Iranian agents”, even though it is unable to prese nt any real evidence proving the alleged Iranian infl uence on the Bahraini opposition since the late 1990 s.

In documenting the strenuous efforts of the Press Union, ultimately unsuccessful, to resist calls, from the late 1950 s onwards, for increased press <b>cable</b> charges, the <b>article</b> demonstrates that the Press Union’s ongoing defence of the commonwealth press rate extended beyond its British leadership to include longstanding member countries, such as Australia, which had traditionally been disadvantaged by distance from London and exorbitant communication charges. Consequently, its protracted defence of the penny cable rate constitutes an important, if neglected, episode in understanding the changing character of commonwealth relations in the critical post-war years...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to gain an}} {{understanding}} {{of the extent to which}} human resource professionals are using and applying job analysis, the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) and competency modelling in New Zealand organisations. This study also explored the research-practice gap in job analysis, as examined through the O*NET and the influence of Taylor and <b>Cable's</b> (2004) <b>article</b> on the O*NET database. An online questionnaire was completed by 107 participants, who were members of the Human Resource Institute of New Zealand research stream. Findings suggest there is high awareness of job analysis, however the application of job analysis in the organisation is commonly hindered by the limited understanding and knowledge amongst human resource professionals. Findings on competency modelling suggest, there has been a possible increase in the application of competency modelling in organisations since Markus, Cooper-Thomas and Allpress (2005) study. The article by Taylor and Cable (2004) has had little influence on the application of the O*NET, suggesting a potential research-practice gap is present in the job analysis area. Specifically, the O*NET database could benefit Human Resource Management (HRM), through supporting the development of job descriptions and person specifications. Human resource professionals could benefit further from extending their awareness of job analysis and competency modelling to the application of these processes in HRM. The need for future research and practical implications for HRM and organisational psychology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} broadband {{environment is}} pushing forward {{a new phase}} of development for the television medium. Just as the introduction of cable television added the multichannel, narrow-casting capability to broadcast television, {{the arrival of the}} Internet and the broadband infrastructure brought more enhanced functions such as interactivity and personalization to <b>cable</b> television. This <b>article</b> introduces a strategic architecture that depicts the roles of various channel members and the interrelationships between them in the emerging broadband television industry by incorporating the concepts of value chain and complementary convergence. Contrary to the belief that the broadband industry would present a truly converged system in which firms from the multichannel television and telephone sectors compete in one another's market with bundled services, this article anticipates a broadband market that continues to offer telecommunications and video programming products under two separate interfacing devices and different distribution infrastructures because of the importance of preserving the unique characteristics of each product. ...|$|R

To speak from the degree of sensibility, the impulse current method has the best sensibility, while the capacitive coupler and AE methods are less sensible. To speak from the noise-resist ability, it is contrary to the degree of sensibility. The impulse method is prone to be interrupted by noise.

40|$|International audienceStay cables {{are likely}} to vibrate under the {{combined}} effect of rain and wind in the so-called phenomenon rain wind-induced vibrations (RWIVs). Rain takes part in the phenomenon {{in the shape of}} water rivulets that run along the <b>cables.</b> In previous <b>articles,</b> the authors investigated the conditions under which such rivulets can be formed. Using a lubrication model, it was shown for a particular wind cable configuration that rivulets can only be exhibited above a critical wind speed for which gravity is overcome. The rivulets' position was also predicted with the model. The results were validated by experiments. In this paper, the wind speed at which rivulets appear and their position are expressed for an arbitrary wind cable orientation. A maximum wind speed for the rivulets' existence is then estimated {{as the result of a}} balance between the drag force and the surface tension. A wind speed interval is consequently obtained for the rivulets' appearance and maintenance on a cylinder. The boundaries of this interval are expressed in term of Weber numbers, comparing the surface tension and wind effect. These predictions are successfully compared with all the measurements that have been published in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This {{review article}} {{is the first}} of three parts of a Special Issue dealing with finite-amplitude {{oscillations}} of elastic suspended cables. This part is concerned with system modeling and methods of analysis. After shortly reporting on cable historical literature and identifying the topic and scope of the review, the article begins with a presentation of the mechanical system and of the ensuing mathematical models. Continuum equations of cable finite motion are formulated, their linearized version is reported, and nonlinear discretized models for the analysis of 2 D or 3 D vibration problems are discussed. Approximate methods for asymptotic analysis of either single or multi-degree-of-freedom models of small-sag cables are addressed, as well as asymptotic models operating directly on the original partial differential equations. Numerical tools and geometrical techniques from dynamical systems theory are illustrated with reference to the single-degree-of-freedom model of cable, reporting on measures for diagnosis of nonlinear and chaotic response, as well as on techniques for local and global bifurcation analysis. The paper ends with a discussion on the main features and problems encountered in nonlinear experimental analysis of vibrating suspended <b>cables.</b> This review <b>article</b> cites 226 references...|$|R

40|$|Iran is but {{one country}} that gives {{real-world}} application to the Orwellian mantra that “history is written by the victors. ” Indeed, the militant clerics, who consolidated power {{at the expense of}} all the revolutionary factions, have worked tirelessly to present their version of the Iranian Revolution’s history as the only version—one best encapsulated by the state’s preferred revolutionary slogan: “Independence, Freedom, Islamic Republic” (esteqlal, azadi, jomhuri-ye eslami). For years, the Iranian government has presented this one-sided history to the benefit of its ruling class and self-affirming ideology. Just as the events of 1978 - 79 are far more complex and disputed than the state would like to admit, the historic uprising of 2009 is equally contentious. More than five years after the revolt, the Iranian government continues to refer to the Green Movement as “the sedition”—a conspiracy orchestrated from abroad and without organic roots within the country. Inspired by the studies that contested the “official” narrative of the Iranian Revolution, this work aspires to do the same with the “official” narrative of the uprising in 2009. The events of 2009 are historically consequential not only because they could have dire consequences for the Iranian government in the long-term, but also because of what they tell the reader about the critical juncture in which Iran’s experiment with Islamism finds itself. After 30 years of Islamic rule, a new generation of activists, who were raised under the ideology and authority of the Islamic Republic, challenged that state by co-opting the system’s discourse, history, and symbolism, all of which they reprogrammed with subversive meaning and leveled against the state with a profound sense of purpose. In doing so, activists brought to the fore in a fiery manner the post-Islamist shift that has been taking place in Iran in recent years. This study takes the archival footage from the events in question, interviews, memoirs, diplomatic <b>cables,</b> activist <b>articles,</b> news data, all of which are intertwined with the research material from the history of the Iranian Revolution in order to produce the context necessary to understanding the tectonic shift the uprising in 2009 represents...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{major changes in}} how video content and advertising is delivered to consumers. Digital technologies such as broadband allow consumers to stream or download programming. Smart phones and tablets allow consumers to view screen content virtually anywhere at any time. Advertising has become personalized and integrated with other content. Despite these {{major changes in the}} media markets, the framework for regulating advertising to children has not changed very much since the 1990 s. This article argues that the existing regulatory framework must be reinvented to protect children in the digital age. It uses Google’s recently introduced YouTube Kids app (“YTK”), which is designed for use by children aged 5 and under, to illustrate a range of unfair or deceptive marketing practices – such as unboxing videos, brand channels, and influencer videos. Many of the videos available on the YTK app, would violate the FCC’s children’s television rules if they were shown on broadcast or <b>cable</b> television. The <b>article</b> describes the relative roles and effectiveness of the FCC and FTC in preventing advertising that takes advantage of children, who because their cognitive abilities are still developing, do not distinguish advertising from other content or understand the purpose of advertising. It identifies the traditional rationales for limiting advertising to children and finds that the same or greater concerns exist today. Finally, it discusses the prospects for updating protections for children in the digital age...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of the ownership of property which vests (by virtue of sections 20 (1) and 21 (1) respectively of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936) in the Master and, upon appointment, in the trustee of the insolvent estate, has {{been the source of}} academic debate and conflicting court judgments over a lengthy period. It was thought that the question had been finally settled by the (then) Appellate Division in De Villiers v Delta Cables (Pty) Ltd 1992 1 SA 9 (A), which concerned property belonging to the solvent spouse (as defined in section 21 (13)), where it was held that ownership passes to the Master and subsequently the trustee. This was accepted by the Constitutional Court for the purposes of its judgment in Harksen v Lane 1998 1 SA 300 (CC). However, recent judgments, in Edkins v Registrar of Deeds, Johannesburg 2012 6 SA 278 (GSJ) and, on appeal, Fourie v Edkins 2013 6 SA 576 (SCA), have seemingly again opened up the question for debate, particularly {{in view of the fact}} that the Supreme Court of Appeal in Fourie v Edkins ignored its own precedent on this issue. These two judgments concerned property registered in the name of the insolvent. In a third recent judgment, in Motala v Moller (GSJ) unreported case number 32654 / 11 (GSJ) of 11 September 2013 (copy on file with authors) concerning property which had belonged to the solvent spouse at the time of the sequestration of the estate of her husband, the court regarded section 25 (4) of the Insolvency Act as countering the precedent established by De Villiers v Delta <b>Cables.</b> In this <b>article,</b> each of these three judgments is analysed and criticised...|$|R

The outcome of that earlier juncture involved an increase in media commercialization and the proliferation of conservative evangelical broadcasters???developments which {{paved the way for the}} emergence of the Religious Right. Today, technological and generational shifts have the potential to alter the course of American religious politics. Younger people are more wary of political partisanship and religious hypocrisy, and are more likely to use new technologies as tools of political engagement. These shifts have led some journalists and researchers to pronounce the death of the Religious Right and the emergence of a new Religious Left. The research presented here assesses the potential outcome of this critical juncture by examining the impact of new media technologies on public discourse at the intersection of religion and politics. Through qualitative analysis of newspaper <b>articles,</b> <b>cable</b> news transcripts, and blog commentaries, I demonstrate how new media tend to generate debates about the authenticity and sincerity of public figures. Pundits and bloggers frequently claim to glimpse public figures??? ???backstage??? identity through video clips, instant messages, and e-mails. In this way, the new media environment generates competing ???discourses of authenticity. ??? Occasionally this dynamic favors independent media sources and grassroots activists. For example the Republican sex scandals, which drove some evangelicals away from the GOP, erupted when liberal bloggers exposed the private messages of conservative congressmen. More often, though, established media industries and political organizations manage to exploit the dynamics of new media to their advantage, leading to what Charles Taylor calls shallow or ???flat??? debates about authenticity. The scandal that erupted in the summer of 2010 surrounding the firing of USDA official Shirley Sherrod exemplifies a trend that began during the 2008 election, as video clips of Rev. Jeremiah Wright circulated between cable news and YouTube. Media coverage of Wright, and subsequently of Sarah Palin, demonstrates that traditional media sources often set the terms of debate about religious authenticity. In these debates, religion frequently serves as a proxy for underlying concerns about race. This intersection of religious and racial politics breathes new life into the Religious Right, while pushing ???prophetic??? social critique to the sidelines. In uncovering these trends, the current research troubles the argument that new media have inherently ???democratizing??? effects that can resuscitate the public sphere and render industry regulation obsolete. Instead, my work buttresses arguments for the revitalization of professional journalism, tighter regulation of commercial media industries, and the development of independent media sources. The current research also contributes to ongoing debates in cultural theory about the relationship between religious practice, racial identity, and democratic politics. In conclusion I examine the implications of the current research for developments beyond the American context, and offer suggestions for future research...|$|R
