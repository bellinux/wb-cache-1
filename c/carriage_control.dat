50|$|More recently, some curved rails {{have been}} {{produced}} to a modular design so components can be unbolted and used elsewhere, subject to design and safety considerations. In some cases, tubular section rails which are welded during manufacture, are produced by specialist rail companies {{so they can be}} used with a pre-owned <b>carriage,</b> <b>controls,</b> and other components. This is, perhaps, like putting an old locomotive on new railway lines. It provides a lower cost solution than buying a totally new system.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether persons living {{in areas of}} high animal density {{are at increased risk}} for carrying livestockassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA), we used an existing dataset of persons in the Netherlands with LA-MRSA <b>carriage</b> and <b>controls</b> who carried other types of MRSA. Results of running univariate and multivariate logistic regression models indicated that living in livestock-dense areas increases the odds of nasal carriage of LA-MRSA. We found that doubling pig, cattle, and veal calf densities per municipality increased the odds of LA-MRSA carriage over carriage of other types of MRSA by 24. 7 % (95 % CI 0. 9 %– 54. 2 %), 76. 9 % (95 % CI 11. 3 %– 81. 3 %), and 24. 1 % (95 % CI 5. 5 %– 45. 9 %), respectively, after adjusting for direct animal contact, living in a rural area, and the probable source of MRSA <b>carriage.</b> <b>Controlling</b> the spread of LA-MRSA thus requires giving attention to community members in animal-dense regions who are unaffi liated with livestock farming.

50|$|An I/O {{modifier}} is {{specified by}} appending an at-sign {{followed by the}} modifier's name to an FDname. For example, *SOURCE*@UC would cause lines read from *SOURCE* to be converted to uppercase before they are presented to a program and MYFILE@UC@-TRIM would cause lines read from the file MYFILE to be converted to uppercase and any trailing spaces {{at the end of}} the line would be retained. Some commonly used I/O modifiers are: @S (sequential), @I (indexed), @FWD (forward), @BKWD (backward), @EBCD (EBCDIC), @BIN (binary), @UC (uppercase), @CC (logical <b>carriage</b> <b>control),</b> @MCC (machine <b>carriage</b> <b>control),</b> @NOCC (no <b>carriage</b> <b>control),</b> @TRIM (trim all but last training blank). Some I/O modifiers are processed in a device independent fashion by MTS and others are device dependent and processed by the Device Support Routines (DSRs).|$|E
50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper punch tape to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape and was mounted on the printer. The length of the <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of paper. The looped carriage tape was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|E

50|$|Commonly, twelve {{men and a}} powder-boy were {{required}} to operate each gun. If needed, some men were designated to take stations as boarders, to man the bilge pumps, or to fight fires. Guns were normally manned on the engaged side only; if a ship engaged two opponents, gun crews had to be divided. All of the guns were capable of using several different kinds of projectiles: round shot, chain or bar shot, grape shot, and heated shot. Each gun was mounted on a wooden gun <b>carriage</b> <b>controlled</b> by an arrangement of rope and tackle. The Captain ordered the gun crews to either open fire together in a single broadside, or allowed each crew to fire at will as the target came close alongside. The gun captain pulled the lanyard to trip the flintlock which sent a spark into the pan. The ignited powder in the pan sent a flame through the priming tube to set off the powder charge in the gun and hurl its projectile at the enemy.|$|R

50|$|Originally, the Rhein-Express was {{operated}} {{with class}} 110 locomotives with and six modernised Silberling <b>carriages</b> without <b>control</b> cars. During 2002, {{the service was}} converted to push-pull train trains made up of newly delivered class 146 locomotives and five double-deck carriages. Because of flood damage at the manufacturer of the seats, the delivery of the double-deck carriages was delayed, so that until the summer of 2003 two sets of Silberling carriages could still {{be found on the}} service.|$|R
50|$|By {{convention}} {{the position}} {{on a sheet of}} paper where the first print line has to be written was associated with Channel 1. For example, if the first line of text had to always be on physical line 3 for a given form, then the channel 1 hole had to be punched in line 3 of the <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape.|$|E
50|$|The line {{printers}} had 12 {{sensors to}} recognize 12 independent {{positions on the}} <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape. Each position was called a channel, numbered from 1 to 12. If a hole was punched for a channel, then this hole marked a position that the printer could 'jump to' quickly by advancing until the hole was sensed by the corresponding channel sensor. This is called skip to channel number n.|$|E
50|$|Printer control {{characters}} and <b>Carriage</b> <b>control</b> characters are IBM mainframe terms that denote the special meaning {{which the first}} character on a line of printable text may have. The first character of each line of text is interpreted as a control character or printer command instead of a character to be printed if a corresponding attribute is set for the print data set (data set is mainframe speak for {{what is known as}} a file on other operating systems).|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{the section}} between Magdeburg and Halle {{is served by}} Regionalbahn trains that run hourly and {{are made up of}} three {{double-deck}} <b>carriages</b> with <b>control</b> cars and propelled by class 143 electric locomotives. Trains on line S1 of the Mittelelbe S-Bahn between Magdeburg and Schönebeck, run between Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof and Magdeburg-Buckau on separate tracks. This service is operated with class 425 EMUs, which were modernised in 2015. Furthermore, the line is used Regional-Express services every two hours to Erfurt and every two hours between Magdeburg and Schönebeck by Regional-Express services to Aschersleben.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} multiple {{train service}} is for two passenger trains, either both of 9 carriages or one 10 and one 8 carriage train; both use all 18 of the railway's <b>carriages.</b> Radio <b>control</b> can accommodate {{more than two}} trains if required, and also facilitate different / unusual movements where necessary. On two occasions during late 2016, two separate Permanent Way trains were run along with the standard passenger train, leading to three trains {{on the line with}} only Haste Hill for passing, leading to careful planning and coordination being required.|$|R
50|$|Mainframe {{printers}} {{originally had}} a <b>Carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape, with 12 channels (1 through 9 and A through C) {{that can be}} assigned a fixed position on the page by punching a hole, allowing the printer to skip a variable distance down the page to a fixed location. Newer printers such as the IBM 4248 have done away with the physical tape and use a Forms Control Buffer (FCB) containing {{an image of the}} tape data. Normally only channel 1 is preassigned, {{to the top of the}} page.|$|E
50|$|In {{its basic}} form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print {{portions}} (fields) {{of the card}} on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card {{to one or more}} counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card, and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next master card was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected {{to the top of the}} next page, typically using a <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> tape.|$|E
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> <b>control</b> {{tape was}} a loop of punched tape {{that was used}} to {{synchronize}} rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{passenger}} services included, {{in addition to}} stopping trains, a pair of express services on the route from Büsum via Heide and Neumünster to Eutin. In the 1980s, the use of uneconomic train sets (a class V 100 locomotive hauling Silberling <b>carriages</b> with a <b>control</b> car) led to a temporary decline of the line.|$|R
50|$|Different rollingstock {{are used}} on line. The Deutsche Bahn sets for the Halle-Eilenburg Regionalbahn service are {{composed}} of locomotives of class 143 hauling one or two double-decker <b>carriages</b> plus a <b>control</b> car and since December 2013 Bombardier Talent 2 multiple units are used for line S4 (Leipzig-Hoyerswerda) of the Mitteldeutschland S-Bahn, which uses {{the section of the}} line from Eilenburg to Falkenberg/Elster.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 370 printer {{was used}} on the IBM 305 RAMAC {{computer}} system, introduced by IBM on September 14, 1956. The 370 {{was connected to the}} 305 by a serial data line from the S track of the computer's drum memory and printed 80-columns with a punched tape <b>controlled</b> <b>carriage.</b> Line formatting was programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a plugboard control panel.|$|R
