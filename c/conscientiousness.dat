25|$|Low <b>conscientiousness</b> {{has been}} linked to antisocial and {{criminal}} behaviors, as well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low <b>conscientiousness</b> and low agreeableness taken together are also associated with substance abuse. People low in <b>conscientiousness</b> have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High <b>conscientiousness</b> is associated with more careful planning of shopping trips and less impulse buying of unneeded items. <b>Conscientiousness</b> {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with business white collar crime.|$|E
25|$|Grit {{was highly}} {{correlated}} with the Big Five <b>conscientiousness</b> trait. Although grit and <b>conscientiousness</b> highly overlap in their achievement aspects, they differ in their emphasis. Grit emphasizes long-term stamina, whereas <b>conscientiousness</b> focuses on short-term intensity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> {{significantly}} correlates {{positively with}} right-wing authoritarianism. Although right-wing authoritarianism {{is one of}} the most powerful predictors of prejudice, a large scale meta-analysis found that <b>conscientiousness</b> itself is uncorrelated with general prejudice. <b>Conscientiousness</b> is positively correlated with support for capital punishment.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} 2004 found <b>conscientiousness</b> was {{significantly}} {{negatively correlated with}} intelligence. <b>Conscientiousness</b> significantly correlated negatively with abstract reasoning (−0.26) and verbal reasoning (−0.23).|$|E
25|$|The {{dependability}} subfactors (order, dutifulness, and deliberation) of <b>conscientiousness</b> correlate negatively with creativity {{while the}} achievement subfactors correlate positively. Another {{study showed that}} people who score high on the order subfactor of <b>conscientiousness</b> show less innovative behavior. Group <b>conscientiousness</b> has {{a negative effect on}} group performance during creative tasks. Groups with only conscientious members have difficulty solving open-ended problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> is {{importantly}} {{related to}} successful academic performance in students and workplace performance among managers and workers. Low levels of <b>conscientiousness</b> are {{strongly associated with}} procrastination. A considerable amount of research indicates that <b>conscientiousness</b> has a small positive correlation with performance in the workplace, and indeed that after general mental ability is taken into account, the other four of the Big Five personality traits do not aid in predicting career success.|$|E
25|$|A {{large scale}} survey of {{residents}} of Great Britain found that average levels {{of all the}} Big Five, including <b>conscientiousness,</b> vary across regional districts in England, Wales and Scotland. High levels of <b>conscientiousness</b> were found throughout much of Southern England, scattered areas of the Midlands, {{and most of the}} Scottish Highlands. Low levels of <b>conscientiousness</b> were observed in London, Wales, and parts of the North of England. Higher mean levels of regional <b>conscientiousness</b> were positively correlated with voting for the Conservative Party, and negatively correlated with voting for the Labour Party, in the 2005 and 2010 elections, and also correlated with a higher proportion of married residents, with higher life expectancy for men and women, fewer long-term health problems, and with lower rates of mortality from stroke, cancer, and heart disease. Higher regional <b>conscientiousness</b> was also correlated with lower median annual income in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Rebellion against {{control is}} {{significantly}} {{negatively correlated with}} <b>conscientiousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> has a weak {{positive}} relationship with conservative political attitudes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> is {{associated}} with rule compliance, obedience and conventional integrity.|$|E
25|$|Average {{levels of}} <b>conscientiousness</b> vary by {{state in the}} United States. People living in the central part, {{including}} the states of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Missouri, tend to have higher scores on average than people living in other regions. People in the southwestern states of New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona also have relatively high average scores on <b>conscientiousness.</b> Among the eastern states, Florida {{is the only one}} that scores in the top ten for this personality trait. The four states with the lowest scores on <b>conscientiousness</b> on average were, in descending order, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> (all its subfactors) {{correlate}} {{significantly with}} conformity (+0.33, p < 0.01).|$|E
25|$|Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' {{describe}} desirable {{aspects of}} character. Because {{it was once}} {{believed to be a}} moral evaluation, <b>conscientiousness</b> was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality of individual differences in <b>conscientiousness</b> has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports that people make about their degrees of <b>conscientiousness.</b> Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of <b>conscientiousness</b> predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and {{it soon became clear that}} all five factors are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which <b>conscientiousness</b> is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.|$|E
25|$|Relationship {{quality is}} {{positively}} associated with partners' level of <b>conscientiousness,</b> and highly conscientious people {{are less likely to}} get divorced. <b>Conscientiousness</b> is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in <b>conscientiousness</b> are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and responsible behavior.|$|E
25|$|Fertility {{has been}} found to {{decrease}} in women who exhibit higher levels of <b>conscientiousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|As noted above, {{procrastination}} {{is consistently}} {{found to be}} strongly correlated with <b>conscientiousness,</b> and moderately so with impulsiveness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conscientiousness</b> {{is one of}} {{the five}} major {{dimensions}} in the Big Five model (also called Five Factor Model) of personality, which also consists of extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, and agreeableness (OCEAN acronym). Two of many personality tests that assess these traits are Costa and McCrae's NEO PI-R and Goldberg's NEO-IPIP. According to these models, <b>conscientiousness</b> {{is considered to be a}} continuous dimension of personality, rather than a categorical 'type' of person.|$|E
25|$|In a Milgram {{experiment}} <b>conscientiousness</b> and agreeableness {{were associated}} with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.|$|E
25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} {{as they relate to}} the Big Five {{personality}} traits: openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and <b>conscientiousness.</b> In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and <b>conscientiousness).</b> Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, it was {{suggested}} that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by <b>conscientiousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The trait {{cluster of}} <b>conscientiousness</b> {{overlaps}} with other models of personality, such as C. Robert Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory, {{in which it}} is related to both self-directedness and persistence. It also includes the specific traits of rule consciousness and perfectionism in Cattell's 16 PF model. It is negatively associated with impulsive sensation-seeking in Zuckerman's alternative five model. Traits associated with <b>conscientiousness</b> are frequently assessed by self-report integrity tests given by various corporations to prospective employees.|$|E
25|$|Big Five {{personality}} traits, ("the five-factor model"). Many psychologists currently {{believe that}} five factors are sufficient: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and <b>conscientiousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, high agreeableness {{does not}} always lead to prosocial behaviour, in a Milgram {{experiment}} <b>conscientiousness</b> and agreeableness were associated with willingness to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, neuroticism, and <b>conscientiousness</b> have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by <b>conscientiousness</b> and neuroticism. In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor.|$|E
25|$|Of all manager/leader types, top {{executives}} show {{the lowest level}} of rule-following, a conscientious trait. <b>Conscientiousness</b> is not always positively related to job performance, sometimes the opposite is true.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Patrick and Charlotte Markey {{suggested}} that violent video games only caused aggressive feelings in {{individuals who had}} a preexisting disposition, such as high neuroticism, low agreeableness, or low <b>conscientiousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|A large {{study found}} that fluid {{intelligence}} was significantly negatively correlated with the order (−0.15), self-discipline (−0.08), and deliberation (−0.09) subfactors of <b>conscientiousness</b> (all correlations significant with p < 0.001.).|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>conscientiousness</b> has a {{positive}} relationship with subjective well-being, particularly satisfaction with life, so highly conscientious {{people tend to be}} happier with their lives than those who score low on this trait.|$|E
25|$|Being {{neurotic}} {{increases the}} risk of developing Alzheimer's, a type of dementia. Neuroticism is associated with increased brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in life, while <b>conscientiousness</b> has a protective effect by preventing brain atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have argued}} {{that this sort of}} <b>conscientiousness</b> is self-eliminating (assuming it is heritable), so by {{avoiding}} reproduction for ethical reasons the childfree will only aid deterioration of concern for the environment and future generations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, <b>conscientiousness</b> and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and <b>conscientiousness</b> were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} 2006 {{found that those}} scoring low on <b>conscientiousness</b> make better {{decisions}} after unanticipated changes {{in the context of}} a task. Specifically, the subfactors order, dutifulness, and deliberation negatively correlated with decision-making quality, but not competence, achievement striving, and self-discipline.|$|E
25|$|Conscientious {{employees}} {{are generally more}} reliable, more motivated, and harder working. They also have lower rates of absenteeism and counterproductive work behaviors such as stealing and fighting with other employees. Furthermore, <b>conscientiousness</b> is the only personality trait that correlates with performance across all categories of jobs.|$|E
25|$|Large unselected studies, however {{have found}} null relationships, and the {{negative}} relationship sometimes found in selected samples such as universities may result from students whose low ability would reduce their chance of gaining entrance, but who have higher <b>conscientiousness,</b> gaining their GPA via hard work rather than giftedness.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck's psychoticism factor {{incorporates}} some of {{the polar}} opposites of the lower order factors of openness, agreeableness and <b>conscientiousness.</b> A high scorer on tough-mindedness in psychoticism would score low on tender-mindedness in agreeableness. Most {{of the differences between}} the taxonomies stem from the three factor model's emphasis on fewer high-order factors.|$|E
25|$|A person's {{level of}} <b>conscientiousness</b> is {{generally}} assessed using self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation {{can also be}} used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. Deciding which measure of either type to use in research is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the study being undertaken.|$|E
