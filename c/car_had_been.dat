5|$|The {{body of a}} 25-year-old {{substitute}} teacher from Kingston, Amy Glauner, was found on Joppenbergh after an October 1998 search. Police determined that she died of head trauma following a fall. Her <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found {{in a parking lot}} by the mountain.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2012, {{he died in}} a {{car crash}} under {{controversial}} circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Payá's children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deliberately run off of the road.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E

Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able to pass through the closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They were driving home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an unmarked <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E

5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E

25|$|On lap 35, Coulthard passed Irvine, {{who then}} retired on lap 41 with three laps to go, with an {{alternator}} failure. Schumacher took the chequered flag, but was disqualified {{after the race}} because the wooden stepped flat bottom board on Schumacher's <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> excessively worn away, more than the permitted 10% wear. Hill was reclassified as the winner ahead of Häkkinen, Verstappen, Coulthard, Blundell and Morbidelli.|$|E

25|$|In May 1981, the Hessian Secretary of Commerce Heinz-Herbert Karry {{was murdered}} with a firearm that in 1973 had been transported in Fischer's car, {{along with other}} weapons stolen from an American army base.

Only later had Fischer learned that his <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used to transport stolen weapons.|$|E
25|$|Within the 15 {{years that}} make up this era, the various {{experimental}} designs and alternate power systems would be marginalised. Although the modern touring <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> invented earlier, {{it was not until}} Panhard et Levassor's Système Panhard was widely licensed and adopted that recognisable and standardised automobiles were created. This system specified front-engined, rear-wheel drive internal combustion engined cars with a sliding gear transmission. Traditional coach-style vehicles were rapidly abandoned, and buckboard runabouts lost favour with the introduction of tonneaus and other less-expensive touring bodies.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} playing first-class cricket for Northamptonshire until 1938, but did {{not play}} at all in 1934 or 1935. This {{is because of the}} fact – unmentioned by Wisden at the time – that he had been convicted of manslaughter after his <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in collision with a motorcycle, killing the latter's pillion passenger. Jupp was sentenced to nine months in prison, and was released in June 1935 after serving half his sentence, {{but did not}} play cricket again until the following year.|$|E

The new car boasts an impressive specification, front engined, rear wheel drive, normally aspirated Cosworth V8 mated to a manual transmission that caused it to be described as “God’s own sports car”. Codenamed T37, deposits were taken in anticipation for delivery in 2017.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1995, {{an eight-year-old}} girl was {{abducted}} and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley. Whiting was arrested {{a few weeks}} later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's <b>car</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a red Ford Sierra, which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, GM {{chairman}} Roger Smith {{demonstrated the}} Impact, an electric concept car, at the 1990 LA Auto Show.

Alan Cocconi of AC Propulsion designed and built the original drive controller electronics for the Impact, and the design was later refined by Hughes Electronics. On April 18, 1990, Smith announced that the Impact would become a production vehicle.|$|E
