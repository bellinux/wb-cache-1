40|$|Firms have {{attempted}} to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction by providing superior service, supposedly for <b>customer</b> <b>benefit.</b> However, does higher <b>customer</b> <b>benefit</b> always lead to higher customer satisfaction? The model developed by social psychologists suggests that a customer is likely to feel negative as well as positive affect toward a contact person (CP) via indebtedness and/or other mediating variables, but this model has remained untested empirically. In this study, we elaborated and empirically tested the model. The results of structural equation modeling show that higher <b>customer</b> <b>benefit</b> from superior service can increase indebtedness, which, in turn, can decrease customer satisfaction. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{customer}} value model (CVM) is a data-driven {{representation of the}} worth, in monetary terms, of what a company is doing or could do for its customers. Customer value models are tools used primarily in B2B markets where {{the choice of a}} given product, service, or offering is based primarily upon the amount {{customer value}} created. Customer value is defined as Value = Benefits - Price. Thus, <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> are quantified in a CVM - product features and capabilities are translated into dollars. Customer value models are different from customer lifetime value models, which seek to quantify the value of a customer to its suppliers.|$|E
50|$|When the O'Farrell Government {{took office}} in March 2011, it {{committed}} to building a line through the CBD to Barangaroo, with a preferred route along George Street. It also committed to conducting feasibility studies into the construction of lines from the City to Sydney University and the City to the University of New South Wales. On 8 December 2011, the government announced shortlisted potential routes for these extensions. In 2012, Transport for NSW decided the routes to Sydney University and Barangaroo via The Rocks provided fewer <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> and were considered a lower priority.

50|$|Advanced {{metering}} {{systems can}} provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers.

In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more flexible billing cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles. With timely usage information available to the <b>customer,</b> <b>benefits</b> will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions.|$|E

50|$|A {{company is}} able to better meet the desires and wants of {{consumers}} through the feedback they receive. The feedback is used to guide customer satisfaction and administer consumer insight. This in turn gives consumers an overall better and improved brand experience. Second, the company can benefit from touchpoints as it aids in the investment of marketing communications by increasing message delivery and decreasing negative messages that can invalidate the marketing communications messages. And the <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> by assisting in the progress of two-way communication, which helps when something goes wrong, {{as it can be}} easily remedied through communication between the entities. Lastly, the company gains leverage in interactive experiences to boost brand awareness, brand associations, anticipated quality of the brand, and brand loyalty. In turn, the consumers benefit from gaining brand insurance. The risk in purchasing a product and using it is reduced or eliminated because of the increase of brand trust.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Sustainable {{operations}} are increasingly part of firms’ competitive strategies. Research widely investigates {{the relationship between}} sustainable operations and competitive advantage, considering financial performance as a dependent variable, and shows controversial results. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to operationalize competitive advantage as internal and external intangible benefits, such as human resource (HR) and <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> HR benefits concern the deployment of a workforce pursuing a firm’s goals and strategy; <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> concern the improvement of a firm’s relationship with its customers. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical results are provided in an analysis of data from a survey conducted on a sample of 107 Italian firms in the food industry. A single industry and country are selected to avoid possible differences in regulations and in operations processes. Structural equation modelling is used to test hypotheses relating sustainable operations to HR and <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> Findings: The authors distinguish between green and social operations practices. Green operations practices directly impact <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> but not HR benefits. Social sustainable operations practices do not directly impact <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> but instead have a direct impact on HR benefits. Hence, through HR benefits, they have an indirect impact on <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> Practical implications: The authors provide results showing to operations managers that both green operations and social {{operations are}} crucial to obtaining <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> Social operations do this by enhancing HR benefits. Green operations instead are not positively related to HR benefits. Originality/value: This research serves as an original contribution to the sustainable operations literature in two ways. First, from a resource-based perspective, the relationship between sustainable operations, HR benefits, and <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> is proposed and tested. Such benefits are also shown to be interrelated based on the service profit chain model. Second, green and social operations practices are analysed separately providing a nuanced view of benefits related to sustainable operations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study a pricing problem where buyers with {{non-uniform}} demand purchase {{one of many}} items. Each buyer has a known {{benefit for}} each item and purchases the item that gives the largest utility, which is defined to {{be the difference between}} the benefit and the price of the item. The optimization problem is to decide on the prices that maximize total revenue of the seller. This problem is also called the optimal product line design problem in the absence of competition. Even though the general problem is known to be NP-hard, it can be solved efficiently under some natural assumptions on <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> In this paper we study properties of optimal solutions and present a dynamic programming algorithm when <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> satisfy the Monge property. The same algorithm {{can also be used to}} solve the problem under the additional requirement that all buyers should be served...|$|E
30|$|To {{increase}} {{the competitiveness of}} wood as a building material requires knowledge of which customer needs require attention in terms of quality improvement and/or product development to best satisfy customers. Hence, information as to the impact on customer satisfaction of the fulfillment of different customer needs, {{as well as the}} performance of wood and substitutes in providing for these needs, is needed. This article suggests the use of customer satisfaction modeling (CSM) for assessing customer needs. The methodology is evaluated in the context of floorcovering. The results suggest that CSM is well suited for extracting the information necessary for prioritizing customer needs: importance/impact and performance data for attributes as well as for <b>customer</b> <b>benefits.</b> The study indicates the necessity of considering substitute materials not only for performance comparisons; substitutes may also reveal otherwise latent customer needs. Practical, functional, benefits exert the greatest impact on customer satisfaction for wooden flooring as well as its closest substitutes, laminate and carpet. Hygiene and a low cost over the life cycle are apparently the <b>customer</b> <b>benefits</b> that require attention from wooden flooring manufacturers, because importance is high and performance relatively low.|$|E
