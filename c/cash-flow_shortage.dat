40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the causes of delay in completing road construction projects in Malawi. A literature review was done which yielded 72 typical causes of delay, and a questionnaire was sent to client, contractor and consultant representatives in Malawi. The results were analysed using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficients, which indicated that the top ten causes of delay in Malawi are: shortage of fuel, insufficient contractor <b>cash-flow,</b> <b>shortage</b> of foreign currency for importation of materials and equipment, slow payment procedures adopted by the client in making progress payments, insufficient equipment, delay in relocating utilities, shortage of construction materials, delay in paying compensation to land owners, shortage of technical personnel, and delay in site mobilisation. The causes of delay are significant and should be given attention by client organisations, consultants and contractors to enable the timely completion of projects in future. It {{should also be noted that}} most of the causes of delay are not unique to Malawi, and have been observed in other southern African countries such as South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland. Recommendations are made to prevent similar causes of delay in future. [URL]...|$|E

A dynamic model of incumbents’ investment in network assets allows to test the explaining strength of several aspects of regulation, competition and corporate structure. The sample includes telecommunications incumbents from the enlarged European Union and two other European countries; firms are observed from 1995 to 2003. Special attention is devoted to describe the ownership and control patterns emerging in (former) State-owned enterprises. After having controlled for competition, regulations are estimated {{not to have a}} significant effect on the investment dynamic. However, the same market structure has less role when the privatization programs are taken into account. Privatization exposes network investments to <b>cash-flow</b> <b>shortages,</b> but this holds true only for State-owned enterprises with looser governance systems. Firms that have been privatized through public offers invest comparatively less, unless managers enjoy discretion in liquidity allocation...|$|R
