40|$|Decentralised {{wastewater}} recycling approaches {{can reduce}} the use of valuable potable water for inapt applications such as irrigation. As Perth has a high irrigation demand and its water supplies are currently under threat, encouragement of this more efficient approach is required. Appropriate technology choice is needed {{to ensure that the}} social, economic and environmental factors are considered in a decentralised wastewater recycling system. As there many technologies available, choosing the right approach can be complex and time consuming {{to the point where it}} potentially discouraging to the involved parties. In order to overcome the technology selection difficulties an electronic decision support tool (EDST) was developed. It incorporates a range of wastewater recycling solutions, ranging from <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>systems</b> to large residential sized treatment plants. The EDST includes a technology type selection process that relies on a detailed algorithm progression to determine the most appropriate wastewater recycling solution. The tool also includes a product database to provide a list of commercially available products for the recommended treatment types. The EDST demonstrates the ability to simplify the wastewater recycling system selection process.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} status of on-site sewage treatment in Australia with particular focus on <b>composting</b> <b>toilets,</b> and {{the transfer of the}} technology to a developing country application. The study began with a request from the Department of Parks Wildlife and Heritage in Tasmania, to inspect and evaluate <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> installations in the World Heritage Area and determine why they were not performing satisfactorily. The investigation was extended to a survey of <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> installations on the East Coast of Australia, predominantly in areas managed by public recreation institutions. In an attempt to remedy some of the problems encountered in the survey of <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities, design, installation and monitoring of a number of batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>systems</b> were undertaken in a variety of contexts. Trials of these custom built public <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> were conducted at two remote high-use sites in the World Heritage Area in Tasmania, and at a road-access cafe facility in a New South Wales national park. Domestic installations were trialed in urban and rural locations in co-operation with local government in southern Tasmania and in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales. Field research and literature review in Japan and China explored {{the status of}} on-site sewage treatment in those countries and its relationship to the use of centralised reticulated sewerage systems. The findings of this review are related to Australia's current sanitation practice and future potential management. Contact was also developed with public recreation land managers in the United States and Canada and co-operative efforts were made to review on-site sanitation options in national parks. A cultural and technical trial of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> funded by the Australian Government aid organisation, AusAID, extended the technology developed in the above trials to the island of Kiritimati in Kiribati in the Central Pacific, and assessed the value of the application from a social, political, administrative, environmental and technical point of view. From the above investigations it was found that there are situations where centralised reticulated sewerage treatment is neither affordable or appropriate, and that water borne on-site options are also not practical. Those situations are probably best suited to dry conservancy techniques. The research, development and promotion of this technology has been undertaken by small business which has sometimes resulted in appropriate installations. On-site sewage treatment is generally limited by a lack of adequate infrastructure. The practical investigations in the study establish that even in the most constrained research circumstances, dry conservancy technology can be improved and does have the potential to provide an appropriate sanitation option. The thesis argues that on-site sewage treatment merits the provision of comprehensive institutional support, and a review of practice in other countries indicates directions that could be explored. Improvements in Australia's sanitation practice also has serious implications for technology transfer to developing countries...|$|R

40|$|What is a <b>{{composting}}</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>system?</b> A composting (or biological) toilet system contains {{and processes}} excrement, toilet paper, carbon additive, and sometimes, food wastes. Unlike a septic system, a <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>system</b> relies on unsaturated conditions (material cannot be fully immersed in water) where aerobic, or airrequiring, bacteria and fungi break down wastes, {{just as they}} do in a yard waste composter. If sized and maintained properly, a composting toilet breaks down waste to 10 to 30 % of its original volume. The resulting soil-like material, called “humus, ” legally must be either buried or removed by a licensed septage hauler in accordance with state and local regulations...|$|E

40|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{improved}} sanitation in Indonesia is reflected in persistence of practicing open defecation causing diarrhoea that is a major reason of under-five mortality. <b>Composting</b> <b>toilets</b> are considered as ecological sanitation representing dry type of sanitation system that is independent of water supply. Due to natural processes of composting that occur under specific conditions, human waste is transformed into compost {{that can be used}} as fertiliser. Although the approach of sustainable sanitation is being introduced in many developing countries, ecological sanitation have not yet been widely implemented in Indonesia except small pilot projects. However, due to sanitation programme of local non-government organisation Project Hope Sumba settled on Indonesian island of Sumba, <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> have been built to serve local people as improved sanitation to eradicate open defecation. The objective of the thesis was to assess user acceptance of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> and perception of ecological sanitation in sub-district of Wewewa Tengah of West Sumba. Additionally, identification of criteria that influence acceptance of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> have been summarized. Primary data have been collected in February and March 2015. The research was based on the interview accompanied by the structured questionnaire with 80 respondents who obtained the <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> within the sanitation programme. Waterless single-vault and double vault <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> without mixing urine and excreta device were installed as well as urine-diverting ones. Based on the survey, majority of the beneficiaries 57. 5 % has decided to quit using the <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> and rebuilt them to septic tank system. The main reasons for stop using the toilets were the fact that <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> does not work correctly because of lack of instructions. Based on the results of the survey, the most important factors affecting acceptance of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> were frequency of using the bulking agent as it contributes to ensure correct process of composting, the experience of final compost application, understanding process of composting and having an off-farm activity. Despite certain failures, the project represents unique experience of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> in Indonesia and can serve as source of valuable information for further projects...|$|R

40|$|This trans {{disciplinary}} study {{investigates the}} potential for safely and sustainably managing human excreta by utilizing this by-product as a fertilizer via alternating batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> of a specific design. An historical analysis traces the traditional use of human excreta in cultivation, and examines {{the reasons for the}} demise of this ancient excreta management strategy in some countries. The study further explores the potential of Agricultural Sanitation providing a modem sustainable method for managing human excreta re-use in traditional settings through field research conducted in Vietnam and Northern Pakistan. A <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> trial conducted on the Central Pacific island of Kiritimati in Kiribati served to test this method of managing human excreta in a challenging cultural and geographic environment where a population has a high incidence of faecally transmitted enteric diseases. To establish the safety of the <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> end-product, fresh faecal samples from <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> households on Kiritimati were tested to identify any pathogens being introduced into the <b>toilets.</b> <b>Compost</b> samples from the <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> were subsequently tested to assess the survival of any pathogenic organisms through laboratory analyses and the incubation of parasite ova that were removed from the compost. Compost samples from a large publicly used batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> in the World Heritage Area of Tasmania, Australia, and a domestic batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> on the North Coast of NSW, Australia were also analysed for pathogen content. The fertilizer capabilities of the <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> end-product was assessed by testing compost samples from the Kiritimati and Australian <b>composting</b> <b>toilets.</b> Total elemental analysis and nutrient availability tests were conducted on the samples. A pot trial was also conducted on Kiritimati and a glasshouse pot trial was performed at the University of Tasmania to observe and record the response of plants amended with the <b>toilet</b> <b>compost.</b> An analysis was undertaken of the socio-cultural problems encou,ntered when introducing new or improved Agricultural Sanitation systems into various communities. The implementation policies of Agricultural Sanitation system projects are reviewed and examined in Kiritimati, Tonga, EI Salvador, Guatemala, Pakistan and Vietnam to determine the main features constraining and enabling implementation in various sociocultural situations. It was found that the technical and biological issues related to Agricultural Sanitation utilizing alternating batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> are not the most significant factors preventing the adoption of this method of excreta management. Evidence from the historical investigation and the review of contemporary use of human excreta in cultivation suggests human excreta is a valuable resource in those cultures. The results from observations and analyses of compost samples from the batch <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> revealed that human excreta compost was aesthetically acceptable, useful, and potentially safe. The major constraint to the sustainable introduction of this excreta management strategy appeared to be resistance to the required changes in behaviour. Therefore attention to complex socio-cultural factors is the principle requirement for successful technology transfer...|$|R
