5|$|The Woodsmen's Show attracts {{thousands}} of visitors to Cherry Springs State Park on the first weekend in August. It has been held every year since 1952, and has been sponsored by the Galeton Rotary Club since 1987. In 2008events at the three-day show included tree-felling, <b>cross-cutting,</b> log rolling, axe-throwing, horse pulling, spring board chopping, the standing block chop, and chainsaw competitions and demonstrations. The 2008show also featured historic recreations {{of life in a}} logging camp, musical performances, and vendors selling food, crafts, and equipment related to the lumber industry.|$|E
5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been duplicated across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of <b>cross-cutting</b> concerns. Aspects define the implementation code which would have otherwise been duplicated and then use pointcuts and join points to define the advice. During weaving, the aspect weaver uses the pointcuts and join points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which the implementation should be injected. The implementation is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes <b>cross-cutting</b> between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
40|$|Aspect {{languages}} are generally comprised of a crosscut language and an action language, with the crosscut language describing joinpoints in a <b>cross-cut</b> program. It is desirable for the <b>cross-cut</b> language to be powerful {{enough so that}} <b>cross-cuts</b> and actions can be clearly separated and so that the <b>cross-cut</b> language is extendible with new types of joinpoints. The latter is especially needed for languages such as Smalltalk where there are few programming constructs and programming conventions are common practice. Therefore we present a <b>cross-cut</b> language {{which is based on}} a logic meta language and which uses a dynamic joinpoint model...|$|R

25|$|The S is {{organized}} around a high-level, <b>cross-cutting</b> structure {{that addresses the}} geopolitical nature of mutual concerns in strategic and economic discussions. The S provides a forum for ongoing and productive bilateral engagement between U.S. and Chinese officials with diverse responsibilities for both economic and strategic issues. The structure of the S allows for a plenary session to discuss issues of <b>cross-cutting</b> strategic and economic importance, while maintaining distinct strategic and economic tracks. Each respective track will involve focused discussions on issues of mutual immediate and long-term strategic or economic interest. The S will meet semi-annually to facilitate robust engagement and progress between dialogues through coordination with existing bilateral dialogues and working-level interactions.|$|E

50|$|Conventional sails {{comprise}} panels, {{which are}} most often stitched together, at other times adhered. There are two basic configurations, <b>cross-cut</b> and radial. <b>Cross-cut</b> sails have the panels sewn parallel to one another, often parallel {{to the foot of}} the sail, and are the least expensive of the two sail constructions. Triangular <b>cross-cut</b> sail panels are designed to meet the mast and stay at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the bias) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail.|$|R

25|$|Lying {{just on the}} {{northern}} flank of Hoodoo Mountain is a small tuya known as Little Bear Mountain. This related Pleistocene age subglacial volcano consists of alkaline basalt and erupted mainly pyroclastic breccia with minor amounts of massive lava, pillow lava, volcanic sandstone and hyaloclastite. <b>Cross-cutting</b> veinlets of obsidian indicate these volcanics were formed by partial melting in the mantle beneath Little Bear Mountain. Mantle xenoliths found at Little Bear Mountain may have originated from mid-crustal depths.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of <b>cross-cutting</b> relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, Méliès {{continued}} producing successful {{films and}} was {{at the peak of}} his popularity. His films that year included The Brahmin and the Butterfly, in which Méliès portrays a Brahmin who transforms a caterpillar into a beautiful woman with wings, but is himself turned into a caterpillar. He also made the féerie Red Riding Hood and Bluebeard, both based on stories from Charles Perrault. In Bluebeard, Méliès plays the eponymous wife-murderer and co-stars with Jeanne d'Alcy and Bleuette Bernon. The film is an early example of parallel <b>cross-cutting</b> and match cuts of characters moving from one room to the next. The Edison Company's 1902 film Jack and the Beanstalk, directed by Edwin S. Porter, was considered a less successful American version of several Méliès films, particularly Bluebeard. That year, he also made Off to Bloomingdale Asylum, a blackface burlesque that includes four white bus passengers transforming into one large black passenger who is then shot by the bus driver.|$|E
500|$|Like all Hawks' comedies, {{the film}} {{is known for its}} fast pace (despite being filmed {{primarily}} in long medium shots, with little <b>cross-cutting).</b> Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, [...] "You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast".|$|E

500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic <b>cross-cutting</b> for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take {{a close look at}} the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E
500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma. The Vermilion fault can be traced westward to North Dakota. It has had a [...] horizontal movement with the northern block moving eastward and upward relative to the southern block. [...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich migmatite, a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] wide belt. Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching, shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked. This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates, about [...] Structures in the migmatite include folds and foliations; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier-phase folds. These <b>cross-cutting</b> foliations indicate that the migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation.|$|E
500|$|The A.V.

[...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that in the midst of all this end-times rush, it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean.

500|$|A Neolithic {{campsite}} {{of around}} 3000 BC beside a spring {{on the west}} of the town is the earliest known human settlement here, but the Willis Museum has flint implements and axes from nearby fields that date back to Palæolithic times. The hillfort at Winklebury ( [...] west of the town centre), known locally as Winklebury Camp or Winklebury Ring dates from the Iron age and there are remains of several other earthworks around Basingstoke, including a long barrow near Down Grange. The site of Winklebury camp is now home to Fort Hill Community School. Nearby, to the west, Roman Road marks the course of a Roman road that ran from Winchester to Silchester. Further to the east, another Roman road ran from Chichester through the outlying villages of Upton Grey and Mapledurwell. The Harrow Way is an Iron-age ancient route that runs to the south of the town.
