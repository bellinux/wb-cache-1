40|$|Recent {{developments}} in chromatographic supports and instrumentation for liquid chromatography are enabling rapid and highly efficient separations. Various analytical strategies have been recently proposed, {{for example the}} use of monolithic supports, elevated mobile phase temperatures, <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with sub- 2 μm fully porous particles for use in ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and superficially porous particles (fused core). All these approaches {{could be used to}} enhance the efficiency and shorten the analysis time. In the presented work, a high efficiency HPLC method was proposed based on coupling three <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with fully porous sub- 2 µm particles and operating them at high temperature to reduce the solvent viscosity, thus reducing the column backpressure. The developed method could increase the number of theoretical plates compared to a single column at 30 ºC. The approach of column coupling was applicable for both isocratic and gradient mode of separation. Also, fast analysis methods were proposed based on using either a <b>column</b> <b>packed</b> with fully porous sub- 2 μm particles and operated at high temperature or a <b>column</b> <b>packed</b> with superficially porous particles as a tool to increase the analysis speed. An ultra-fast green method was also proposed by using a short narrow bore <b>column</b> <b>packed</b> with fully porous particles. In addition, the chromatographic performance of <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with fused-core particles was investigated and compared to that of fully porous particles (sub- 2 µm) at elevated temperature and extended column lengths. The study involved a comparison of chromatographic parameters such as retention, selectivity, resolution, efficiency and pressure drop. This study demonstrated that the fused-core particles can produce key advantages over the sub- 2 µm particle columns in terms of separation speed, resolution and efficiency. All the developed methods were validated and applied to the analysis of environmental pollutants in surface water and/or waste water.

40|$|Fosthiazate is an organophosphorus {{nematicide}} {{which was}} recently included in Annex I of the Directive 91 / 414 /EEC under the clause {{that it should}} be used with special care in soils vulnerable to leaching. Thus, the leaching of fosthiazate was investigated in <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with three different soils which represented situations of high (site 2), intermediate (site 1) and low (site 3) leaching potential. The recommended dose of fosthiazate was applied at the surface of the soil columns and fosthiazate fate and transport was investigated for the next two months. Fosthiazate concentrations in the leachate collected {{from the bottom of the}} <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with soil from site 2 exceeded 0. 1 μg l- 1 in most cases. This soil was characterized as acidic, indicating longer fosthiazate persistence, with low organic matter content, indicating weak adsorption, thus representing a situation vulnerable to leaching. In contrast, the lowest concentrations of fosthiazate in the leachate were evident in the <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with soil from site 3. This soil was characterized as alkaline, indicating faster degradation, with higher organic matter content, indicating stronger adsorption, thus representing a situation not favoring leaching of fosthiazate. The highest concentration of fosthiazate in the leachate from the <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with soil from site 2 was 3. 44 μg l- 1 compared to 1. 17 and 0. 16 μg l- 1, which were the corresponding maximum values measured in <b>columns</b> <b>packed</b> with soil from sites 1 and 3, respectively. The results of the current study further suggest that fosthiazate is mobile in soil and can leach under conducive soil conditions like acidic soils with low organic matter content. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Like {{other forms}} of chromatography, {{increasing}} the column length enhances resolution, and increasing the column diameter increases column capacity. Proper <b>column</b> <b>packing</b> is important for maximum resolution: An over-packed column can collapse the pores in the beads, resulting {{in a loss of}} resolution. An under-packed column can reduce the relative surface area of the stationary phase accessible to smaller species, resulting in those species spending less time trapped in pores. Unlike affinity chromatography techniques, a solvent head {{at the top of the}} column can drastically diminish resolution as the sample diffuses prior to loading, broadening the downstream elution.|$|E
50|$|Still, {{the use of}} the {{hydrodynamic}} volume, a size {{based on}} dynamical properties, in the interpretation of SEC data is not fully understood. This is because SEC is typically run under low flow rate conditions where hydrodynamic factor should have little effect on the separation. In fact, both theory and computer simulations assume a thermodynamic separation principle: the separation process is determined by the equilibrium distribution (partitioning) of solute macromolecules between two phases --- a dilute bulk solution phase located at the interstitial space and confined solution phases within the pores of <b>column</b> <b>packing</b> material. Based on this theory, {{it has been shown that}} the relevant size parameter to the partitioning of polymers in pores is the mean span dimension (mean maximal projection onto a line). Although this issue has not been fully resolved, it is likely that the mean span dimension and the hydrodynamic volume are strongly correlated.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{absolute}} instrumental {{approach was}} also {{possible with the}} development of light scattering theory by Einstein, Raman, Debye, Zimm, and others. The problem with measurements made using membrane osmometry and sedimentation was that they only characterized the bulk properties of the polymer sample. Moreover, the measurements were excessively time consuming and prone to operator error. In order to gain information about a polydisperse mixture of molar masses, a method for separating the different sizes was developed. This was achieved by the advent of size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC is {{based on the fact that}} the pores in the packing material of chromatography columns could be made small enough for molecules to become temporarily lodged in their interstitial spaces. As the sample makes its way through a column the smaller molecules spend more time traveling in these void spaces than the larger ones, which have fewer places to [...] "wander". The result is that a sample is separated according to its hydrodynamic volume [...] As a consequence, the big molecules come out first, and then the small ones follow in the elutent. By choosing a suitable <b>column</b> <b>packing</b> material it is possible to define the resolution of the system. Columns can also be combined in series to increase resolution or the range of sizes studied.|$|E
