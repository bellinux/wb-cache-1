5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} herbaceous plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and <b>cinquefoil</b> (Potentilla).|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby <b>cinquefoil,</b> fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur <b>cinquefoil.</b> Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E

5000|$|The {{north and}} south aisle windows are late Gothic in character, from the 16th century, {{although}} they have been repaired several times, modern cusping being inserted. In the north aisle there are four windows, the eastern of two <b>cinquefoiled</b> lights with tracery under a pointed head, the next two square-headed, of three and four <b>cinquefoiled</b> lights respectively, and the fourth also square-headed, of three <b>cinquefoiled</b> lights. Between {{the third and fourth}} windows is a round-headed north doorway with a plain quarter-round moulding of uncertain but not ancient date; Pevsner described the porch as [...] "Elizabethan-looking".|$|R
5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in <b>cinquefoil,</b> cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple <b>cinquefoil,</b> and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
25|$|The trefoil, quatrefoil and <b>cinquefoil</b> are {{abstract}} forms resembling {{flowers or}} leaves. The trefoil is always shown slipped (i.e. with a stem), unless blazoned otherwise. The <b>cinquefoil</b> is sometimes blazoned fraise (strawberry flower), most notably when canting for Fraser. The trillium flower occurs occasionally in a Canadian context, and the protea flower constantly appears in South Africa, {{since it is}} the national flower symbol.|$|E

25|$|The central chancel east {{window is}} of five lights, {{separated}} by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoilslobes {{formed by the}} overlapping of five circlesand spandrels. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two Tudor windows, both wider than high. The window to the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched <b>cinquefoil</b> heads, and is clear glazed. The window to the west is of five lights, again with arched <b>cinquefoil</b> heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.|$|E

25|$|The nave {{is defined}} by the {{clerestory}} above the abutted north and south aisle roofs. The clerestory contains three clear glazed windows on the north wall and three on the south, each of twin-lights surrounded by shallow-top arches within deep hood moulds. The windows at the south are point-headed and of plain tracery, those at the north round-headed with <b>cinquefoil</b> cusping—lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles. The clerestory parapet is of plain stone construction, overhangs the wall, and has a coped top.|$|E
25|$|The 1448 south chapel {{sits on a}} moulded plinth {{which runs}} over two twin-stepped buttresses, one angled and central to the south wall, the other {{diagonal}} on the south-east corner. The buttresses are topped by square-based pinnacles with blind cusped panels, crocketed above gables at each side, the pinnacle at the south-east finished with a finial. The parapet is embattled with moulded coping, which runs as a gable end at the east end and includes a central cross above. At the roof line {{at the base of}} the parapet and the buttress tops runs a moulded cill band—angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face—which continues around the east side and follows the line of the gable end. Either side of the south wall buttress is a three light window with <b>cinquefoil</b> heads, with six panels above with trefoil heads, enclosed in a moulded surround, and set with stained glass. The window opening has a flattened arch above the spring with a following hood mould. The 1460–70 north chapel also sits on a moulded plinth. Its angle buttresses are similar style to the south chapel, including cill band, although four in number on the north wall defining three external bays with three windows. These and the chapel east window are all of three lights with simple 'Y' tracery and <b>cinquefoil</b> heads.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp <b>cinquefoil,</b> lesser spearwort, common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E

25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh <b>cinquefoil</b> (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E
25|$|Both {{north and}} south chapels have canopied niches: the south chapel one each {{either side of a}} c.1916 stained glass window; the north, one at the {{north-east}} corner. The north chapel also contains a piscina. In the south chapel at the east wall, in an opening leading from the chapel to the chancel, is a blind doorway. At the south side is a piscina, an aumbry and a stoup. There is an elaborate canopied relief tomb niche, without tomb, with internal arch, with decorative bosses above, holding a <b>cinquefoil</b> with foliate bosses attached, and spandrels containing shields. The south chapel west stained glass window is c.1892. The north chapel has mirrored a more elaborate tomb niche including spandrels containing angels holding shields, and a castellated top with foliate cross.|$|E
25|$|In {{the south}} chapel {{there is a}} {{commemorative}} brass plaque to William Strood and his wife Agnes, both of whom died in 1448. Also are three marble tablets to the Gregory family. One has an ogee-arched head with <b>cinquefoil</b> and bosses surmounted by a foliate cross, with square columns either side each topped with a crocketted pinnacle. The secondin {{the shape of a}} tomb face, of white marble and topped with coat of arms, sitting on and set in front of a black marble supportis dedicated to Daniel Gregory (died 9 June 1819, aged 72), the fourth son of George Gregory of Harlaxton and his wife, Anne. The monument was provided by the deceased's brother George De Ligne Gregory. The third, of similar style, but topped by a knight's helmet and two coat of arms, is dedicated to George De Ligne Gregory (1 May 1740 - 24 August 1822).|$|E

25|$|Joan Kerr {{indicates}} that St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn {{was one of}} Blacket's favourite buildings, as, unlike his cathedrals in Sydney and Perth, he was not hampered either by distance, or a previous architect's foundations. It was here that Blacket was able to really indulge a love of Flowing Decorated ornamentation. There are three very large windows, of seven and six lights in the chancel and transept ends, each with highly elaborate and distinct tracery, inspired by, but not identical to, famous Medieval windows. That in the North transept has a wheel based on the Visconti emblem of a window in Milan Cathedral, but by the judicious placement of two small tracery lights, Blacket has {{turned it into a}} sunflower, an emblem frequently used by one of the stained glass firms he employed, Lyon and Cottier. Other decorative features include the foliate carving of the capitals, much of it in the stiff-leaf style of Wells Cathedral; pierced <b>cinquefoil</b> openings in panels above the hammerbeams; and a screen of white New Zealand stone. The stained glass includes windows by two of England's major firms: John Hardman & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and Sydney's two leading firms: Lyon and Cottier and Ashwin and Falconer.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in limestone rubble, with some ironstone banding, and ashlar dressings. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with a clerestory and north and south aisles, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower dates from the 12thcentury and is in three stages. Its parapet is embattled, and has pinnacles and gargoyles at the corners. Pieces of stone decorated with chevrons have been incorporated {{in the fabric of}} the tower. In the top stage are paired bell openings on the north, west and south sides. In the middle stage is a round-headed window on the south side, and a lancet window on the west. A large vertical stone, possibly a former cross shaft, {{has been used as a}} quoin in the northwest corner of the nave. In the west wall of the north aisle is a small 12th-century round-headed window. Its north wall contains a blocked doorway and two 13th-century lancet windows; there is another lancet window in the east wall. In the north wall of the chancel is a blocked doorway which formerly led to a north chapel. The east wall contains a 19th-century two-light window, and outside the east wall are the foundations of a former apse. In the south wall of the chancel is a 14th-century two-light window with a <b>cinquefoil</b> above it. The south aisle has two-light windows with ogee heads in its east and south walls. The south doorway has a pointed arch. In both the north and south sides of the clerestory are two windows with paired lights.|$|E
