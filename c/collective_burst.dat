40|$|Several {{experimental}} and numerical studies {{have observed that}} populations of oscillatory neurons can synchronize and converge to an dynamical attractor composed of periodic bursts which involve the whole network. We show here that a sufficient condition for this phenomenon to occur {{is the presence of}} an excitatory population of oscillatory neurons displaying spike-driven adaptation, which was observed for cultured pyramidal neurons from the cortex or the hippocampus. More than just synchronization – which takes place even for weak coupling – bursting occurs for stronger coupling as the adaptive neurons switch from their initial adaptive spiking to an intermittent burst-like behavior. Addition of inhibitory neurons or plastic synapses can then modulate this dynamics in many ways but is not necessary for its appearance. After discussing the origin of the bursting behavior, we provide a detailed analytic and numerical description of such dynamics, as well as the evolution of its properties depending on the neuronal and synaptic parameters. This allows us to explain the change in the neuronal dynamics and the phenomenon underlying the termination of a burst. We based our study on a mean-field model for adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF or AdEx) neurons, thanks to which we discuss the related biological phenomena and the relevance of the explored region of parameter space. A sufficient condition for synchronous bursting in neuronal population is the existence of a population of excitatory neurons displaying spike-driven adaptation and oscillatory behavior. For strong enough coupling, the adaptive neurons not only synchronize but switch from their initial regular spiking to an emergent and intermittent burst-like behavior. Using a 2 D dynamical system, we provide a detailed analytic and numerical description of such dynamics based on a simplified mean-field model. This leads to a minimal model, based on a hypothesis that can be tested experimentally, which not only reproduces the biological observations but also provides an explanation to the underlying phenomena involved in synchronous bursting. Indeed we propose possible mechanisms for both the initiation and termination of a <b>collective</b> <b>burst</b> as well as analytic results to predict the properties of the global activity and its evolution depending on neuronal and synaptic parameters...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the origin of}} bursty dynamics in natural and social processes we provide a general analysis framework in which the temporal process is decomposed into subprocesses and then the bursts in subprocesses, called contextual bursts, are combined to <b>collective</b> <b>bursts</b> in the original process. For the combination of subprocesses, it is required to consider the distribution of different contexts over the original process. Based on minimal assumptions for interevent time statistics, we present a theoretical analysis {{for the relationship between}} contextual and collective interevent time distributions. Our analysis framework helps to exploit contextual information available in decomposable bursty dynamics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCultures of dissociated neurons are an {{invaluable}} experimental tool in studying neuronal networks at an intermediate scale in an in vitro controlled physico-chemical environment. Moreover, current micro-fabrication techniques allow {{the design of}} a custom connectivity between subpopulations, which could make it possible to carry out computations with devices involving living cells. The Quorum Percolation (QP) model has been designed in the context of neurobiology to describe bursts of activity occurring in neuronal cultures {{from the point of view}} of collective phenomena rather than from a dynamical synchronization approach. Such a model is well suited to describe triggered activity in neuronal devices, and its generic character points at the necessity of heavily structured devices to go beyond <b>collective</b> <b>bursting.</b> We derive a continuous extension of the QP model, seen as information propagation on a non-metric directed graph, and discuss how its critical behavior might give insight on the connectivity of neuronal networks. The link with metric graphs, embedded in a two-dimensional space, is tackled by the introduction a model, where axon growth is constrained by obstacles such as plots and channels. This provides a starting point for the construction of neuronal devices in vitro capable of more complex behaviors. Lastly, we show how simulations of bursts with a dynamical adaptive integrate-and-fire model can be interpreted in terms of quorum percolation, confirming the resilience of this synchronized behavior...|$|R
40|$|A minimal {{athermal}} {{model for}} the flow of dense disordered materials is proposed, based on two generic ingredients: local plastic events occuring above a microscopic yield stress, and the non-local elastic release of the stress these events induce in the material. A complex spatio-temporal rheological behaviour results, with features in line with recent experimental observations. At low shear rates, macroscopic flow actually originates from <b>collective</b> correlated <b>bursts</b> of plastic events, taking place in dynamically generated fragile zones. The related correlation length diverges algebraically at small shear rates. In confined geometries bursts occur preferentially close to the walls yielding an intermittent form of flow localization.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to complex systems, more {{particularly}} to neural networks. Disassociated in vitro rat brain neuron cultures show, {{under a variety of}} experimental contexts, a spontaneous electrical activity. This activity manifests itself by a rapid succession of ignitions of a large fraction of neurons named <b>collective</b> <b>bursts.</b> The study of the initiators of these bursts is one of the conceptual problems underlying the spontaneous electrical activity. A study of Eytan and Marom showed that some "first to fire" cells exist. In this thesis, we study these particular neurons, through a detailed analysis of data obtained by the multi-electrode array methods and simulations. We have established that some cells are triggering bursts beyond a simple statistical effect of being the first. These particular cells are called leaders. The analysis of experimental data indicates that the long term dynamics of the leaders is relatively robust and that these leaders are not only the main initiators of bursts, but, the burst itself carries traces indicating which of the leaders has initiated the burst. The study of simulations using the leaky integrate and fire neuron model permitted us to find out that leaders form naturally from a balanced combination of inputs, outputs, their local neighborhood and their own properties. Basically, a leader is an excitatory neuron, has a low membrane potential firing threshold, sends a signal to a lot of excitatory neurons as well as to a few inhibitory neurons and a leader receives only a few signals from other excitatory neurons...|$|R
40|$|We {{found that}} a network-organized metapopulation of cooperators, defectors and {{destructive}} agents playing the public goods game with mutations, can collectively reach global synchronization or chimera states. Global synchronization {{is accompanied by a}} <b>collective</b> periodic <b>burst</b> of cooperation, whereas chimera states reflect the tendency of the networked metapopulation to be fragmented in clusters of synchronous and incoherent bursts of cooperation. Numerical simulations have shown that the system's dynamics alternates between these two steady states through a first order transition. Depending on the parameters determining the dynamical and topological properties, chimera states with different numbers of coherent and incoherent clusters are observed. Our results present the first systematic study of chimera states and their characterization in the context of evolutionary game theory. This provides a valuable insight into the details of their occurrence, extending the relevance of such states to natural and social systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} superradiant {{evolution}} {{of a set of}} $N$ two-level systems spontaneously radiating under the effect of phase-breaking mechanisms. We investigate the dynamics generated by non-radiative losses and pure dephasing, and their interplay with spontaneous emission. Our results show that in the parameter region relevant to many solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, even with a dephasing rate much faster than the radiative lifetime of a single two-level system, a sub-optimal <b>collective</b> superfluorescent <b>burst</b> is still observable. We also apply our theory to the dilute excitation regime, often used to describe optical excitations in solid-state systems. In this regime, excitations can be described in terms of bright and dark bosonic quasiparticles. We show how the effect of dephasing and losses in this regime translates into inter-mode scattering rates and quasiparticle lifetimes.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>collective</b> dynamics of <b>bursting</b> neurons on clustered network. The clustered network {{is composed of}} subnetworks each presenting a small-world property, and in a given subnetwork each neuron has a probability {{to be connected to}} the other subnetworks. We give bounds for the critical coupling strength to obtain global burst synchronization in terms of the network structure, i. e., intracluster and intercluster probabilities connections. As the heterogeneity in the network is reduced the network global synchronization is improved. We show that the transitions to global synchrony may be abrupt or smooth depending on the intercluster probability...|$|R

40|$|All {{higher order}} central nervous systems exhibit {{spontaneous}} neural activity, though {{the purpose and}} mechanistic origin of such activity remains poorly understood. We explore the ignition and spread of <b>collective</b> spontaneous electrophysiological <b>burst</b> activity in networks of cultured cortical neurons growing on microelectrode arrays using information theory and first-spike-in-burst analysis methods. We show the presence of burst leader neurons, which form a mono-synaptically connected primary circuit, and initiate a majority of network bursts. Leader/follower firing delay times form temporally stable positively skewed distributions. Blocking inhibitory synapses usually results in shorter delay times with reduced variance. These distributions are generalized characterizations of internal network dynamics and provide estimates of pair-wise synaptic distances. We show that mutual information between neural nodes {{is a function of}} distance, which is maintained under disinhibition. The resulting analysis produces specific quantitative constraints and insights into the activation patterns of collective neuronal activity in self-organized cortical networks, which may prove useful for models emulating spontaneously active systems.

40|$|As it {{has been}} shown by pump-probe {{experiments}} electron injection at the interface between a dye molecule and mesoporous TiO 2 proceeds with rates exceeding 1 x 10 (13) s(- 1). However, similar dye-TiO 2 systems exhibit residual dye emission with lifetimes extending into the long nanosecond range. To address this inhomogeneity of injection rates time-correlated single photon counting microscopy was used to compare the emission behavior of dye-sensitized mesoporous films of TiO 2 with that of individual anatase nanoparticles that had undergone extensive dialysis. The sensitized films produce intense residual emission with multiexponential decay components as long as 220 ns. The channels of mesoporous films contain physisorbed and trapped dye, which is the dominant source of the emission. It is likely that the wide range of lifetimes reflects the distribution of mean free paths experienced by the loose dye molecules diffusing within the film prior to undergoing oxidative quenching. In contrast, the intensity of emission from individual nanoparticles from which the loose dye was removed by dialysis is orders of magnitude lower. The lifetimes obtained from such particles are much shorter, with the primary component on a sub-nanosecond time scale. The presence of residual emission with a 230 ps lifetime shows that even on the surfaces of dialyzed nanoparticles there is a fraction of sensitizer molecules that do not inject electrons with the same high rate as is observed in ultrafast pump-probe experiments on films. Since the physisorbed dye was removed from these samples by dialysis, the residual emission is likely to originate from dye molecules bound to surface defects. Unusual <b>collective</b> emission <b>bursts</b> were observed in some of the measurements on sensitized nanoparticles. We attribute this behavior to stimulated emission from individual nanocrystallites. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Presented on November 2, 2011 from 3 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm In Room 1116 of the Marcus Nanotechnology building. Runtime: 68 : 37 minutes“Cogito ergo sum. ” In the {{physical}} sciences, {{there is a}} long history of thinking about thinking, going back {{at least as far as}} René Descartes’ famous pronouncement. Much more recently, a combination of neuroscientists and physicists realized that it is possible to explore the dynamics of interacting neurons using ideas borrowed from nonlinear dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. The nervous system contains many reasonably small collections of neurons that collectively generate a well-defined pattern of electrical activity, which continues even when those collections of cells are removed from the animal. These functional groups of neurons are now termed central pattern generators. While understanding such restricted systems does not necessarily elucidate such sublime questions as those regarding the nature of consciousness, these studies do provide an intriguing example of an application of statistical mechanics to biology. They also admit quantitative comparisons to experiment! In this talk I present a minimal model for one such central pattern generator based on the interaction of nonlinear dynamical systems interacting on a quenched random network. No biological background will be assumed and, fortunately, very little will be required for exploring how a simple model of coupled excitatory neurons can produce <b>collective</b> and metronomic <b>bursts</b> of activity that controls the breathing rhythm in mammals. I will focus on how topological properties of the random network of neuronal connections controls the collective dynamical phase diagram of the system. I will conclude with some new extensions of this work to the building of similarly simple models of the global and rhythmic dynamics of the neocortex, the seat of consciousness and the paragon of complexity that produced “Cogito ergo sum. ...|$|R
