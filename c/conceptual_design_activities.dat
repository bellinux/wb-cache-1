Based on the inventive principles of TRIZ, this paper presents a novel design method by integrating technical and physical contradiction analysis methods into the <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> of new product development (NPD).

40|$|The DEMO reactor is {{expected}} to be the first application of fusion for electricity generation in the near future. To this aim <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> are progressing in Europe (EU) under the lead of the EUROfusion Consortium in order to drive on the development of the major tokamak systems. In 2014 the activities carried out by the magnet system project team were focused on the Toroidal Field (TF) magnet system design and demonstrated major achievements in terms of concept proposals and of consolidated evaluations against design criteria. Several magnet system R&D activities were conducted in parallel, together with broad investigations on High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) technologies.

40|$|Decisions {{made during}} {{conceptual}} design have {{significant influence on}} the cost, performance, reliability, safety and environmental impact of a product. It {{has been estimated that}} design decisions account for more than 75 % of final product costs. It is, therefore, vital that designers have access to the right tools to support such design activities. In the early 1980 s, researchers began to realize the impact of design decisions on downstream activities. As a result, different methodologies such as design for assembly, design for manufacturing and concurrent engineering, have been proposed. Software tools that implement these methodologies have also been developed. However, most of these tools are only applicable in the detailed design phase. Yet, even the highest standard of detailed design cannot compensate for a poor design concept formulated at the conceptual design phase. In spite of this, few CAD tools have been developed to support <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> <b>activities.</b> This is because knowledge of the design requirements and constraints during this early phase of a product's life cycle is usually imprecise and incomplete, making it difficult to utilize computer-based systems or prototypes. However, recent advances in fields such as fuzzy logic, computational geometry, constraints programming and so on have now made it possible for researchers to tackle some of the challenging issues in dealing with <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> <b>activities.</b> In this special issue, we have gathered together discussions on various aspects of conceptual design phase: from the capturing of the designer's intent, to modelling design constraints and solving them in an efficient manner, to verifying the correctness of the design...|$|E

During these stages, the designer makes important decisions about the parameters of a model that are aimed at satisfying a set of design criteria.

40|$|Background This {{investigation}} {{examines the}} role and use of sketching as tool of <b>design</b> representation during <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> <b>activity.</b> In particular we focus upon sketching’s relationship with problem framing and solution-focused strategies and reasoning in the proposition, exploration and development of solution ideas. This research was conducted to contribute to furthering {{knowledge and understanding of}} sketching for use in design pedagogy and the development of <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> tools. Methods In a qualitative content analysis (QCA) a coding frame based upon the constructs naming, framing, moving and reflecting is employed in the analysis of a concept design protocol using the think-aloud method. The protocol’s transcriptions were segmented before being encoded through the concept-driven coding frame. The analysis and discussion of results proceeds through reference to the encoded protocol data and is supported by the synchronic charting of <b>design</b> <b>activity.</b> Results Sketching <b>activity</b> during <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> provides opportunities for previous frames of reference to re-emerge and be re-engaged in new ways. The act of sketching appeared to facilitate frequent shifts of attention to and from sub-problems and sub-solutions. This thus provided opportunities to laterally explore different aspects of emergent solution ideas in a concurrent manner. These frequent shifting of attention may act as a catalyst for appositional reasoning across different aspects of the design problem. The participant’s solution-focused thoughts appeared to both influence and be influenced by sketching activity, affording fresh insights and perspectives to emerge. Conclusion The study of sketching and other tools of design representation provides opportunities to better understand the kinds of designerly ways of knowing, thinking and action required in practice. Findings have implications for design pedagogy and the development of <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> tools. clos...|$|R
