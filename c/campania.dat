5|$|The {{wreck of}} HMS <b>Campania</b> was {{initially}} afforded {{protection under the}} Protection of Wrecks Act, being designated in 2000. This designation was revoked in 2013 when the site was re-designated as a Historic Marine Protected Area under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. The remains of the four <b>Campania</b> aircraft and seven 1½ Strutters that she had on board when she sank are still entombed in her wreck.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 <b>Campania</b> had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. <b>Campania</b> now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey <b>Campania.</b> The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times <b>Campania</b> also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|Derby della <b>Campania</b> {{generally}} {{refers to}} a rivalry with regional clubs, mainly Avellino and Salernitana. However, both teams have largely played in the lower divisions and meetings are largely limited to the Coppa Italia.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Campania</b> was a {{seaplane}} {{tender and}} aircraft carrier, converted from an elderly ocean liner by the Royal Navy {{early in the}} First World War. After her conversion was completed in mid-1915 the ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with the Grand Fleet. These revealed {{the need for a}} longer flight deck to allow larger aircraft to take off, and she was modified accordingly. <b>Campania</b> missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, but made a number of patrols with elements of the Grand Fleet. She never saw combat and was soon relegated to a training role because of her elderly machinery. In November 1918 <b>Campania</b> was anchored with the capital ships of the Grand Fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchors to drag. She hit several of the ships and the collisions punctured her hull; she slowly sank, with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in <b>Campania,</b> {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt as more a major crime wave than an armed rebellion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Campania</b> {{failed to}} receive the signal to deploy when the Grand Fleet {{departed}} Scapa Flow on 30 May 1916 {{en route to the}} Battle of Jutland, but she sailed two hours and fifteen minutes later. Even though she was slowly overtaking the fleet early in the morning of 31 May, she was ordered to return to Scapa Flow as she lacked an escort and German submarines had been reported in the area. The ship participated in some anti-submarine and anti-Zeppelin patrols, but she was later declared unfit for fleet duty because of her defective machinery and became a seaplane training and balloon depot ship. In April 1918 <b>Campania,</b> along with the Grand Fleet, was transferred from Scapa Flow to Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Campania</b> {{was built}} by the Castellammare shipyard, where her keel was laid on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Basilicata. The ships were small enough that they could be built on the same slipway. They were {{launched}} {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. After Fitting-out work was completed, Campannia was commissioned on 18 May 1917, four months before her sister ship. Designed as a colonial cruiser in the mold of the cruiser , <b>Campania</b> spent the first several years of her career in Italy's African colonies, including Italian Libya. On 1 July 1921, the ship was reclassified as a gunboat and two of her 152mm guns were removed during reconstruction work that lasted until 1922. Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, <b>Campania,</b> Apulia, and Calabria, {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|The first land {{grant in}} Nescopeck Township was located {{to the west}} of Big Wapwallopen Creek. It was known as the <b>Campania</b> Tract and it was {{surveyed}} to Daniel Grant in 1769. The tract was patented to George Campbell in 1773. Prince Maximilian of Wied visited the area near the creek during his travels in North America.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. <b>Campania</b> and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. <b>Campania</b> was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of {{politics}} at this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to <b>Campania</b> that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD23, Drusus mysteriously died, and Tiberius {{seems to have}} {{made no effort to}} elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} {{interval}} {{of three years}} between Germanicus' and Drusus' first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father. The hardship {{of the last two}} years on his father had made him reclusive. For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to <b>Campania,</b> leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{began to}} bolster his {{personal}} forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar. On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in <b>Campania.</b> By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 denarii.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, {{only one}} reached hurricane status, the fewest since 1890. Furthermore, that storm strengthened into major hurricane, which is Category3 or {{higher on the}} modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. This storm, which was the fourth and strongest hurricane of the season, peaked at Category3 strength with 120mph (195km/h) winds. It was also attributed to at least six fatalities after sending a rogue wave across the steerage of the steamer <b>Campania.</b> The first storm also resulted in two deaths after a schooner wrecked in Barbados.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of <b>Campania)</b> to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals {{is to reduce the}} time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two or three days.|$|E
5|$|After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus {{were named}} as consuls and assumed the fasces {{in place of}} Carinus and Numerianus. Bassus {{was a member of}} a senatorial family from <b>Campania,</b> a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction. He was skilled in areas of {{government}} where Diocletian presumably had no experience. Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, his refusal to accept second-tier status to any other emperor, and his willingness to continue the long-standing collaboration between the empire's senatorial and military aristocracies. It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.|$|E
5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} <b>Campania.</b> Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into its}} existence, the Italian Football Championship {{was limited to}} just Northern clubs, so Southern clubs competed against sailors or in cups such as Thomas Lipton's Lipton Challenge Cup. In the cup competed between Naples and Palermo FBC, Naples won three finals. The foreign {{contingent}} at the club broke off in 1912 to form Internazionale Napoli, in time for both club's debut in the Italian Championship of 1912–13. Though the sides had a keen rivalry in the <b>Campania</b> section, they were not as successful outside of it {{and a few years}} after World War I, they merged as Foot-Ball Club Internazionale-Naples, also known as FBC Internaples.|$|E
5|$|Geraldine Ferraro {{was born}} on August 26, 1935 in Newburgh, New York, the {{daughter}} of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, <b>Campania)</b> and owner of two restaurants. She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. Her father {{died of a heart}} attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the garment industry to support them.|$|E
5|$|In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen {{opened the}} gates to the Normans. The Norman army {{proceeded}} to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and <b>Campania</b> were in revolt. He {{also learned that}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was {{at the gates of}} Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Penney {{and some}} of his staff {{returned}} by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 for his role in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view of the degree of radioactive contamination, he felt he could not leave his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of Narvik in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Monte Bello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on <b>Campania,</b> which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. Hawkesbury continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus again {{attempted}} to marry into the Julio-Claudian family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier, he requested marriage with Drusus's widow Livilla in AD 25, possibly {{with an eye}} towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} a potential successor. The emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank. Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his paranoia towards Agrippina and the Senate, he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of <b>Campania,</b> which he did in AD 26, and finally to the island of Capri, where he lived until his death in AD 37. Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius and the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} record contains few details of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, {{was little more than a}} child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in <b>Campania,</b> after which he disappears from the {{historical record}}.|$|E
5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the <b>Campania</b> province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E
25|$|Palma <b>Campania</b> culture {{takes shape}} {{at the end}} of the third {{millennium}} BC and is representative of the Early Bronze Age of <b>Campania.</b> It owes its name to the locality of Palma <b>Campania</b> where the first findings were made.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey <b>Campania</b> was a British ship-borne, {{patrol and}} {{reconnaissance}} aircraft of the First World War and Russian Civil War. It was a single-engine, two-seat biplane with twin main floats and backward-folding wings. The <b>Campania</b> {{was the first}} aeroplane ever designed specifically for carrier operations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Campania</b> was {{declared}} obsolete in August 1919.|$|E
25|$|The rest of <b>Campania,</b> {{with the}} {{exception}} of Naples, adopted the Latin language as official and was Romanised. As part of the Roman Empire, <b>Campania,</b> with Latium, formed the most important region of the Augustan divisions of Italia; <b>Campania</b> {{was one of the main}} areas for granary. Roman Emperors chose <b>Campania</b> as a holiday destination, among them Claudius and Tiberius, the latter of whom is infamously linked to the island of Capri. It was also during this period that Christianity came to <b>Campania.</b> Two of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, are said to have preached in the city of Naples, and there were also several martyrs during this time. Unfortunately, the period of relative calm was violently interrupted by the epic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. With the Decline of the Roman Empire, its last emperor, Romulus Augustus, was put in a manor house prison near Castel dell'Ovo, Naples, in 476, ushering in the beginning of the Middle Ages and a period of uncertainty in regard to the future of the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} <b>Campania</b> is rich {{with a vast}} array of culture and history. Since the Greek colony of Elea, now Velia, <b>Campania</b> was home to {{philosophers}} of the Pre-Socratic philosophy school, such as Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, who came to prominence around 490–480 BC. The Latin poet Vergil (70 BC–19 BC) settled in Naples in his late life: parts of his epic poem Aeneid are located in <b>Campania.</b> The ancient scientist Pliny the Elder studied Mount Vesuvius, and died after being poisoned and killed by gas emitted from the volcano during the 79 AD eruption.|$|E
25|$|The Naples dialect, a {{distinct}} language which is mainly spoken in the city, {{is also found}} in the region of <b>Campania,</b> and has been diffused to other areas of Southern Italy by Neapolitan migrants. On 14 October 2008, a law was passed by the Region of <b>Campania,</b> stating that the Neapolitan language was to be legally protected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campania</b> is home {{to several}} {{national}} football, water polo, volleyball, basketball and tennis clubs.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy, {{in the last}} decade the region of <b>Campania</b> has not attracted large numbers of immigrants. The Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated in January 2007 that 98,052 foreign-born immigrants live in <b>Campania,</b> equal to 1.7% of the total regional population. Part of {{the reason for this is}} in recent times, there have been more employment opportunities in northern regions than in the Southern Italian regions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campania</b> {{produces}} wines including Lacryma Christi, Fiano, Aglianico, Greco di Tufo, Pere 'e palomma, Ischitano, Taburno, Solopaca, and Taurasi. The cheeses of <b>Campania</b> {{consist of}} Mozzarella di Bufala (buffalo mozzarella) (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), fiordilatte ("flower of milk") a mozzarella made from cow's milk, ricotta from sheep or buffalo milk, provolone from cow milk, and caciotta made from goat milk. Buffalo are bred in Salerno and Caserta.|$|E
25|$|Rome had an {{affinity}} {{for the people of}} <b>Campania,</b> who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans. The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in <b>Campania.</b> The Italic speakers in Latium had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} of the montage and decoration {{may be explained by}} proximity to advanced metalworking centers such as those of Taranto or <b>Campania.</b>|$|E
