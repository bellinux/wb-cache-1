5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster <b>clauses</b> into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality <b>clauses</b> are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such <b>clauses</b> are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster <b>clauses</b> cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more <b>clauses,</b> that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other <b>clauses</b> are subordinate to it. Subordinate <b>clauses</b> may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative <b>clauses</b> are <b>clauses</b> that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative <b>clauses</b> can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate <b>clauses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the <b>clauses</b> in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some <b>clauses</b> of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the <b>clauses</b> of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E

5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate <b>clauses</b> with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used to}} form complement <b>clauses</b> for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
5|$|Verbs {{are marked}} for {{grammatical}} information in three distinct sets of inflectional paradigms, called Verb orders. Each order corresponds generally {{to one of}} three main sentence types: the Independent order is used in main <b>clauses,</b> the Conjunct order in subordinate <b>clauses,</b> and the Imperative order in commands.|$|E

50|$|In {{non-functional}} linguistics, {{a simple}} complete sentence {{consists of a}} single <b>clause.</b> In functional linguistics, a sentence is typically associated with a <b>clause</b> and a <b>clause</b> can be either a <b>clause</b> simplex or a <b>clause</b> complex. A <b>clause</b> is a <b>clause</b> simplex if it represents a single process going on through time {{and it is a}} <b>clause</b> complex if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more <b>clause</b> simplexes.|$|R

5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such <b>clauses</b> are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence <b>clauses.</b>|$|E
5|$|All of the {{foregoing}} constitutional provisions apply exclusively to criminal matters. In contrast, the due process and equal protection <b>clauses</b> have substantial application outside of the criminal law.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal <b>clauses</b> that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal <b>clauses</b> {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In <b>clauses</b> with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
50|$|Contract {{claims are}} handled under the {{disputes}} <b>clause</b> in commercial items contracts or another <b>clause</b> {{in different types}} of contracts.

50|$|A center {{embedded}} sentence {{is difficult to}} comprehend when a relative <b>clause</b> is embedded in another relative <b>clause.</b> Comprehension becomes easier when the types of <b>clause</b> are different -- when a complement <b>clause</b> is embedded in a relative <b>clause</b> or when a relative <b>clause</b> is embedded in a complement <b>clause.</b> For example- The man who heard that the dog had been killed on the radio ran away.|$|R
40|$|East Asian {{languages}} like Korean and Japanese are {{stocked with}} {{various types of}} clausal complex noun phrases. Among these phrase types, the gapless relative <b>clause</b> construction is exceptional in {{that there is no}} gap in the adnominal <b>clause,</b> unlike ordinary relative <b>clause</b> construction. The gapless relative <b>clause</b> construction is similar to noun complement <b>clause</b> construction syntactically because both constructions have no gap in the adnominal <b>clause,</b> but the gapless relative <b>clause</b> construction is different from the noun complement <b>clause</b> construction in the semantic and morphological respects. Therefore, {{it is difficult to determine}} to which construction the gapless relative construction belongs. This dissertation claims that the gapless relative <b>clause</b> construction is a subtype of relative <b>clause</b> construction, not of noun complement, because it shares many properties with the ordinary/gappy relative <b>clause</b> construction except for the existence of a gap. The gapless relative <b>clause</b> construction also has a unique semantic property that a cause and effect relation holds between the adnominal <b>clause</b> and the head noun...|$|R
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main <b>clauses,</b> for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent <b>clauses.</b> (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By breaking up long <b>clauses</b> into multiple smaller <b>clauses,</b> and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E

50|$|Here again, in {{the first}} {{sentence}} the if <b>clause</b> {{may or may not}} be true; the then <b>clause</b> {{may or may not be}} true but certainly (according to the speaker) is true conditional on the if <b>clause</b> being true. Here both the if <b>clause</b> and the then <b>clause</b> are in the present indicative. In the second sentence, the if <b>clause</b> is not true, while the then <b>clause</b> may or may not be true but certainly would be true in the counterfactual circumstance of the if <b>clause</b> being true. In this sentence the if <b>clause</b> is in the past subjunctive form of the subjunctive mood, and the then <b>clause</b> is in the conditional mood.|$|R
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive <b>clauses</b> in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative <b>clauses)</b> usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|Intonation in {{indicative}} <b>clauses</b> usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, {{falls on}} the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and {{falls on the}} last syllable.|$|E
5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These <b>clauses</b> define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these <b>clauses</b> as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} at random, {{for a given}} number n of variables and m of <b>clauses,</b> by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of all possible two-variable <b>clauses.</b> When m is small relative to n, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, the limit is one, while if α>1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α=1.|$|E
