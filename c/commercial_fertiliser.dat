5000|$|New {{fertilisers}}, {{besides the}} organic fertilisers in manure, were slowly found as massive sodium nitrate (NaNO3) deposits {{found in the}} Atacama Desert, Chile, were brought under British financiers like John Thomas North and imports were started. Chile was happy to allow the exports of these sodium nitrates by allowing the British to use their capital to develop the mining and imposing a hefty export tax to enrich their treasury. Massive deposits of sea bird guano (11-16% N, 8-12% phosphate, and 2-3% potash), were found and started to be imported after about 1830. Significant imports of potash obtained {{from the ashes of}} trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported. By-products of the British meat industry like bones from the knackers' yards were ground up or crushed and sold as fertiliser. By about 1840 about 30,000 tons of bones were being processed (worth about £150,000). An unusual alternative to bones was found to be the millions of tons of fossils called coprolites found in South East England. When these were dissolved in sulphuric acid they yielded a high phosphate mixture (called [...] "super phosphate") that plants could absorb readily and increased crop yields. Mining coprolite and processing it for fertiliser soon developed into a major industry—the first <b>commercial</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> Higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900. Labour productivity slowly increased at about 0.6% per year. With more capital invested, more organic and inorganic fertilisers, and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5%/year—not enough to keep up with population growth.|$|E

Practical recommendation •	In conventional cultivation, the nitrogen uptake of winter oilseed rape amounts to 140 kg N per ha for a yield expectation of 35 dt per ha. In organic agriculture, about 100 kg suffice for a yield expectation of 20 - 25 dt. •	The ideal time for cultivating oilseed rape is after grass-clover or legumes. After grains, apply about 30 tonnes per ha of manure or manure compost before cultivating rapeseed. •	In dry conditions in spring, an early single application of nitrogen is preferable to two smaller applications. In the case of slurry with a low N content, two applications are often required because maximum of 40 m 3 of slurry can be applied at once. Regularly analyse the N content of slurry (regular content: 1 kg of N per m 3 of slurry or tonne of manure, respectively; range: 0, 3 kg N per m 3 for cow slurry to 3 kg N per m 3 for pig slurry).

40|$|Purpose: Organo-mineral biochar {{fertiliser}} has {{the potential}} to replace conventional biochar and organic fertiliser to improve soil quality and increase plant photosynthesis. This study explored mechanisms involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in both soil and ginger plants (Zingiber officinale: Zingiberaceae) following different treatments including organic <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>commercial</b> bamboo biochar <b>fertiliser,</b> and organo-mineral biochar fertiliser. Materials and methods: Soil received four treatments including (1) <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> (5 t ha− 1) as the control, (2) <b>commercial</b> bamboo biochar <b>fertiliser</b> (5 t ha− 1), (3) organo-mineral biochar fertiliser at a low rate (3 t ha− 1), and (4) organo-mineral biochar fertiliser at a high rate (7. 5 t ha− 1). C and N fractions of soil and plant, and gas exchange measurements were analysed. Results and discussion: Initially, organo-mineral biochar fertiliser applied at the low rate increased leaf N. Organo-mineral biochar fertiliser applied at the high rate significantly increased N use efficiency (NUE) of the aboveground biomass compared with other treatments and improved photosynthesis compared with the control. There was N fractionation during plant N uptake and assimilation since the 15 N enrichment between the root, leaf, and stem were significantly different from zero; however, treatments did not affect this N fractionation. Conclusions: Organo-mineral biochar fertiliser has agronomic advantages over inorganic and raw organic (manure-based) N fertiliser because it allows farmer to put high concentrations of nutrients into soil without restricting N availability, N uptake, and plant photosynthesis.

We assess the fossil fuel dependency for the Danish {{food production}} system {{by means of}} Food Energy Returned on fossil Energy Invested (Food-EROI) and {{by the use of}} energy intensive nutrients from imported livestock feed and commercial fertilisers. The analysis shows that the system requires 221 PJ of fossil energy per year and that for each joule of fossil energy invested in farming, processing and transportation, 0. 25 J of food energy is produced; 0. 28 when crediting for produced bioenergy.

Since 1996, Mashonaland farmers, who traditionally cultivated maize, have started soybean production and tested the effects of Rhizobium biofertilizer. Atmospheric nitrogen can only enter plants {{after it has been}} fixed in the root nodules of leguminous plants by a bacterium called Rhizobium that lives in the soil. Under natural conditions, legumes do not find the best bacteria to fix sufficient quantities of nitrogen for high yields. By inoculating seeds with Rhizobium in liquid form, yields have more than doubled in field trials.

The Se status of SA mutton merino ram lambs, as reflected by whole blood, liver and kidney Se concentrations, was elevated (P&lt; 0. 01) for at least 5 months after application of the fertiliser.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} requirement {{varies depending on}} variety and usage. The conventional fertilisation amounts to 120 kg of N per ha in table potatoes and potatoes for processing. Early potatoes and seed potatoes require slightly less nitrogen at about 100 kg of N per ha. The nitrogen supply strongly depends on the conditions for N mineralisation (weather, humus content of the soil, preceding crop residues). Thus, optimising the N supply is complex. Nitrogen from the preceding crop: Grain legumes or cereals in combination with green manure are favourable preceding crops. Field peas may leave behind up to 50 kg net weight of available nitrogen, a mixture of grain legumes and barley up to 30 kg. Depending on the preceding crop and the soil, the nitrogen left behind may amount to zero. Using grass-clover ley as a preceding crop {{is not an option}} due to the high risk of wireworm infestation. Manure as basic fertiliser: A dosage of 15 to maximum 30 tonnes of manure per ha (1 - 2 kg of available N per t) in autumn during the preceding crop serves as basic nitrogen fertilisation. Mineralisation occurs slowly during the entire growth period. A dosage of manure also covers the high potassium demand of potatoes. Farms without livestock need to cover the K supply by using approved mineral fertilisers. Due to the risk of Rhizoctonia, only well-rotted or composted manure should be used. Manure compost has, like other composts, a low N effect. Undiluted cattle slurry: Depending on the slurry’s N content (1 - 3 kg of available N/m 3), 30 - 90 m 3 of slurry {{can be applied to the}} preceding crop or at a plant height of 10 - 20 cm the latest (i. e. before creating the ridges) and worked into the soil. Later applications of slurry only promoted haulm growth and delay the maturation of the tubers. Commercial fertiliser: An additional dosage of fertiliser of about 30 - 60 kg of N per ha with a granulated, quickly mineralising commercial N fertiliser can complement the missing nitrogen supply. It should be applied during spring at planting or at the first round of hoeing the latest. In case of lacking farm manure, up to 90 kg of total N can be applied per ha.

40|$|The thesis {{assesses the}} yield {{advantage}} and adoption dynamics of conservation agriculture (CA) as a sustainable farming method that {{was introduced in}} Zimbabwe {{to address the problems}} of low productivity and declining soil quality. This study is based on five-year panel survey that was intended to monitor the impacts of CA on adopters. The study focused particularly on basin CA, which involves digging small pits with hand hoes during the off-season. This technology allows for early planting and the concentration of soil nutrients within the planting basin {{in order to reduce the}} risk of crop failure. Specifically, this study attempts to: a) Provide evidence that shows that CA adoption has a positive impact on maize yield; b) Determine factors that condition farmers to apply more components of the CA package; and c) Answer the question why some farmers are abandoning CA, which they had adopted earlier. The first part of the thesis used plot level data to model a single equation yield function where CA was assumed to have an intercept effect. Through a household fixed effect model, the impact on yield was measured and verified through ordinary least squares. The evaluation showed that the input with the greatest impact on yield was nitrogen fertiliser. The unambiguous finding of this analysis is the positive significant impact of CA technology on maize yield. The second part of the thesis examined the determinants of adoption intensity using count regression models, specifically Poisson and negative binomial regression. The evaluation showed that more intense users of CA had higher productivity, lived in areas with higher production potential and received some form of input support from non-governmental organisations. There is a general tendency towards dis-adoption as farmers reduce the number of CA practices applied with time. However, the number of techniques applied in the current season increases albeit at a diminishing rate. This implies that CA is becoming more intensively practised in a relatively endogenous manner. However, unless conditions that make the practice easier to apply, CA cannot be expected to be maintained in Zimbabwe. Finally the thesis applied a random effects logit model to measure abandonment of CA. Study findings suggest that poor vulnerable households are more likely to persist with CA confirming that CA is accessible to the poor who are the target group for this technology. Loss of input support through programmes has contributed to dis-adoption but it is not clear whether <b>commercial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> has been available in the absence of NGO programmes. In addition, there is a strong tendency toward dis-adoption in semi-arid and arid regions, raising the question about the suitability of CA in those regions. The study finds results that appear to be at odds with each other: that the practice of CA leads to significantly higher yields of the most important crop, yet there is evidence of farmers discontinuing the practice. There is therefore need to explore the factors that constrain adoption and encourage abandonment in order to understand whether the future of sustainable agriculture in Africa lies in CA.

Three kinds of zinc-containing crystal samples were synthesised by controlling temperature and solution chemical compositions.

The mineralogical and chemical compositions of samples determined by XRD and FTIR closely matched the theoretical mineral phases.

40|$|Biochar is a carbon-rich {{material}} {{produced by}} pyrolysis (heating {{in the absence}} of oxygen) of biomass to capture combustible gases and generate heat and electricity. It can be added to soils as a means to sequester carbon and to maintain or improve soil functions. The physical and chemical properties of biochars determine their function as a tool for environmental management. Soil changes and plant response have been analysed on diverse soil types under various climatic conditions, water regimes, chemo-physical environments and on different species. Yet, the exact mechanisms behind the effects of biochar application are not fully understood and productivity gains vary greatly {{depending on the type of}} biochar, application rates, crop species and environmental conditions. Producing biochar from different organic waste materials appears to be a promising method of achieving greater levels of certainty and flexibility for integrating carbon sequestration, managing waste disposal costs and introducing a new solution into soil and yield management in the conventional agricultural and forestry production systems. Biochar, however, is not widely used by farmers or foresters in Australia, mainly due to the lack of certainty concerning long-term consequences, yield gains and a lack of ‘know-how’ in the field of quality certification, transportation, logistics and cost efficiency. Forestry is a significant industry in Tasmania, with large scale plantations of radiata pine (Pinus radiata, D. Don) and Eucalyptus (E. globulus and E. nitens, H. Deane & Maiden) which play an increasingly important role in supplying for national and international demand for timber. Propagating robust seedlings for planting in the field is an important part of plantation establishment as it influences potential yield, while also being a significant budget component. As biochar has been reported to positively affect desirable soil characteristics (e. g. increased nutrient efficiency, improved water holding capacity or reduced bulk density) and enhance crop productivity, it was hypothesised that it can bring benefits to Eucalyptus seedling growth. The main objectives of this project were to investigate chemical changes of the soil, plant material and soil solution following biochar application; and to determine the optimum biochar dose required to positively influence eucalyptus growth under Tasmanian conditions; both in a controlled nursery environment and during establishment in the field. A secondary aim was to determine if <b>commercial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> rates could be reduced via biochar application to the growing medium. The final assumption was that biochar can be profitably made from forest residues and utilized within the forest production systems of Tasmania. The macadamia shell biochar used in this research was characterised as high in potassium and sodium, relatively high in total carbon content and low in total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content relative to other biochars described in literature. Two experiments were conducted: a pot trial in which Eucalyptus seedlings were observed from sowing to 9 months; and a field experiment in the Florentine valley in South West Tasmania where seedling establishment was monitored for 14 months. In both experiments the agronomic characteristics of the seedlings and trees was monitored on a regular basis. Each experiment had 4 sample collection periods when plant material and soil or potting mix samples were collected and analysed. Percolating water was collected from custom-built lysimeters installed in the field plantation. Agronomic monitoring revealed that in both experiments fertiliser combined with certain doses of biochar influenced the tree growth. The height of seedlings and young trees was comparable between full fertiliser treatment (i. e. when no biochar was applied) and treatments where medium biochar rates were combined with reduced fertiliser amounts. However, biochar application did not result in significantly taller plants. Other agronomic features were not influenced by biochar application in either experiment. The potting mix was high in organic matter and the fertiliser applied at rates reflected industry standards. While fertiliser rates were reduced to simulate a nutritionally poor soil, all other environmental parameters were optimal in the pot trial. As previous reports have indicated that biochar has more noticeable effects on poor quality soils, it is possible that the quality of the potting mix masked the efficacy of biochar in relation to agronomic productivity, although both soil and leachate parameters were influenced. In contrast, under field conditions the biochar doses were applied at rates below that at which soil and leachate parameters were modified in the potting experiment, thus the doses were possibly too low to show a significant effect. The application method could also have influenced biochar efficiency under field conditions. Chemical and physical changes in the analysed mediums used implied a number of different, in some cases contradictory, mechanisms. Biochar in both experiments increased growing medium pH and released potassium and sodium to the soil. In the plant tissues, biochar induced changes, yet no clear trends were evident that macadamia biochar has any sizable effect on the nutritional status of E. nitens in Tasmania. In most cases, the changes in leaf tissue were correlated with changes in the soil with no evidence that biochar directly influenced plant nutrient uptake. Biochar did not have a clear effect on percolating water nutritional changes and the only thing that can be concluded with certainty is that application of biochar increased potassium infiltration from the soil. This is most likely connected with significant amount of potassium introduced to the soil when biochar was applied. While the mechanisms for the reported changes remain unclear, in many cases biochar was responsible for changes in soil and plant material chemical characteristics and a limited agronomic response. It appears that biochar is able to influence nutrients transformations in the soil and therefore influence the soil environment for the E. nitens in Tasmania. It also shows significant potential for reduced <b>commercial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> rates both in the forestry plantations and in the forest nurseries. The financial analysis was based on the trial outcomes and the local operating environment in Tasmania; including current forestry procedures used for managing plantations in Tasmania; and benefits resulting from biochar production and incorporation into Tasmanian soils. The Biochar Scenario assumed on-site biochar making, out of post-harvest forestry residues, and different methods of biochar utilization. The model was built in Microsoft Excel® with help from Forestry Tasmania experts. A number of assumptions were considered concerning: a) production costs, b) savings enjoyed by traditional operations following biochar scenario implementation and c) biochar sale. The analysis revealed a potential annual income of 179, 514 resulting from introducing the Biochar Scenario on 270 ha. The sensitivity analysis identified the crucial factors responsible for scenario profitability, namely biochar price and final product distribution. The findings of this work supported the hypothesis that reducing common fertiliser rates used for seedling establishment in forestry plantations is viable. It has also provided insight into changes in both soil and plant tissue following macadamia shell biochar application to Tasmanian soils. The financial analysis served as a solid background for the realistic implementation of the Biochar Scenario for forestry industry in Tasmania...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since {{the late}} 1980 s, {{the use of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in most Eastern European {{countries}} has decreased at an unprecedented rate. We examined {{the impact of this}} dramatic reduction in agricultural inputs on concentrations of nutrients in four rivers in Eastern Europe: the Emajogi and Õhnejogi (Estonia), the Daugava (Latvia), and the Tisza (Hungary). Time series of nitrate (NO 3 -N) and phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations and data on runoff were selected to represent catchments with substantial areas of agricultural land and available time series of sufficient length and frequency. The study period was 1987 – 1998. We detected downward trends in nitrate-N and phosphate-P in only two of the four rivers. Our results imply that the response to the extensive decrease in agricultural intensity since the late 1980 s has been slow and limited in many rivers. Corresponding results in the literature are inconclusive and comprise several examples of both decreasing and non-decreasing nutrient concentrations. Our findings, along with similar data from other studies, indicate that large cuts in nutrient inputs do not necessarily induce an immediate response, particularly in medium-sized and large catchment areas. Moreover, the difference we noted between nitrogen and phosphorus suggests that factors other than reduced fertiliser application influenced the inertia of the water quality response...|$|R

40|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>fertilisers</b> {{provide a}} {{convenient}} and {{effective means of}} maintaining a satisfactory level of balanced nutrition in nurseries provided they are used with proper regard to timing and in quantities which have some relation to the actual requirements. For many years their regular use has been regarded as an accepted part of nursery husbandry. In New Zealand Forest Service nurseries, {{as well as some}} private forest nurseries, assessment of requirements is made largely on the basis of standardised agricultural soil tests. Soil sampling methods and interpretation of soil test results are outlined. Prescriptions based on soil test ratings have generally helped to maintain satisfactory growth in successive crops, while preventing cumulative excesses which could also adversely affect nursery stock. Fertilisers are commonly applied during bed preparation (especially P, K and secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S) as low-cost simple agricultural fertilisers), as well as later during the period when seedlings are making rapid growth (light maintenance side- or topdressings of granulated multinutrient fertilisers or nitrogenous fertilisers according to soil requirements). In the event of poor growth or malnutrition symptoms affecting a crop, visual diagnosis, aided where necessary by foliar analysis, is used to resolve the cause so that prompt remedial action can be taken, e. g., by foliar spray.

The nitrogen sources applied to Tempranillo grapevines were proline, phenylalanine, urea, and two <b>commercial</b> nitrogen <b>fertilisers,</b> both without and with amino acids in their formulations. All treatments were applied at veraison and one week later. Proline treatment {{did not affect the}} must nitrogen composition. However, phenylalanine and urea foliar application enhanced the plants' synthesis of most of the amino acids, producing similar effects. In addition, the spray of <b>commercial</b> nitrogen <b>fertilisers</b> over leaves also induced a rise in grape amino acid concentrations regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} amino acids in their formulation. The most effective treatments were phenylalanine and urea followed by nitrogen fertilisers. This finding is of oenological interest for improved must nitrogen composition, ensuring better fermentation kinetics and most likely enhancing wine quality. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The science o f {{transition}} metal chelation finds applicability in many analytical {{areas where the}} determination of agents which will chelate {{transition metal}} ions, or the determination of transition metal ions themselves, is desired. This thesis details the use of transition metal chelation in solving analytical problems encountered in the adhesives, fertiliser and biomedical laboratoiy. In the adhesives industry, transition metal ions in anaerobic adhesives can initiate the polymerisation process, resulting in premature setting o f products in their packaging. Addition o f a chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, however, renders the metal ion inactive with respect to its catalytic properties. A novel method was developed for the simultaneous determination o f the seven metal cations Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cd(H), and Mn(H), with limits o f detection as low as 30 ppb for certain metal ions. The method {{has been shown to}} give no response in the presence of excess EDTA This was achieved by the development o f a solid-phase extraction procedure, and separation on a dynamically coated Cjg reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography column. In the fertiliser industry, chelates are added to <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers</b> for the supply of micronutrients to plants. The determination of the iron chelates of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), hydroxy- 2 - ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEEDTA), ethylenediaminedi(o-hydroxy-phenylacetic) acid (EDDHA), and ethylenediaminedi(o-hydroxy-p-methylphenyl) acetic acid (EDDHMA), and the Cu, Zn and Mn chelates of EDTA was investigated. The ionpairing reagent tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, gave a separation of all iron chelates on a Chromspher C jg column using a solvent switching system. Cu-, Zn-, and MnEDTA were separated using the ion-pairing reagent tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide. For the iron chelates both limit of determination and linear range studies, showed that the method is capable of analysing the concentration range found in <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> The capabilities of gel permeation chromatography for the separation and purification of the above chelates, was also investigated. Of the two gels Bio-Gel P 2 and Fractogel HW- 40 (S), Fractogel HW 40 (S) gave the best separation o f FeEDDHA, FeEDDHMA, FeDTPA and FeHEEDTA. CuEDTA, ZnEDTA and MnEDTA were found to co-elute with FeDTPA. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has become very important in the analysis o f peptides, as it is a highly powerful mechanism of separation, and can analyse nanoliter sample quantities. However, detection methods employing UV, spectrofluorimetry, radiolabelling and mass spectrometry have limited sensitivity. A copper-coated capillary was developed for the determination of peptides by CE with electrochemical detection. A simple washing procedure produces a copper-coated column which is stable for 12 hours. Under alkaline conditions, peptides complex with Cu(II) from the walls of the column to form Cu(II) -peptide complexes which are subsequently oxidised at a carbon fibre electrode to form copper(III) -peptides. The system was shown to be applicable for the analysis of small peptides (five amino acids),and protected peptides, for which typical detection limits were in the lx lO 2 ̆ 7 range...|$|R

The objective is to show the feasibility of the approach, to point out the reduction possibilities within the agriculture and to provide tools to set clear quantitative goals for reduction. There appears to be an urgent need to develope new methods, because several of the TMR-based indexes cannot be applied within the agricultural sector as such.

40|$|Selenium (Se) {{is both an}} {{essential}} micronutrient for animals and humans and potentially toxic at relatively low intakes. Total soil Se is usually low(0. 01 – 2 mg/kg), but parts of China, India and the USA have toxic soil Se levels. Available soil Se is poorly correlated with total soil Se and is highly variable, both locally and globally. The plant availability of Se in soil depends on the major Se species present and on soil characteristics, including the quantity of sorption components (aluminium and iron oxide/hydroxides), pH and redox status. Also, the presence of anions competing for the same sorption surfaces (including sulphate, phosphate and organic anions) affects root uptake and retention of Se in soil, and microbial activity is important for Se interactions with organic matter. Depletion of Se and S is common in soils of Sub-Saharan Africa, due to soil erosion, leaching and volatilisation through burning. The only viable long-term solution, especially for farmers who cannot afford <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> is to re-establish agricultural ecosystems that are closer to the natural ecosystems they replaced. Selenium is {{not considered to be}} essential for higher plants; however, it has numerous health roles in humans and animals, mostly mediated by Se-dependent enzymes. Although diseases associated with profound Se deficiency (Keshan disease, Kaschin-Beck disease and myxoedema) are rare, suboptimal intake is widespread and may increase risk of heavy metal toxicity, certain cancers, cardiovascular diseases and HIV disease. It is possible to biofortify food crops using selenate, but a high proportion is retained in the soil, and more targeted supplementation may be preferable to conserve this scarce micronutrient.

40|$|International audienceRecently {{published}} {{assessments of}} nutrient budgets {{on a national}} basis have shown that K deficits for developing countries are so substantial that a doubling of world production of potash fertilisers {{would be required to}} balance inputs and offtake, simply to meet demands in Africa alone. The price of potassium fertiliser raw materials has increased by a factor of 4 during 2007 - 2009, approaching $ 1000 per tonne in some markets. Thus an annual investment of the order of US$ 5600 million is required to replenish soil K stocks in Africa. In this context it is appropriate to review current knowledge of alternative sources of K, which is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth's continental crust, present in feldspars and (much less commonly) feldspathoid minerals including nepheline and leucite. Theoretical considerations based on the experimental determination of mineral dissolution rates indicate that nepheline dissolves 100 times more quickly than potassium feldspar, and this suggests that nepheline-bearing rocks are more effective as sources of K for plant growth than granitic rocks, even though these have higher K contents. Crop trials with silicate rocks and minerals as sources of K show increased K availability and uptake for nepheline-bearing rocks compared with granitic rocks. Under conditions where soils are rapidly leached (especially tropical soils such as oxisols that contain quartz, aluminium oxy-hydroxides and kaolinite), with low capacity to retain soluble nutrients, the use of potassium feldspar or crushed granite does give a yield response, although no greater than for conventional fertilisers. In other experiments with crushed ultramafic, basaltic and andesitic rocks improvements in crop yield are claimed, although this cannot be unambiguously related to the mineralogical or chemical composition of the rock used. In conclusion, the present high cost of conventional potassium fertilisers justifies further investigation of potassium silicate minerals and their host rocks (which in some cases include basic rocks, such as basalt) as alternative sources of K, especially for systems with highly weathered soils that lack a significant cation exchange capacity. Such soils commonly occur in developing countries, and so this approach provides an opportunity to develop indigenous silicate rock sources of K as an alternative to sometimes prohibitively expensive <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} of organic wastes as soil amendments is notably promoted in sustainable agricultural systems. However, for many animal by-products approved by organic farming regulations {{little is known}} about their effects on the greenhouse gas balance of the soil, in particular on N 2 O emissions. In this work we report on the N 2 O and CO 2 emissions from six animal-derived wastes (horn and hoof meal, blood meal, hydrolysed leather, meat bone meal, chicken manure and a <b>commercial</b> organic mixed <b>fertiliser).</b> We compared these emissions to those from a mineral fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) in a sandy and a loam soil during a three month laboratory incubation study. N 2 O flux dynamics varied strongly with residue category and soil type. In the sandy soil, cumulative N 2 O emissions correlated with soil NO 3 - content. Although the mineral fertiliser produced the highest total N 2 O emissions (5. 7 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil), the <b>commercial</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> mixture led to statistically similar emissions (5. 3 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil). The other by-products emitted between 1. 3 – 3. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and only blood meal emitted less than 1 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil. In the loam soil, N 2 O emissions never exceeded 1. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and did not correlate with NO 3 - in soil. With regard to CO 2 emissions and C storage potential, chicken manure was the only residue that significantly accumulated C in both soils during the course of our experiment. The addition of an extra easily available source of C (glucose) or N (NO 3 -) influenced N 2 O emissions differently depending on the residue applied.

40|$|Timber {{is one of}} a few {{agricultural}} products that is not linked to the human food chain, and thus can be submitted to a number of practices not usually considered appropriate for other markets such as horticulture. Direct application of biosolids to plantation stands as a substitute for <b>commercial</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is one of these practices. However, there maybe significant health issues in regards to the potential for pathogens to be introduced to the environment through the use of the biosolids. Despite the treatment processes that wastewater sludge undergoes to be classified as biosolids prior to direct land application, some pathogens survive and therefore there is a potential for infection of the local human population. The research objective {{of this study is to}} establish the human health risk of using biosolids in a plantation stand. The die-off of indicator pathogens will be monitored to establish their ability to survive once the biosolids are applied to land. The health risks of airborne pathogens will be determined through studies into the ability of pathogens to be transported via the smoke from a burn off scenario. A literature review established that the indicator pathogens for this study would be Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp., and Coliphage. Preliminary results indicate that there are some colonies of the indicator pathogens present but at very low levels, however further results are needed to establish a firm conclusion. Preliminary results show there is potential for some pathogens to be transported via the smoke initiated from a burn off. Given the low pathogen numbers in the applied biosolids, spiked biosolids samples have also been used to provide a point of comparison. These preliminary results support the current literature, however further analysis is required in order to firmly establish the health risks of this potential occurrence. Further research to intensively monitor the pathogen die-off in the first year post-application is required and will be combined with the data from the multiple years’ post-application samples. Research into the ability of dust generated from the biosolids due to vehicle movement to transfer pathogens is also required to establish the health risk both to members of the general public and also the plantations workers. The effects that the pine trees themselves and specifically the addition of pine needles to the soil organic matter will also be researched to establish if this phenomenon has an effect of the die-off of pathogens. The results from this study can be transposed to agricultural systems and may aid in future decision making in regards to the use of biosolids particularly areas linked to the human food chain...|$|R
