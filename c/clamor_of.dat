25|$|A {{temporary}} truce between Spain and her rebellious Netherlanders allowed Basque-Spaniard admiral Miguel de Vidazabal, {{commander of}} the Gibraltar squadron, to cooperate with Dutch ships in anti-Corsair operations. These resulted in sixteen Corsair vessels being brought into Gibraltar. The truce prompted by the <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> public opinion {{and even more so}} by his minister the Count-Duke of Olivares, collapsed in 1621, and a Dutch and Danish fleet of thirty-one sail arrived in the Straits to do what damage it could to Spanish shipping.|$|E
500|$|With {{a battle}} plan in order, Lee sent a draft to his lieutenants, written by {{his chief of}} staff, Col. Robert Chilton (see right box). The orders were not well-crafted, however, since they {{designated}} the yell of a single charging brigade as the only signal of attack for a full [...] fifteen brigades. Amid the tumult and <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> battle, this was bound to create confusion. Moreover, Chilton's draft effectively left the attack solely {{at the discretion of}} Lewis Armistead, who had never before held command of a brigade during battle. The draft also did not note the time that it had been written, which later caused confusion for Magruder.|$|E

He apparently never informed his family in advance about the choice to join the war, because the news of his enlistment was reported back in Hawaiʻi's American missionary community as [...] "Henry Pitman has run away from home and gone [...]" [...] Carter described Pitman's rationale for enlisting: [...] "In the midst of the <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> war, when the very air vibrated with excitement, the wild enthusiasm of the crowds, and the inspiring sound of the drum, his [...] nature rose within him.

500|$|Harrison's 1840 {{campaign}} {{was one of}} firsts. It featured the first presidential candidate to speak for himself, the first to have a grassroots campaign involving {{the mass of the}} people (including many women, who could not then vote), and according to Shafer, [...] "the beginning of presidential campaigning as entertainment". Gunderson noted, [...] "for the first time, a presidential candidate abandoned a customary Olympic seclusion for the fervid <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> the arena". In her biography of Harrison, Collins deemed the candidate's speechmaking as symbolic of [...] "the erasing of the barrier between common Americans and their Chief Executive". Having been born in a log cabin, or in some other humble dwelling, remained a staple of presidential campaign biographies well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} insight into the {{theological}} language based on the Suffering perspective. While modern rationality is concerned about logical and scientific language, the Anamnetic reason saves humanity from its own oblivion.

Besides, the theological language is remembrance and hope...|$|R
60|$|Then in {{the next}} breath Madeline denied this insistent <b>clamoring</b> <b>of</b> a love that was {{gradually}} breaking her spirit. Like a somber shadow remorse followed her, shading blacker. She had been blind to a man's honesty, manliness, uprightness, faith, and striving. She had been dead to love, to nobility that she had herself created. Padre Marcos's grave, wise words returned to haunt her. She fought her bitterness, scorned her intelligence, hated her pride, and, weakening, gave up {{more and more to}} a yearning, hopeless hope.|$|R

2500|$|Other criticisms were levied at its {{original}} chairman, Charles Van Wyck. After the committee {{had been at}} work for several months, Rep. Van Wyck desired to investigate the mode of conducting business at the New York Customs House. The other committee members objected for lack of time. It was decided that Van Wyck would take the evidence while the other members continued their work of investigating government contracts. After collecting {{a large body of}} evidence, was instructed by the committee not to proceed in his investigations without further orders. The rest of the committee returned to New York, and after receiving testimony and evidence from the custom-house in its own defense, ordered the testimony taken by Mr. Van Wyck to be deposited with the Clerk of the House [...] "subject only to the inspection of any member of the committee." [...] Van Wyck was later suspended from conducting his investigations, which he alleged were because of [...] "the <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> the revenue officers and their friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|This prosaic preoccupation, Călinescu notes, led Caragiale {{to depict}} the dust-covered mahala quarters, the passage of loaded trucks, and the <b>clamor</b> <b>of</b> {{boarding}} school girls walking down boulevards. Various works in this series also display their author's sympathy for the urban underclass, showing the beggars' losing battle with the natural elements, or unloved old women reduced to envying the happy couples they meet on the street. In more or less allusive poems, included by Cioculescu among the [...] "desacralizing" [...] texts, Caragiale also tests the limits of propriety, and questions the sexual taboos of his generation, from schoolgirls fantasizing about being kept women, to the moral severity imposed on churchgoers {{and the impact of}} sexual inhibition on the subconscious. The poet's sensibility for such themes touched not just his choice of subjects, but also his appreciation of other poems. In a 1922 letter to critic Tudor Vianu, Ion Barbu recalled that Caragiale's enthusiasm for Răsturnica, which can be read as a grotesque but compassionate homage to a dead prostitute, far exceeded his own: in Barbu's definition, Răsturnica was [...] "that smut which wrung tears from Luchi Caragiale".|$|E

They were all condemned to slavery, excepting Ibrahim Zenete. The instance of clemency which he had shown in refraining to harm the Spanish striplings on the last sally from Malaga won him favorable terms.
