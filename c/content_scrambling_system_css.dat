25|$|An early {{example of}} a DRM system is the <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> {{employed}} by the DVD Forum on film DVDs circa 1996. CSS uses an encryption algorithm to encrypt content on the DVD disc. Manufacturers of DVD players must license this technology and implement it in their devices {{so that they can}} decrypt the encrypted content to play it. The CSS license agreement includes restrictions on how the DVD content is played, including what outputs are permitted and how such permitted outputs are made available. This keeps the encryption intact as the video material is played out to a TV.|$|E

50|$|The {{best example}} of {{practical}} use of certificate-based encryption is <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> {{which is used to}} encode DVD movies {{in such a way as}} to make them playable only in a part of the world where they are sold. However, the fact that the region decryption key is stored on the hardware level in the DVD players substantially weakens this form of protection.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> encryption, DIVX discs used Triple DES encryption and alternative channel modulation coding scheme, which prevented them being read in normal DVD players.|$|R
50|$|DVD-Video {{has four}} {{complementary}} systems designed {{to restrict the}} DVD user in various ways: Macrovision, <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> region codes, and disabled user operations (UOPs). There are also anti-ripping techniques intended to foil ripping software.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> is {{a digital}} rights {{management}} (DRM) and encryption system employed on many commercially produced DVD-Video discs. CSS utilizes a [...] 40-bit stream cipher algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.|$|R
50|$|DVD X Copy was a {{consumer}} software program that enabled novice computer users to copy any DVD movie to any blank DVD. Most commercial DVD movies include <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> a copy-protection technology {{designed to prevent}} DVD movies from being copied. This controversial DVD copy software program included technology that decrypts the CSS copy protection mechanism on DVD movie discs. DVD X Copy products are still being sold on the DVD X Copy website, although it was previously believed to be no longer sold or supported.|$|E
5000|$|... 321 Studios was {{a privately}} held company {{headquartered}} in St. Louis, Missouri with a sales office in Berkeley, California. The company {{was a leading}} provider of DVD authoring software, including the highly controversial DVD X Copy product line of DVD copy software. The DVDXCopy family of products enabled novice computer users to quickly and easily copy any DVD movie, including DVD movies protected with the <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> [...] 321 Studios' products were sold through most major North American and International retailers and worldwide through the company's website.|$|E
50|$|DVDs {{are often}} {{encrypted}} with the <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> To play a CSS DVD, {{it must be}} decrypted. Jon Johansen and two anonymous colleagues wrote DeCSS, a program that did this decryption, so they could watch DVDs in Linux. US servers distributing this software were asked to stop on the theory they were violating this law. Mr. Johansen was tried in his native Norway under that country's analogous statute. The Norwegian courts ultimately acquitted Mr. Johansen because he was acting consistent with interoperability {{and he could not}} be held responsible for others' motives. The software is now widely available.|$|E
50|$|Discs {{made with}} DVD copying {{programs}} such as DVD Shrink automatically disable any Macrovision copy protection. The ease with which Macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of DVD releases {{that do not have}} copy protection of any kind, <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> or Macrovision.|$|R
5000|$|... libdvdcss (or libdvdcss2 in some repositories) is a {{free and}} open source {{software}} library for accessing and unscrambling DVDs encrypted with the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> libdvdcss {{is part of the}} VideoLAN project and is used by VLC media player and other DVD player software packages, such as Ogle, xine-based players, and MPlayer.|$|R
50|$|Many DVD-Video titles use <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> encryption, {{which is}} {{intended}} to discourage people from copying the disc. Usually, users need to install software provided on the DVD or downloaded from the Internet such as MPlayer, TotalMedia Theatre, PowerDVD, VLC or WinDVD {{to be able to}} view the disc in a computer system.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1999 the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) {{learned of}} the {{availability}} on the Internet of DeCSS, a program that allowed people to view the content of DVDs using computers that lacked commercial DVD players, bypassing the encryption system known as the <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> generally used on commercial DVDs. The MPAA responded by sending {{out a number of}} cease and desist letters to web site operators who posted the software. In January 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the publisher of the magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, and others. This case is known as Universal v. Reimerdes, [...]|$|E
50|$|DVD Decrypter is a {{deprecated}} {{software application}} for Microsoft Windows that can create backup disk {{images of the}} DVD-Video structure of DVDs. While it was still supported, {{it could be used}} to make a copy of any DVD protected with <b>Content</b> <b>Scrambling</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> The program can also record images to disc — functionality that the author has now incorporated into a separate product called ImgBurn. The software also allows a copy of a region-specific DVD to be made region free. It also removes Macrovision content protection, CSS, region codes, and user operation prohibition, but cannot copy DVDs protected with newer systems such as XProtect.|$|E
50|$|The <b>content</b> <b>scramble</b> <b>system</b> (<b>CSS)</b> is a {{collection}} of proprietary protection mechanisms for DVD-Video discs. CSS attempts to restrict access to the content only for licensed applications. According to the DVD Copy Control Association (CCA), which is the consortium that grants licenses, CSS is supposed to protect the intellectual property rights of the content owner.|$|R
25|$|Boxee uses libdvdcss {{to support}} {{playback}} of DVD-Video movies encrypted using the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> encryption. The distribution of executable versions of Boxee containing this code could possibly violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the U.S. and the Copyright Directive in European Union member countries which have incorporated it into national law. However, {{this has never}} been tested in court for open source projects.|$|R
50|$|DeCSS was {{developed}} {{without a license}} from the DVD Copy Control Association (CCA), the organization responsible for DVD copy protection—namely, the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> used by commercial DVD publishers. The release of DeCSS resulted in a Norway criminal trial and subsequent acquittal {{of one of the}} authors of DeCSS. The DVD CCA launched numerous lawsuits in the United States in an effort to stop the distribution of the software.|$|R

50|$|The DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) is an {{organization}} primarily responsible for the copy protection of DVDs. The <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> was devised for this purpose to make copyright infringement difficult, but also presents obstacles to some legitimate uses of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial Regional Playback Control (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.|$|R
50|$|Frank A. Stevenson (born 1970) is a Norwegian {{software}} developer, {{and part-time}} cryptanalyst. He is primarily {{known for his}} exposition of weaknesses in the DVD Forum's <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> Although the cryptoanalysis was done independently, he {{is known for his}} relations to DeCSS, and appeared before the courts as a witness in the Jon Johansen court trial. He also gave a deposition for the DVD CCA v. McLaughlin, Bunner, et al. case.|$|R
50|$|ARccOS (Advanced Regional Copy Control Operating Solution) is a copy-protection system made by Sony {{that is used}} on some DVDs. Designed as an {{additional}} layer {{to be used in}} conjunction with <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> the <b>system</b> deliberately creates corrupted sectors on the DVD, which cause copying software to produce errors (see bad sector). The corrupted sectors are in areas of the disk that most DVD players do not access, but most copying software does.|$|R
50|$|ImgBurn {{is based}} on the optical disc burning engine of DVD Decrypter. However, it does not have the ability to {{circumvent}} copy protections of encrypted DVDs. As of version 2.3.0.0, ImgBurn can create image files from unencrypted CDs/DVDs. It cannot, however, remove <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> encryption or any other copy protection. It is possible to use third-party software such as DVD43, an intermediate driver that operates between the hardware and software, for such purpose.|$|R
50|$|In computing, {{a trusted}} client is a device or program {{controlled}} by the user of a service, but with restrictions designed to prevent its use in ways not authorized by the provider of the service. That is, the client is a device that vendors trust and then sell to the consumers, whom they do not trust. Examples include video games played over a computer network or the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> in DVDs.|$|R
50|$|Kaleidescape, Inc., {{licensed}} {{the motion}} picture industry-supported digital rights management <b>system,</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> from the DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) {{in order to provide}} a home entertainment server system that would allow a user to copy physical DVDs to a single persistent storage device. Once in the Kaleidescape system, the DVD content could be stored, organized, and played back at any time, without requiring access to the original DVDs. It would also allow users to make permanent copies of borrowed or rented DVDs.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is {{a content}} {{distribution}} system for recordable and pre-recorded media, currently {{used to protect}} HD-DVD and Blu-Ray content. AACS builds off of its predecessors, the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> and <b>Content</b> Protection for Pre-recorded/Recordable media (CPRM/CPPM), adding more robust key distribution and revocation capabilities. In this paper, a concise summary of the lengthy AACS specification for pre-recorded media is provided, with emphasis on how the AACS keys are organized, distributed, and revoked using subset difference trees. A description of the AACS mechanisms for recordable content and on-line content is also provided. ...|$|R
25|$|The VLC {{media player}} {{software}} {{is able to}} read audio and video data from DVDs that incorporate <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> encryption, even though the VLC media player software lacks a CSS decryption license. The unauthorized decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content or unauthorized distribution of CSS decryption tools may violate the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content has been temporarily authorized for certain purposes (such as documentary filmmaking that uses short portions of DVD content for criticism or commentary) under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act anticircumvention exemptions that were issued by the US Copyright Office in 2010. However these exemptions do not change the DMCA's ban {{on the distribution of}} CSS decryption tools like VLC.|$|R
50|$|The Librarian of Congress {{periodically}} issues rulings {{to exempt}} certain classes of {{works from the}} DMCA's prohibition on the circumvention of copy protection for non-infringing purposes. One such ruling in 2010 declared, among other things, that the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> commonly employed on commercial DVDs could be circumvented to enable non-infringing uses of the DVD's content. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) hailed the ruling as enabling DVD excerpts {{to be used for}} the well-established fair-use activities of criticism and commentary, and for the creation of derivative works by video remix artists. However, the text of the ruling says the exemption can only be exercised by professional educators and their students, not the general public.|$|R
5000|$|Handbrake transcodes {{video and}} audio from nearly any format {{to a handful of}} modern ones, but it does not defeat or {{circumvent}} copy protection. One form of input is DVD-Video stored on a DVD disc, in an ISO image of a DVD disc or on any data storage device as a VIDEO_TS folder. HandBrake’s developers removed libdvdcss (the open-source library responsible for unscrambling DVDs encrypted with the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS))</b> from the application in version 0.9.2. Removal of digital rights management (DRM) from DVDs using HandBrake was possible by installing VLC, a media player application that includes the libdvdcss library. Currently, Handbrake can remove DRM only after the user installs the latest version of libdvdcss.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{consumer}} device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony BDZ-S77, a $3,800 (US) BD-RE recorder {{that was made}} available only in Japan. But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system {{that would be more}} secure than the failed <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name [...] "Blu-ray Disc Founders" [...] was officially changed to the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), and 20th Century Fox joined the BDA's Board of Directors. The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.|$|R
25|$|The GameCube {{introduced}} a proprietary miniDVD optical disc format as the storage medium for the console, capable of storing up to 1.5GB of data. The technology {{was designed by}} Matsushita Electric Industrial (now Panasonic Corporation) which utilizes a proprietary copy-protection scheme – different from the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> found in standard DVDs – to prevent unauthorized reproduction. The Famicom Data Recorder, Famicom Disk System, SNES-CD, and 64DD had explored various complementary storage technologies, but the GameCube was Nintendo's first console {{to move away from}} cartridge-based media altogether. The GameCube's 1.5GB mini-disc have sufficient room for most games, although a few games require an extra disc, higher video compression, or removal of content present in versions on other consoles. By comparison, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, also sixth-generation consoles, both use 8.5GB Dual-Layer DVDs.|$|R
50|$|In {{principle}} {{the privacy}} issue could be resolved using any standard signature scheme (or public key encryption) {{and a single}} key pair. Manufacturers would embed the private key into every TPM produced and the public key would be published as a certificate. Signatures produced by the TPM must have originated from the private key, {{by the nature of}} the technology, and since all TPMs use the same private key they are indistinguishable ensuring the user's privacy. This rather naive solution relies upon the assumption that there exists a global secret. One only needs to look at the precedent of <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> an encryption <b>system</b> for DVDs, to see that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, this approach fails to realize a secondary goal: the ability to detect rogue TPMs. A rogue TPM is a TPM that has been compromised and had its secrets extracted.|$|R
5000|$|This case {{involves}} the digital media company RealNetworks, DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) {{and the major}} motion picture studios. RealNetworks licensed the <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS),</b> a technology commonly used on copyrighted DVDs to prevent unauthorized copying, from DVD CCA and released the product RealDVD that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted DVDs. However, some major movie studios feel that RealDVD can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental DVDs instead of purchasing. RealNetworks, on the other hand, believes that copying of DVD is now legal after the favorable ruling of a 2007 California Superior Court case against Kaleidescape, a manufacturer of high-end media servers capable of copying copyrighted DVD content to the servers. Therefore, RealNetworks sued the DVD CCA and several major movie studios on September 30, 2008 seeking for a declaratory judgment that RealDVD neither violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [...] nor breached the licensing contract with DVD CCA. On the same day, the studios sued RealNetworks by alleging that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the contract.|$|R
5000|$|Many DVD-Video {{titles are}} {{encrypted}} with <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS).</b> This is a data encryption and communications authentication method {{designed to prevent}} copying video and audio data directly from the DVD-Video discs. Decryption and authentication keys needed for playing back encrypted VOB files are stored in the normally inaccessible lead-in area of the DVD and are used only by CSS decryption software (e.g., in a DVD player or software player). If someone is trying to copy the contents of an encrypted DVD-Video (e.g., VOB files) to a hard drive, an error can occur, because the DVD was not authenticated in the drive by CSS decryption software. Authentication of the disc allows the copying of individual VOB files without error, but the encryption keys will not be copied. If the copied undecrypted VOB files are opened in a player, they will request the keys from the DVD-ROM drive and will fail. [...] There are many CSS-decrypting programs, or ripping software, such as libdvdcss, DeCSS, DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD or DVD Shrink which allow a protected DVD-Video disc to be played without access to the original key or copied to hard disk unscrambled. In some countries, their usage can {{be a violation of}} law (e.g. for non-personal use).|$|R
40|$|Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems aim {{to create}} a secure {{framework}} to control access and actions that can be performed by users (both human and machine). DRM technologies have become very important in an increasingly networked world because it promises {{the owner of the}} file persistent control over the file even when the file leaves the owner’s machine. It is not only useful in combating piracy (which is currently the main use of DRM systems) but also for protecting sensitive documents in enterprises. DRM systems can be seen to fit at various levels on a computer system- at an application layer, which is cur-rently seen in applications like Apple iTunes; at an operating system level like Microsoft’s Rights Management System (RMS) in Windows Server 2003 or at a hardware level like <b>Content</b> <b>Scramble</b> <b>System</b> (<b>CSS)</b> in DVD players. However, current DRM systems are mostly not interoperable and in most cases either do not provide all the requirements expected by the customer or do not provide a totally secure framework. DRM systems that are used for copyright enforcement give rise to many legal questions mostly revolving on the amount of control the copyright holder has over their creations once they have been distributed to the users. Many of the legal questions do not affect DRM systems for enterprises, but most of the technical requirements are the same...|$|R
