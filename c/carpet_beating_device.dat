The enlisted men of the battery are harassed by their Wachmeister Schulz and a platoon leader, Feldwebel Platzek, whenever possible. Especially Gunner Vierbein, who has a passion for music and {{wanted to become a}} piano player, is a preferred target. This intensifies when Vierbein is ordered by Schulz to <b>carpet</b> <b>beating</b> in his rooms and Schulz´s wife, Lore, starts flirting with him. Even the squad leader Unteroffizier Lindenberg, who is known to be fair and correct, starts under pressure from Schulz to pick on him. He breaks down under the constant hard drill and harassment; when he steals ammunition on a rifle range, to commit suicide, one of his comrades, Gefreiter Asch, who helps him constantly to get along with the military life, prevents this and decides that the harassment by the NCOs can´t go on.|$|R

40|$|Background: Counterpulsation devices (CPD) require {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) lead implantation for {{timing device}} filling and ejection with the native heart. Non- implantable leads limit {{the scope of}} CPD treatment to short-term therapy. Standard transvenous/epicardial ECG leads increase the invasiveness of therapy. Methods: To overcome these limitations, subcutaneous ECG leads were tested in chronic (n= 6) and acute (n= 5) bovine models.

To address this, we characterized the barrier function of a 3 D culture model of the bronchial airway wall mucosa, modified the culture conditions for optimization of ciliogenesis, and compared epithelial and subepithelial GFP transduction by a pWpts-GFP lentivirus, pseudotyped with VSV-G, under static vs. dynamic conditions.

Microparticle tracking revealed partial coordination of mucociliary transport among groups of cells.

He was disgusted with himself, with the loathsome rush of emotion breaking through all the reserves that guarded his manhood. Something unknown, withering and poisonous, had entered his life, passed near him, touched him, and he was deteriorating. He was appalled. What was it? She was gone. Why? His head was ready to burst with the endeavour to understand her act and his subtle horror of it. Everything was changed. Why? Only a woman gone, after all; and yet he had a vision, a vision quick and distinct as a dream: the vision of everything he had thought indestructible and safe in the world crashing down about him, like solid walls do before the fierce breath of a hurricane. He stared, shaking in every limb, while he felt the destructive breath, the mysterious breath, the breath of passion, stir the profound peace of the house. He looked round in fear. Yes. Crime may be forgiven; uncalculating sacrifice, blind trust, burning faith, other follies, may be turned to account; suffering, death itself, may with a grin or a frown be explained away; but passion is the unpardonable and secret infamy of our hearts, a thing to curse, to hide and to deny; a shameless and forlorn thing that tramples upon the smiling promises, that tears off the placid mask, that strips the body of life. And it had come to him! It had laid its unclean hand upon the spotless draperies of his existence, and he had to face it alone with all the world looking on. All the world! And he thought that even the bare suspicion of such an adversary within his house carried with it a taint and a condemnation. He put both his hands out as if to ward off the reproach of a defiling truth; and, instantly, the appalled conclave of unreal men, standing about mutely beyond the clear lustre of mirrors, made at him the same gesture of rejection and horror.|$|R

Each of the approaches computes the matching score and the mean of the two resulting scores is taken. The mean is compared with the established threshold such that the system provides response by indicating whether the verification is successful or not.
