5000|$|Due to the {{way they}} work, DevSleep-enabled drives may not be {{suitable}} for most desktop PCs and some notebooks with the 3.3 V voltage present in their SATA power connectors; the presence of 3.3 V results in DevSleep-enabled drives remaining in DevSlp state. [...] An incompatibility between a desktop mainboard and a SATA SSD may be resolved by disabling the DevSleep feature using a power <b>connector</b> <b>adapter</b> that does not pass the +3.3 V line.|$|E
5000|$|The DMS-59 {{connector}} {{is used by}} AMD (AMD FireMV), Nvidia and Matrox {{for video}} cards sold in Lenovo Thinkcentres, Viglen Genies and Omninos, Dell, and HP computers. DMS-59 connectors also appeared on Sun Computers. Some confusion has been caused {{by the fact that}} vendors label cards with DMS-59 as [...] "supports DVI", but the cards have no DVI connectors built-in. Such cards, when equipped with only a VGA <b>connector</b> <b>adapter</b> cable, cannot be connected to a monitor with only a DVI-D input. A DMS-59 to DVI adapter cable needs to be used with such monitors.|$|E

5|$|The iPad can use Wi-Fi network {{trilateration}} from Skyhook Wireless {{to provide}} location information to {{applications such as}} Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; {{it also has a}} black strip on the back to aid 3G reception. The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port. However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock <b>connector</b> <b>adapters</b> for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.|$|R
50|$|The Acer N50 uses an {{unconventional}} 2.5mm headphone jack. To use headphones with a 3.5mm headphone <b>connector,</b> an <b>adapter</b> must be used. This adapter is {{included with the}} Acer N50.|$|R
50|$|For {{connectivity}} with HD ready televisions, the box outputs via a HDMI <b>connector</b> (<b>adapters</b> to Digital Visual Interface are available). The box is High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) compliant. Sky boxes manufactured {{prior to}} January 2008 also had analogue component connections (YPbPr), {{but as the}} HDCP copy protection {{cannot be applied to}} this type of output it is no longer included. Traditional standard-definition (SD) connections are available via SCART and S-Video. All programming is currently output from both HDMI and SD connections, although individual broadcasters have the option to require HDCP (and therefore HDMI) in the future.|$|R

50|$|There are {{adapters}} between most {{types of}} parallel SCSI connector, and some companies will manufacture custom cables to guarantee having the correct <b>connectors.</b> An <b>adapter</b> from narrow to wide must include termination to work properly.|$|R
50|$|Applications can be generic {{consoles}} (such as JConsole and MC4J) or domain-specific (monitoring) applications. External applications {{can interact}} with the MBeans {{through the use of}} JMX <b>connectors</b> and protocol <b>adapters.</b> <b>Connectors</b> serve to connect an agent with a remote JMX-enabled management application. This form of communication involves a connector in the JMX agent and a connector client in the management application.|$|R
50|$|APC-7 <b>{{connectors}}</b> require <b>adapters</b> {{to change}} from the connectors used in the laboratory to those used on everyday products. These adapters are expensive precision devices. For example, an APC-7 to type N (f) cost $105 in 1979. Such adapters bought new today (as of July 2012) can {{cost as much as}} $294.|$|R
40|$|Today's {{software}} {{systems are}} often built from {{a set of}} independent components. For interconnecting these components the interaction mechanisms are capsulated in connectors. This leads to an architectural description, which uses both components and connectors as first class modelling entities. Existing research provides a large fundament for the component construction. For the ability to build connectors, some work is still needed. Therefore, this paper presents a set of patterns for highlevel architectural connectors, such as: - secure transmission connector - error detection or correction connector - compressed transmission connector - split bi-directional transmission connector - redundant channel <b>connector</b> - <b>adapter</b> <b>connector.</b> These patterns restructure existing software architectures, so they meet their non-functional requirements, such as maintainability, security and safety...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the composite video output jack, the IIc, IIc Plus, and the IIGS featured a two-row, 15-pin output. In the IIc and IIc Plus, this connector was a special-purpose video <b>connector</b> for <b>adapters</b> to digital RGB monitors and RF modulators. In the IIGS it was an output for an analog RGB monitor specially designed for the IIGS.|$|R
5000|$|... 3.3 V is {{supplied}} {{along with the}} traditional 5 V and 12 V supplies. However, very few drives actually use it, so they may be powered from a four-pin Molex <b>connector</b> with an <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unicomp {{currently}} produces Model M's with USB connectors {{that can}} be connected directly to modern PCs. However, earlier Model M's have either AT or PS/2 <b>connectors,</b> requiring <b>adapters</b> for PCs lacking those capabilities. (PS/2-to-USB adapters exist for computers without PS/2 ports; and additional AT-to-PS/2 adapters, or SDL-to-PS/2 cables, for computers without AT ports.) Some PS/2-to-USB adapters are unreliable with early Model M's that require more power than the adapters can provide.|$|R
5|$|Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can {{function}} as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is {{the gender of the}} <b>adapter's</b> <b>connectors</b> and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide a description of the SSME {{electrical harness}} and cable designs as well as the development history and lessons learned...|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of personal computers and laptops consider parallel to be a legacy port {{and no longer}} include the parallel interface. Smaller machines have less room for large parallel port <b>connectors.</b> USB-to-parallel <b>adapters</b> are available that can make parallel-only printers work with USB-only systems.There are PCI (and PCI-express) cards that provide parallel ports. There are also some print servers that provide interface to parallel port through network. USB-to-EPP chips can also allow other non-printer devices {{to continue to work}} on modern computers without a parallel port.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to gathering {{data for the}} metadata catalog, some ECI systems are able to connect to the resources offered by a computer system directly through an interface such as an API. These types of connections are {{often referred to as}} <b>adapters,</b> <b>connectors,</b> or content bridges by ECI vendors.|$|R
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} in-line {{extraction system}} for water samples containing {{low levels of}} emerging contaminants is described. The system was specially developed for large volume samples (up to 4 L) using commercial solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Four sets containing PTFE-made <b>connectors,</b> brass <b>adapters</b> and ball valves were used to fit SPE cartridges and sample bottles to a 4 -port manifold attached to a 20 L carboy. A lab-made vacuum device {{was connected to the}} manifold cap. The apparatus is robust and less expensive than the typical available system. Its also provides less experimental handling, avoiding cross contamination and sample losses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{provides}} a novel {{design of the}} sample holder for the complex permittivity determination of nonmagnetic linear dielectric materials by measuring reflection and transmission coefficients. The sample holder is made of the common N <b>connector</b> female-female <b>adapter.</b> The design described is very simple and compact. Especially the price of our design is much cheaper than price for commonly used airline coaxial waveguide from verification kit with comparative measurement accuracy. Several plastics in the frequency range from 0. 4 GHz up to 18 GHz were measured and reached results are presented and discussed. Key-Words:- permittivity measurement, broadband measurement, dielectric material...|$|R
50|$|Composite or {{component}} video {{at up to}} 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock <b>connector</b> using an <b>adapter</b> sold by Apple. IPhone 4 also supports 1024×768 VGA output without audio, and HDMI output, with stereo audio, via dock adapters. The iPhone did not support voice recording until the 3.0 software update.|$|R
50|$|The {{in-system}} programming (ISP) programming {{method is}} functionally performed through SPI, plus some twiddling of the Reset line. As {{long as the}} SPI pins of the AVR are not connected to anything disruptive, the AVR chip can stay soldered on a PCB while reprogramming. All that is needed is a 6-pin <b>connector</b> and programming <b>adapter.</b> This {{is the most common}} way to develop with an AVR.|$|R
50|$|The {{inputs and}} outputs at the back {{consisted}} of an network <b>adapter</b> <b>connector</b> which is an RJ-45 port that supports 10/100/1000 Mbit/s speeds, 4 USB 2.0 connectors, center/subwoofer connector, line-in connector, front left/right line-out connector, microphone jack, side left/right surround connector, rear left/right surround connector and a network activity light. The Insprion 560 only had a VGA connector however the Insprion 570 added HDMI alongside VGA.|$|R
50|$|Before HD {{television}} {{became a}} standard, nearly all TV sets, VCRs, and DVD players sold in Europe had SCART connectors, although these are sometimes supplemented by RCA and/or RF <b>connectors.</b> SCART-RCA <b>adapters</b> also exist, which usually allow input of composite video and stereo audio. Outside Europe, separate RCA connectors are usually used, supplemented by RF connectors for backward compatibility and simplicity. Although mini-DIN connectors {{are used for}} S-Video connections, composite video, component video, and analog audio (mono or stereo) all use RCA connectors unless the signals are sent via SCART. In the digital realm, however, combined A/V connectors are gaining ground; HDMI is commonly used today for consumer electronics, and DisplayPort, a potential competitor to HDMI, is often found on home computers and peripherals.|$|R
50|$|The MagSafe 2 was {{introduced}} on the MacBook Air and Macbook Pro with Retina of mid 2012. It {{is incompatible with}} the older MagSafe <b>connectors</b> without an <b>adapter,</b> {{and returns to the}} T-shaped design that points straight out, rather than the L-shape that runs {{along the side of the}} machine. The connector was made smaller to fit the thinner laptops. MagSafe 2 was first announced at the 2012 Worldwide Developers Conference on July 11, 2012.|$|R
