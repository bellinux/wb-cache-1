5|$|Following Bianchi's accident, the FIA {{began an}} {{investigation}} and also considered appropriate changes to safety procedures, {{such as those}} at the , where {{the location of a}} tractor crane serving the Senna S <b>chicane</b> was altered.|$|E
5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino <b>Chicane.</b> Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the <b>chicane</b> and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the <b>chicane</b> to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the <b>chicane.</b> McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{restarted}} on lap twelve, Michael Schumacher led, while Häkkinen and Villeneuve were running second and third. Behind them were Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Wurz, Gene, Heidfeld, Zonta, Mazzacane, Diniz, Salo and Alesi. Michael Schumacher began to immediately {{pull away from}} Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth position. By the start of lap 13, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 2.1 seconds. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved up into seventh position after passing Gené and Wurz. Villeneuve became the third retirement of the race when he pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with gearbox problems on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen overtook Fisichella to take fourth position. Heidfeld retired after his engine failed and spun off at Variante della Roggia <b>chicane</b> on lap 15. One lap later, Ralf Schumacher lost two positions after being passed by Verstappen and Zonta. Salo passed Mazzacane to claim ninth position on lap 17. At the start of the 19th lap, Zonta tried to pass Verstappen heading into the Variante Goodyear <b>chicane,</b> but Verstappen moved onto an early defensive line to prevent Zonta from moving ahead. Zonta attempted to overtake Verstappen into the Variante della Rogia <b>chicane</b> to take third place four laps later, but was unable to complete it as he ran wide. He managed to get ahead after exiting the <b>chicane</b> on the same lap.|$|E

5000|$|The FIA {{will assume}} {{responsibility}} for the placement of artificial <b>chicanes</b> in stages, with regulations dictating their placement, width and frequency of use. The changes were introduced following the 67th Rally Finland where event organisers placed <b>chicanes</b> that were criticised by drivers for being too narrow, poorly-positioned and potentially dangerous.|$|R

5|$|After having {{held off}} {{for most of}} the race, the rain began to fall once more during the final three hours. This caused {{numerous}} incidents, including the No. 93 Autorlando Porsche missing a Mulsanne <b>chicane</b> and plowing through a temporary tire barrier. The No. 7 Peugeot made an unscheduled garage stop and retired one lap after re-entering the race, claiming oil pressure problems.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car pulled}} into the pit-lane {{at the end of}} the secondlap. Vettel {{retained}} his lead into the firstcorner, followed by Kovalainen, Webber, Rosberg and Massa. Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane; Glock passed Alonso later in the lap. Vettel immediately opened a lead of twoseconds over Kovalainen; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray off the back of the Toro Rosso. Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first <b>chicane</b> on lapfour as the track began to dry. Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13thpositions, respectively. The next lap, Hamilton attempted to pass Räikkönen at the third corner, but overshot, cutting the <b>chicane.</b> Emerging ahead of the Ferrari, he gave the place back, returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty. Glock spun on lapseven, losing oneplace to Kubica.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} gate types {{require a}} specific manner of crossing. Double cone gates must be crossed in level flight, single cone gates must be crossed in a 90° angle, and slalom {{flying through the}} <b>chicane</b> gates (knife or level flying not mandatory).|$|E

5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop <b>chicane.</b> Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at the Bus Stop <b>chicane</b> for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the Bus Stop <b>chicane</b> while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E
5|$|Engel was {{the fastest}} driver {{who was not}} issued with a penalty to not qualify within the top ten; his fastest time was eight-tenths of a second slower than Piquet's pole {{position}} lap. He was more than one-tenth of a second faster than 13th-placed qualifier Félix da Costa, who in turn, was nearly four-tenths ahead of débutant Carroll. The three drivers were followed by Sarrazin in 15th, and Evans in 16th; the latter struggled with cold brakes and tyres which prevented him from going faster. Ma's left-rear quarter was damaged when he contacted the barriers lining the circuit and qualified 17th. Jérôme d'Ambrosio struggled and was restricted to starting behind Ma. Di Grassi pushed hard and made a mistake at the <b>chicane,</b> making contact with the wall, and his front-left quarter was damaged, triggering red-flag conditions with three minutes left of the second group's running. He was restricted to starting 19th. Frijns completed the field and caused qualifying to be temporarily stopped when his car went airborne after hitting the kerbs at the <b>chicane</b> and collided with the barrier.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 European Grand Prix on 24 August, mid-season testing {{took place}} at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari {{concentrated}} on their aerodynamic set-up during tests on Monza's long straights. Massa set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld was quickest on the second day. Massa spun off into the gravel at the Ascari <b>chicane,</b> bringing a brief halt to testing. Hamilton was fastest on the third day.|$|E
50|$|As the {{combination}} of high speed and high downforce caused tyre and engine failures, two roughly equally spaced <b>chicanes</b> were consequently added to the straight before the 1990 race to limit the achievable maximum speed. The <b>chicanes</b> were added also because the FIA decreed {{it would no longer}} sanction a circuit which had a straight longer than 2 km., which is roughly the length of the Döttinger Höhe straight at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. The <b>chicanes</b> have limited top speeds on the Mulsanne with most of the leading cars topping out at approximately 330 km/h during qualifying and 320 km/h during the race.|$|R

5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari <b>chicane,</b> bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari <b>chicane,</b> forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E
5|$|Following the pitstops {{and safety}} car deployment, Petrov had gained sixth place while Barrichello, Alguersuari, Rosberg and Maldonado {{were in the}} {{remaining}} point scoring positions. Schumacher and Webber, who had contested second place before the safety car, resumed their fight as the race resumed on lap 61. Barrichello was passed by Rosberg and Alguersuari before Massa, {{who had been in}} eleventh place, overtook both Williams cars for ninth. Kobayashi lost fifth place to Petrov, and Maldonado retired by spinning off on the wet track at turn two. Webber, passing Schumacher using DRS, cut the <b>chicane</b> on lap 64 and ceded the position back to avoid a penalty. Button passed Webber, after he again cut the <b>chicane,</b> and Schumacher on the same lap, and gained second place. As Button began catching race leader Vettel, Webber overtook Schumacher for third place on lap 67. On the same lap di Resta retired because of a puncture, and Massa gained eighth position from Alguersuari. The fastest lap of the race was set by Button on lap 69, setting a time of 1:16.956 as he was closing to Vettel for the race lead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop <b>chicane,</b> but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the <b>chicane</b> but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fatal}} {{accident}} of Bryan Faloon the previous year, two <b>chicanes</b> {{were added to}} circuit {{in a bid to}} slow the cars down. One was placed down the back straight and the other was just before the main straight. These <b>chicanes</b> were very artificial, with them being made up of concrete kerbing, railway sleepers and tractor tyres.|$|R

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Barrichello set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, which was three-tenths of a second quicker than Pedro de la Rosa of Arrows. Coulthard was third fastest despite going off the circuit at the Clark <b>chicane.</b> Michael Schumacher went off at the Senna <b>chicane</b> en route to recording the fourth quickest lap, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen, Montoya, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the second practice session, Irvine was running quicker by setting the fastest {{time of the day}} of 1:41.424, ahead of Montoya in second. Häkkinen was third quickest, in front of Barrichello in fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit's chicanes which prevented him from setting a quicker lap. de la Rosa, Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier, followed in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the Bus Stop <b>chicane,</b> he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the Bus Stop <b>chicane,</b> but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit for dry tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LXIV ING Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 September 2008 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps {{near the}} town of Spa, Belgium. It was the 13thrace of the 2008 Formula One season. The 44-lap race was won by Felipe Massa for the Ferrari team, after the initial winner, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, was penalised for cutting a <b>chicane</b> and gaining an {{advantage}} over Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, {{also known}} as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR.
