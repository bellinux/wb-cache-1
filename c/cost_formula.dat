40|$|We {{introduce}} the finger aware cursor operator for relational join queries. It scans {{a list of}} tuples in a finger enabled manner when a nested loop join operation is performed. Using this scan operation, we improve the performance of nested loop join when compared to when compared to conventional scan. To quantify the improvement in performance using fingered scan, a statistic named runs that quantifies the degree of randomness in a list of records is introduced. This statistic is vital in assessing the performance improvement achieved using fingered scan. Using runs statistic as a key ingredient, we develop a cost model that can assign a cost value to the join operation based on underlying fingered scan. We then develop a <b>cost</b> <b>formula</b> and evaluate the cost model against a simulated data set. We show that conventional System R cost model {{is not sufficient to}} capture the performance improvement. We then evaluate using the new <b>cost</b> <b>formula</b> and show that it predicts the cost of join operation correctly...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} nearly-zero energy building and encouraged setting the nearly-zero energy target {{with a view to}} cost-optimal level - the energy performance that leads to the lowest cost during the building estimated economic lifecycle. To searching this regard, the cost-optimal methodology based on the global cost was defined providing a tool to assess different nearly-zero energy scenarios. Nowadays, the cost-optimal analysis is used as a decision-making tool between different energy design alternatives mostly on a theoretical level; but it has spread little among the professional field. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give a more holistic and all-comprehensive approach to the cost-optimal methodology. This paper proposes and applies a modified approach of the cost-optimal evaluation, which will lead to the achievement of more interesting results for all the actors involved, including investors and final users. This study highlights the usefulness of including not only costs but also benefits that can derive from each energy design scenario. Choosing different energy efficiency solutions, the related benefits evaluation could turn the tables. Different kinds of benefits could be considered as the increase of the real estate market value, the enhancement of the indoor comfort, the reduction of CO 2 emissions and others. Thus, a proposal of how quantifying these qualitative benefits in monetary terms is shown to introduce them in the global <b>cost</b> <b>formula.</b> Actually, benefits conversion into monetary values is the most challenging issue. Precisely, this paper shows a list of benefits that can affect the choice of different envelope and HVAC system solutions, pointing out their influence on the global cost evaluation. Certainly, introducing benefits in the global <b>cost</b> <b>formula</b> means using a more holistic and complete approach, while the already complex degree of the cost-optimal methodology – due to the numerous input data –increases. To validate the reviewed global <b>cost</b> <b>formula,</b> it will be necessary to apply it to various case studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{average daily}} benefit to cost ratio of a {{building}} energy storage system is mainly constrained by the battery lifetime. This paper aims to minimize the average daily cost of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) (comprised of a battery and supercapacitor) by optimizing the battery capacity. A novel optimization model is proposed with the objective to find the minimum average daily investment cost of the HESS. The objective function has two parts: (1) the investment <b>cost</b> <b>formula</b> for the battery is derived {{as a function of}} the battery capacity, which has an interdependence with the minimum state of charge (SOC) and the maximum discharge current; (2) the investment <b>cost</b> <b>formula</b> for the supercapacitor is also established as a function of battery capacity by matching the maximum battery power with that of the supercapacitor. Case studies demonstrate several ways to increase the average daily benefit to cost ratio: (1) adopting a suitable control strategy to avoid capacity saturation; (2) reducing the battery SOC to increase the threshold for the maximum discharge current (MDC) saturation; and (3) increasing MDC to raise the threshold for the SOC saturation. Results show that the average daily benefit to cost ratio is doubled compared to previous work...|$|E

40|$|Query {{processing}} {{over the}} Internet involving autonomous data sources {{is a major}} task in data integration. It requires the estimated costs of possible query plans in order to select the best one with the minimum cost. In this context, {{the cost of a}} query is affected by three factors: network congestion, server contention state, and complexity of the query. In this paper, we study the effects of both the network congestion and server contention state on the cost of a query. We refer to these two factors together as system contention states. We present a new approach to determining the system contention states by clustering the costs of a sample query. We construct two <b>cost</b> <b>formulas</b> for each of the system contention states respectively using the multiple regression process. When a new query is submitted, its system contention state is estimated first using either the time slides method or the statistical method. The cost of the query is then calculated using the corresponding <b>cost</b> <b>formulas.</b> The estimated <b>cost</b> of the query is further adjusted to improve its accuracy. Our experiments show that our methods can produce quite accurate cost estimates of the submitted queries to remote data sources over the Internet. ...|$|R
