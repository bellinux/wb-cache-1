50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} as a leavening agent, i.e., to cause baked goods to rise. Because it is acidic, when combined with an alkali ingredient, commonly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate, it reacts to produce carbon dioxide and a salt. Outward pressure of the carbon dioxide gas causes the rising effect. When combined in a ready-made baking powder, the acid and alkali ingredients are included in the right proportions such that they will exactly neutralize each other and not significantly affect the overall pH of the product. AMCP and MCP are fast acting, releasing most carbon dioxide within minutes of mixing. It is popularly used in pancake mixes. In double acting baking powders, MCP is often combined with the slow acting acid sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP).|$|E

High power input in a microarc oxidation process is required to deposit coatings with crystalline HA. However, the high power input, either in potentiostatic or galvanostatic modes, leads to poor adhesion. Different voltage controls (constant or linear increase) used in bipolar pulse microarc oxidation (MAO) in aqueous solutions containing calcium acetate (Ca(CH 3 COO) 2 ∙H 2 O) and <b>calcium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> (Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ∙H 2 O) were investigated in this study.

The predominant phase varied from anatase to rutile as the applied voltage increased. More rutile, CaTiO 3 and HA crystals in the coatings were achieved when the linearly increasing voltage reached 400 V in an HA-containing electrolyte.
