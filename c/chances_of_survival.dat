5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and animals to increase their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then livestock animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E
5|$|The CPC has {{retained}} close {{relations with the}} remaining socialist states still espousing communism: Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam and their respective ruling parties. It spends {{a fair amount of}} time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the collapse of the Eastern European socialist states in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.|$|E

5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.|$|E
50|$|For {{people who}} are hospitalized for thermal burns, 95% <b>of</b> them survive. <b>Survival</b> rates {{increased}} steadily over {{the last half century}} due to advances in treating burns as well as more trustful burn centers. According to statistics from 1990 to 1994, the risks of death caused by burns are greater for: people older than 60 years of age, burns covering over 40% of the body, and patients suffering inhalation injury. According to the formula developed by authors, patients who has zero risk criteria would have 99.7% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> ones who have one criterion would have 97% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> patients having two would have 67% chance, and patients nursing all three would have 10% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} thought that dogs and gray wolves did not voluntarily interbreed in the wild, though they can produce fertile wolf-dog offspring. In 2010, {{a study of}} 74 Italian wolf male {{lineages}} found that 5 of them originated from dog ancestry, indicating that female wolves will breed with stray male dogs in the wild. In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolf-dog hybridization, which occurred 10,000–15,000 years ago. Like pure wolves, hybrids breed once annually, though their mating season occurs three months earlier, with pups mostly being born in the winter period, thus lessening their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> However, one genetic study undertaken in the Caucasus Mountains showed {{that as many as}} 10% of dogs in the area, including livestock guardian dogs, are first generation hybrids. The captive breeding of wolf-dog hybrids has proliferated in the USA, with 300,000 such animals being present there.|$|E

Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is sad to say goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E

5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E

25|$|According to Penton, further {{evidence}} that the Nazis did not consider Witnesses inherently candidates for destruction {{in the same way}} as Jews, Romanis, and homosexuals, is that almost no Jehovah's Witnesses were gassed, and they were often employed domestically by the SS and in other jobs with significantly better conditions, improving their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
