5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and <b>chrysoberyl.</b> As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance and {{exploration}} both had significant {{impacts on the}} development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability {{of a wide variety of}} gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, amazonite from Brazil, spinel, iolite, and <b>chrysoberyl</b> from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea peridot, as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.|$|E
500|$|Beryllium {{is found}} in over 100 minerals, but most are {{uncommon}} to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), <b>chrysoberyl</b> (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald.|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} oxide of {{vanadium}}, vanadium pentoxide V2O5, {{is used as}} a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. Vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics. [...] Vanadium is an important component of mixed metal oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein, acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. In service, the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture. [...] Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO2, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry, although alexandrite in nature is a <b>chrysoberyl.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{ships of}} CW 9 had sailed {{on and the}} anti-submarine yachts HMS Wilna, HMS Rion, {{trawlers}} HMS Cape Palliser, Kingston <b>Chrysoberyl,</b> Kingston Olivine and Stella Capella were attacked, having been sent to rescue survivors. Cape Palliser and Rion were badly damaged; Fighter Command sent 145 and 43 squadrons to defend the convoy. Just after 16:00, three 145 Squadron Hurricanes were lost with their pilots against Bf110s and three more were lost from 43 Squadron, five of the pilots being killed. Three StG 77 Stukas were shot down by 145 Squadron and four were damaged by 43 Squadron (two were 70 percent and 80 damaged). LG 1 suffered two damaged Bf110s and three Bf109s from II./JG 27 were lost, two shot down by 43 Squadron and one was damaged; no ships were hit and none were sunk. 152 and 238 squadrons tried to intercept but failed {{to make contact with}} the attackers but 152 Squadron met Bf109s from JG 53 [...] south of Swanage and two Spitfires were damaged and force-landed, the pilots unhurt. II./JG 53 claimed two Spitfires and a Hurricane for no loss. II./JG 53 commanded by Günther Freiherr von Maltzahn flew from Guernsey.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{recorded}} (for all I know) of the philanthropic Emperor Bo, that when engaged in cutting his garden lawn with a mower made of alabaster and <b>chrysoberyl,</b> he chanced {{to cut down}} a small flower; whereupon, being much affected, he commanded his wise men immediately to take down upon tablets of ivory the lines beginning: [...] "Small and unobtrusive blossom with ruby extremities." [...] But this incident, touching as it is, does not shake my belief in the incident of Robert Burns and the daisy; and I am left with an impression that poets are {{pretty much the same}} everywhere in their poetry&mdash;and in their prose.|$|E
60|$|On one {{occasion}} {{he took up}} the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green <b>chrysoberyl</b> that turns red by lamp-light, the cymophane with its wire-like line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.|$|E
5000|$|The mineral or {{gemstone}} <b>chrysoberyl</b> is an aluminate of beryllium {{with the}} formula BeAl2O4. The name <b>chrysoberyl</b> {{is derived from}} the Greek words χρυσός chrysos and βήρυλλος beryllos, meaning [...] "a gold-white spar". Despite the similarity of their names, <b>chrysoberyl</b> and beryl are two completely different gemstones, although they both contain beryllium. <b>Chrysoberyl</b> is the third-hardest frequently encountered natural gemstone and lies at 8.5 on the hardness scale, between corundum (9) and topaz (8).|$|E
5000|$|Ordinary <b>chrysoberyl</b> is yellowish-green and {{transparent}} to translucent. When the mineral exhibits good pale green to yellow color and is transparent, {{then it is}} used as a gemstone. The three main varieties of <b>chrysoberyl</b> are: ordinary yellow-to-green <b>chrysoberyl,</b> cat's eye or cymophane, and alexandrite. Yellow-green <b>chrysoberyl</b> was referred to as [...] "chrysolite" [...] during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, which caused confusion since that name has also been used for the mineral olivine ("peridot" [...] as a gemstone); that name is no longer used in the gemological nomenclature.|$|E

5000|$|Gems {{lacking the}} silky {{inclusions}} {{required to produce}} the cat's eye effect are usually faceted. An alexandrite cat's eye is a <b>chrysoberyl</b> cat's eye that changes color. [...] "Milk and honey" [...] is a term commonly {{used to describe the}} color of the best cat's eyes. The effect refers to the sharp milky ray of white light normally crossing the cabochon as a center line along its length and overlying the honey-colored background. The honey color is considered to be top-grade by many gemologists but the lemon yellow colors are also popular and attractive. Cat's eye material is found as {{a small percentage of the}} overall <b>chrysoberyl</b> production wherever <b>chrysoberyl</b> is found.|$|E
50|$|If the {{pegmatite}} fluid {{is rich in}} beryllium, crystals of beryl or <b>chrysoberyl</b> could form. Beryl has a high {{ratio of}} beryllium to aluminium, while {{the opposite is true}} for <b>chrysoberyl.</b> Both are stable with the common mineral quartz. For alexandrite to form, some chromium would also have had to be present. However, beryllium and chromium do not tend to occur in the same types of rock. Chromium is commonest in mafic and ultramafic rocks in which beryllium is extremely rare. Beryllium becomes concentrated in felsic pegmatites in which chromium is almost absent. Therefore, the only situation where an alexandrite can grow is when Be-rich pegmatitic fluids react with Cr-rich country rock. This unusual requirement explains the rarity of this <b>chrysoberyl</b> variety.|$|E

5000|$|In gemology, chatoyancy ( [...] ), or chatoyance or cat's eye effect, is {{an optical}} {{reflectance}} effect seen in certain gemstones. Coined from the French [...] "œil de chat", meaning [...] "cat's eye", chatoyancy arises {{either from the}} fibrous structure of a material, as in tiger's eye quartz, or from fibrous inclusions or cavities within the stone, as in cat's eye <b>chrysoberyl.</b> [...] The precipitates that cause chatoyance in <b>chrysoberyl</b> are the mineral rutile, composed mostly of titanium dioxide. Examined samples have yielded no evidence of tubes or fibres. The rutile precipitates all align perpendicularly with respect to cat's eye effect. It is reasoned that the lattice parameter of the rutile matches {{only one of the}} three orthorhombic crystal axes of the <b>chrysoberyl,</b> resulting in preferred alignment along that direction.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of asteriated stones such as star sapphires and chatoyant stones such as cat's eye <b>chrysoberyl,</b> a domed cabochon cut is used to show the star or eye, which would not be visible in a faceted cut.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "cat's eye", {{when used}} by {{itself as the}} name of a gemstone, refers to a cat's eye <b>chrysoberyl.</b> It is also used as an {{adjective}} which indicates the chatoyance phenomenon in another stone, e.g., cat's eye aquamarine.|$|E
50|$|Translucent {{yellowish}} chatoyant <b>chrysoberyl</b> {{is called}} cymophane or cat's eye. Cymophane has its derivation {{also from the}} Greek words meaning 'wave' and 'appearance', {{in reference to the}} haziness that visually distorts what would normally be viewed as a well defined surface of a cabochon. This effect may be combined with a cat eye effect. In this variety, microscopic tubelike cavities or needle-like inclusions of rutile occur in an orientation parallel to the c-axis, producing a chatoyant effect visible as a single ray of light passing across the crystal. This effect is best seen in gemstones cut in cabochon form perpendicular to the c-axis. The color in yellow <b>chrysoberyl</b> is due to Fe3+ impurities.|$|E
50|$|The {{confusion}} between spinel and taaffeite {{is understandable}} as certain structural features are identical in both. Anderson et al., classified taaffeite {{as an intermediate}} mineral between spinel and <b>chrysoberyl.</b> Unlike spinel, taaffeite displays the property of double refraction that allows distinction between these two minerals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chrysoberyl</b> {{can also}} {{grow in the}} country rocks near to {{pegmatite}}s, when Be- and Al-rich fluids from the pegmatite react with surrounding minerals. Hence, {{it can be found}} in mica schists and in contact with metamorphic deposits of dolomitic marble. Because it is a hard, dense mineral that is resistant to chemical alteration, it can be weathered out of rocks and deposited in river sands and gravels in alluvial deposits with other gem minerals such as diamond, corundum, topaz, spinel, garnet, and tourmaline. When found in such placers, it will have rounded edges instead of sharp, wedge-shape forms. Much of the <b>chrysoberyl</b> mined in Brazil and Sri Lanka is recovered from placers, as the host rocks have been intensely weathered and eroded.|$|E
5000|$|Brazilianite is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} gemstone.Brazilianite is relatively new phosphate minerals along with amblygonite, turquoise and apatite that are used as gemstones. [...] Brazilianite is often confused with amblygonite, apatite, <b>chrysoberyl,</b> beryl, and topaz. [...] Even though it was first described in 1945, its discovery was actually in 1944 but it was believed it was <b>chrysoberyl</b> until analysis was done to the mineral indicating a new mineral. [...] The State of Minas Gerais is the largest producer and exporter of gemstones in Brazil and is accountable for 74 percent of the official production which includes brazilianite. [...] It is soft and fragile causing it {{not to be a}} popular stone. [...] When brazilianite is heated, it losses it yellow color and becomes colorless.|$|E
50|$|Honey-colored stones {{have been}} used to imitate the more valued cat's eye <b>chrysoberyl</b> (cymophane), but the overall effect is unconvincing. Artificial fibre optic glass is a common {{imitation}} of tiger's eye, and is produced {{in a wide range of}} colours. Tiger's eye comes primarily from South Africa and east Asia.|$|E
50|$|Gem species {{known for}} this {{phenomenon}} include the aforementioned quartz, <b>chrysoberyl,</b> beryl (especially var. aquamarine), charoite, tourmaline, labradorite, selenite, feldspar, apatite, moonstone, thomsonite and scapolite amongst others. Glass optical cable can also display chatoyancy if properly cut, {{and has become}} a popular decorative material in a variety of vivid colors.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium {{is found}} in over 100 minerals, but most are {{uncommon}} to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), <b>chrysoberyl</b> (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald. The green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).|$|E
5000|$|Although other {{minerals}} such as tourmaline, scapolite, corundum, spinel and quartz can form [...] "cat's eye" [...] stones similar in appearance to cymophane, the jewelry industry designates these stones as [...] "quartz cat's eyes", or [...] "ruby cat's eyes" [...] and only <b>chrysoberyl</b> can {{be referred to}} as [...] "cat's eye" [...] with no other designation.|$|E
50|$|Phenakite {{is found}} in {{high-temperature}} pegmatite veins and in mica-schists associated with quartz, <b>chrysoberyl,</b> apatite and topaz. It {{has long been known}} from the emerald and <b>chrysoberyl</b> mine on the Takovaya stream, near Yekaterinburg in the Urals of Russia, where large crystals occur in mica-schist. It is also found with topaz and amazon-stone in the granite of the Ilmen Mountains in the southern Urals and of the Pikes Peak region in Colorado (US). Small, gem grade individual crystals of phenakite showing a prismatic habit are noted in beryl dissolution cavities at the Noumas II Pegmatite, part of the Orange River pegmatite belt in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Large crystals of prismatic habit have been found in a feldspar quarry at Kragero in Norway. Framont near Schirmeck in Alsace is another well-known locality. Still larger crystals, measuring 1 to 2 in. in diameter and weighing 28 lb. have been found at Greenwood in Maine, but these are pseudomorphs of quartz after phenakite.|$|E
50|$|In 1836 he {{was sent}} to Vesoul as a mining engineer, and began {{studying}} the different ores at Franche-Comté, where his reputation grew, growing artificial crystals of a number of minerals including corundum, <b>chrysoberyl</b> and peridot.
