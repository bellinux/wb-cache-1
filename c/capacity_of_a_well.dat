40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{practical}} range of net power capacity available from conventional and enhanced geothermal wells {{as a function}} of temperature and productivity index. For a temperature range of 100 °C to 190 °C, which is the operating temperature limit of presently available downhole pumps, wells are typically pumped and power is usually generated in a binary-cycle plant, and in rare cases in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In this temperature range, the net MW <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> has an upper limit of about 7. 3 MW, irrespective of how high the well’s productivity index is. This capacity limit cannot be improved unless technology can be improved to allow setting pumps deeper in the well than the current limit of 457 m (1, 500 feet) and pumping at a higher rate than the present limit of about 160 ℓ/s (2, 500 gallons per minute). For resource temperatures greater than 190 °C, wells must be self-flowed, and power is generated from such wells in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In the temperature range of 190 °C to nearly 220 °C a self-flowing well’s net power capacity (irrespective of its productivity index) is less than the maximum of 7. 3 MW for a pumped well. Above 220 °C, the net power <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> increases rapidly with increasing temperature and productivity index, and there is no practical upper limit. The maximum net power capacity available from an EGS well depends on reservoir depth and local temperature gradient; the optimum depth being increasingly shallow for higher temperature gradients. The trend of decrease in the optimum depth with temperature gradient applies whether this optimum is defined in terms of the maximum net MW <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> or the minimum drilling cost per net MW capacity...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to find a}} {{probabilistic}} characterization of the productive <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> in a geological formation hosting an aquifer. Such characterization in terms of productive capacity may allow a preliminary assessment to be made of the probability of success for a required productivity (i. e. target point). This evaluation is usually carried out by statistical analysis of a geological dataset, which is likely to be influenced by many parameters. Such datasets are often incomplete or unreliable. Therefore, a method for evaluating potential productivity, using probabilistic hydraulic conductivity data, is proposed. The hydraulic characterization of hydrogeologic units is based on the collection of information obtained mainly through pumping tests and their interpretation. The results, expressed in terms of hydraulic conductivity, are summarized in a range of variability that is strictly dependent on the number of performed tests and their spatial distribution in the unit itself. If this range is known, an estimate of well’s yield can be made on a deterministic basis, through Thiem’s relationship for steady state conditions, by setting a value of hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the average value of the range. The proposed reliability analysis enables to overcome the limitations of the deterministic approach by correlating each calculated flow rate, which is taken to be a design flow rate exceeding the critical flow rate of the hydrogeologic unit, to its probability of failure. Therefore, this approach aims to evaluate the probability of failure of the water system. The preliminary result is to associate the values of aquifer exploitation with a probability failure function. This outcome can then be used to define the potential solutions in the optimal allocation of the withdrawal by means of reliability analysis that takes into account the uncertainty of the system...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to estimate the electrical generating <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> small-diameter geothermal wells for off-grid rural electrification using wellhead generators. In these applications, generating <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> interest are typically in the range 100 - 1000 kWe. The approach amounted to (1) calculating the “wellhead discharge characteristics” (water/steam discharge rates as functions of wellhead pressure) for <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> hypothetical <b>well</b> and reservoir descriptions, (2) employing a mathematical representation for the net generating <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wellhead powerplant as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> its operating inlet pressure and steam inlet rate, and (3) varying the wellhead (= turbine inlet) pressure to identify the “optimum” pressure value at which the net electrical power is maximized. Calculations were carried out for well diameters from 75 mm to 300 mm, for well depths from 300 to 1200 meters, for reservoir temperatures from 100 °C to 240 °C, for piezometric surface depths (related to shut-in reservoir pressure) from zero to 250 meters, and for downhole productivity indices from 2 kg/s/bar to infinity. A few cases were also included in which the CO 2 content of the reservoir fluid was non-zero (up to 1 % by mass in the brine). Both backpressure and condensing single-flash steam turbine powerplants were considered. The study was restricted to vertical wells of uniform inside diameter and to all-liquid in-situ reservoir fluids. Over fifteen thousand combinations of the above parameters were examined.

In order to seek an enhanced condensate oil recovery technology that is suitable for this condensate gas reservoir at its later development stage, it is necessary to analyze its reserve producing degree and remaining development potential after depletion production, depending on the supercritical fluid phase behavior and depletion production performance characteristics. The supercritical fluid theories and multiple reservoir engineering dynamic analysis methods were adopted comprehensively, such as dynamic reserves, production decline, liquid-carrying <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> production <b>well,</b> and remaining development potential analysis. It is shown that, at its early development stage, the condensate in Lian 4 fault block presented the features of supercritical fluid, and the reservoir pressure was lower than the dew point pressure, so retrograde condensate loss was significant. Owing to the retrograde condensate effect and the fast release of elastic energy, the reserve producing degree of depletion production is low in Lian 4 fault block, and 80 % of condensate oil still remains in the reservoir. So, the remaining development potential is great. The supercritical condensate in Lian 4 fault block is of high density. Based on the optimization design by numerical simulation of compositional model, it is proposed to inject CO 2 at the top and build up pressure by alternating production and injection, so that the secondary gas cap is formed while the gravity-stable miscible displacement is realized. In this way, the recovery factor of condensate reservoirs can be improved by means of the secondary development technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{generally}} accomplished {{technique for}} horizontal wells in tight gas reservoirs is by multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, not to mention, the flow characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horizontal <b>well</b> with multiple transverse fractures are very intricate. Conventional methods, <b>well</b> as <b>an</b> evaluation unit, {{are difficult to}} accurately predict production <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> each fracture and productivity differences between <b>wells</b> with <b>a</b> different number <b>of</b> fractures. Thus, <b>a</b> single fracture sets the minimum evaluation unit, matrix, fractures, and lateral wellbore model that are then combined integrally to approximate horizontal well with multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in tight gas reservoirs. This paper presents a new semi-analytical methodology for predicting the production <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horizontal <b>well</b> with multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in tight gas reservoirs. Firstly, a mathematical flow model used as a medium, which is disturbed by finite conductivity vertical fractures and rectangular shaped boundaries, is established and explained by the Fourier integral transform. Then the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single stage fracture analysis is incorporated to establish linear flow model within a single fracture with a variable rate. The Fredholm integral numerical solution is applicable for the fracture conductivity function. Finally, the pipe flow model along the lateral wellbore is adapted to couple multi-stages fracture mathematical models, and the equation group of predicting productivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multi-stage fractured horizontal well. The whole flow process from the matrix to bottom-hole and production interference between adjacent fractures is also established. Meanwhile, the corresponding iterative algorithm of the equations is given. In this case analysis, the productions of each well and fracture are calculated under the different bottom-hole flowing pressure, and this method also contributes to obtaining the distribution of pressure drop and production for every horizontal segment and its changes with effective fracture half-length and conductivity. Application of this technology will provide gas reservoir engineers a better tool to predict well and fracture productivity, besides optimizing transverse hydraulic fractures configuration and conductivity along the lateral wellbore...|$|R

However, the activity elicited during a VO 2 max test does not reflect the high intensity intermittent nature of soccer performance. Therefore, VO 2 max testing is unable to isolate specific components of fitness and indicators of match performance, but can provide information related to the general physical <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player, as <b>well</b> as differentiate between populations. These factors, as well as the impracticality of adopting VO 2 max testing in soccer teams, suggests sport scientists use maximal oxygen uptake assessment during periods of the season when large changes in fitness are expected. Measurement of lactate threshold can be useful during steady-state exercise to show changes in aerobic performance elicited from training interventions. However, the disparity associated with blood lactate accumulation in steady-state and intermittent type activity means its usefulness in soccer is limited. Moreover, as lactate threshold is not sensitive enough to soccer-specific indicators of match performance, it is best used as <b>a</b> determinant <b>of</b> general fitness.

Due to the geometry of the LSB, {{as well as its}} unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections resultant of manufacturing processes, much of the existing research for common cold-formed steel sections is not directly applicable to LSB. Experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of LSBs subject to pure bending actions and predominant shear actions. To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the strength of LSB sections under combined bending and shear actions. Combined bending and shear is especially prevalent at the supports of continuous span and cantilever beams, where the interaction of high shear force and bending moment can reduce the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> section to <b>well</b> below that for the same section subject only to pure shear or moment. Hence experimental studies were conducted to assess the combined bending and shear behaviour and strengths of LSBs. Eighteen tests were conducted and the results were compared with current AS/NZS 4600 and AS 4100 design rules. AS/NZS 4600 design rules were shown to grossly underestimate the combined bending and shear <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> LSBs and hence two lower bound design equations were proposed based on experimental results. Use of these equations will significantly improve the confidence and cost-effectiveness of designing LSBs for combined bending and shear actions...|$|R

This study addresses the mechanisms activating PEK, also designated PERK or EIF 2 AK 3. We describe the characterization of two regions in the ER luminal portion of the transmembrane PEK that carry out distinct functions in the regulation of this eIF 2 ki-nase. The first region mediates oligomerization between PEK polypeptides, and deletion of this portion of PEK blocked induction of eIF 2 kinase activity. The second characterized region of PEK facilitates interaction with ER chaperones. In the absence of stress, PEK associates with ER chaperones GRP 78 (BiP) and GRP 94, and this binding is released {{in response to}} ER stress. ER luminal sequences flanking the transmembrane domain are re-quired for GRP 78 interaction, and deletion of this por-tion of PEK led to its activation {{even in the absence}} of ER stress.

The theoretical background of the study was constructed from academic literature, which is related to concepts of learning by exporting, along with sources for learning in the market and new product development. The empirical research in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> qualitative case study was based on four semi-structured interviews and secondary data from the case company official site. The interview data was collected between March and April 2015 from case company employees who directly work in the department of exporting and product development. The method of thematic analysis was used to categorize and interpret the collected data. What was conclusively discovered, was that the knowledge from an exporting market can be an incentive for product innovation, especially an incremental one. Foreign customers and competitors as important sources for new knowledge contribute to the innovative process. Foreign market competitors’ influence on product improvements was high only when the competitor was a market leader or held a colossal market share, while the customers’ influence is always high. Therefore, involving a foreign customer in the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new product is vital to a company that is interested in benefiting from what is learned through exporting.

40|$|AbstractMethods for {{estimating}} subsurface volumes in porous and permeable geologic formations {{are routinely}} applied {{in oil and}} gas, ground water, underground natural gas storage, and UIC disposal evaluations. In general, these methods {{can be divided into}} two categories: static and dynamic. The static models require only rock and fluid properties, while the dynamic methods require information about active injection, e. g. injection volumes and reservoir pressures. The static models are volumetric and compressibility; the dynamic models are decline curve analyses, mass (or volumetric) balance, and reservoir simulation. The volumetric method requires a simple geometric description of the formation that includes formation height and area, porosity, and some type of factor that reflects the pore volume that CO 2 can occupy. The compressibility method relates the change in pore pressure to the change in water and pore volume. Pore pressure will increase as CO 2 is injected. This causes a decrease in water volume and an increase in pore volume. The sum of these changes can accommodate space for CO 2 storage. This is primarily an issue for closed reservoirs. For active CO 2 injection, in addition to the static methods, dynamic methods can be used. Some geologic formations will incur flat or constant injection rates with variable injection pressure, while other formations will have decreasing injection rate with constant injection pressure. This is primarily due to surface operations and the outer boundary condition of the reservoir (closed or open). A decreasing injection rate trend can be analyzed and extrapolated to an uneconomic injection rate to infer the ultimate storage <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active injection <b>well.</b> Mass or volumetric balance can be used to estimate subsurface injected volumes using cumulative injection volume as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> pore pressure. Based on the geologic unit, combinations of parameters are used to allow straight line projections of the observed trends to make forecasts of the ultimate storage capacity. Injection zone flow simulation models can be used pre- or post injection, require the most input data and can accommodate a very rigorously defined geologic model. Storage estimates can be made readily from simulation for various development scenarios that include completion interval, well-type, injection rates, and multiple injection well spacing. The data requirements, assumptions and limitations for each of these methods are reviewed. Advantages and disadvantages of applying each method to basin-scale and specific site-scale storage estimates are discussed...|$|R
50|$|A {{drill stem}} test (DST) is a {{procedure}} for isolating and testing the pressure, permeability and productive <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> geological formation during the drilling <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well.</b> The test is <b>an</b> important measurement <b>of</b> pressure behaviour at the drill stem and is <b>a</b> valuable way <b>of</b> obtaining information on the formation fluid and establishing whether <b>a</b> <b>well</b> has found <b>a</b> commercial hydrocarbon reservoir.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} define the {{capacity}} constraints, let us now identify the principal constraints and describe {{them in terms of}} the resource limited, factors, specific conditions and consequences. The constraints are grouped based on the type of moving bodies concerned, and on their location in a station or line section. Seven groups of constraints are defined below: (i) the vehicle <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infrastructure; (ii) the vehicle fleet; (iii) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vehicle; (iv) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> route; (v) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station; (vi) the vehicle storage and movement <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station; (vii) the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station for interface with personal transport modes.|$|R
30|$|The body of {{the paper}} {{consists}} of three main parts, followed by a conclusion. Section  2 provides the framework <b>of</b> analysis for <b>a</b> mass transit system, identifying four subsystems relating respectively to: the Passenger, the Vehicle, the Station and the Line. In Section  3, seven categories <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint are described: (i) the vehicle <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infrastructure; (ii) the vehicle fleet; (iii) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vehicle; (iv) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> route; (v) the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station; (vi) the vehicle movement and storage <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station; (vii) the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station for interface with individual modes of transport. Section  4 covers the composition of resources {{in the operation of}} public transport, interactions between capacity constraints and the feedbacks by users or the operator on congestion mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The problem {{considered}} {{in this paper}} is whether the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> discrete time Gaussian channel is increased by feedback or not. It {{is well known that}} the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white Gaussian channel under the average power constraint is not changed by feedback. In the previous paper [7] we gave some sufficient conditions under which the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-white Gaussian channel is increased by feedback. In this paper we give the necessary condition under which the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-white Gaussian channel with blockwise white noise is increased by feedback. ...|$|R
30|$|The load group {{varies from}} 2 to 12  MW. The {{transmission}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 10  kV line is 3 – 4 MV. The common <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 35 / 10  kV transformer is 31.5 MVA, 20 MVA, 16 MVA and 5 MVA. The typical <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 35 / 10  kV substation can be 5 * 2 MVA, 16 * 2 MVA, whose load is between 5 and 10  MW.|$|R
30|$|The {{passenger}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vehicle induces {{the passenger}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> route by adding up the <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> the vehicles covering the route {{during a period}} H. Demand itself consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flow <b>of</b> passengers who arrive at the platform during the period.|$|R
3000|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the streaming <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cluster it is necessary to measure the streaming <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single streaming server in the cloud with the test setup described in subsection [...] "Test setup".|$|R
30|$|For a SISO {{fading channel}} with perfect {{knowledge}} of the channel at the receiver, the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> SISO link is given as C= log 2 (1 +ρ). Therefore, the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> equivalent SISO link is equal to approximately 6.66 bps/Hz at ρ.|$|R
