40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to address the low service levels offered by Buffalo City Municipality. In the past Council has received numerous customer complaints to this effect, via correspondence and verbal <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> <b>council</b> delegates and officials. The executive head of the municipality has requested a turn around of this appalling situation. The aim of this {{research was}} to gain insight and meaning to the existing problem in an attempt to correct it. This was accomplished by identifying the problem, and then by introducing sub-problems to the main problem for practical and relevant solutions. The research was extended to cover the East London and King Williams Town Local Councils. This was undertaken through personal interviews with the Buffalo City Municipality staff, management, Salga officials and non-profit organisations that were involved in community research on service levels and delivery in local government for this region. Literature was reviewed on methods of improving customer relations in both the public and private sectors. Local and international best practices were analysed to benchmark against successful practices worldwide. Information relevant to Buffalo City’s scenario has been presented in this study, from the identification of effective customer relation practices, followed by the roles and skills required by management. In addition to the personal interviews conducted, a two-page questionnaire was compiled based on integrated information from literature reviewed on best practices, and staff and management input. The questionnaire formed part of the empirical study. Results of the study were critically analysed and revealed three main areas of urgent importance. These are: effective communication, the establishment of a customer care policy and procedures together with training and development. These are effectively achievable after the placement of staff. The study was concluded with a practical and applicable detailed programme of intervention...|$|E

40|$|A {{communication}} containing {{proposals for}} {{reform of the}} EU olive-oil regime was forwarded by the European Commission <b>to</b> the EU <b>Council</b> and European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003. There are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled payment scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional olive-growing areas, so partial decoupling, with 60 % of payments to be decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme is proposed. 40 % of payments are to remain within national envelopes, nominally not linked to production but linked {{to the maintenance of}} olive groves, the soil and the environment. Full details of the reform proposals and their likely impact {{can be found in the}} Commission <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Council</b> and European Parliament (COM (2003) 544 final). It is anticipated that adhesion to the single farm payment scheme will result in more stable incomes for olive-oil producers, due to the greater efficiency of direct aid payment schemes in getting money into farmers pockets.

40|$|With {{the growth}} in social, {{political}} and economic importance of the Internet, it has been recognized that the underlying technology {{of the next generation}} Internet must not only meet the many technical challenges but must also meet the social expectations of such a pervasive technology. As evidence of the strategic importance of the development of the Internet, the European Union has adopted a <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Council</b> and the European Parliament focusing on the next generation Internet and the priorities for action in migrating to the new Internet protocol IPv 6 and also a new Directive (2002 / 58 /EC) on ’processing of personal data and protection of privacy in the electronic communication sector’. The Data Protection Directive is part of a package of proposals for initiatives which will form the future regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. The new Directive aims to adapt and update the existing Data Protection Telecommunications Directive (97 / 66 /EC) to take account of technological developments. However, it is not wel...|$|R
40|$|The European Securities Clearing and Settlement Industry is {{currently}} experiencing a vast movement of consolidation. This is {{encouraged by the}} European Commission, who seeks to establish a single market for the issuance and trade of financial securities across the European Union, and in parallel {{reduce the cost of}} cross-border transactions. Several forms of integration have been taking place in recent years. Horizontal integration for example has taken the form of mergers between different exchanges or between different Central Securities Depositories (CSDs). Vertical integration has on the other hand taken the form of mergers between an exchange and a CSD or alternatively integration of a CSD and a custodian bank, forming what is known as an (I) CSD (International Central Securities Depository). In a recent <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> the European <b>Council</b> and Parliament (Commission of the European Communities, 2004) the European Commission refuses to take any position about which form of consolidation is more likely to maximize social welfare. It goes as far as stating that "Market forces will determine the "final " structure of the Clearing and Settlement industry " (p. 11), implicitly taking for granted that the market outcome will coincide with the social optimum...|$|R
40|$|Deep-sea {{fish stocks}} consist {{of species that}} live at depths of greater than 400 metres. While being {{important}} for EU fisheries, this natural renewable resource is particularly vulnerable to over-fishing, as many deep sea species are slow-growing and commonly of low fecundity. Generally {{little is known about}} the biology of deep sea species, and there prevails a substantial lack of scientific data on deep-sea stocks. This constitutes a major impediment to management strategies underpinning sustainable and profitable deep sea fisheries. Europe’s deep-sea fisheries began in the 1970 ’s and were entirely unregulated. The fleet grew as rewards were high, but many species were rapidly depleted. It was only in 2003 that a management plan was brought into action. While some measures to better protect commercially exploited deep sea fish have been adopted, such as the limitation of fishing effort or total allowable catches, these have been insufficient to allow stocks to recover and there is a general consensus that most deep-water stocks remain below safe biological limits for exploitation. In a recent <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Council</b> and the European Parliament, the European Commission has emphasized the need to improve our knowledge on deep sea fish species to move away from the current prevailing unsustainable exploitation. Ideally, this would be the development of a robust and practical approach to estimate the abundance of deep sea species to support stock assessments and reduce the uncertainty about the state and rebuilding rates of commercially exploited deep sea stocks. The current rapid technology development and concurrent steep drop in costs of large-scale genotyping offers major opportunities for fisheries management. This report explores whether the concept of genetic close-kin abundance estimation, recently applied to establish biomass estimates of Southern Bluefin Tuna, can be applied to fisheries management of deep sea fish species.

40|$|A {{communication}} containing {{proposals for}} {{reform of the}} EU tobacco regime was forwarded by the European Commission <b>to</b> the EU <b>Council</b> and European Parliament on September 23 rd 2003. These proposals involve: the progressive decoupling of the existing tobacco premium from production over a three-year period; the phasing-out of the tobacco fund; {{the establishment of a}} special fund under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in tobacco-growing areas. By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current tobacco premium will have been converted into the single farm payment and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. A detailed assessment of the situation and options for reform in the EU tobacco sector {{can be found in a}} Commission staff working paper 'Extended Impact Assessment: Tobacco Regime. Full details of the Commission's proposals for reform of the tobacco regime, alongside a summary assessment of the current situation, can be found in the text of the Commission's <b>communication</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Council</b> and European Parliament on 'Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP: the tobacco, olive oil, cotton and sugar sectors'. It is envisaged that the reform process will 'bring better market orientation and income growth for producers, in addition to the positive impact on producer income development from the increased transfer efficiency of decoupled payments'. This is especially the case for small scale producers who will receive a larger part of their income through the single farm payments. The reform process will also lead to the cessation of production of less profitable varieties of tobacco and the conversion of land to other uses. By the end of the reform period it is anticipated that EU prices will be aligned with world market prices. Comment: The alignment of EU prices with world market prices which the reform process is intended to bring about is likely to reduce the income to ACP suppliers of tobacco to the EU market. These price effects will need to be carefully assessed in the light of the prices which ACP suppliers currently enjoy. A communication containing proposals for reform of the EU tobacco [...] ...|$|R
