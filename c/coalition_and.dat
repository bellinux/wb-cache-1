5|$|During the Second Macedonian War, Nabis {{had another}} {{possibility}} for expansion. Philip of Macedon offered him the polis of Argos {{in exchange for}} Sparta defecting from the Roman <b>coalition</b> <b>and</b> joining the Macedonian alliance. Nabis accepted and received control over Argos. However, when the war turned against Macedon, he rejoined the Roman <b>coalition</b> <b>and</b> sent 600 Cretan mercenaries to support the Roman army. Philip was later decisively defeated by the Romans {{at the battle of}} Cynoscephalae, but Sparta remained in control of Argos. After the war, the Roman army did not withdraw from Greece, but instead sent garrisons to various strategic locations across Greece to secure its interests.|$|E

5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the <b>coalition</b> <b>and</b> increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{tensions}} arose {{between the}} ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted {{a struggle for}} succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision {{was rejected by the}} Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF <b>coalition,</b> <b>and</b> Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over {{a large part of the}} Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election. This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.|$|E

This led to Angle defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, Angle defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively siding with The Angle Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, siding with The Angle Alliance as well.|$|E

40|$|East Tennessee State University (ETSU) {{was awarded}} a grant through an interagency {{agreement}} between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Appalachian Regional Commission to promote cancer control activities between state comprehensive cancer control (CCC) <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> local Appalachian communities. We invited representatives from CCC <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> Appalachian communities to a forum {{to develop a plan}} of action. The attendees recommended a minigrant model that uses a request for proposals (RFP) strategy to encourage CCC <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> Appalachian communities to collaboratively conduct forums and roundtables locally. They set criteria to guide the development of the RFPs and the agendas for the roundtables and forums that ensured new communication and collaboration between the CCC <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> the Appalachian communities. We established the roundtable agenda to focus on the presentation and discussion of state and local Appalachian community cancer risk, incidence, and death rates and introduction of state cancer plans. The forums had a more extensive agenda to present cancer data, describe state cancer plans, and describe successful cancer control programs in local Appalachian communities. This article describes the ETSU minigrant model that supports forums and roundtables and reports how this strategy improves cooperative partnerships between CCC <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> Appalachian communities in the local implementation of state cancer plans in Appalachia...|$|R
5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} <b>coalition,</b> <b>and</b> supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} <b>coalition,</b> <b>and</b> would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it was hard for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a <b>coalition</b> <b>and</b> members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E

40|$|Background: Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} force in human history is the formation of social <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> alliances (i. e., long-lasting <b>coalitions)</b> <b>and</b> their impact on individual power. Understanding the dynamics of alliance formation and its consequences for biological, social, and cultural evolution is a formidable theoretical challenge. In most great ape species, coalitions occur at individual and group levels and among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape societies remain essentially hierarchical, <b>and</b> <b>coalitions</b> rarely weaken social inequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to egalitarianism, <b>and</b> human <b>coalitions</b> <b>and</b> alliances occur not only among individuals and groups, but also among groups of groups. These observations suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of human coalitions can only be understood {{in the context of}} social networks and cognitive evolution. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|From the {{beginning}} the party leadership had split into pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese and moderate factions. Under Hồ {{the party had}} followed a policy of neutrality between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China {{in the aftermath of}} the Sino–Soviet split. This policy continued until reunification. In the aftermath of the war, a power struggle began between Lê Duẩn's pro-Soviet and its rival pro-Chinese factions. Former rivals Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ formed a <b>coalition</b> <b>and</b> purged the pro-Chinese faction. Their first victims were Hoàng Văn Hoan and Chu Văn Tấn. While the Politburo made decisions through consensus, Lê Duẩn, through his post as General Secretary, was the most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with Lê Đức Thọ, Trần Quốc Hoàn and Võ Nguyên Giáp. Together with Lê Đức Thọ, Lê Duẩn controlled personnel appointments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Political Directorate of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the General Logistics Department of the VPA and the Ministry of Transport.|$|E
