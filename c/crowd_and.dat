5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBoth <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> {{binocular}} rivalry impair object perception, but {{their influence on}} object perception has so far only been investigated in separate fields. Three experiments investigated the joint influences of <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry on object perception (orientation discrimination). Experiment 1 investigated how <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry influence orientation discrimination together. Experiment 2 tested whether rivalry between flankers affects crowding using an orientation discrimination task. Experiment 3 tested whether crowding affects the temporal dynamics of the rivalry between a target and a rival stimulus. In Experiment 1, judgments of target orientation were more impaired when <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry were simultaneously induced than when they were separately induced and their effects were combined. In Experiment 2, judgments of target orientation were impaired even when flankers were undergoing rivalry, thus highlighting {{the importance of the}} presence of flankers. Experiment 3 showed that flankers presented in the neighborhood of a target undergoing rivalry shortened target dominance and prolonged target suppression. The augmented impairments of object perception found in Experiments 1 and 3 suggest that <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry interact, presumably through signal suppression. The adverse effect of flankers shown in Experiment 2 suggests that inappropriate feature integration may have additionally contributed to this interaction...|$|R
