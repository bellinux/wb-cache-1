40|$|Early-onset <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> are {{relatively}} rare. About 20 % of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> are familial or hereditary. Two autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndromes are more studied: Lynch syndrome accounts for 2 - 5 % of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> and {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} represents 1 % of total <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers.</b> Unlike the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, there are no clinical features that help in easily recognizing Lynch syndrome. The young age of cancer occurrence could be a criterion that should raise a suspicion of Lynch syndrome. In Morocco, the average age at diagnosis of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> according to the register of cancers of Casablanca is 56 years, which is 10 years earlier than in European countries. Our study aimed to assess the frequency and molecular characteristics of the Lynch syndrome in Moroccan early-onset <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 13 % of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> display {{microsatellite}} instability (MSI), {{a form of}} replication error repair. <b>Colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> developing in individuals with constitutional defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes hMLH 1, hMSH 2, hPMS 1 and hPMS 2 consistently show evidence of this phenomenon. Since MSI is indicative of MMR deficiency, testing <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> for MSI provides a method of refining the identification of carriers of germline MMR mutations. To assess which microsatellites represent the best reporters of replication error (RER) status we have examined 116 early onset <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> for MSI. MSI was assessed using eight dinucleotide- and two mononucleotide-repeat fluorescently labelled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. The two mononucleotide repeat markers (BAT 25 and BAT 26) were highly sensitive and typing of either represents an efficient strategy for defining RER status of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> and obviates the requirement of typing numerous microsatellite markers...|$|R

5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancer.</b> A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancer,</b> though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancer.</b> For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

40|$|The Surgical Endoscopy Service {{has been}} aggressively {{evaluating}} gastrointestinal symptoms with colonoscopy and screening asymptomatic patients with flexible sigmoidoscopy {{in hopes of}} finding early curable <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the stages of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> resected during the 18 -month period prior to (Pre-SES) and during the first 18 months (Post-SES) after the creation of the Surgical Endoscopy Service. In addition, the yield of lesions that would have been obtained by depending upon patient symptoms or occult blood testing were determined. A total of 361 colonoscopies were performed Pre-SES and 874 colonoscopies Post-SES; 26 patients underwent resection of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> Pre-SES and 32 Post-SES. Whereas early <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> (Dukes' A and B 1) were found in only three patients (12 %) Pre-SES period, early cancers were found in 13 (41 %) Post-SES. Doubling the number of colonoscopies produced a fourfold increase in the number of early lesions. Furthermore, disseminated cancers (D lesions) dropped from 19 % Pre-SES to 3 % Post-SES. Among the total 58 patients, 43 % of the A lesions and 40 % of the B 1 lesions were asymptomatic. Even more alarming, 86 % of the A lesions, 50 % of the B 1 lesions, 31 % of the B 2 lesions, and 14 % of the C 2 lesions were occult blood negative. Indeed, only the D lesions were uniformly occult blood positive. This study demonstrates that aggressive colonoscopy detects early <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers.</b> Moreover, patient symptoms or occult blood testing will fail to indicate the majority of early <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Though most <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> show allelic losses, {{a subset}} of <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> (microsatellite {{instability}} or MSI-positive cancers) develop numerous small insertion and deletion mutations in repetitive DNA. Some of these sequences occur in coding regions of cancer related genes which, when targeted by frameshift mutations, produce truncations in their protein product, Such a gene is the proapoptotic tumor suppressor, BAX, mutated by frameshifts within a polyG sequence in approximately 50 % of MSI-positive <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers.</b> BAX is directly transactivated by p 53, a gene commonly mutated in <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> but not often in MSI-positive lesions. Here we sought to characterize the relationship between BAX and p 53 by simultaneously analysing a selected series of 65 colorectal tumors for mutations in the entire coding regions of both genes. The tumors comprised 19 MSI-high, 12 MSI-low and 34 MSI-null cancers. Eight of 19 MSI-high sporadic <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> (42 %) contained insertions and deletions at the polyG tract in the BAX gene. In addition, three somatic BAX missense mutations mere identified in two tumors. A single missense mutation was detected in an MSI-high tumor that also contained a frameshift microdeletion, and two missense mutations were identified in an MSI-null tumor wild-type for p 53. p 53 mutations were detected in 5 / 12 MSI-low tumors (42 %) and 12 / 34 MSI-null tumors (35 %). Of significance, no p 53 mutations were detected in MSI-high tumors. This study demonstrates that a reciprocal relationship exists between p 53 and BAX in sporadic <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers,</b> and further supports the hypothesis that MSI-low tumors are biologically similar to MSI-null tumors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether low-level {{microsatellite instability}} (MSI-L) {{is a phenomenon}} specific to <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers</b> or is also present in other tumour types. Breast (grade III ductal and lobular), endometrial and ovarian carcinomas, as well as <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers,</b> were analysed for MSI-L using eight microsatellite markers. The markers were selected from a panel {{that had previously been}} shown to be sensitive for the detection of MSI-L in <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers.</b> It was found that MSI-L was present in 30 of 87 (35 %) <b>colorectal</b> <b>cancers,</b> 2 of 59 (3 %) grade III breast carcinomas, 1 of 35 (3 %) lobular breast cancers, 16 of 50 (32 %) endometrial cancers, and 9 of 34 (26 %) ovarian cancers. These results suggest that MSI-L is a very rare occurrence in breast carcinomas, but does occur as a real phenomenon in colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian carcinomas, which {{are all part of the}} hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. PCR artefact was also found to masquerade as MSI-L; criteria for the assessment of MSI-L are suggested to eliminate this problem...|$|R

40|$|Epithelial {{cells of}} the {{intestinal}} mucosa undergo a continual process of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis which is regulated by multiple signaling pathways.

Moreover, KLF 4 inhibits the axis formation of Xenopus embryos and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice.
