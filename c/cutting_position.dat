50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their <b>cutting</b> <b>position.</b> This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{clippers}} can be utilized {{to achieve a}} regular haircut: taper clippers, rotary clippers and outliner/edger clippers. Taper clippers are powered by a linear or pivot motor. The blades are not readily interchangeable. The taper lever allows adjustment of the cutting length within a certain range, usually from #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm) on the fine side to #1 length, 3/32" [...] (2.4 mm) on the coarse side. For longer lengths, clipper guards are attached. The guard will cut at the numbered guard length when the taper lever is in the shortest <b>cutting</b> <b>position.</b> Clipper guards are also known as clipper guide combs. Fade clippers are identical to taper clippers {{with the exception of}} the range of cutting lengths which is entirely within the fine blade range. Most fade clippers cut between #00000 blade length, 1/125" [...] (0.2 mm) and #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm). As with regular taper clippers, clipper guards can be attached for longer cutting lengths.|$|E

Each FRG has 10 member farmers. The experiment consisted of three levels of part used (top, middle and bottom) and four levels of node numbers (three, five, seven and nine) in factorial combination. The nursery experiments were laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. The experiment was started on August 2011 and completed on October, 2011. Data on survival count, survival percentage, number of branches/seedlings, number of leaves/branches and number of leaves/seedlings were recorded for all the treatments considered in a participatory approach.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to study the effect of <b>cutting</b> <b>position,</b> rooting medium and hormone on the rooting of bush tea stem cuttings. The experiment was carried out in four consecutive seasons from 2002 to 2003 at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. The parameters recorded were <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> (apical vs. basal), rooting medium (composted pine bark vs. sand), rooting hormone (with Seradix® No. 2 vs. no hormone), sampling days (15, 20, 25 and 30 days) and season (summer, autumn, winter and spring). <b>Cutting</b> <b>position</b> had a highly significant effect (P< 0. 001) on rooting and transplanting survival of bush tea with better rooting percentage, root length, root number and survival percentage from apical than from basal cuttings. Composted pine bark improved the number of roots developed but had no effect on rooting percentage, survival percentage nor on root length of the cuttings. The application of rooting hormone (Seradix® No. 2) during the propagation period increased root number and further increased shoot length after transplanting but not rooting percentage, survival percentage or root length. Season also showed highly significant differences (P< 0. 001) on rooting percentage, root number and root length. Rooting of cuttings was improved when propagated in autumn (longer roots) and spring (number of roots) but not in summer or winter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that vegetative propagation of bush tea could be achieved by apical cuttings propagated in composted pine bark with Seradix® No. 2 hormone in spring for 30 days since root number was the most important factor for the successful establishment of the cuttings.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agronomy) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Honeybush (Cyclopia spp. Fabaceae) is {{indigenous}} to the fynbos botanical biome of the Eastern and Western Cape of South Africa. The {{increase in the}} international demand for honeybush tea for health benefits, concern over exploitation of wild populations {{and the lack of}} published agronomic information necessitated this study to evaluate different aspects of honeybush propagation. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of species and <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> on rooting of cuttings of Cyclopia species using different rooting hormones, to evaluate the effect of an organic plant fertilizer and <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> on growth and establishment of rooted cuttings and to study the influence of different seed pre-treatments on germination of Cyclopia species. Terminal and sub-terminal cuttings of C. intermedia and C. genistoides treated with different rooting hormones were rooted under day/night temperature controlled glasshouse conditions. Intermittent mist was used as means of moisture supply to the cuttings for 45 - 60 seconds daily every 30 minutes. C. genistoides rooted significantly better compared to C. intermedia as measured by rooting percentage, number of roots per cutting, length of longest root and mean root length during the summer season. The <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> had a significant effect on rooting of the cuttings in summer compared to winter and spring season. The interactive effect of species, treatment and <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> resulted into 86 % of rooting in summer from the terminal cuttings of C. genistoides, while only 4 % was recorded as the highest rooting percentage in both winter and spring seasons. The highest number of roots and the greatest root length per cutting were obtained with 2 and 4 g L- 1 IBA from terminal cuttings of C. genistoides and these hormone concentrations were not significantly different to each other. To evaluate the effect of an organic plant fertilizer and <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> on plant growth and establishment, rooted cuttings of two Cyclopia species (C. intermedia and C. genistoides) from two cutting positions (terminal and sub-terminal) were transferred to pots (576 cm 3) and treated with Nitrosol fertilizer at application rates of 3. 33 ml. L- 1, 1. 67 ml. L- 1 and 0 ml. L- 1 (control). Cyclopia plantlets were uniformly inoculated once with a symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria to improve the formation of nodules. Nitrosol® at 3. 33 ml. L- 1 significantly affected fresh and dry plant weight, fresh and dry root weight, number of shoots and nodules per plant compared to either 1. 67 ml. L- 1 or the control. Relative to species, C. genistoides performed better in terms of fresh and dry plant weight, fresh and dry root weight, and number of shoots and nodules per plant compared to C. intermedia. The origin of the <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> did not significantly affect the above mentioned parameters. Plant mineral analysis revealed that most of the essential elements increased with increasing Nitrosol® application rates, with C. genistoides having higher levels of mineral elements than C. intermedia. This could be an indication {{of the differences between the}} two species in terms of nutrient uptake, utilization and distribution within the plant tissues. In the germination studies, seeds obtained from different seed sources of Cyclopia species were subjected to different pre-sowing treatments. Seed treatments were sulphuric acid (95 %), hot water (100 °C), water with smoke paper disk, and demineralised water (control). The study revealed that all the treatments had a significant effect on germination with the exception of eight year old seeds obtained from C. subternata (seed source two). Although hot water treatment improved germination compared to smoked paper disk and the control, seeds treated with hot water degenerated rapidly. The highest overall germination (77. 33 %) was found with one year old seeds compared to other seed sources older than one year. Although smoked paper disks generally did not improve germination compared to the control, in one year old seeds from seed source one, this treatment greatly influenced germination, suggesting that seed age might have influenced germination of these seeds. In terms of germination rate, germination generally started after four days in most treatments...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{efforts are}} made to {{automate}} vineyard operations to cap the ever increasing labour cost. However, one of the operations {{that have not been}} completely automated is grapevine pruning. A robotic machine for grapevine pruning needs to respond to the changing physical characteristics of the environment, and to date, no algorithm can accurately identified appropriate positions for grapevine pruning in a variety of environmental conditions. The aim of this research was therefore to develop a new algorithm using image processing, image analysis and stereo vision system to determine pruning positions and making automatic grapevine pruning possible. In order to get the pruning positions accurately and automatically, images taken from two cameras are processed and analysed. Utilizing the latest computer vision techniques, the algorithm takes three steps before the final <b>cutting</b> <b>positions</b> are derived. First, the uploaded images are pre-processed by the so called image processing phase during which binary image is obtained from the original image. Second, image analysis technique is employed to identify different parts of grape vine and obtain the 2 D <b>positions</b> of the <b>cutting</b> points. Novel algorithms are proposed to locate the cordon, the branch and finally the nodes step by step with high accuracy. Both the locating precision and computing complexity of the algorithms are considered, so that the images could be processed incessantly. Finally, cameral calibration and stereo vision were also performed after that to determine the 3 D pruning point, so the system can inform the robotic machine to perform the pruning. For the experiments, images were taken from the vineyard which located in the Adelaide National Wine Centre and the University of Adelaide Waite Campus. Ten images full of canes were analysed, and an 85 % success rate for pruning positions was achieved. 85 % of the <b>cutting</b> <b>positions</b> found by the proposed method were consistent with those found by experts, while the rest 15 % of the <b>cutting</b> <b>positions</b> found by the proposed method would not affect the growth of the grapevine significantly in the next year although they don‘t match the positions found by experts perfectly. The experiment verified the accuracy and application potential of proposed algorithm. The contribution of this research has three folds: a) The latest research and application of automatic grapevine pruning is reviewed; b) A novel automatic grapevine pruning algorithm using computer vision technique to automatically identify important grapevine features, locate the pruning points, and derive their three dimensional coordinates is proposed, researched and developed; c) The proposed algorithm can be also applicable to other agricultural operation automation other than grapevine pruning.

40|$|Machining long slender {{workpieces}} still {{presents a}} technical challenge {{on the shop floor}} {{due to their}} low stiffness and damping. Regenerative chatter is a major hindrance in machining processes, reducing the geometric accuracies and dynamic stability of the cutting system. This study has been motivated by the fact that chatter occurrence is generally in relation to the <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> in straight turning of slender workpieces, which has seldom been investigated comprehensively in literature. In the present paper, a predictive chatter model of turning a tailstock supported slender workpiece considering the <b>cutting</b> <b>position</b> change during machining is explored. Based on linear stability analysis and stiffness distribution at different cutting positions along the workpiece, the effect of the cutting tool movement {{along the length of the}} workpiece on chatter stability is studied. As a result, an entire stability chart for a single cutting pass is constructed. Through this stability chart the critical cutting condition and the chatter onset location along the workpiece in a turning operation can be estimated. The difference between the predicted tool locations and the experimental results was within 9 % at high speed cutting. Also, on the basis of the predictive model the dynamic behavior during chatter that when chatter arises at some cutting location it will continue for a period of time until another specified location is arrived at, can be inferred. The experimental observation is in good agreement with the theoretical inference. In chatter detection respect, besides the delay strategy and overlap processing technique, a relative threshold algorithm is proposed to detect chatter by comparing the spectrum and variance of the acquired acceleration signals with the reference saved during stable cutting. The chatter monitoring method has shown reliability for various machining conditions...|$|E
