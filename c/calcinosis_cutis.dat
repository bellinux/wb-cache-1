5000|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> (or {{cutaneous}} calcification) {{is a type}} of calcinosis wherein {{calcium deposits}} form in the skin. A variety of factors can result in this condition. The most common source is dystrophic calcification, which occurs in soft tissue as a response to injury. In addition, calcinosis is seen in Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome (the [...] "C" [...] in CREST). In dogs, <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is found in young, large breed dogs and is thought to occur after a traumatic injury.|$|E
50|$|Metastatic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} calcification {{of the skin}} resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus, and associated with an internal malignancy.|$|E
50|$|Dystrophic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} calcification {{of the skin}} resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus, and occurs in a preexisting skin lesion of inflammatory process.|$|E
50|$|Iatrogenic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} calcification {{of the skin}} resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus introduced by a medical procedure, either inadvertently or as a specific therapy.|$|E

50|$|Reynolds {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} secondary laminopathy, consisting of the combination of primary biliary cirrhosis and progressive systemic sclerosis. In some patients this syndrome has also been associated with Sjögren's syndrome and hemolytic anemia. Typical clinical features include jaundice, elevated blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis,</b> telangiectasias, and pruritus. This disease may cause white or yellow-ish spots on the arms or legs. The syndrome, a special case of scleroderma, is named after the American physician, Telfer B. Reynolds, MD (1921-2004), who first described it. He is also known for creating one of the world's first hepatology programs at the University of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|Several {{systemic}} syndromes {{have also}} been associated with syringoma including diabetes mellitus, down syndrome, Brooke-Spiegler, and Nicolau-Balus. Specifically, diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with clear cell syringoma consisting of nests of clear cells containing glycogen. It is thought that phosphorylase deficiency, resulting from elevated glucose levels seen in diabetes leads to an accumulation of glycogen in the skin and within the clear cells. The incidence of syringomas {{has been reported in}} up to 40 percent of people with Down syndrome and can be associated with a condition <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> which requires prompt medical attention. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome with cutaneous manifestations including syringomas and trichoepitheliomas. Nicolau-Balus is a rare autosomal dominant disorder consisting of atrophoderma vermiculata and syringomas.|$|E
50|$|Fiddler’s neck usually {{involves}} highly localized lichenification, mild hyperpigmentation, and erythema where the chin rest or instrument body presses against {{the skin of}} the neck. Other signs and symptoms include scale buildup, cyst and scar formation, papules and pustules related to local infection, and focal edema. In Blum & Ritter’s study in West Germany (1990), they found that 27% of their population had only minor issues, 72% had a palpable mass at the site, and 23% reported pain and other signs of inflammation such as hyperthermia, pulsation, and cystic, pustular, or papular lesions. Size of masses were an average of 2 cm in diameter ranging up to 4 cm, some being associated with purulent drainage, continuous discharge, and crusting. Dystrophic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> has also been reported. Other serious sequelae include sialolithiasis of the submandibular gland and adenolymphoma of the parotid gland.|$|E

40|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disorder {{caused by an}} abnormal deposit of calcium phosphate in the skin {{in various parts of}} the body. Four main types of <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> have been recognized according to etiology: associated with localized or widespread tissue changes or damage (dystrophic calcification), that associated with an abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism (metastatic calcification), not associated with any tissue damage or demonstrable metabolic disorder (idiopathic calcification), and Iatrogenic. Very few cases of idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> are reported in early childhood in the literature. We report one such case of idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> over elbow in a 12 -year-old female child. Histological examinations of the lesions resected in this case reveal calcium deposits in the dermis, surrounded by foreign body giant cells. Idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is a rare phenomenon and occurs in the absence of known tissue injury or systemic metabolic defect.

40|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the skin. Based on {{the etiology of}} the deposition <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> may be devided into four major groups namely metastatic, dystrophic, idiopathic, and iatrogenic. The pathophysiology of <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> remains unclear. The dystrophic form {{is the most common}} whereas the idiopathic one is the rarest. Idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> occurs {{in the absence of any}} identifiable causes and is not associated with drug use. Idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> has two major types called localized (circumscript) and generalized (universalis). Localized type generally involves the vulva, scrotum, penis and breast. A definitive diagnosis requires the histologic demonstration of the accumulation of calcium in the skin and exclusion of other clinic types. There is not an effective treatment for the disease. A 47 -year-old woman referred to our outpatient clinic for painless, yellowish-white nodules on her hand enduring for 30 years. A diagnosis of idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> was made by clinical and histological findings.

This is a case report of an adult female presenting with Idiopathic <b>Calcinosis</b> <b>Cutis</b> over the back. The exact mechanism of occurrence of this condition is not known.

40|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> {{involves}} the inappropriate deposition of calcium within the dermis {{layer of the}} skin, and {{is often associated with}} rheumatoid disease. A 42 -year-old woman presented for evaluation of a hard palpable mass on the left upper eyelid. After everting the eyelid, a large papillomatous mass with a broad base was identified on the superior area of the tarsus. The lesion was partially excised posteriorly under local anesthesia, and pathologists identified the mass as <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis.</b> The patient had no systemic or trauma history, and the serum levels of calcium and phosphorous were normal. Idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis for a protruding papillomatous mass of the tarsal plate, and surgical debulking could be a viable option for large protruding lesions, although more follow-up is necessary to monitor regrowth.

40|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disorder {{characterized by the}} progressive deposition of crystals of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) in the skin in various areas of the body. It is classified into four types according to etiology, namely as dystrophic if calcium and phosphorus levels are normal and tissue damage is present, as idiopathic if calcium and phosphorus levels are normal and no tissue damage is present, or as metastatic if there is hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Medical and surgical treatments are options to cure <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis.</b> Medical therapy is not very effective. Surgical excision has shown to be beneficial, {{as it can provide}} a symptomatic relief. However, since <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> limits are not always well defined, a recurrence of the lesions may occur. We dealt with a very rare form of <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> in a healthy 6 -year-old girl. There was no evidence of connective tissue disorder or abnormal mineral metabolism. Hence, she was diagnosed as idiopathic <b>calcinosis</b> <b>cutis</b> and, although calcifications in idiopathic cutis are most commonly localized to one area, our patient unusually exhibited widespread calcific deposits. Although the existing lesions showed slow improvement, systemic pamidronate therapy was effective in preventing the occurrence of new lesions. Surgical excision proved to be an effective and successful treatment.
