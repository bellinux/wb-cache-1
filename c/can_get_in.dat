Gutzman {{argue that}} when {{politicians}} {{come to power}} they exercise all the power they <b>can</b> <b>get,</b> <b>in</b> the process trampling states' rights. Gutzman argues that the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798 by Jefferson and Madison were not only responses to immediate threats but were legitimate responses based on the long-standing principles of states' rights and strict adherence to the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Positions with doubled pawns {{are usually}} a draw if the {{defending}} king <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> {{front of the}} pawns. If the defending king cannot {{get in front of}} the pawns, the outcome depends on which file the pawns are on and where the defending king is cut off. If the defending king is cut off by more than one file, the pawns win, except if they are rook pawns. If the pawns are on the c through f file then they win if the opposing king is cut off by one file (or more) on the long side, otherwise they draw.|$|E

25|$|Accidents {{and lasting}} damage can {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often {{if he or she}} is all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in,</b> but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.|$|E
25|$|Hand mating is {{the most}} {{efficient}} method, but requires the most work {{on the part of}} the human involved. A male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored. They are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating. Usually, one <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once. The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama's reproductive tract more sound. If the mating is not successful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.|$|E

[...] The SMC was seen as a safe place for the opposition protesters to go.

Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> an anxious state– I like it when Dot's hysterical!

500|$|Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) {{occurs in}} horses ranging {{from birth to}} 1 year of age and {{is more common in}} fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, {{possibly}} polygenic in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve [...] air <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in,</b> but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives.|$|E

500|$|In a July 2009 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Cornell shot down {{rumors of a}} reunion, saying that conversations between the band members had been limited to discussion about {{the release of a}} box set or B-sides album of Soundgarden rarities, and that there had been no discussion of a reunion at all. The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out". On March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs. Cornell stated that the moment [...] "sort of sparked the idea: If Matt, Kim, and Ben <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> a room, rehearse a couple songs, and play, maybe we all could do that as Soundgarden." ...|$|E

He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} absent from Nintendo's Wii showing at its 2006 pre-E3 press conference. Nintendo officially {{revealed}} the game {{under the name}} of Super Smash Bros. Brawl the next day, May 10, 2006, along with the game's first official trailer during the E3 After-Hours Press Conference. In an interview with IGN, Sakurai said the Wii's motion sensing features might not be included because [...] " [...] found that trying to implement too much motion-sensory functionality <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the way of the game". As far as Wi-Fi play is concerned, Sakurai stated his plan was to include Wi-Fi connection compatibility from the start. He goes on to say, [...] "One of the primary reasons Super Smash Bros. Brawl was created was that Nintendo, when taking Wii online, wanted to have Smash Bros. to do that." [...] However, Sakurai stated on the Japanese version of the Smash Bros. website that there were [...] "hurdles of all sorts that [...] it very difficult" [...] to implement online battles. Furthermore, he said that an online ranking system is unlikely to be implemented. During a test play between Sakurai and Hideo Kojima, Kojima stated that the game felt complete and that Nintendo [...] "could put it out now and it would sell millions of copies". Starting May 22, 2007 and ending April 14, 2008, the site had daily weekday updates.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> {{when you are in}} love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing her eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical response {{ranging from}} extremely positive to extremely negative. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five, summarising {{it as an}} [...] "energetic romp that oozed with body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud" [...] which also [...] "infused a type of family melodrama commonly seen on soaps". He praised the [...] "stunningly bonkers" [...] plot noting that [...] "every potential dramatic and comedic moment that stemmed from Gwen's unconventional 'bun in the oven' scenario was fully maximised". He felt that in the central role [...] "Eve Myles delivered an outstanding performance as Gwen" [...] and also singled out the guest actors for praise, particularly Nerys Hughes. In an end of series review he listed [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] as his favourite episode of Torchwoods second series. Writing for The Stage, Mark Wright wrote that [...] "it’s good to see Torchwood <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with its lighter side and not lose any momentum" [...] concluding [...] "I think I really might love this show". Jon Beresford of TV Scoop felt the episode {{to be one of}} the strongest of the second series. Whilst he felt it to be [...] "corny" [...] in places he summarised the episode as an [...] "exciting yarn with some really good performances from the team". He felt that Myles and Owen [...] "stole the show" [...] as Gwen and Rhys believing that [...] "there's a definite spark between these two that sets their moments apart." ...|$|E
