The day was [...] fair, {{the sky was}} blue, {{and everything}} was peaceful too, [...] when suddenly a well-dressed gent engaged in heated [...] argument and roundly to abuse began another well-dressed [...] gentleman. His suede-gloved fist he raised on high to dot [...] {{the other in the}} eye. Who knows what horrors might have [...] been, had there not come upon the scene old London city's [...] favourite son, Policeman C. 231. 'What means this conduct? [...] Prithee stop!' exclaimed that admirable slop. With which he [...] placed a warning hand upon the brawler's <b>collarband.</b> We [...] simply hate to tell the rest. No subject here for flippant [...] jest. The mere remembrance of the tale has made our ink [...] turn deadly pale. Let us be brief. Some demon sent stark [...] madness on the well-dressed gent. He gave the constable a [...] punch just where the latter kept his lunch. The constable [...] said 'Well! Well! Well!' and marched him to a dungeon cell. [...] At Vine Street Station out it came--Lord Belpher was the [...] culprit's name. But British Justice is severe alike on [...] pauper and on peer; with even hand she holds the scale; a [...] thumping fine, in lieu of gaol, induced Lord B. to feel [...] remorse and learn he mustn't punch the Force." ...|$|E
