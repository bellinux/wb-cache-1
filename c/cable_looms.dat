50|$|Cable lacing is {{a method}} for tying wiring {{harnesses}} and <b>cable</b> <b>looms,</b> traditionally used in telecommunication, naval, and aerospace applications. This old cable management technique, taught to generations of linemen, is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions {{along the length of}} the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or velcro cable ties.|$|E
40|$|DE 1004010176 A UPAB: 20051027 NOVELTY - Electrical <b>cable</b> <b>looms</b> may be {{constructed}} by laying the cables (5) temporarily {{on the surface}} of a drum (1) that is mounted on a frame (3). The cables are secured by temporary means and a manual operator can index the drum using a foot pedal. An alternative system has two drums with a laying surface inbetween. USE - Manufacture of electrical <b>cable</b> <b>looms.</b> ADVANTAGE - Reduces the amount of space needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the application of}} bounding volume hierarchies in collision detection among densely packed fiber assemblies like hair strands or <b>cable</b> <b>looms.</b> In particular, we glance at collision detection algorithms with sub-quadratic upper bound and their practicability and performance in complex dynamic hair scenes. Unlike common collision detection techniques our approach exploits the topological structure of the underlying filament assembly and allows for fast hierarchy updates in dynamic deformable scenes. Furthermore, we compare hierarchies of the wrapped and the layered type and show the feasibility of fiber based collision detection on full human hair models. We simulate each fiber of an assembly by means of Cosserat rod models. Keywords—collision detection, fiber assemblies, hair modeling, wrapped / layered hierarchies, COSSERAT rods...|$|E
