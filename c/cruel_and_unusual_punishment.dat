5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>punishment.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{objections}} to originalism is that it cannot cope with cultural change. One {{of the most}} commonly invoked examples of this claimed weakness is the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause, whose original meaning would (it is argued) authorize barbaric punishment practices like flogging and branding, and disproportionate punishments like the death penalty for relatively minor offenses. This Article shows that this objection to originalism is inapt, at least with respect to the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>punishments</b> Clause. As I have shown in prior articles, the original meaning of “cruel and unusual” is “cruel and contrary to long usage,” or “cruel and new. ” The primary purpose of the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause is to prevent legislatures and courts from imposing new punishments that are unduly harsh in light of the long usage of the common law. This Article demonstrates that the Clause also incorporates the common law doctrine of desuetude, which holds that a once traditional punishment can become “unusual” if it falls out of usage long enough to show a stable multigenerational consensus against it. State courts and the Supreme Court of the United States employed this doctrine in decisions prior to 1958 to determine whether punishments such as ducking of a common scold, execution accompanied by torture, and imprisonment at hard labor for a minor offense were <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual.</b> Under the original meaning of the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause, the death penalty could become unconstitutional if it fell out of usage long enough to show a stable, multigenerational consensus against it. This process already occurred with respect to flogging, branding, and execution for relatively minor crimes like theft, and under the constitutions of states that abolished the death penalty several generations ago...|$|R

50|$|The Excessive Fines Clause <b>and</b> the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{prohibit}} certain disproportionate sentences.

The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits increasing the maximum authorized sentence for an offense based on a fact not found by a jury. Mandatory minimums based on judicial fact-finding are not prohibited. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense. The test of Blockburger v.

40|$|Although {{a century}} {{has passed since}} the Supreme Court started {{reviewing}} criminal punishments for excessiveness under the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause, this area of doctrine remains highly problematic. The Court has never answered the claim that proportionality review is illegitimate {{in light of the}} Eighth Amendment’s original meaning. The Court has also adopted an ever-shifting definition of excessiveness, making the very concept of proportionality incoherent. Finally, the Court’s method of measuring proportionality is unreliable and self contradictory. As a result, a controlling plurality of the Court has insisted that proportionality review be limited to a narrow class of cases. This area of doctrine needs rethinking. This Article is the first to establish that the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause was originally meant to prohibit excessive punishments as well as barbaric ones, and that proportionality review is therefore unquestionably legitimate. This Article also demonstrates that proportionality is a retributive concept, not a utilitarian one. Punishments are unconstitutionally excessive if they are harsher than the defendant deserves as a retributive matter. Finally, this Article shows that proportionality should be measured primarily in relation to prior punishment practice. The proposed approach will align the Court’s proportionality jurisprudence more closely with the core purpose of the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause <b>and</b> will enable the Court to expand proportionality review to a much larger class of cases...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{describes}} the anomaly of executions {{in the context}} of the U. S. Supreme Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. While the Supreme Court routinely reads the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause to protect prisoners from harm, the Court simultaneously interprets the Eighth Amendment to allow inmates to be executed. Corporal punishments short of death have long been abandoned in America’s penal system, yet executions — at least in a few locales, heavily concentrated in the South — persist. This Article, which seeks a principled and much more consistent interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, argues that executions should be declared unconstitutional as 2 ̆ 2 <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>punishments.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In so doing, the Article explores the history of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> 2 ̆ 2 catchphrase in English and American law and critiques the Supreme Court’s 2 ̆ 2 evolving standards of decency 2 ̆ 2 test. The Article also {{describes the}} abandonment of corporal punishments as penal sanctions and discusses existing Eighth Amendment jurisprudence on that topic. The Article explains how executions are <b>cruel</b> — <b>and</b> were thought to be so even by some of America’s founders — and have, over time, become unusual. The Article further highlights how the U. S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment fundamentally transformed the <b>Cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unusual</b> <b>Punishments</b> Clause calculus, making modern-day executions unusual in the extreme because of the arbitrary and discriminatory way in which they are carried out...|$|R
