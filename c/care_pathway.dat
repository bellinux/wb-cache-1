25|$|The Liverpool <b>Care</b> <b>Pathway</b> for the Dying Patient (LCP) was a UK <b>care</b> <b>pathway</b> (excluding Wales) {{covering}} {{palliative care}} options for {{patients in the}} final days or hours of life. It was developed to help doctors and nurses provide quality end-of-life care. Now discredited, the LCP was widely abused as a 'tick box exercise', with patients being casually assessed as terminal, heavily sedated, and denied water so the diagnosis became self-fulfilling. Hospitals were also provided cash incentives to achieve targets for the number of patients killed on the LCP.|$|E

40|$|<b>Care</b> <b>pathways</b> aim {{to promote}} evidence- and guideline-based care, improve the {{organisation}} {{and efficiency of}} care, and reduce cost. In the past decade, <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> have been increasingly implemented as a tool in acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation. In the most recent Cochrane systematic review, which included three randomised and 12 non-randomised studies, patient management with stroke <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> {{was found to have}} no significant benefit on functional outcome, and patient satisfaction and quality of life might actually be worse. On the other hand, it was associated with a higher proportion of patients receiving investigations and a lower risk of developing certain complications such as infections and readmissions. Overall, the evidence supports the use of <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> in acute stroke but not stroke rehabilitation. Future developments, including electronic <b>care</b> <b>pathways,</b> patient <b>pathways,</b> and pre-hospital <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> for hyperacute stroke, will be discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Dutch {{health care}} system is a large drain on the Dutch {{national}} budget. With the Dutch hospitals costing 20 billion euros yearly. Six billion euros, of the total 20 billion euros are spend on goods and materials. If a part of these goods are wasted within the {{health care system}}, the costs of this system could be reduced by reducing this waste. This report has researched the possible waste reduction possible in health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> by researching three health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> in Dutch hospitals. This report answers the research question: How can the possible wasted disposables be reduced in health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> in Dutch hospitals. This question is answered with the creation of a framework based on multiple case studies created from research done in the three health <b>care</b> <b>pathways,</b> Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, Cataract and Hip Fractures. These health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> are visualised using IDEF 0 diagrams, and the disposable flows are shown in matching tables. To provide constructive solutions to possible wasted disposables within health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> in Dutch hospital in general, a framework is constructed. This framework generalizes health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> to four basic steps, diagnostics, pre-operation, operation and post operation. The main solutions to reduce the chance of wasted disposables within health <b>care</b> <b>pathways,</b> is to improve the amount of standardisation of disposables used and needed, and improve the communication and collaboration between parties within the health <b>care</b> <b>pathways.</b> These solutions are based on the case studies and the literature research on the Dutch health care system in general, Dutch hospitals and the goods logistics within the Dutch health care system. This also provides an answer to the research question, on how to reduce disposables being wasted in health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> in Dutch hospitals. This thesis research is conducted on three <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> are researched in multiple hospitals, but not all Dutch hospitals. Different results could be reached when researching other health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> or different hospitals, but the framework provided in this report could be valid for these different situations. Both the validity of this research and the constructed framework has to be researched in subsequent research studies. These subsequent research studies have to verify if the conclusions derived in this research is valid for other health <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> and if the framework is applicable and if it has achieved its objective.

40|$|This is {{an updated}} version of a Cochrane review {{published}} in Issue 11, 2013 in the Cochrane Library. In many clinical areas, integrated <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> are utilised as structured multidisciplinary care plans that detail essential steps in caring for patients with specific clinical problems. In particular, <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> for the dying have been developed as a model to improve care of patients who are in the last days of life. The <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> were designed with an aim of ensuring that the most appropriate management occurs at the most appropriate time, and that it is provided by the most appropriate health professional. Since the last update, there have been sustained concerns about the safety of implementing end-of-life <b>care</b> <b>pathways,</b> particularly in the United Kingdom (UK). Therefore, there is a significant need for clinicians and policy makers to be informed about the effects of end-of-life <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> via a systematic review...|$|R
2500|$|Jonathan Potter, the {{director}} of the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians stated in 2009 that their audits showed that [...] "where the Liverpool <b>Care</b> <b>Pathway</b> for the dying patient (LCP) is used, people are receiving high quality clinical care in the last hours and days of life". The 2009 audit looked at end-of-life care in 155 hospitals, and examined the records of about 4,000 patients. A major criticism of this study was that each of the participating hospitals was only asked to submit datasets from 30 patients: arguably, the study was heavily biased by the ability to [...] "cherry-pick" [...] the most favourable datasets, and the lack of availability of all data for independent scrutiny and objective assessment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Making {{healthcare}} treatment decisions is {{a complex}} process involving a broad stakeholder base including patients, their families, health professionals, clinical practice guideline developers and funders of healthcare. Methods: This paper presents a review of a methodology {{for the development of}} urological cancer <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> (UCAN <b>care</b> <b>pathways),</b> which reflects an appreciation of this broad stakeholder base. The methods section includes an overview of the steps {{in the development of the}} UCAN <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> and engagement with clinical content experts and patient groups. Results: The development process is outlined, the uses of the urological cancer <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> discussed and the implications for clinical practice highlighted. The full set of UCAN <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> is published in this paper. These include <b>care</b> <b>pathways</b> on localised prostate cancer, locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, hormone-resistant prostate cancer, localised renal cell cancer, advanced renal cell cancer, testicular cancer, penile cancer, muscle invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Conclusion: The process provides a useful framework for improving urological cancer care through evidence synthesis, research prioritisation, stakeholder involvement and international collaboration. Although the focus of this work is urological cancers, the methodology can be applied to all aspects of urology and is transferable to other clinical specialties. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Good {{practice}} within healthcare is disseminated in {{a variety}} of forms. There are various levels of standards, from broad national guidance for whole areas to local <b>care</b> <b>pathways.</b> However, the recommended practices are rarely analysed, designed or disseminated using formal (or even semi-formal) process modelling techniques. By the end of 2008 all hospital treatment will need to have started within 18 weeks of referral. To achieve this, the health service will need to streamline and reorganise its processes. Process improvement is often seen as a companion to information systems development, which can be used to enable new ways of working and ease organisational change. However, the current NHS IT project is lacking strong standards for <b>care</b> <b>pathways.</b> We examine 5 examples of <b>care</b> <b>pathways.</b> We argue that the use of process modelling tools should be examined as a way of improving the effectiveness and understanding of <b>care</b> <b>pathways.</b> Such improvements may in turn enable hospitals to achieve the 18 weeks treatment target and result in much better clinical information systems...|$|R
