5000|$|Automatic <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> was {{introduced}} in 1998 by Lee Giles, Steve Lawrence and Kurt Bollacker [...] and enabled automatic algorithmic extraction and grouping of citations for any digital academic and scientific document. Where previous citation extraction was a manual process, citation measures could now scale up and be computed for any scholarly and scientific field and document venue, not just those selected by organizations such as ISI. This {{led to the creation}} of new systems for public and automated <b>citation</b> <b>indexing,</b> the first being CiteSeer (now CiteSeerX, soon followed by Cora, which focused primarily on the field of computer science and information science. These were later followed by large scale academic domain citation systems such as the Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic. Such autonomous <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> is not yet perfect in citation extraction or citation clustering with an error rate estimated by some at 10% though a careful statistical sampling has yet to be done. This has resulted in such authors as Ann Arbor, Milton Keynes, and Walton Hall being credited with extensive academic output. [...] SCI claims to create automatic <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> through purely programmatic methods. Even the older records have a similar magnitude of error.|$|E
50|$|Automated <b>{{citation}}</b> <b>indexing</b> {{has changed}} the nature of citation analysis research, allowing millions of citations to be analyzed for large scale patterns and knowledge discovery. The first example of automated <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> was CiteSeer, later to be followed by Google Scholar. More recently, advanced models for a dynamic analysis of citation aging have been proposed. The latter model is even used as a predictive tool for determining the citations that might be obtained at any time of the lifetime of a corpus of publications.|$|E

5000|$|The {{level of}} {{indexing}} depth is partly {{determined by the}} number of terms assigned to each document. In <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> this corresponds to the number of references in a given paper. On the average, scientific papers contain 10-15 references, which provide quite a high level of depth.|$|E

Today, automated <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> has changed the nature of citation analysis research, allowing millions of citations to be analyzed for large-scale patterns and knowledge discovery. Citation analysis tools can be used to compute various impact measures for scholars based on data from citation indices. These have various applications, from the identification of expert referees to review papers and grant proposals, to providing transparent data in support of academic merit review, tenure, and promotion decisions. This competition for limited resources may lead to ethical questionable behavior to increase citations.|$|E

These <b>citation</b> <b>indices</b> were used both for general and for legal study. The Talmudic <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> En Mishpat (1714) even included a symbol to indicate whether a Talmudic decision had been overridden, just as in the 19th-century Shepard's Citations.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> {{is one way}} of {{the many}} {{possibilities}} to measure “the quality ” of a researcher: count the citations to his work. The notion of <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> has many derived concepts, one of which is the h-index. In this note we consider one particular wish for a new definition of <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> of an author: when counting citations to the author’s work, weigh (= multiply) each citation by the <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> of the citing author. We show how the weighted <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> can be computed in the MapReduce framework. (1) Introduction. A <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> {{is one way of}} the many (sometimes contradictory and often unsatisfactory) possibilities to measure “the quality ” of a researcher: count the citations to his work [6]. The notion of <b>citation</b> <b>index</b> has many variants and derived concepts, one of which is the frequently used h-index.

5000|$|Currently, 15 {{databases}} {{are available}} in the online system, where the set of data contained in a database is delineated based on what organization owns the original collection being indexed. [...] Each database contains individual records that describe published books and articles, authors, ancient objects, images, etc. The descriptive records, or metadata, are connected in various ways, such as by connecting authors with their publications, and publications with their subject descriptors. In this way, it functions similar to many integrated library systems, or <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> services.|$|E
50|$|The BIS is {{the most}} widely used self-report measure of {{impulsive}} personality traits. As of June 2008, Web of Knowledge (an academic <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> and search service) tallied 457 journal citations of the 1995 article which defined the factor structure of the 11th version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Although initially developed in the United States, the BIS-11 has been applied widely around the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland,Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Citations are the formal, {{explicit}} {{linkages between}} papers that have particular points in common. A citation index {{is built around}} these linkages.

And every paper that is found provides a list of new citations with which to continue the search.The simplicity of <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> is one of its main strengths.|$|E
