Participants included an oncologist, five oncology nurses and an oncology social worker from a medical oncology unit, as well as 16 nursing staff members and a unit manager from two oncology hospital wards in Pretoria (South Africa). They all serve the same patients. Individual questionnaires, focus-group interviews and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Although the tasks of the participants concerned are mostly not information intensive and therefore seem not to require the use of CAS, there is <b>conditional</b> <b>interest</b> in CAS. This <b>conditional</b> <b>interest</b> is a result of factors such as working conditions (e. g. working hours, demands of the job), a lack of access to information resources, a lack of computer skills and experience in using the WWW, a lack of motivation to use CAS, the expectations of and limited support from management, and the impact of specific tasks and responsibilities on the need for, and interest in, CAS.

40|$|Background. There are few health {{promotion}} tools for urban Inuit, {{and there is}} a specific dearth of evaluations on such tools. Objective. The current study used a community-specific approach in the evaluation of a {{health promotion}} tool, based on an urban Inuit community&#x 0027;s preferences of health knowledge sources and distribution strategies. In partnership with the Tungasuvvingat Inuit Family Health Team in Ottawa, a CD-Rom was developed featuring an Inuk Elder presenting prenatal health messages in both Inuktitut and English. Also, relevant evaluation materials were developed. Design. Using a mixed methods approach, 40 participants completed interviews prior to viewing the CD-Rom and participated in a focus group at follow-up. Questionnaires were also completed pre- and post-viewing to assess changes between expectations and reactions in order to document acceptability. Results. Significant increases were found on satisfaction, acceptability of medium and relevance of content ratings. Qualitative findings also included (a) interest, uncertainty and <b>conditional</b> <b>interest</b> prior to viewing; and (b) positive evaluations of the CD-Rom. Conclusions. This suggests that CD-Rom technology has the potential for health promotion for urban Inuit, and the community-specific evaluation approach yielded useful information...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} examining urban Inuit health, despite significant health disparities and indications that Inuit perspectives on health differ from mainstream perspectives. This collection of studies examined family health and parenting in an urban Inuit community and employed a participatory action research approach {{in partnership with the}} Tungasuvvingat Inuit Family Resource Centre. The first study examined health information processes through key informant interviews and focus groups. Five themes emerged: importance of visual learning, community Elders, and cultural interpreters; community cohesion; and an Inuit and non-Inuit distinction. The core sources of health information were family members and sources from within the Inuit community. The principal dissemination strategy for health information was one-on-one communication. Overall, results showed a community-specific perspective on health information. The second study developed and evaluated a health promotion tool tailored to the community's preferences articulated in Study 1. A CD-Rom presented an Inuk Elder delivering two messages on supporting mothers during pregnancy. Quantitative and qualitative measures were used to assess participants' expectations and reactions to elements of the CD-Rom. Quantitative analyses found increases in evaluation, medium, and content ratings. Qualitative findings included: (i) interest, uncertainty, and <b>conditional</b> <b>interest</b> prior to viewing; and (ii) positive evaluations of the CD-Rom (in particular of the Elder) and an interest in additional similar tools on parenting topics from a family-centered perspective. Taken together, results suggested that the tool is appropriate for this community and that Inuit health is family-based. The third study further examined urban Inuit parenting by using the autonomy-relatedness perspective from cultural psychology, in order to increase understanding of how parents support the well-being of their children. Major parenting themes obtained from interviews included: child characteristics, parenting behaviours and beliefs, affection and love, stressors, and responsive and respectful parenting. The majority of parenting themes linked to relatedness, although there was evidence of autonomy in both parenting behaviours and child characteristics. Overall, research findings emphasized the family perspective on health held by this Inuit community, and pointed to differences in health information structures and parenting as a result of living in an urban context. Implications for health research and health promotion are discussed...|$|E

The large swings in New Zealand's exchange rate during the 1990 s were broadly consistent with the estimated conditional equilibrium, while the equally large swings in the exchange rate since 2000 were moves away from the conditional equilibrium. This may be because some factor other than interest rates or price levels has driven the exchange rate away from the conditional equilibrium since 2000. Alternatively, the long-run relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate may have changed since the 1990 s. ...|$|R
