25|$|Ultimately {{the only}} {{solution}} was for the LB to build its own line between Coulsdon North and Earlswood, bypassing Redhill, which {{became known as the}} Quarry Line. Plans were drawn up by Charles L. Morgan, the Chief Engineer. Authority was granted by Parliament in July 1896, and construction took place in 1898–9. The line involved substantial <b>civil</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>works</b> including the excavation of new tunnels at Merstham and Redhill, cuttings, embankments and a covered way at Cane Hill Hospital. The line opened on 8 November 1899 (1 April 1900 for passengers).|$|E

Other projects he was involved in designing include the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station's aerials, one of the earliest telecobalt radiotherapy units, Sri Lanka's tallest building, and the rebuilding of Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge after a fire.

While late 19th and 20th century technologies would later bridge the mountain chain in other places, these all required significant <b>civil</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>works</b> to make a road bed past the barrier range geologist classify as the ridge-and-valley Appalachians.

In Great Britain, governmental approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and state funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research.
