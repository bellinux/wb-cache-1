5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; {{one of his}} staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun of his <b>conservative</b> <b>approach</b> to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Meagan and Dunne {{resigned}} from the club and were replaced by Seán Thomas, {{the architect of the}} Six in a Row side, who with limited resources, re-signed Johnny Fullam and Mick Leech, as well as John Conway from Bohemians. Rovers finished the 1976–77 season in eleventh but won the club’s only League of Ireland Cup, with Leech’s 250th career goal proving the difference against Sligo. In July 1977, Irish international player-manager John Giles returned to Dublin to take up the same role at Rovers. The Kilcoynes implemented a full-time policy and unveiled plans to rebuild Glenmalure Park as a 50,000 all-seater stadium as well as turning the club into a school of excellence for Irish football, capable of challenging for European honours. Giles signed Irish internationals, Ray Treacy, Eamon Dunphy and Paddy Mulligan to complement the youth setup. In his first season in charge, the club won their 21st FAI Cup, defeating Sligo in a controversial final, but despite that success and emphatic victories in European competition against Apoel Nicosia and Fram Reykjavík, Giles' <b>conservative</b> <b>approach</b> based on possession football proved unsuccessful and on 3 February 1983, he resigned.|$|E

5|$|During a siege on {{the kingdom}} of Doma, Kefka grows {{impatient}} with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain {{the trust of the}} protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad—the Emperor taking a more <b>conservative</b> <b>approach,</b> since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.|$|E
5|$|The first daily {{newspaper}} {{to appear in}} Aarhus was Århus Stiftstidende, established in 1794 as Aarhuus Stifts Adresse-Contoirs Tidender, with a moderately <b>conservative</b> <b>approach.</b> Once one of Denmark's largest, it was a leading provincial newspaper for a time, but after the Second World War it increasingly faced competition from Demokraten (1884–1974) and Jyllands-Posten, both published in Aarhus. In 1998, it merged with Randers Amtsavis and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of Berlingske Media. The {{daily newspaper}} of Jyllandsposten (today known as Jyllands-Posten) was established in 1871 in Aarhus, and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With {{a reputation as a}} serious news publication, the paper has always included news from Jutland in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper (Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten) in the 1960s. Today {{it is one of the}} three leading serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being Berlingske and Politiken. Jyllands-Posten publishes JP Aarhus, a section dedicated to news in and around Aarhus, and hosted a free cityguide website from 2010 to 2016. The Copenhagen-based media company of Politiken, also publishes several free local papers once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden. In Aarhus, they publish a total of five local newspapers; Aarhus Midt, Aarhus Nord, Aarhus Vest, Aarhus Syd and Aarhus Weekend.|$|E

40|$|One {{potential}} problem of active database applications is the non-termination of rules. Although algorithms {{have been proposed}} to detect non-termination, almost all provide a conservative estimate; that is, the algorithms detect all the potential cases of non-termination. These algorithms then {{leave it to the}} database programmer to analyze each case to determine if indeed the rules are non-terminating. Our work proposes the use of automated tools for software specification and verification, to analyze active database applications. In this paper we show how the database programmer can automatically detect non-termination using an existing symbolic model checker. Our approach does not require much expertise {{on the part of the}} database programmer, and can be used to detect termination cases which the <b>conservative</b> <b>approaches</b> reject as non-terminating ones. Our approach, thus, complements the <b>conservative</b> <b>approaches.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|In the past, asthma was {{generally}} considered a contraindication for diving due to theoretical concern about {{an increased risk}} for pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness. The <b>conservative</b> <b>approach</b> was to arbitrarily disqualify asthmatics from diving.

Asthma has a similar prevalence in divers as in the general population.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the legalization}} of {{contraceptives}} {{in the early twentieth}} century, Brazilian law placed contraception, abortion and immorality in the same classification.

25|$|Bug!, a Sega Saturn {{game that}} was {{released}} in 1995, offered a more <b>conservative</b> <b>approach</b> to true 3D platforming. It allowed players to move in all directions, {{but it did not}} allow movement along more than one axis at once; the player could move orthogonally but not diagonally. Its characters were pre-rendered sprites, much like the earlier Clockwork Knight. The game played very similarly to 2D platformers, but it was considered a true 3D title, and let players walk up walls and on ceilings. It was a moderate success, and spawned a sequel called Bug Too!.|$|E

25|$|While the {{conservative}} {{wing of the}} German political spectrum, primarily formed of the CDU and CSU, enjoys considerable support, this support tends to be less extended to Stoiber. He enjoys considerably more support {{in his home state}} of Bavaria than in the rest of Germany, where CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel is more popular. This has its reasons: Merkel supports a kind of fiscal conservatism, but a more liberal social policy. Stoiber, on the other hand, favors a more <b>conservative</b> <b>approach</b> to both fiscal and social matters, and while this ensures him the religious vote, strongest in Bavaria, it has weakened his support at the national level.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we make an analogy {{between the time}} that storage must be {{maintained}} in a optimistic simulation and the blocking time in a conservative simulation. By exploring this analogy, we design two new Global Virtual Time (GVT) protocols for Time Warp systems.

In particular, we explore the connection between clock advancement schemes in <b>conservative</b> <b>approaches</b> and storage reclaiming in optimistic schemes.
