Indeed, when users delegate their sensitive data such as timetables to an autonomous agent, this one executes many automatic data processing without their intervention: users lost {{a part of their}} data control. To tackle this problem, we propose in this article to extend a concrete application of <b>calendars</b> <b>management</b> multi-agent system by implementing a specific protocol for sensitive data transactions that represents the first step of privacy preservation in multi-agent systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Calendar</b> <b>management</b> tools assist {{users with}} {{coordinating}} their daily life. Different tasks {{have to be}} scheduled according to the user preferences. In many cases, tasks are at different locations and travel times have to be considered. Therefore, these kinds of <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> problems {{can be regarded as}} spatio-temporal optimisation problems and are often variants of traveling salesman problems (TSP) or vehicle routing problems. While standard TSPs require a solution to include all tasks, prize-collecting TSPs are more suited for <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> problems as they require a solution that optimises the total sum of “prizes ” we assigned to tasks at different locations. If we now add time windows that limit when tasks can occur, these prize-collecting TSPs with time windows (TW-TSP) are excellent abstractions of spatio-temporal optimisation problems such as <b>calendar</b> <b>management.</b> Due to the inherent complexity of TW-TSPs, the existing literature considers mainly approximation algorithms or special cases. We present a novel algorithm for TW-TSPs that enables us to find the optimal solution to TW-TSP problems occurring in real-world <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> applications efficiently. Our algorithm is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that depends on the maximal number of tasks that can be revisited from some other task, a parameter which is small in the application scenario we consider. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Calendar</b> <b>management</b> {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a complex, highly personal type of activity, which must take individual preferences and constraints into account {{in the formulation of}} satisfactory schedules. Current <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> services are affected by two limitations: most of them lack any reasoning capabilities and thus cannot help the user in the management of tight schedules, which make the allocation of new tasks particularly challenging. Others are too impositive because they proactively schedule events without involving the user in the decision process. In order to address such issues, we propose a mixed-initiative approach which enables the user to select the events to be considered, receive safe schedule suggestions from the system and select the preferred ones for revising a calendar. A peculiarity of our system is the fact that, in the suggestion of alternative schedules for an event, it searches for solutions which are very similar to the user’s current schedule, with the aim of limiting changes to her/his daily plans as much as possible. Our <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> service is based on the exploitation of well-known Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems techniques, which guarantee the generation of safe scheduling solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{flexible}} file sharing in distributed systems is increasing in {{applications such as}} <b>calendar</b> <b>management,</b> collaborative editing of documents, collaborative software developments etc. The file sharing policies required in these applications are often {{very different from the}} traditional read/write policies. Hence, a flexible way of specifying and implementing sharing policies on individual files in file systems is required. We propose a distributed object-based system model of constructing file systems. The Object-based system model is based on a pattern called FlexiFrag. We show how a distributed object-based system and in particular distributed file system can be constructed using the pattern in a flexible way.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in how personal agents who perform <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> {{on behalf of their}} human users can schedule meetings effectively. A key difficulty of concern is deciding when to reschedule an existing meeting in favor of a new meeting. We model the meeting scheduling problem as a special subclass of distributed constraint reasoning (DCR) called the Incremental, Limited Information Exchange Multiagent Assignment Problem (IL-MAP). Key novelties of our approach include i) a focus on incremental scheduling, ii) scheduling under a limited information exchange paradigm and, iii) using models of other agents to schedule more effectively. Our results are the first in DCR to show how models of other agents can be used to improve problem solving performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Meeting {{scheduling}} is {{an important}} routine task in many organizations. The basic problem in meeting scheduling {{is to find a}} common free time for all participants of a meeting satisfying the given requirements. It is a time-consuming, iterative and tedious task. There exists several solutions for centralized <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> and meeting scheduling, but they are of limited functionalities, not fully automatic and requests are static. Most of the schedulers not considered change of participants, the distance between the places of the participants and the venues of meetings. In this approach equivalent classes of persons, distance between the venue and places of participants with dynamic requests is considered to schedule meetings. This approach performs better and effective for practical meeting scheduling...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} for an {{interface}} agent to succeed at assisting a user is learning when and when not to interrupt him to provide him assistance. Unwanted or irrelevant interruptions hinder the user’s work and make him dislike the agent because it is being intrusive and impolite. The IONWI algorithm enables interface agents to learn a user’s preferences and priorities regarding interruptions. The resulting user profile is then used by the agent to personalize the modality of the assistance, that is, assisting the user with an interruption or without an interruption depending on the user’s context. Experiments were conducted in the <b>calendar</b> <b>management</b> domain, obtaining promising results.

In this context, we propose a common content language combining meta-policies and application context data {{on one hand and}} on the other hand an interaction protocol for the exchange of sensitive data. Based on this proposal, agents providing sensitive data are able to check the compliance of the consumers to the HiMAS principles.
