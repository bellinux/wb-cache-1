2500|$|The {{structure}} of the mammalian voltage-gated K+ channel {{has been used to}} explain its ability to respond to the voltage across the membrane. Upon opening of the channel, conformational changes in the voltage-sensor domains (VSD) result in the transfer of 12-13 elementary charges across the membrane electric field. This charge transfer is measured as a transient <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> that precedes opening of the channel. Several charged residues of the VSD, in particular four arginine residues located regularly at every third position on the S4 segment, are known to move across the transmembrane field and contribute to the gating charge. The position of these arginines, known as gating arginines, are highly conserved in all voltage-gated potassium, sodium, or calcium channels. However, the extent of their movement and their displacement across the transmembrane potential has been subject to extensive debate. Specific domains of the channel subunits have been identified that are responsible for voltage-sensing and converting between the open and closed conformations of the channel. There are at least two closed conformations. In the first, the channel can open if the membrane potential becomes more positive. This type of gating is mediated by a voltage-sensing domain that consists of the S4 alpha helix that contains 6–7 positive charges. [...] Changes in membrane potential cause this alpha helix to move in the lipid bilayer. This movement in turn results in a conformational change in the adjacent S5–S6 helices that form the channel pore and cause this pore to open or close. In the second, [...] "N-type" [...] inactivation, voltage-gated K+ channels inactivate after opening, entering a distinctive, closed conformation. In this inactivated conformation, the channel cannot open, even if the transmembrane voltage is favorable. The amino terminal domain of the K+ channel or an auxiliary protein can mediate [...] "N-type" [...] inactivation. The mechanism of this type of inactivation {{has been described as a}} [...] "ball and chain" [...] model, where the N-terminus of the protein forms a ball that is tethered to the rest of the protein through a loop (the chain). The tethered ball blocks the inner porehole, preventing ion movement through the channel.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} {{limitations}} in particular for the classical polarography experiment for quantitative analytical measurements. Because the current is continuously measured during {{the growth of}} the Hg drop, there is a substantial contribution from <b>capacitive</b> <b>current.</b> As the Hg flows from the capillary end, there is initially a large increase in the surface area. As a consequence, the initial current is dominated by capacitive effects as charging of the rapidly increasing interface occurs. Toward the end of the drop life, there is little change in the surface area which diminishes the contribution of capacitance changes to the total current. At the same time, any redox process which occurs will result in faradaic current that decays approximately as the square root of time (due to the increasing dimensions of the Nernst diffusion layer). The exponential decay of the <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> is much more rapid than the decay of the faradaic current; hence, the faradaic current is proportionally larger {{at the end of the}} drop life. Unfortunately, this process is complicated by the continuously changing potential that is applied to the working electrode (the Hg drop) throughout the experiment. Because the potential is changing during the drop lifetime (assuming typical experimental parameters of a 2 mV/s scan rate and a 4 s drop time, the potential can change by 8 mV from the beginning to the end of the drop), the charging of the interface (<b>capacitive</b> <b>current)</b> has a continuous contribution to the total current, even at the end of the drop when the surface area is not rapidly changing. As such, the typical signal to noise of a polarographic experiment allows detection limits of only approximately 10−5 or 10−6 M.|$|E
50|$|Parallel {{resonance}} or near-to-resonance circuits {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} the waste of electrical energy, which would otherwise occur while the inductor built its field or the capacitor charged and discharged. As an example, asynchronous motors waste inductive current while synchronous ones waste <b>capacitive</b> <b>current.</b> The use of the two types in parallel makes the inductor feed the capacitor, and vice versa, maintaining the same resonant current in the circuit, and converting all the current into useful work.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason why}} commutating dv/dt {{is less than}} static dv/dt is that, shortly before the device tries to turn off, {{there is still some}} excess {{minority}} charge in its internal layers {{as a result of the}} previous conduction. When the TRIAC starts to turn off, these charges alter the internal potential of the region near the gate and MT1, so it is easier for the <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> due to dv/dt to turn on the device again.|$|E

However, in {{the proposed}} technique, the sampling frequency is set equally with the switching frequency of the DC/DC converter. That is because the setting is sufficient to cover the requirement for analyzing the <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>current</b> and it does not require additional design considerations for the DC/DC converter to analyze the <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>current.</b> In this step, a moving window technique is applied to calculate di/dt and d 2 i/dt 2 [...] of the <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>current</b> as well as use Prony’s method.|$|R

50|$|Presence of {{uninterrupted}} {{ground fault}} may pose a significant safety risk: {{if the current}} exceeds 4 A - 5 A an electric arc develops, which may be sustained even after the fault is cleared. For that reason, they are chiefly limited to underground and submarine networks, and industrial applications, where the reliability need is high and probability of human contact relatively low. In urban distribution networks with multiple underground feeders, the <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> may reach several tens of amperes, posing significant risk for the equipment.|$|E
50|$|Systems with {{earthing}} {{through high}} resistance have low phase-to-ground fault currents so require high sensitivity of FI.

50|$|Medium and {{high-voltage}} power cables, in circuits over 2000 volts, {{usually have}} a shield layer of copper or aluminium tape or conducting polymer. If an unshielded insulated cable is in contact with earth or a grounded object, the electrostatic field around the conductor will be concentrated at the contact point, resulting in corona discharge, and eventual destruction of the insulation. Leakage current and <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> through the insulation presents a danger of electrical shock. The grounded shield equalizes electrical stress around the conductor, diverts any leakage current to ground. Stress relief cones should be applied at the shield ends, especially for cables operating at more than 2 kV to earth.|$|E

30|$|When a fault {{occurs in}} {{distribution}} line, {{it is possible}} to measure <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>current</b> at the DC/DC converter. The <b>capacitive</b> discharge <b>current</b> is analyzed at each converter in two aspects.

The transferred data is analyzed with respect to the converter station, and the control center identifies the fault section in the LVDC distribution system. This is followed by sending the operation signal to the corresponding protective devices to isolate the fault section as shown in Fig.  4. Given that only the minimum fault section is isolated through the proposed technique, all customers do not experience an outage as long as a ring-type system is used.|$|R

For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than sending end voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor is connected in parallel with shunt capacitance of the line known as Shunt Reactor, ...|$|E
50|$|Dramatically better {{discrimination}} against the <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> {{can be obtained}} using the tast and pulse polarographic techniques. These have been developed with introduction of analog and digital electronic potentiostats. A first major improvement is obtained, if the current is only measured {{at the end of}} each drop lifetime (tast polarography). An even greater enhancement has been the introduction of differential pulse polarography. Here, the current is measured before the beginning and before the end of short potential pulses. The latter are superimposed to the linear potential-time-function of the voltammetric scan. Typical amplitudes of these pulses range between 10 and 50 mV, whereas pulse duration is 20 to 50 ms. The difference between both current values is that taken as the analytical signal. This technique results in a 100 to 1000-fold improvement of the detection limit, because the capacitive component is effectively suppressed.|$|E

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the DME is that each drop has a smooth and uncontaminated surface free from any adsorbed analyte or impurity. The self-renewing electrode {{does not need to}} be cleaned or polished like a solid electrode. This advantage comes at the cost of a working electrode with a constantly changing surface area. Since the drops are produced predictably the changing surface area can be accounted for or even used advantageously. In addition the drops' growth causes <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> and faradaic current. These changing current effects combined with experiments where the potential is continuously changed can result in noisy traces. In some experiments the traces are continually sampled, showing all the current deviation resulting from the drop growth. Other sampling methods smooth the data by sampling the current at the electrode only once per drop at a specific size. The DME's periodic expansion into the solution and hemispherical shape also affects the way the analyte diffuses to the electrode surface. The DME consists of a fine capillary with a bore size of 20-50 µm.|$|E
50|$|The turn-on {{is due to}} a {{parasitic}} {{capacitive coupling}} of the gate terminal with the MT2 terminal, which lets currents into the gate in response to a large rate of voltage change at MT2. One way to cope with this limitation is to design a suitable RC or RCL snubber network. In many cases this is sufficient to lower the impedance of the gate towards MT1. By putting a resistor or a small capacitor (or both in parallel) between these two terminals, the <b>capacitive</b> <b>current</b> generated during the transient flows out of the device without activating it. A careful reading of the application notes provided by the manufacturer and testing of the particular device model to design the correct network is in order. Typical values for capacitors and resistors between the gate and MT1 may be up to 100 nF and 10 Ω to 1 kΩ. Normal TRIACs, except for low-power types marketed as sensitive gate, already have such a resistor built in to safeguard against spurious dv/dt triggering. This will mask the gate's supposed diode-type behaviour when testing a TRIAC with a multimeter.|$|E
