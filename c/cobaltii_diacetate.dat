40|$|The {{bimetallic}} paddlewheel catalyst precursor, [PdIICoII(µ-OOCCH 3) 4] H 2 O· 2 CH 3 COOH (1), prepared from [Pd 3 (µ-OOCCH 3) 6] and [Co(OOCCH 3) 2], {{was used}} as a single source precursor to prepare, after binding to a surface-hydroxylated silicon wafer and oxidation, the bimetallic oxides of PdIVCoIII/SiO 2 catalyst supported on a model planar (i. e., two-dimensional) silicon wafer. This catalyst catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to its corresponding carbonyl compounds. The bimetallic tetracarboxylato catalyst precursor was bonded to the surface-hydroxylated silicon wafer by spin-coating and also by grafting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that one of the four µ-acetato bridging ligands was substituted by Si–O fragments in a covalent bond formation process during grafting of 1 onto the wafer. In contrast, during the spin-coating process, all four acetato ligands remained intact during fixation on the silicon surface. Upon oxidation and workup, the grafted sample’s Pd:Co ratio remained unchanged (1. 0 : 1. 3), whereas the spin-coated sample’s Pd content decreased with respect to Co content. XPS determined binding energies were interpreted to imply that after oxidation in an oxygen/argon mixture of the grafted sample both PdII and CoII were oxidized to produce PdO 2 (337. 5 eV) and CoIII 2 O 3 (781. 1 eV) which most probably interacts with the silicon surface via PdIV–O–Si and CoIII–O–Si bonds. Solvent free aerobic oxidation of octadecanol to its corresponding carbonyl compound was achieved on this oxidized PdIVCoIII/SiO 2 model catalyst using molecular oxygen as oxidant under solvent-free conditions. The use of the single source catalyst precursor, 1, resulted in a PdIVCoIII/SiO 2 catalyst with superior catalytic activity toward the oxidation of octadecanol over a catalyst prepared from a physical mixture of the separate reactant compounds tripalladium(II) hexaacetate and <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>diacetate...</b>|$|E
