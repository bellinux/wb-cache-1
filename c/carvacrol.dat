50|$|<b>Carvacrol</b> {{does not}} have many {{long-term}} genotoxic risks. The cytotoxic effect of <b>carvacrol</b> can make it an effective antiseptic and antimicrobial agent. <b>Carvacrol</b> {{has been found to}} show antioxidant activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvacrol</b> {{is present}} in the {{essential}} oil of Origanum vulgare (oregano), oil of thyme, oil obtained from pepperwort, and wild bergamot. The essential oil of Thyme subspecies contains between 5% and 75% of <b>carvacrol,</b> while Satureja (savory) subspecies have a content between 1% and 45%. Origanum majorana (marjoram) and Dittany of Crete are rich in <b>carvacrol,</b> 50% and 60-80% respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Ancient Egyptians used thymol and <b>carvacrol</b> in {{the form}} of a {{preparation}} from the thyme plant (a member of the mint family) to preserve mummies. Thymol and <b>carvacrol</b> are now known to kill bacteria and fungi, making thyme well suited for such purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil of Monarda fistulosa was analyzed using mass spectrometry and arithmetical retention indices, {{and was found}} to contain p-cymene (32.5%), <b>carvacrol</b> (24.0%), thymol (12.6%), an aliphatic aldehyde (6.3%), the methyl ether of <b>carvacrol</b> (5.5%), α-pinene (3.5%), β-pinene (2.9%), sabinene hydrate (1.9%), α-terpinene (1.7%), citronellyl acetate (1.6%), and β-caryophyllene (1.1%).|$|E
50|$|The plant {{contains}} the chemical compounds thymol, <b>carvacrol</b> and cedrol.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a potent}} {{activator}} of the human ion channels transient receptor potential V3 (TRPV3) and A1 (TRPA1). Application of <b>carvacrol</b> on the human tongue, as well as activation of TRPV3, causes a sensation of warmth. In addition, <b>carvacrol</b> also activates, but then rapidly desensitizes, the pain receptor TRPA1; this explains its pungency.|$|E
50|$|The main {{chemical}} compounds {{found in the}} essential oil of Plectranthus amboinicus according to one analysis are <b>carvacrol</b> (28.65%), thymol (21.66%), α-humulene (9.67%), undecanal (8.29%), γ-terpinene (7.76%), ρ-cymene (6.46%), caryophyllene oxide (5.85%), α-terpineol (3.28%) and β-selinene (2.01%). Another analysis obtained thymol (41.3%), <b>carvacrol</b> (13.25%), 1,8-cineole (5.45%), eugenol (4.40%), caryophyllene (4.20%), terpinolene (3.75%), α-pinene (3.20%), β-pinene (2.50%), methyl eugenol (2.10%), and β-phellandrene (1.90%). Other studies showed <b>carvacrol</b> as the main constituent of P. amboinicus oil, and at even higher concentrations than in the first analysis shown above. The variations {{can be attributed to}} the methodology used in the extraction process, seasonal variations, soil type, climate, genetic and geographical variations of the plant.|$|E
50|$|In rats, <b>carvacrol</b> {{is quickly}} metabolized and excreted. The main {{metabolic}} route is esterification of the phenolic group with sulfuric acid and glucuronic acid. A minor pathway is oxidation {{of the terminal}} methyl groups to primary alcohols. After 24 hours, only very small amounts of <b>carvacrol</b> or its metabolites {{could be found in}} urine, indicating an almost complete excretion within one day.|$|E
50|$|Thymol {{is part of}} a {{naturally}} occurring class of compounds known as biocides, with strong antimicrobial attributes when used alone or with other biocides such as <b>carvacrol.</b> In addition, thymol can reduce bacterial resistance to common drugs such as penicillin. Numerous studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial effects of thymol, ranging from inducing antibiotic susceptibility in drug-resistant pathogens to powerful antioxidant properties. Research demonstrates that thymol and <b>carvacrol</b> reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics through a synergistic effect, and thymol {{has been shown to be}} an effective fungicide, particularly against fluconazole-resistant strains. This is especially relevant to Candida infections. <b>Carvacrol</b> and thymol have been demonstrated to have an antimutagenic effect. In addition, there is evidence that thymol has antitumor properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvacrol,</b> or cymophenol, C6H3CH3(OH)(C3H7), is a monoterpenoid phenol. It has a {{characteristic}} pungent, warm odor of oregano.|$|E

Research demonstrates that thymol and <b>carvacrol</b> reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics through a synergistic effect, and thymol {{has been shown to be}} an effective fungicide, particularly against fluconazole-resistant strains. <b>Carvacrol</b> and thymol have been demonstrated to have a strong antimutagenic effect. In addition, there is evidence that thymol has antitumor properties. Though the exact mechanism is unknown, some evidence suggests thymol effects at least some of its biocidal properties by membrane disruption. Thymol has been shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA in vitro.|$|E

50|$|A study led by Supriya Bavadekar in 2012 {{reported}} <b>carvacrol</b> stimulates apoptosis in {{prostate cancer}} cells. In 2015, another study using rats with carcinogenic DMH injections showed <b>carvacrol</b> at 40mg/kg bt.w reversed carcinogenic effects on colon cells, however, the therapeutic effects were substantially increased when combined X-radiation treatment. A {{follow up study}} by the same lead researcher in 2016 provided additional evidence for this effect. These studies are preliminary and further research is required. Both pro and anti-apoptotic effect of this compound have been proposed in various cellular systems, but conclusive evidence to support a direct effect is lacking.|$|E
50|$|The terpinenes, phellandrenes, and terpinolene {{are formed}} similarly. Hydroxylation {{of any of}} these {{compounds}} followed by dehydration can lead to the aromatic p-cymene. Important terpenoids derived from monocyclic terpenes are menthol, thymol, <b>carvacrol</b> and many others.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil of Lippia graveolens contains 0-81% thymol, 0-48% <b>carvacrol,</b> 3-30% para-cymene, and 0-15% eucalyptol. The first two components give the plant a flavor similar to oregano, {{and the leaves}} are widely used as an herb in Mexico and Central America.|$|E
50|$|The TRPV3 {{channel is}} {{directly}} activated by various natural compounds like <b>carvacrol,</b> thymol and eugenol. Several other monoterpenoids which cause either feeling of warmth or are skin sensitizers can also open the channel.

5000|$|... o-Cresol {{is mainly}} {{used as a}} {{precursor}} to other compounds. Chlorination and etherification gives members of a commercially important herbicides, such as 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA). Nitration gives dinitrocresol, a popular herbicide. Kolbe-Schmitt carboxylation gives o-cresotinic acid, a pharmaceutical intermediate. <b>Carvacrol,</b> essence of oregano, is derived by alkylation of o-cresol with propylene. The muscle relaxant Mephenesin is an ether derived from o-cresol.|$|E
50|$|Thymol (also {{known as}} 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, IPMP) {{is a natural}} {{monoterpene}} phenol derivative of cymene, C10H14O, isomeric with <b>carvacrol,</b> found in oil of thyme, and extracted from Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) and various other kinds of plants as a white crystalline substance of a pleasant aromatic odor and strong antiseptic properties. Thymol also provides the distinctive, strong flavor of the culinary herb thyme, also produced from T. vulgaris.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvacrol</b> {{inhibits}} {{the growth}} of several bacteria strains, e.g. Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. Its low toxicity together with its pleasant taste and smell suggests its use as a food additive to prevent bacterial contamination. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa it causes damages to the cell membrane of these bacteria and, unlike other terpenes, inhibits their proliferation. The cause of the antimicrobial properties {{is believed to be}} disruption of the bacteria membrane.|$|E
50|$|A {{good example}} of a plant with many {{polymorphic}} chemotypes is Thymus vulgaris. While largely indistinguishable in appearance, specimens of T. vulgaris may be {{assigned to one of}} seven different chemotypes, depending on whether the dominant component of the essential oil is thymol, <b>carvacrol,</b> linalool, geraniol, sabinene hydrate (thuyanol), α-terpineol, or eucalyptol. Such chemotypes may be indicated as Thymus vulgaris ct. thymol (red thyme), or Thymus vulgaris ct. geraniol (sweet thyme), etc. Such an indication has no taxonomic standing.|$|E
50|$|Lippia is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} verbena family, Verbenaceae. It was named after Augustus Lippi, (1678-1705), a French naturalist and botanist (with Italian origins). He was killed in Abyssinia. The genus contains roughly 200 species of tropical shrubs that are found around the world. Plants are fragrant due to their essential oils, which vary between species but may include estragole, <b>carvacrol,</b> linalool, or limonene. The leaves of certain species, such as L. graveolens, {{can be used as}} a culinary herb similar to oregano.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants are}} valued {{by the local}} {{population}} for their content in essential oils, mostly pulegone and menthone, but also limonene, carvone, <b>carvacrol,</b> thymol and similar substances. They are used as condiments, medicinally against illnesses of the respiratory and digestive systems, and traditionally {{for the protection of}} stored tubers against pests, especially in Southern Peru. In Argentina and Peru, the essential oils are extracted commercially on a larger scale, and at least locally, this has led to overexploitation in recent years. Argentine researchers {{are looking for ways to}} protect Minthostachys or to take it into cultivation to meet increasing demand.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvacrol</b> may be {{synthetically}} {{prepared by}} the fusion of cymol sulfonic acid with caustic potash; {{by the action of}} nitrous acid on 1-methyl-2-amino-4-propyl benzene; by prolonged heating of five parts of camphor with one part of iodine; or by heating carvol with glacial phosphoric acid or by performing a dehydrogenation of carvone with a Pd/C catalyst. It is extracted from Origanum oil by means of a 50% potash solution. It is a thick oil that sets at 20 °C to a mass of crystals of melting point 0 °C, and boiling point 236-237 °C. Oxidation with ferric chloride converts it into dicarvacrol, whilst phosphorus pentachloride transforms it into chlorcymol.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a survey}} of {{available}} literature, only a few publications relevant to the chemical composition of Thymus pannonicus were found, suggesting that a substantial dearth of information in this field still exists. According to Karuza-Stojaković et al., the principal constituents of T. pannonicus essential oil from southern parts of Vojvodina province (northern Serbia) were terpinyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, thymol, <b>carvacrol</b> and geranyl acetate (listed in order of descending quantity). Recent comprehensive studies of chemical variability in hydrodistilled essential oils of different wild growing and cultivated populations of T. pannonicus from Hungary, as well as supercritical fluid extracts of various Lamiaceae species, confirmed that high concentrations of both thymol and p-cymene are the main chemosystematic attributes of T. pannonicus essential oil,. Further research efforts of Pluhár Zs. et al. on the volatile oil composition of T. pannonicus from nineteen different localities of Hungary, confirmed a significant essential oil polymorphism in this plant species, as twelve different chemovarieties were determined, namely: thymol, thymol/p-cymene, thymol/p-cymene/γ-terpinene, thymol/p-cymene/neral, thymol/p-cymene/γ-terpinene/β-bisabolene, thymol/p-cymene/isoborneol/γ-terpinene, thymol/linalyl acetate/γ-terpinene/α-cubebene, p-cymene/geraniol/linalyl acetate, linalyl acetate/geranyl acetate, germacrene-D/β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide/α-cubebene/linalool, and germacrene-D/β-caryophyllene/farnesol.|$|E
5000|$|Oregano is an {{important}} culinary herb, used for the flavour of its leaves, which can be more flavourful when dried than fresh. It has an aromatic, warm, and slightly bitter taste, which can vary in intensity. Good-quality oregano may be strong enough almost to numb the tongue, but cultivars adapted to colder climates often have a lesser flavor. Factors such as climate, season, and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than {{the differences between the}} various species of plants. Among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are <b>carvacrol,</b> thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene.Oregano's most prominent modern use is as the staple herb of Italian-American cuisine. Its popularity in the U.S. began when soldiers returning from World War II brought back with them a taste for the [...] "pizza herb", which had probably been eaten in southern Italy for centuries. There, it is most frequently used with roasted, fried, or grilled vegetables, meat, and fish. Oregano combines well with spicy foods popular in southern Italy. It is less commonly used in the north of the country, as marjoram generally is preferred.|$|E
50|$|Plectranthus amboinicus is {{attributed}} to have antiseptic, antimicrobial, appetizing, digestive, carminative, stomachic, anthelmintic, binding, deodorant, diuretic and tonic properties. It is commonly used in respiratory tract disorders as a bronchodilator, antitussive, and expectorant. The antiseptic and antimicrobial properties of the plant {{have been attributed to}} the presence of compounds such as <b>carvacrol,</b> thymol, flavones, phenols, tannins and aromatic acids. The leaves are traditionally used for the treatment of coughs, sore throats and nasal congestion, but also for a range of other problems such as infections, rheumatism and flatulence. The plant is cultivated in home-gardens throughout India for use in traditional medicine, being used to treat malarial fever, hepatopathy, renal and vesical calculi, cough, chronic asthma, hiccup, bronchitis, helminthiasis, colic, convulsions, and epilepsy, Shenoy and others refer to further Indian traditional medicinal uses such as for skin ulcerations, scorpion bite, skin allergy, wounds, diarrhoea, with emphasis on the leaves being used as a hepatoprotective, to promote liver health. In Indonesia Plectranthus amboinicus is a traditional food used in soup to stimulate lactation for the month or so following childbirth. In Cambodia two uses are recorded: juice from the leaves is sweetened and then given to children as protection from colds; and leaves are applied to the lips. In Bahia, Brasil, people use the plant to treat skin lesions caused by Leishmania braziliensis. Just to the north, in Paraiba of the same country, the plant is commonly used in home medication.|$|E
