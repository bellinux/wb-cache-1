5|$|Much of the {{management}} work {{carried out in the}} nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), <b>common</b> <b>pochard</b> (Aythya ferina), common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti).|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and <b>common</b> <b>pochard</b> were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, <b>common</b> <b>pochard,</b> northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife include little egrets, spotbills, and carps, {{seasonally}} also tufted ducks, northern pintails, and <b>common</b> <b>pochards.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aquatically {{foraging}} Bewick’s Swans Cygnus bewickii {{have been}} repeatedly {{reported to be}} accompanied by diving ducks, but the exact nature of this relationship is unclear. Based on field observations, we found a strong correlation between the number of foraging swans and the number of foraging <b>Common</b> <b>Pochards</b> Aythya ferina and Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula at our study site (Lauwersmeer, the Netherlands), with the median ratio being close to one diving duck per swan. To determine whether the association was kleptoparasitic or commensal, we measured in a series of experimental trials the instantaneous intake rates of Bewick’s Swans and <b>Common</b> <b>Pochards</b> when foraging alone and when foraging together. On average, pochards in company with a swan attained twice the instantaneous intake rate as compared with foraging alone. This was mainly due to gleaning food items that floated away {{as a result of the}} swan’s trampling activity, and was not due to stealing: in fact, food intake rates of swans were not affected by the presence of a pochard. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{adult male}} is unmistakable. It has a rounded orange head, red bill and black breast. The flanks are white, the back brown, and the tail black. The female is mainly a pale brown, with a darker back and crown and a whitish face. Eclipse males are like females but with red bills. They are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as <b>common</b> <b>pochards.</b> They feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants, and {{typically}} upend for food {{more than most}} diving ducks.|$|R
25|$|The {{park has}} some 8,800 trees, {{including}} Ginkgo biloba, Cinnamomum camphora, Zelkova serrata, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There {{is a further}} 24,800m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, <b>common</b> <b>pochard,</b> little grebe, great egret, and great cormorant. The Baer's pochard, ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{feature of}} the northern section of the park is a boating lake. This has been in situ since a tender to install a [...] lake with {{an island in the}} centre was accepted in August 1880. An approach to Joseph Swan to illuminate the lake received no response, but a further approach to John Hancock to design the lake edge was more successful; the lake edge today still follows Hancock's original design. Model boating has been a fixture of the lake since 1886 and the Saltwell Park Model Boat Club is the latest organisation to use the lake for this purpose. The island in the centre of the lake was in 1909 home to a bandstand, and visiting performers were required to travel by boat to the island, but the bandstand was moved to the Saltwell Grove section of the park in 1921. During the summer months, visitors can hire rowing boats and pedalos for use on the lake. The lake has long been inhabited by mallards and tufted ducks and it is also home to several other species of wildfowl, including swans, Canada and barnacle geese, coots and moorhens. <b>Common</b> <b>pochard</b> and grebe also inhabit the lake in winter after migrating from Russia and central Europe. Kingfisher are also reported to have returned to the lake after a lengthy absence.|$|E
2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar-headed goose, ruddy shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, <b>common</b> <b>pochard,</b> brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.|$|E
50|$|These are gregarious birds, {{but less}} social than other Aythya species but where common it can form large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as tufted ducks and <b>common</b> <b>pochards.</b> Forms pairs from January onwards and during {{courtship}} the male often curls his tail {{so that it}} dips into the water forming a triangular white patch of the undertail coverts. In areas where it is common it will form colonies at protected sites such as islands, often in association with gulls. Where scarce it nests singly, in dispersed and concealed sites.|$|R

25|$|The campus lake is {{the largest}} plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The {{decision}} by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin {{as the site of}} the Heslington West was built on generally flat agricultural land and it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including greylag, Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, tufted duck, and <b>common</b> <b>pochards.</b> There is also a growing population of black swans and a few great crested grebe. Herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence.|$|R

40|$|Medina lagoon in Andalusia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} densities of spent lead (Pb) shot in Europe. Blood samples from waterbirds were {{collected}} in 2006 - 2008 to measure Pb concentration (PbB), δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry. PbB above background levels (> 20 γg/dl) was observed in 19 % (n= 59) of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and in all <b>common</b> <b>pochards</b> (Aythya ferina) (n= 4), but common coots (Fulica atra) (n= 37) and moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) (n= 12) were all 6 γg/dl. In mallards, an inhibition of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and an increased level of oxidized glutathione (oxGSH) in red blood cells (RBC) were associated with PbB levels > 20 γg/dl. In coots, PbB levels were negatively related to vitamin A and carotenoid levels in plasma, and total glutathione in RBCs; and positively related with higher superoxide dismutase and GPx activities and % oxGSH in RBCs. Overall, the results indicate that previously assumed background levels of PbB for birds need to be revised. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCapsule Clutch {{size and}} female body mass play major roles in duck {{incubation}} behaviour. Aims To investigate {{the effects of}} incubation stage, clutch size, body size, body mass and weather on incubation attentiveness. Methods Incubation behaviour was monitored with Temperature Data Loggers (TDLs). Nest temperature fluctuations were recorded both {{in the field in}} <b>Common</b> <b>Pochards</b> Aythya ferina and in aviaries in Mallards Anas platyrhynchos using TDLs deposited either in the nest (Pochards) or in a dummy egg placed in the clutch (Mallards). Both methods allowed data collection on incubation attentiveness. Results Incubation attentiveness increased over the incubation period and with clutch size for both species. Body size appeared to affect incubation rhythms in Mallards only. Female Pochards were found to reload their nest with fresh material in response to precipitation events, presumably owing to the rise in water level. Conclusions Clutch size and female body mass play major roles in duck incubation behaviour. Climatic events can also be prominent factors influencing incubation behaviour. We describe {{for the first time the}} nesting behaviour of Pochard females and show that they have the capacity to adjust nest topology in response to a rise in water level following rain...|$|R

40|$|Wild bird {{movements}} and aggregations following spells of cold weather {{may have resulted}} in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H 5 N 1 in Europe during the winter of 2005 – 2006. Waterbirds are constrained in winter to areas where bodies of water remain unfrozen in order to feed. On the one hand, waterbirds may choose to winter {{as close as possible to}} their breeding grounds in order to conserve energy for subsequent reproduction, and may be displaced by cold fronts. On the other hand, waterbirds may choose to winter in regions where adverse weather conditions are rare, and may be slowed by cold fronts upon their journey back to the breeding grounds, which typically starts before the end of winter. Waterbirds will thus tend to aggregate along cold fronts close to the 0 °C isotherm during winter, creating conditions that favour HPAIV H 5 N 1 transmission and spread. We determined that the occurrence of outbreaks of HPAIV H 5 N 1 infection in waterbirds in Europe during the winter of 2005 – 2006 was associated with temperatures close to 0 °C. The analysis suggests a significant spatial and temporal association of outbreaks caused by HPAIV H 5 N 1 in wild birds with maximum surface air temperatures of 0 °C– 2 °C on the day of the outbreaks and the two preceding days. At locations where waterbird census data have been collected since 1990, maximum mallard counts occurred when average and maximum surface air temperatures were 0 °C and 3 °C, respectively. Overall, the abundance of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and <b>common</b> <b>pochards</b> (Aythya ferina) was highest when surface air temperatures were lower than the mean temperatures of the region investigated. The analysis implies that waterbird movements associated with cold weather, and congregation of waterbirds along the 0 °C isotherm likely contributed to the spread and geographical distribution of outbreaks of HPAIV H 5 N 1 infection in wild birds in Europe during the winter of 2005 – 2006...|$|R
