5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for <b>cooling</b> {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic <b>cooling,</b> conductive <b>cooling,</b> radiational <b>cooling,</b> and evaporative <b>cooling.</b> Adiabatic <b>cooling</b> occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive <b>cooling</b> occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational <b>cooling</b> occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative <b>cooling</b> occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with <b>cooling</b> to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after <b>cooling,</b> metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for <b>cooling</b> the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The <b>cooling</b> water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The <b>cooling</b> water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} <b>cooling</b> systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC <b>cooling</b> system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold <b>cooling</b> system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle <b>cooling</b> and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal <b>cooling</b> devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the <b>cooling</b> system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for <b>cooling</b> during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot <b>cooling</b> water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses.

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and <b>cooling,</b> especially if the heating and <b>cooling</b> are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film <b>cooling</b> and transpiration <b>cooling.</b> Film <b>cooling</b> works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner <b>cooling,</b> transpiration <b>cooling,</b> is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> air to pass through it, providing <b>cooling</b> benefits similar to film <b>cooling.</b> The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> air required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration <b>cooling</b> uses much less <b>cooling</b> air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less air for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E
