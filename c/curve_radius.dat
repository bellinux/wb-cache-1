Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built along an existing road, but rather on a new right-of-way, avoiding the need to provide access to properties.|$|E
5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79. The SL95s {{are the only}} {{bidirectional}} trams, and therefore {{the only ones that}} can operate on the Ullevål Hageby Line, that is served by lines 17 and 18. Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen. They run on the Ullevål Hageby-, Ekeberg-, Sinsen-, Grünerløkka–Torshov-, Lilleaker- and Skøyen lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and <b>curve</b> <b>radius.</b> The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E

25|$|For {{those lines}} {{constructed}} {{to a lower}} standard, speed can be increased via numerous methods including realigning rail lines to increase the minimum <b>curve</b> <b>radius,</b> {{reducing the number of}} intersections, or introducing tilting trains to improve the speed of trains running on those lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety of}} a {{horizontal}} curve {{is affected by the}} length of the curve, the <b>curve</b> <b>radius,</b> whether spiral transition curves are used, and the superelevation of the roadway.

25|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest arrangement {{consists of}} two turnouts and a fixed diamond crossing. Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km/h. This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space. Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point rodding of a single signal box.|$|E
25|$|Shinkansen routes are {{completely}} separate from conventional rail lines (except Mini-shinkansen which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is {{not affected by}} slower local or freight trains, and {{has the capacity to}} operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without road crossings at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō Shinkansen).|$|E
25|$|The Briskeby Line is in poor {{condition}} {{because of}} insufficient maintenance.

To this end the Manchester Benchmarks passenger vehicle model is used and scatter in vehicle, suspension and wheel profile properties is accounted for in the generation of load collectives that are used for rail damage assessment. Rail wear and RCF damage are evaluated at different <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> for load collectives of different size using Archard’s wear law and the Tγ RCF damage model. Variance in damage estimates are investigated and it is shown that variance is reduced at smaller <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> for both damage criteria.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} how a {{degraded}} track geometry influences further {{degradation of the}} geometry {{and the formation of}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear of rails. The overall objective is optimisation of railway maintenance. For this, further understanding and quantification of the deterioration of track components are needed. Dynamic multibody simulations have been performed featuring different wagons, and a track with different <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> and different levels of track geometry degradation. With the resulting wheel/rail interaction degradation indicators are evaluated. Increased track shift forces are considered as an indicator of further track geometry degradation. Two different RCF indices (one shakedown map based and one wear number based) are used to quantify surface degradation of rails. Measured lateral track irregularities were found to follow a normal distribution reasonably well. Furthermore, the standard deviation of track shift forces was shown to have a linear relationship with the standard deviation of the lateral irregularities. For large <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> an increase of the level of lateral irregularities increases the length of rail affected by RCF. The opposite is predicted for small <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> where the length of rail affected by RCF decreases with increasing levels of lateral irregularities. For very small <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> it was shown that the degradation mechanism shifts from pure wear for low levels of lateral irregularities to a mixed wear/RCF degradation for higher levels of lateral irregularities. Amplification of lateral irregularities in different wavelength spans revealed that an amplification of longer wavelengths (between 10 [...] 50 metres) had the largest influence on the length of rail affected by RCF in shallow curves. A correlation study between predicted tangential wheel/rail contact forces and lateral irregularities (amplitudes of the irregularities, first order derivatives and second order derivatives) was carried out. No significant correlation was found...|$|R
25|$|The metro {{is mostly}} underground; surface {{sections}} include sections on viaduct in Paris (lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) {{and at the}} surface in the suburbs (lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines some stations (for example, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of line 14.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds and loads hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of those lines and minimum <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of those lines, the maximum speed of those through service {{is still the same}} as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E
