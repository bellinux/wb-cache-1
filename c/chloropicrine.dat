40|$|The {{chlorination}} by-products {{chloral hydrate}} and <b>chloropicrine</b> were assayed for genotoxicity in three short-term tests. <b>Chloropicrine</b> was 100 -fold more potent than chloral in inducing mutations in strain TAI 00 of S. typhimurium (fluctuation test) and, {{at variance with}} chloral, was positive in the SOS chromotest using strain PQ 37 of E. coli. On the other hand, only chloral caused {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes following in L, iL'o exposure of the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl newt larvae...|$|E
40|$|Goods {{containers}} {{imported into}} the Netherlands are often treated with such pesticides as methyl bromide, <b>chloropicrine</b> and phosphine. There {{is always a}} chance that pesticides absorbed in goods during transport will be released into the air by evaporation during consumer use. In this investigation, commissioned by the VROM Inspectorate, goods such as mattresses, footwear, bags and wood-hewn sculptures {{were found to be}} prone to evaporation. This evaporation can, in turn, cause consumers to be unintentionally exposed. Furthermore, evaporation from foodstuffs and medicines can lead to oral ingestion of pesticides and perhaps even changes in the chemical composition of a food or medicine...|$|E
40|$|WE have {{recently}} shown 1, 2 that β-mercaptoethanol (a strongly reducing -SH-containing substance) markedly inhibits morphogenetic movements (gastrulation, closure of neural plate) in amphibian eggs. The oxidized counterpart of β-mercaptoethanol (dithiodiglycol) produces a thickening of the neural plate; {{the same type}} of abnormalities can be obtained with other thiol reagents, iodoacetamide and <b>chloropicrine</b> for example 3. Another interesting action of β-mercaptoethanol is the complete inhibition of cap formation in anucleate fragments of the alga Acetabularia, without appreciable effect on the growth in length of the stalks 4. It is a surprising fact that β-mercaptoethanol exerts strongly inhibitory effects on morphogenesis in biological systems so different as amphibian eggs and Acetabularia; the purpose of this communication is to summarize the results obtained in further experiments made on Acetabularia, amphibian eggs and regenerating animals (axolotl tadpoles, planarians). © 1959 Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|Mycorrhizae play an  {{important}} role in plant growth, since their prescence increases nutrient absorption, enhances resistance to adverse environmental factors, protects the rools from pathogens, and increases height and stem growth. Thirteen tree nursery administrators were interviewed {{in order to find}} out about ectomycorrhizal practices used. About 69. 2 % of the nurseries inoculate with Pisolithus tinctorius fruiting bodies, 15. 4 % use soil from pine plantations, and 7. 8 % use both methods. Tree nursery administrators lack sufficient knowledge about the function of ectomycorrhizae and the most effective inoculation methodologies. Furthermore, an experiment on ectomycorrhizal inoculation of oak seedlings was carried out. Three soil types and three treatments (inoculation with soil and roots from an oak forest, soil sterilization with methyl bromide and <b>chloropicrine,</b> and no treatment as control) were used. Results indicated that seedlings growing in inoculated soil showed most growth in stem height and larger stem dry weight. However, root dry weight of inoculated seedlings was less that those corresponding to seedlings growing in sterilized and control soil. This also demonstrates the effectivity of inoculation with oak forest soil...|$|E
