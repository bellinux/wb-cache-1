40|$|ABSTRACT Carton Clamp Test Methodologies and the Effects on Load Containment and Retention Tyler Don Blumer A carton clamp is an {{alternative}} device for moving packages and material. Instead of using iron tines {{like that of a}} conventional forklift, a carton clamp uses two large aluminum platens to slightly compress and secure the load for handling. This is advantageous as it allows operators to move layers of a unitized load individually, and eliminates the need for a pallet when handling full unitized loads. When using a carton clamp attachment, it is often difficult for operators to accurately gauge the amount of force being applied to the load. The required clamping force changes depending on the size, shape, and weight of the load. This creates the potential for under-clamping (slippage) and over-clamping (compressive damage). Seeing a market need for a reliable means of testing, two organizations set out to develop a testing protocol. A rift formed between schools of thought regarding the correct testing procedure. ISTA provides a sterile, calculated, and stationary simulation of carton <b>clamp</b> <b>handling</b> in its ISTA 6 -SAMS test protocol. ASTM offers a more holistic, dynamic, observational approach in its mobile ASTM 6055 standard protocol. One school of thought is suggested to imply that a package should be developed to be handled by the carton clamp (ASTM). The other school of thought is that the carton clamp attachment should be properly adjusted to the package specimen (ISTA). Previous studies have been performed citing the ISTA standard and using a specialized carton clamping device vibration device that is calibrated for laboratory research. Arguably, this method, though repeatable in nature, does not accurately simulate carton <b>clamp</b> <b>handling</b> found in industry. Likewise, the equipment investment is cost prohibitive for those in industry wishing to duplicate such a study. ASTM uses a carton clamp truck as used in industry, but does not specify any specific parameters making repeatability between laboratories and practitioners ambiguous. This study examined whether or not a common ground can be reached; implementing a carton clamp lift truck as found in industry allowing for mobile (hazard course) testing. A modified version of ISTA 3 B will be paired off against ASTM 6055 for evaluating both column and cross stack pallet patterns with a variety of treatments. This study attempted to determine if carton clamps as found in industry are capable and repeatable enough to provide consistent data. Similarly, this study examined the test methodologies effect on load containment via stretch film force, load retention via unitized load slippage, and the effects of ride height and driver interaction. The study sought to understand if these effects are uniform across the unitized load, or if particular layers of the load more affected than others...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [67]- 69) The vibrational {{modes of}} several tennis rackets, including wooden, composite, and wide-body rackets, were determined {{through the use}} of impact modal analysis and a single frequency driving/scanning technique. It was observed that the mode frequencies of the rackets made of new composite materials and of a wide-body construction had a higher stiffness than the traditional wooden racket, as well as higher modal damping. The modes were divided into two catagories: one in which the motion was dominated by the frame, and one in which the motion was dominated by the strings. The dwell time and coefficient of restitution (COR) of a tennis ball was measured for three cases: 1) for the ball being dropped onto a hard surface, 2) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of the rackets with their heads clamped, and 3) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of the rackets with their <b>handles</b> firmly <b>clamped.</b> The COR for a new ball on a hard surface was found to be about 0. 79, and decreased with increasing impact velocity. The CORs for dropping the ball on the rackets with fixed heads were found to be approximately the same for all of the rackets, in the range 0. 90 - 0. 93. For the <b>clamped</b> <b>handle</b> case, the wide-body composite rackets had much higher CORs than the other rackets of about 0. 55 - 0. 53. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

40|$|Boundary {{violation}} is {{a common}} process in optimization problems. This problem {{can be seen in}} Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) and its variants too. An aging based variant of PSO called, PSO with Aging Leader and Challengers(ALC-PSO) overcomes the stagnation problem that existed in PSO. To avoid the problem of random particles, some bound handling mechanisms need to be applied to Particle Swarm Optimization with Aging Leader and Challengers (ALC-PSO) to improve its performance. During the search process, some particles may leave the search boundaries within which the optimal solution is to be found. It becomes essential to handle such boundary constraint violations and some boundary handling strategies are required to be implemented. This paper presents some of these bound handling methods applied to ALC-PSO algorithm and comparisons are made with PSO. These methods include velocity initialization, velocity <b>clamping</b> and bound <b>handling</b> methods. The results are simulated on MATLAB R 2011 b for Ackley benchmark problem...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with table tennis racket used in competitions. Table tennis racket blades are made of an assembly of several wood layers (3, 5 or 7). The layers are of different wood essences, and the fiber orientations of successive layers are perpendicular most of the time. Hence, the blades appear {{to be made of}} a composite material. A finite elements analysis was conducted on the modeling of the racket blade. The questions relative to the detailed modeling of each wood layer is discussed versus the modeling of only one homogenized layer. The model considered orthotropic properties for the wood material. The elasticity orthotropic properties of each of the wood essences used were determined individually. Also, global properties of blade samples were measured. These quantities were then used for the material properties specifications in the FE model. The simulations performed gave the mode shape for the resonance frequencies. In parallel, an experimental analysis was performed to determine the resonance frequencies and the vibration mode shapes for several boundary conditions: racket <b>handle</b> <b>clamped,</b> and racket freely supported. The excitation of the racket blade has been done both by using a shock hammer and by performing a sine sweep with a shaker. The comparisons between vibration modes and frequencies obtained by simulation and experiment permit to validate a FE model for the racket blade. It takes into account the orthotropic property of the composite wood that constitutes the blade...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Only very {{recently}} has modern technology {{been applied to}} the design of the tennis racket. In fact, the tennis player of a few hundred years ago would easily recognize today's racket. Although the literature reveals a surprising number of studies on racket mechanics, little work has been reported on the dynamic stresses involved during tennis play. Such investigations lead naturally to questions of fully stressed design optimization. An AMF/Head "Professional" tennis racket was modeled on an IBMPC-AT using the MSC-PAL finite element code. Experimental verification of the computer model was accomplished in two ways. First, the racket was <b>clamped</b> at the <b>handle,</b> loaded statically, and deflections measured by dial indicator. Next, the racket was instrumented with piezoelectric accelerometers, caused to vibrate in its fundamental mode, and the resulting acceleration-time history recorded on a digital oscilloscope. This data was translated on the IBMPC-AT to reveal the racket's fundamental natural frequency. These experimental results were then compared to the predictions from the finite element model. For dynamic loading, the racket was mounted in a test fixture utilizing a spring-loaded arm. Tennis balls were fired from a pitching machine with the acceleration-time history again recorded on a digital oscilloscope. The data was processed on the IBMPC-AT and used as input for the finite element transient analysis, and dynamic stresses in the racket frame were determined. The results are disscused and future research opportunities are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Vid tillverkning av den kulglass som säljs i glassbarer och på restauranger används en hårdglassmaskin. Glassmaskinen kyler och blandar glassmassan till rätt temperatur och konsistens innan glassen kan serveras. Oceanpower är ett kinesiskt företag som bland annat utvecklar och tillverkar glassmaskiner. Ett nytt konstruktionsförslag har tagits fram för dörren som försluter kylcylindern på deras hårdglassmaskin OPH 42. Genom studiebesök och egna {{analyser}} har förbättringsmöjligheter kunnat lokaliseras hos den befintliga förslutningsdörren. Dessa har främst varit kopplade till hygienen och den dagliga rengörningen av maskinen. En mängd olika koncept för en ny konstruktion av dörren togs fram och utvärderades mot en kravspecifikation. Konceptet som valdes som det mest passande byggde på att ett munstycke monteras på förslutningsdörren med hjälp av en bajonettlåsning vilket kan lossas varje gång glassmaskinen skall rengöras. Således kan det gallerförsedda munstycket diskas för hand eller i maskin istället för att gallret rengörs på plats på maskinen. Förslutningsdörren som tidigare var fäst på maskinfronten med en fast led på ena sidan konstruerades om så att rotationsleden kunde glida i ett spår. Detta gör att dörren kan tryckas på plats rakt framifrån och på så sätt minska belastningen på den gummipackning som tätar förslutningsdörren. Dörren spänns åt med två handtag på var sida för att sprida trycket på packningen. When the gelato sold in {{ice cream}} {{bars and restaurants}} is manufactured, an ice cream machine is used. The ice cream machine cools and mixes the ice cream to the right temperature and consistency {{before it can be}} served. Oceanpower is a Chinese company that, among other things, develops and manufactures ice cream machines. A new design proposal to the door that seals the cooling cylinder on their ice cream machine OPH 42 has been developed. Through interviews, visits and analysis of the ice cream machine has opportunities for improvement been localized in the existing sealing door. These have mainly been linked to hygiene and the daily cleaning of the machine. A variety of concepts for a new design of the door was developed and evaluated against a set of requirements. The concept that was chosen as the most fitting was based on a nozzle mounted on the sealing door with a bayonet lock which can be released each time the ice cream machine should be cleaned. Accordingly, the nozzle can be washed by hand or machine instead of that the grill must be cleaned in place on the machine. The sealing door which was previously attached to the machine front with a fixed point on one side was reconstructed so that the rotation point could slip in a groove. This means that the door can be pushed into place from the front, thus reducing the load on the rubber gasket that seals the door. The door is <b>clamped</b> by two <b>handles</b> on each side to spread the pressure on the gasket...|$|R
