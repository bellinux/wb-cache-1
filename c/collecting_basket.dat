40|$|In Market <b>Basket</b> 2010 we <b>collected</b> food <b>baskets</b> {{from five}} Swedish major grocery chains {{by using a}} {{shopping}} list based on per capita food consumption data derived from production and trade statistics. Two types of baskets were purchased at each grocery chain, mirroring the standard price and the low price assortments. The food baskets were purchased in Uppsala in May-June 2010. Based on the food categories included in the per capita statistics, a detailed shopping list was produced and followed at the purchase event. The baskets were divided into 12 food groups, homogenates of each food group were analysed for selected compounds and the supply, or per capita exposure, was calculated. Both nutrients and toxic compounds were analysed and this report includes data on levels in food groups of total fat and fatty acids, carbohy¬drates (sugars, starch, dietary fibre), vitamin D, essential minerals and toxic metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). For these food components food per capita exposure data were calculated, which were assessed against health-based recomm¬endations of supplies of nutrients and tolerable/acceptable exposures of contaminants. Generally, this market basket study is in most cases satisfactory from a health-based point of view. The differences in levels, both regarding toxic compounds and nutrients, between standard and low price baskets, and between grocery chains (when this was studied) were small. For the analysed nutrients, the changes in per capita exposure compared to earlier market basket studies are generally small, and, with some exceptions, in line with recommended intakes or levels. Regarding potentially toxic compounds in food, the estimated per capita exposures are in many cases well below accep¬table/tolerable intake levels or health-based reference doses, and time trends (when present) are mostly favourable, i. e. decreasing levels compared to earlier market basket studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the intake of organic tin compounds in foodstuffs in the Finnish market basket. The study was conducted by <b>collecting</b> thirteen market <b>baskets</b> from supermarkets and market places in the city of Kuopio, eastern Finland. Altogether 115 different food samples were bought. In each basket foodstuffs were mixed in proportion to their consumption and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry for seven organic tin compounds (mono-, di-, and tributyltin, mono-, di-, and triphenyltin, and dioctyltin). Organotin compounds were detected in only four baskets, with the fish basket containing the largest number of different organotins. The European Food Safety Authority has established a tolerable daily intake of 250 ng/kg body weight for the sum of dibutyltin, tributyltin, triphenyltin, and dioctyltin. According to this study, the daily intake of these compounds was 2. 47 ng/kg body weight, of which 81 % originated from the market basket for fish. This exposure is only 1 % of the tolerable daily intake and thus poses a negligible risk to the average consumer. However, for high fish consumers using fish from contaminated areas, the intake may be much higher...|$|R
40|$|The October-December Quarter was {{dedicated}} to analyzing {{the first two years}} tree planting activities and evaluation of the results. This included the analyses of the species success at each of the sites and quantifying the data for future year determination of research levels. Additional detailed studies have been planned to further quantify total carbon storage accumulation on the research areas. At least 124 acres of new plantings will be established in 2005 to bring the total to 500 acres or more in the study area across the state of Kentucky. During the first 2 years of activities, 172, 000 tree seedlings were planted on 257 acres in eastern Kentucky and 77, 520 seedlings were planted on 119 acres in western Kentucky. The quantities of each species was discussed in the first Annual Report. A monitoring program was implemented to measure treatment effects on above and below ground C and nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes. A sampling strategy was devised that will allow for statistical comparisons of the various species within planting conditions and sites. Seedling heights and diameters are measured for initial status and re-measured on an annual basis. Leaves were harvested and leaf area measurements were performed. They were then dried and weighed and analyzed for C and N. Whole trees were removed to determine biomass levels and to evaluate C and N levels in all components of the trees. Clip plots were taken to determine herbaceous production and litter was <b>collected</b> in <b>baskets</b> and gathered each month to quantify C & N levels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if tapping sugar maple trees alters the {{decomposition}} of their leaf litter. To do this, leaf litter collection baskets were placed in tapped and untapped stands of maple trees in Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill, Vermont. Litter was allowed to <b>collect</b> in the <b>baskets</b> throughout the fall 2016 season, and then the leaves were dried, weighed, and run through a nutrient analyzer. The nutrient analysis yielded percent nitrogen by weight, percent carbon by weight, and carbon nitrogen ratios for each sample. It was found that the leaf litter of untapped samples had significantly more nitrogen and significantly lower carbon nitrogen ratios than the leaf litter collected in the tapped stand. This indicates a likely change in the decomposition of the leaves in each stand, because nutrient ratios have been shown to alter decomposition rates for leaves. One of the implications of slowed decomposition is retarded nutrient cycling, which could lead to a reduction in available nitrogen, a limiting nutrient for sugar maples, in the forest’s soil. More research should be done to determine the origin of the difference in nutrients. Additionally, a longer-term study is necessary to monitor the decomposition rates in this forest...|$|R

Materials and methods: Ureteroscopic lithotripsy was applied in 110 patients with lower ureteral stones between February 2007 and April 2011. The stones were fragmented with a pneumatic lithotripter. In Group 1 (n= 55), ureteroscopic lithotripsy was performed without a guidewire and the stone fragments were not collected. In Group 2 (n= 55), a ureteral guidewire was used and the stone fragments were <b>collected</b> with a <b>basket</b> catheter or forceps. The two groups were compared in terms of operating time, stone free rates, renal colic, and complications. Results: The mean operating time was 17 min (range 12 - 30 min) and 35 min (range 25 - 95 min) for Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Macroscopic hematuria was recorded in 3 patients in Group 1 for 30 hours compared to 8 patients for 48 hours in Group 2.

40|$|Background: The use of {{pesticides}} is essential to pests control in horticultural crops {{for the production of}} an adequate food supply for an increasing world population and for the control of insect-borne diseases. Therefore, pesticide residues in environment and food {{have a negative impact on}} the health of living organisms especially human. In this regard, the present study was carried out for assessment and comparing of propineb residues in Iranian tea and imported consumed tea. Methods: In this experimental study, according to the Cochran's sample size formula, 12 samples from 4 brand of imported tea and 6 samples from 2 brand of Iranian tea were <b>collected</b> from market <b>basket</b> of Hamadan City in 2015. After preparation and processing the samples in the laboratory, propineb residues in samples determined using a spectrophotometric method to a wavelength range of 400 nm in 5 replications. Recovery tests were carried out using pesticide-free samples. Also, all statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package version 19 (Chicago, IL, USA). Results: The mean concentration of propineb residues in Iranian tea samples were 1. 60 ± 0. 27 µg/kg and in imported tea samples were 0. 78 ± 0. 63 µg/kg, respectively and lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL) provided by the European Commission (100 ppb). The results of the comparison of the mean concentration of pesticide residues between Iranian and imported tea samples revealed no statistically significant differences between all the samples together (P= 0. 17). Conclusion: The results showed that the residues of propineb were found in all analyzed tea specimens. But according to the mean concentrations of propineb residues in tea samples marketed in Hamedan City were lower than MRL, therefore, no adverse health effects have been established from controlled consuming of tea. Also, concerning increased use of agricultural inputs especially kind {{of pesticides}} for pest management by farmers, regular periodic monitoring of chemical pollutants content in Iranian and imported tea are recommended for food safety...|$|R
