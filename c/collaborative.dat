5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly <b>collaborative</b> nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the <b>collaborative</b> culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this <b>collaborative</b> culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
