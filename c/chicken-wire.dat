5000|$|The oldest {{sediment}} of each cycle {{was either}} deposited {{in a deep}} sea or in a great brackish lake. The fine sediments deposited on a quiet or deep bottom had perfectly even lamination. As the basin was drying up and the water depth decreased, lamination became more irregular on account of increasing wave agitation. Stromatolite was formed then, when the site of deposition fell within an intertidal zone. The intertidal flat was eventually exposed by the final desiccation, at which time anhydrite was precipitated by saline ground water underlying sabkhas. Suddenly seawater would spill over the Strait of Gibraltar, or {{there would be an}} unusual influx of brackish water from the eastern European lake. The Balearic abyssal plain would then again be under water. The <b>chicken-wire</b> anhydrite would thus be abruptly buried under the fine muds brought in by the next deluge.(Hsu, 1983) ...|$|E

50|$|The Congress of the People, {{consisting}} of around 3000 people, gathered in Kliptown outside Johannesburg on 26 June 1955 {{in a field}} surrounded by <b>chicken-wire</b> {{to give it a}} lawful claim of being a private gathering. The gathering was not prevented from assembling by the South African government. The delegates came {{from all parts of the}} country arriving in Johannesburg via car, bus, bicycle, by foot and horseback. The majority of the people in the gathering where Black Africans, with hundreds of people of Indian descent and about a hundred whites. The object of the congress was to write a Freedom Charter representing the aspirations of the black and white South Africans. The aim was to have a lead speaker present each section of the proposed charter and open the section to general discussion and debate by the gathering. This would not happen due to the intervention by the government and each section would be agreed to but not by general discussion.|$|E
50|$|Thus part of {{the problem}} with uptake may have been an overemphasis on technology, to the {{exclusion}} of socio-economic considerations. In the case of drying, it may be a more appropriate solution to strengthen the capacity of mills and traders to dry than attempt village-level improvements. There is thus a continual need to balance and blend technically ideal procedures andapproaches with social, cultural, and political realities.Past on-farm storage interventions that have proved less than successful have included the promotion of costly driers in W. Africa that fell victim to termites when made with local wood or bamboo and were too expensive when constructed with sawn wood. In the 1980s, there was considerable enthusiasm for the introduction of ferro-cement and brick bins throughout Africa, but these were often found to be too complicated for farmers to construct, and too costly. Small Breeze block silos also experienced construction difficulties and were found to be not economically feasible. Storage cribs made of wood and <b>chicken-wire</b> were introduced by donors but rejected by farmers because sides made of chicken wire showed others the size of each farmer's harvest.|$|E

On Day 23, after spending {{the past few days}} in the Big Brother Bedsit, Emma was officially ejected from the house after much consideration from Big Brother. On Day 25, Housemates were given their new task, in which they had to cast their own body parts in plaster, and attach them to a <b>chicken-wire</b> frame, thus creating the [...] "perfect Housemate." [...] The Housemates finished this task by the following day. On Day 26, Housemates were given a task in which they had to create a film based on their time in the house, with the Housemates portraying one another. Housemates performed their film for Big Brother later that night, dressed in their costumes. On Day 29, it was revealed that Vanessa had become the first official Housemate to be evicted from the house, receiving 86% of the public vote.

The uniformity of response in the lens-coupled detector has a global shading of up to 40 %, while pixel-to-pixel variation owing to a <b>chicken-wire</b> pattern was dominant in the fiber-coupled detector. Apart from the higher transmittance, the fiber-coupled detector has a few characteristics that require attention when it is used for computed tomography, which are browning of the fiber, discontinuity in the image, image distortion, and dark spots in the <b>chicken-wire</b> pattern.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: Chronic {{alcohol abuse}} causes {{steatohepatitis}} with insulin resistance, which impairs hepatocellular growth, sur-vival and metabolism. However, growing evidence supports {{the concept that}} progressive alcohol-related liver injury may be mediated by concurrent mal-signaling through other networks that promote insulin resistance, e. g. pro-inflammatory, pro-ceramide and endo-plasmic reticulum (ER) stress cascades. Methods: Using the Long Evans rat model of chronic ethanol feeding, we characterized the histopathologic and ultrastructural features of steatohepatitis in relation to biochemical and molecular indices of tissue injury, inflam-mation, insulin resistance, dysregulated lipid metabolism and ER stress. Results: Chronic steatohepatitis with early <b>chicken-wire</b> fibrosis was associated with enlargement of mitochondria and disruption of ER structure by electron microscopy, elevated indices of lipid storage, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, increased activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, impaired signaling through the insulin receptor (InR), InR substrate- 1, Akt, ribosomal protein S 6 kinase and proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa, glycogen syn-thase kinase 3 β activation and constitutive up-regulation of ceramide and ER stress-related genes. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated altered ceramide profiles {{with higher levels of}} C 14 and C 18, and reduced C 16 species in ethanol-exposed livers.

40|$|Background: Pure mucinous {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} histologic type of mammary neoplasm and may exist as mixed mucinous-ductal carcinoma. This study aims to describe fine needle aspiration cytology features of {{mucinous carcinoma}} of breast diagnosed in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal over the period of 2 years and to correlate with histological findings. Materials and Methods: There were a total of 8 cases of mucinous carcinoma of breast, diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology in TUTH {{during the period from}} April 2010 to March 2012. The patient’s age, laterality of involvement, fine needle aspiration cytology features, gross and histological findings, type of surgery performed and tumor size were evaluated. Fine needle aspiration cytology smears were evaluated for cellularity, amount of mucin, <b>chicken-wire</b> vasculature and nuclear atypia. Results: Fine needle aspiration cytology provided a pre-operative diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma in 5 cases and mixed mucinous carcinoma-invasive ductal carcinoma in 3 cases. Histological examination showed pure mucinous carcinoma in 3 cases, mixed mucinous carcinoma-invasive ductal carcinoma in 4 cases and mixed cribriform carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in 1 case. Conclusion: Mucinous carcinoma may appear clinically and radiologically benign and fine needle aspiration cytology plays important role in the correct pre-operative diagnosis. Significant nuclear pleomorphism and necrosis, in addition to extracellular mucin suggests mixed mucinous carcinomainvasive ductal carcinoma.

40|$|Uroplakins (UPs) {{are major}} {{differentiation}} products of urothelial umbrella cells and play {{important roles in}} forming the permeability barrier and in the expansion/stabilization of the apical membrane. Further, UPIa serves as a uropathogenic Escherichia coli receptor. Although it is understood that UPs are delivered to the apical membrane via fusiform vesicles (FVs), the mechanisms that regulate this exocytic pathway remain poorly understood. Immunomicroscopy of normal and mutant mouse urothelia show that the UP-delivering FVs contained Rab 8 / 11 and Rab 27 b/Slac 2 -a, which mediate apical transport along actin filaments. Subsequently a Rab 27 b/Slp 2 -a complex mediated FV–membrane anchorage before SNARE-mediated and MAL-facilitated apical fusion. We also show that keratin 20 (K 20), which forms a <b>chicken-wire</b> network ∼ 200 nm below the apical membrane and has hole sizes allowing FV passage, defines a subapical compartment containing FVs primed and strategically located for fusion. Finally, we show that Rab 8 / 11 and Rab 27 b function in the same pathway, Rab 27 b knockout leads to uroplakin and Slp 2 -a destabilization, and Rab 27 b works upstream from MAL. These data support a unifying model in which UP cargoes are targeted for apical insertion via sequential interactions with Rabs and their effectors, SNAREs and MAL, and in which K 20 {{plays a key role}} in regulating vesicular trafficking...|$|E
40|$|Trimesic acid (TMA) and {{alcohols}} {{were recently}} shown to self-assemble into a stable, two-component linear pattern at the solution/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) interface. Away from equilibrium, the TMA/alcohol self-assembled molecular network (SAMN) can coexist with pure-TMA networks. Here, {{we report on}} some novel characteristics of these non-equilibrium TMA structures, investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observe that both the <b>chicken-wire</b> and flower-structure TMA phases can host 'guest' C 60 molecules within their pores, whereas the TMA/alcohol SAMN does not offer any stable adsorption sites for the C 60 molecules. The presence of the C 60 molecules at the solution/solid interface was found to improve the STM image quality. We {{have taken advantage of}} the high-quality imaging conditions to observe unusual TMA bonding geometries at domain boundaries in the TMA/alcohol SAMN. Boundaries between aligned TMA/alcohol domains can give rise to doubled TMA dimer rows in two different configurations, as well as a tripled-TMA row. The boundaries created between non-aligned domains can create geometries that stabilize TMA bonding configurations not observed on surfaces without TMA/alcohol SAMNs, including small regions of the previously predicted 'super flower' TMA bonding geometry and a tertiary structure related to the known TMA phases. These structures are identified as part of a homologic class of TMA bonding motifs, and we explore some {{of the reasons for the}} stabilization of these phases in our multicomponent system...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the clinico-pathological and histological features of Chondroblastoma (CB). Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from 2000 to 2013. Methodology: The histological slides of all {{reported cases of}} CB were retrieved and reviewed for morphological features. Clinical features were noted from surgical pathology reports. Frequency of features was noted. Results: Sixty one cases of CB were identified. Pain {{was the most common}} presenting symptom. The age ranged from 10 to 38 years (mean 20 ± 1. 98 years; M: F 2. 5 : 1) with 61 % patients in the second decade of life. Forty six cases occurred in long tubular bones; distal femur being most common site. Metaphysis, clavicle, temporal bone and metacarpal were also involved. Histologically, all CBs were composed of round to polygonal cells and scattered osteoclast-type multinucleated giant cells and majority had hemosiderin pigment. <b>Chicken-wire</b> calcifications and coarse calcifications were seen in 85 % and 26 % of cases respectively. A spindle cell component was seen in 54 % of cases. ABC-like areas were seen in 10 cases. Mitosis ranged from 1 to 6 / 10 HPFs. Recurrence was seen in 2 cases. Recurrent tumor showed similar morphology when compared with the initial tumor. Conclusion: CB is a benign tumor but has potential for recurrence. Males are more affected, second decade is more common and distal femur is most common site. Metaphysis, clavicle, temporal bone and metacarpal were the rare sites of CB.

The refined lattice constants of the monoclinic unit cell are a = 15. 1 (1) Å; b = 17. 6 (1) Å; c = 5. 290 (4) Å; β = 100. 5 (2) °; space group C 2 /m. The structure, including all reflections, refined {{to a final}} R = 0. 07. Raite occurs in hyperalkaline rocks from the Kola peninsula, Russia. The structure consists of alternating layers of a hexagonal <b>chicken-wire</b> pattern of 6 -membered SiO 4 rings. Tetrahedral apices of a chain of Si six-rings, parallel to the c-axis, alternate in pointing up and down. Two six-ring Si layers are connected by edge-sharing octahedral bands of Na+ and Mn 3 + also parallel to c. The band consists of the alternation of finite Mn–Mn and Na–Mn–Na chains. As {{a consequence of the}} misfit between octahedral and tetrahedral elements, regions of the Si–O layers are arched and form one-dimensional channels bounded by 12 Si tetrahedra and 2 Na octahedra. The channels along the short c-axis in raite are filled by isolated Na(OH,H 2 O) 6 octahedra. The distorted octahedrally coordinated Ti 4 + also resides in the channel and provides the weak linkage of these isolated Na octahedra and the mixed octahedral tetrahedral framework.
