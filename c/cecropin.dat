40|$|AbstractWe {{recently}} {{showed that}} Helicobacter pylori grown on plates produce cecropin-like antibacterial peptides to which H. pylori is resistant. This antibacterial activity was traced to fragments from the N-terminus of ribosomal protein L 1 (Pütsep et al., Nature, April 22, 1999). The evolutionary suggestion from this finding {{has now been}} extended by the synthesis of eight peptides with sequences taken from the N-terminus of ribosomal protein L 1 (RpL 1) of five different species. Two peptides of different length derived from H. pylori RpL 1 showed a potent antibacterial activity, while a peptide with the sequence from Escherichia coli was 20 times less active. Like <b>cecropins</b> the H. pylori peptides were not cytolytic. We suggest that the <b>cecropins</b> have evolved from ribosomal protein L 1 of an ancestral intracellular pathogen that developed to a symbiont ending as an organelle.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Cecropins</b> are {{cationic}} molecules with a {{wide range}} of antimicrobial activities. The native peptide <b>cecropins</b> from Musca domestica (Md-Cec) have antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, cDNA fragments encoding both the Md-Cec-L (62 aa) and Md-Cec-S (40 aa) peptides of Md-Cec were respectively expressed using the pMAL-c 4 x expression vector. High level expression of Md-Cec-L was achieved in Escherichia coli, while expression of Md-Cec-S failed to reach a decent level due to its high level of toxicity to the host cells. Md-Cec-L was expressed as a soluble form using a maltose binding protein (MBP) system, whose product is a MBP-tagged fusion protein, and separated with the carrier amyrose resin. Heterologous expression in E. coli and antimicrobial activity assays showed that both the recombinant fusion protein Md-Cec-L and Md-Cec-S have exhibited antimicrobial activity in vivo; and Md-Cec-L also exhibited antimicrobial activity in vitro.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of actions of melittin and two synthetic peptides, CEME (a cecropin-melittin hybrid) and CEMA, against gram-negative bacteria. CEMA was produced by recombinant DNA procedures and is an analog of CEME with a modified C terminus resulting in two additional positive charges. All three peptides showed good antimicrobial activity against four different gram-negative bacteria, but only CEMA was able to somewhat augment the activity of some conventional antibiotics in synergy studies. Studies using the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae showed that the peptides all possessed the ability to permeabilize bacterial outer membranes to the hydrophobic fluorophor 1 -N-phenylnaphthylamine and the protein lysozyme, with CEMA being the most active. CEMA also had the strongest relative binding affinity for bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). These data collectively indicated that these peptides all cross the outer membrane by the self-promoted uptake pathway and that CEMA is the peptide most effective at accessing this pathway.

Hoffmann confirmed discovery of phagocytosis done by Eli Metchnikoff, through injection of Bacillus thuringiensis and observation of increase of phagocytes. In addition, he showed strong correlation between hematopoiesis and antimicrobial defenses by assessing the susceptibility of an insect to the microbial infection after X-ray treatment. Hoffmann shifts from using grasshopper model to using dipteran species in the 80s. By using Phormia terranovae, Hoffmann and his colleagues {{were able to identify}} 82-residues long antimicrobial polypeptide named Diptericin which was glycine-rich, along with other polypeptides in Drosophila melanogaster such as defensin, <b>cecropin,</b> and attacin. Further molecular genetic analysis revealed that the promoters for the genes encoding these antimicrobial peptides contained DNA sequences similar to the binding elements for NF-κB in mammalian DNA. Dorsal gene, critical in dorso-ventral patterning in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster was also identified to be in this NF-κB family. It was initially speculated by Hoffmann and colleagues that activity of Dorsal was directly linked to the expression of the Diptericin gene. However, it turned out that Diptericin was normally induced even in the loss-of-function Dorsal mutants. Further conducted research showed that Diptericin expression was dependent on the expression of imd gene. Identification of another antifungal peptide named Drosomycin and RNA blots demonstrated that two distinct pathways(Toll, Imd) exist, involving Drosomycin and Diptericin respectively.

40|$|Cecropins {{constitute}} one of {{the largest}} and most potent immune protein families found in insect species with diversified numbers and features. In view of the large number of <b>cecropin</b> proteins existing with much sequence variations among them, an overview of the multigene <b>cecropin</b> family in silkworm Bombyx mori was attempted in this study. <b>Cecropin</b> encodes an inducible 64 residue anti‐bacterial peptide and was clustered into two groups; first group viz. A and second group including B, D, E and Enbocin. <b>Cecropin</b> A consisted of two sub-groups located on chromosome number 6 of B. mori genome. <b>Cecropin</b> B consisted of six sub‐groups, <b>cecropin</b> D and E of one each and Enbocin of two. The second sub‐group formed in tandem array of multigene family locus over a length of 78. 62 kb on chromosome number 26 in B. mori genome and was organized in positive as well as opposite orientation. The results indicated that <b>cecropin</b> B genes were organized in a close cluster with the intergenic sequence ranging from 1366 bp to 23526 bp. Interestingly a distantly related <b>cecropin</b> E was also located within the <b>cecropin</b> B multigene locus.

40|$|Wolbachia are maternally {{transmitted}} {{symbiotic bacteria}} that can spread within insect populations {{because of their}} unique ability to manipulate host reproduction. When introduced to nonnative mosquito hosts, Wolbachia induce resistance {{to a number of}} human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), Plasmodium, and filarial nematodes, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, we have deciphered how Wolbachia infection affects the Aedes aegypti host in inducing resistance to DENV. The microarray assay indicates that transcripts of genes with functions related to immunity and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are up-regulated in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia. Infection with this bacterium leads to induction of oxidative stress and an increased level of reactive oxygen species in its mosquito host. Reactive oxygen species elevation is linked to the activation of the Toll pathway, which is essential in mediating the expression of antioxidants to counterbalance oxidative stress. This immune pathway also is responsible for activation of antimicrobial peptides—defensins and <b>cecropins.</b> We provide evidence that these antimicrobial peptides are involved in inhibition of DENV proliferation in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Utilization of transgenic Ae. aegypti and the RNAi depletion approach has been instrumental in proving the role of defensins and <b>cecropins</b> in the resistance of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to DENV. These results indicate that a symbiotic bacterium can manipulate the host defense system to facilitate its own persistent infection, resulting in a compromise of the mosquito's ability to host human pathogens.
