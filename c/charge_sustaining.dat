The presented route recognition algorithm compares the GPS trajectory of the ongoing trip with stored commuting routes using the well known cross-correlation operation. If a route is recognized the energy management system switches from a charge depleting <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> discharge strategy to a strategy where the battery discharge rate is adapted to the length of the recognized route, thereby decreasing the average discharge current and the resistive losses. The proposed system is evaluated using simulations on one month of logged commuter driving data.

40|$|Abstract—Control {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) that minimize fuel consumption while satisfying a <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> constraint. Since one of the components of an HEV is typically the ubiquitous internal combustion engine, tailpipe emissions must also be considered. This paper uses Shortest-Path Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SP-SDP) to address the minimization of a weighted sum of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions for an HEV equipped with a dual mode Electrically Variable Transmission (EVT) and a catalytic converter. The shortest path formulation of SDP is chosen to directly address the <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> requirement. Using simple methods, an SP-SDP solution required more than eight thousand hours. Using linear programming and duality, an SP-SDP problem is solved in about three hours on a desktop PC. The resulting time-invariant feedback controller reduces tailpipe emissions by more than 50 % when compared to a popular baseline controller.

40|$|The {{drive to}} improve and {{optimize}} hybrid vehicle performance is increasing with the growing market of hybrids. This research is conducted on a student developed parallel split hybrid architecture. The architecture features an engine, transmission and two electric motors; one pre-transmission and one post-transmission. In order to complete this project, UWAFT has selected an 850 cc two-cylinder turbocharged engine that will operate on 85 % ethanol (E 85) in a plug-in hybrid parallel split powertrain configuration. As most production hybrids have four-cylinder engines, this powertrain is seen as further electrification of hybrid electric vehicles. Different tests are conducted to demonstrate how the engine would operate in the vehicle. The results show that by running E 85, the engine is able to produce up to 58 % of the specified power rating with its first tune and provided validation for the capability of producing power in parallel operation. Additionally the model more accurately represents the speed matching capabilities of the engine. The control strategy operates the powertrain components in a series, parallel, and all electric power flow. Control strategies for these three power flows are compared through optimization of efficiencies within the powertrain. The resulting control strategy optimizations used by the team have increased the vehicle’s charge depleting range by 27. 7 %., while decreasing energy consumption by 13. 8 %. Additionally it produced a 30. 5 % increase in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent in <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> mode, increasing total range by 30. 2 %. Inspection of cell internal resistance (Rint) derived by the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests indicates that Rint {{is a function of}} relative capacity (state of charge, or SOC), thus some SOC ranges are more efficient than others. Therefore energy losses can be minimized by placing <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> operation in a more efficient SOC range. This creates three operational stages; the initial charge depleting stage to an efficient SOC, a <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> stage until a recharge station is within reach, and a final charge depleting stage until arrival. When coupled with a known drive distance, this three segment Internal Resistance Based (IRB) control strategy increases the extended range electric vehicle (EREV) net battery efficiency from 96. 8 to 97. 3 % with an associated 14 % decrease in energy losses across the urban domestic drive schedule. Indirect benefits include an increased active SOC range, decreased urban emissions, and decreased waste heat generation, meeting the goals of Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions...|$|E

A novel feedback based controller for the <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> mode is proposed to facilitate distributed controller design for battery CSM. The method based on sensitivity analysis of the control signals with respect to the battery hardware parameter is introduced to define the controller distribution architecture.

Various real-time controls have been recently developed. As each study is performed in a specific context, a comparative analysis is critically needed to point out their pros and cons. This paper proposes a comparison between three promising real-time strategies: adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), optimal control law (OCL), and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). Two offline algorithms are used as benchmark: Pontryagin's minimum principle and dynamic programming. Implementation and parameters setting issues are discussed for each strategy. The real-time strategies robustness is then evaluated over several types of driving cycles and a statistical analysis is conducted using random cycles generated by Markov process. Simulation results show that OCL needs improvement. A-ECMS reaches the best fuel saving performance when used with parameter sets adjusted to the driving environment, while SDP better respects the <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> constraint...|$|E
30|$|A {{subset of}} EVs, called plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs), {{are equipped with}} both electric motor (EM) and internal combustion engine (ICE). PHEVs usually have two operation modes: charge depleting (CD) and <b>charge</b> <b>sustaining</b> (CS) (Zhang and Vahid 2010). When operated at CD mode, PHEVs mainly utilize batteries and operate like all-electric vehicles (Larminie and Lowry 2003). After depleting batteries, PHEVs switch to CS mode and are driven by the ICE like conventional vehicles. By this hybridization, PHEVs get a comparable driving range to conventional vehicles, while become less clean than all-electric vehicles. Current PHEVs usually have a battery with capacity of 2 – 20  KWh and can be operated at CD mode for only tens of kilometers (Morrow et al. 2008). After this, they will enter CS mode if without recharging batteries, and thus starting to cause much emissions. This paper studies the routing problem that aims at reducing the emissions.|$|E
