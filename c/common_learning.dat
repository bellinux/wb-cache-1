25|$|Biofeedback {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that involves measuring a subject's quantifiable bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, sweat gland activity, and muscle tension, conveying the information to the patient in real-time. This raises the patient's awareness and conscious control of his or her unconscious physiological activities. Neal Miller is generally considered the father of modern-day biofeedback. Miller theorized the basic principles of biofeedback by applying his theory that classical and operant conditioning were both the result of a <b>common</b> <b>learning</b> principle in 1961. Miller hypothesized that any measurable physiological behavior within the human body would respond in some way to voluntary control.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic plasticity. One study sought to teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days {{to teach them to}} distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted to determine if the same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for synaptic plasticity also applied to nonsynaptic plasticity affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity share <b>common</b> <b>learning</b> rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity synergistically form a coherent engram to store memory traces.|$|E

40|$|Many {{institutions}} of higher education are designing spaces to facilitate learning. Libraries have created information or <b>learning</b> <b>commons</b> to support this activity. This article draws from the literature and best practices to explore this new direction. Academic libraries have focused on student learning and the teaching of skills and strategies that develop information literacy competency. Although there is an assumption that <b>learning</b> <b>commons</b> facilitate student <b>learning,</b> {{there is a need to}} more closely connect this new environment with information literacy and pedagogy and to demonstrate its merits in enhancing learning. A basic premise is that each <b>learning</b> <b>commons</b> that is planned well will be unique. That is because a key component of the planning process is to understand the campus perspective, student learning styles and preferences, and the role of the campus library. The combination of those factors will result in a <b>learning</b> <b>commons</b> that supports its own institutional priorities and profile in a specialized manner. The article is in the form of a panel discussion that explores possible relationships between the <b>learning</b> <b>commons</b> and student <b>learning,</b> pedagogy, and information literacy.
