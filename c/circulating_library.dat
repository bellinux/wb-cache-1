50|$|<b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> {{rented out}} bestsellers in large numbers, {{allowing}} publishers and authors {{to increase their}} readership and increase their earnings, respectively. Publishers and <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> became decreasingly dependent on {{each other in the}} nineteenth century for their mutual profit. <b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> also influenced book publishers to keep producing expensive volume-based books instead of a single-volume format (see Three-volume novel). However, when bestselling fiction titles went out of fashion quickly, many <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> were left with inventory they could neither sell nor rent out. This {{is one of the reasons}} why <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries,</b> such as Charles Edward Mudie, were eventually forced to close their doors in response to cheaper alternatives.|$|R
50|$|Much like paperbacks of today, many of {{the novels}} in <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> were unbound. At this period of time, many people chose to bind their books in leather. Many <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> skipped this process. <b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> {{were not in the}} {{business}} of preserving books; their owners wanted to lend books as many times as they possibly could. <b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> had ushered in a completely new way of reading. Reading was no longer simply an academic pursuit or an attempt to gain spiritual guidance. Reading became a social activity. Many <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> were attached to the shops of milliners or drapers. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends as coffee shops do today.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> in the 18th century, by booksellers and publishers provided {{a means of}} gaining profit and creating social centers within the community. The <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> not only provided a place to sell books, but also a place to lend books for a price. These <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> provided a variety of materials including the increasingly popular novels. Although the <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> filled {{an important role in}} society, members of the middle and upper classes often looked down upon these libraries that regularly sold material from their collections and provided materials that were less sophisticated.|$|R

In 1892 the society conveyed the Atheneum property to the village with the condition that it maintain, in perpetuity, a library and reading room in the building and construct the building within five years.|$|E
50|$|One {{difference}} between <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> and other libraries was that their collection reflected public demand, {{which led to}} larger collections of fiction. When circulation decreased, the books were sold. Another difference was the customers were often female. These factors contributed to the popularity of <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries.</b> <b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> {{were the first to}} serve women and actively seek out their patronage. It was not coincidence that some of these libraries were located in millinery and stationary stores and midwives' offices.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the ways people procured books had changed, and <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> were no longer the favored way of obtaining them. The biggest contributor to the contraction of <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> was reduced the price of books, which made them more accessible to the public, so that they were less reliant on <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries.</b> In an attempt to compensate for the loss of revenue, the subscription fees were lessened to daily rates down from monthly or yearly ones.|$|R

After the Main Building was rebuilt, a new library was established with a budget of $500 and comprised 16,000 volumes. In 1888, during the golden jubilee of Fr.

However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the <b>circulating</b> <b>library</b> which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria.

Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{complicated}} to precisely define <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> and specifically what separates them from {{other types of}} libraries. In the time period of <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries,</b> there were other libraries, such as subscription libraries, that operated {{in a similar fashion}} but were not the same. However, when both types of libraries were commonplace, the terms <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> and subscription libraries “were completely interchangeable." [...] It was logical that they were considered to be the same since both <b>libraries</b> <b>circulated</b> books and charged a subscription fee. The libraries differed in their intent. Circulating libraries’ intent was financial gain, and subscription libraries intended to obtain literary and scholarly works to share with others.|$|R
50|$|<b>Circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> {{offered an}} {{alternative}} to the large number of readers who could not afford the price of new books in the nineteenth century but also desired to quench their desire for new material. Many <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> were perceived as the provider of sensational novels to a female clientele but that was not always the case. Many private <b>circulating</b> <b>libraries</b> in Europe were created for scientific and/or literary audiences. In Britain, readers in the middle classes depended on these institutions to provide access to the latest fiction novels that required a substantial subscription that many lower class readers couldn't afford.|$|R

500|$|Despite his meager accommodations, Morris {{decided to}} make the best of his {{imprisonment}} in Philadelphia by negotiating with his jailors to borrow books from the so-called <b>circulating</b> <b>library</b> recently established by Benjamin Franklin in that city. One historian points to this time as when Morris was exposed to the philosophers that would be so influential in his later life as an educator: [...] "From Milton, James Morris absorbed ideas in favor of healthy exercises to develop both body and mind at the same time; from Rollin, the danger of following custom blindly rather than reason; and form Locke, the novel idea that the English language was as important as Latin and Greek." ...|$|E

Fillmore was relegated to menial labor; unhappy at not learning any skills, he left Hungerford's employ. [...] His father then placed him in the same trade at a mill in New Hope. [...] Seeking to better himself, Millard Fillmore bought a share in a <b>circulating</b> <b>library,</b> and read all the books he could.

Thomas Hookham, the publisher of all Peacock's early writings, was possibly responsible for the introduction.
