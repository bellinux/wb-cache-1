I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one <b>can</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

[...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead.

500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> to men as well".|$|E
500|$|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter {{was well}} {{received}} by Harry Potter fans. Matt Blum of Wired stated [...] "every detail is finely crafted {{to enhance the}} experience". An Orlando Sentinel article stated [...] "muggles will love their Harry Potter adventure" [...] but identifies {{the need for the}} park to offer Universal Express Passes due to large crowds. It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Lisa Minot, from The Sun, stated [...] "after a sneak peek, I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is the most faithful recreation of JK Rowling's books and movies ever seen. Fans will be in heaven." [...] Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old." [...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy the heck out of a visit to the Wizarding World". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was [...] "utterly mad" [...] to leave it to the Americans [...] "to make money from a great British invention." ...|$|E

The core issue in the debate over intrinsic value of animals remains between utilitarianists and deontologists.|$|R

2500|$|It {{can also}} be {{regarded}} as ancient history, [...] "part of a broader spectrum of originally anonymous, history-like ancient Near Eastern narratives." [...] It is frequently called myth in scholarly writings, {{but there is no}} agreement on how [...] "myth" [...] is to be defined, and so while Brevard Childs famously suggested that the author of Genesis 1–11 [...] "demythologised" [...] his narrative, meaning that he removed from his sources (the Babylonian myths) those elements which did not fit with his own faith, others <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is entirely mythical.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Emilia Eberle, a Romanian {{national}} team member during the Károlyi coaching era, gave {{an interview to}} KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, claiming that while {{she was on the}} {{national team}}, both Béla and Márta Károlyi regularly beat her and her teammates for mistakes they made in practice or competition. [...] "In one word, I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was brutal," [...] she told KCRA. Other Romanian team members, including Ecaterina Szabo and Rodica Dunca, as well as Géza Pozsár, the team choreographer who defected with the Károlyis, have made similar charges of physical abuse. When asked in 2008 to comment on the allegations, Béla said: [...] "I ignore it. I'm not even commenting. These people are really trash." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on that sentiment, {{and said}} [...] "It’s a very cynically romantic text about love, {{and how we}} behave, and how we’re expected to behave. It’s a party, but there’s something darker there as well". Inspired by the exposing nature of film, Whedon decided to infuse a recurring motif of sexuality, [...] "...because it’s a visual medium. You <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> or you can show it. [...] There’s an element to it, of debauchery, that was fun for a time {{but then it was}} just sort of dark".

2500|$|It was announced, after airing {{thirteen}} episodes, {{that the}} new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013. Mr. Tatematsu, General Manager of Editing, explained, "Iron Chef is a high quality show and we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is FujiTV's treasure. Currently we are struggling for the ratings.

All three Iron Chefs were paired with an American challenger, and then for a fourth round, all six competed. Currently, there are no plans for any more Iron Chef specials.|$|E
2500|$|The Ich bin ein Berliner {{speech is}} in part derived from a speech Kennedy gave at a Civic Reception on May 4, 1962, in New Orleans; there also he used the phrase civis Romanus sum by saying [...] "Two {{thousand}} years ago the proudest boast was to say, [...] "I am a citizen of Rome." [...] Today, I believe, in 1962 the proudest boast is to say, [...] "I am {{a citizen of the}} United States." [...] And {{it is not enough to}} merely say it; we must live it. Anyone <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> But Americans who serve today in West Berlin—your sons and brothers -- are the Americans who are bearing the great burden." [...] The phrases [...] "I am a Berliner" [...] and [...] "I am proud to be in Berlin" [...] were typed already a week before the speech on a list of expressions to be used, including a phonetic transcription of the German translation. Such transcriptions are also found in the third draft of the speech (in Kennedy's own handwriting), from June 25. The final typed version of the speech does not contain the transcriptions, which are added by hand by Kennedy himself.|$|E
