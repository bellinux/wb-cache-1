25|$|In {{recent times}} more {{systematic}} hill lists {{have been produced}} based upon topographical prominence and height, rather than mere visual appeal. Most relevant to <b>Crinkle</b> Crags are the lists of Hewitts and Nuttalls. These variously list the summit, the first <b>Crinkle</b> (<b>Crinkle</b> Crags South Top), and two tops on Shelter Crags (Shelter Crags and Shelter Crags North Top), but exclude the other three Crinkles.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{the summit}} {{to the south}} the ridge descends over Stonesty Pike and Little Stand (a Nuttall) to the Duddon Valley at Cockley Beck. Two further ridges branch out from <b>Crinkle</b> Crags {{on either side of}} the summit, before turning south to run {{parallel}} to Little Stand. On the west, across the marshy trench of Moasdale is Hard Knott. To the east an initially indistinct ridge firms up on the traverse to Cold Pike. Between Cold Pike and <b>Crinkle</b> Crags, but generally included as part of the latter is the further Nuttall of Great Knott.|$|E

25|$|The {{summit is}} formed from the tuff, lapilli-tuff and breccia of the Lingmell Formation. The eastern slopes display the rhyolitic rocks of the Long Top Member and <b>Crinkle</b> Member. The crags {{on the western}} face are {{outcrops}} of the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation.|$|E
25|$|The crags {{on either}} face of Base Brown display rocks of the <b>Crinkle</b> Member of the Airy's Bridge Formation. This {{consists}} mainly of welded rhyolitic lapilli-tuff and tuff, with some breccia. There are also minor intrusions of andesite above Styhead Gill. The summit dome is overlain by till.|$|E
25|$|The {{headwaters}} of the River Esk and the Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of <b>Crinkle</b> Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for , finally meeting the sea {{on the slopes of}} Black Combe. From <b>Crinkle</b> Crags the first fell on this ridge is Hard Knott, followed by Harter Fell and Green Crag. Alfred Wainwright did not include the remainder of the ridge in his influential ‘’Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells’’, but later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow, Black Combe and the low hills around Devoke Water to their main volumes. Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.|$|E

The Langdale face displays several strata: from the top The Lingmell Formation, <b>Crinkle</b> Member and Bad Step Tuff. These are composed, respectively, of tuff, lapilli-tuff and breccia; rhyolitic tuff and breccia; and rhyolitic lava-like tuff.|$|E
25|$|Southward of Bowfell {{the ridge}} falls steeply to Three Tarns, the col {{separating}} it from <b>Crinkle</b> Crags.

40|$|Marine species {{generally}} have large population sizes, continuous distributions and high dispersal capacity. Despite this, {{they are often}} subdivided into separate populations, which are the basic units of fisheries management. For example, populations of some fisheries species across the deep water of the Timor Trench are genetically different, inferring minimal movement and interbreeding. When connectivity {{is higher than the}} Timor Trench example, but not so high that the populations become one, connectivity between populations is <b>crinkled.</b> <b>Crinkled</b> connectivity occurs when migration is above the threshold required to link populations genetically, but below the threshold for demographic links. In future, genetic estimates of connectivity over <b>crinkled</b> links could be uniquely combined with other data, such as estimates of population size and tagging and tracking data, to quantify demographic connectedness between these types of populations. Elasmobranch species may be ideal targets for this research because connectivity between populations {{is more likely to be}} <b>crinkled</b> than for finfish species. Fisheries stock-assessment models could be strengthened with estimates of connectivity to improve the strategic and sustainable harvesting of biological resources...|$|R
25|$|The Southern Fells {{include the}} highest ground in England, a {{horseshoe}} which begins with Scafell and Scafell Pike {{in the west}} and then curves around the north of Upper Eskdale to take in Great End, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and <b>Crinkle</b> Crags. As the name suggests, Esk Pike stands {{at the head of the}} valley, although it is not the highest of these fells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crinkle</b> Crags is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District in {{the county}} of Cumbria. It forms part of two major rings of mountains, {{surrounding}} the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge {{is a series of}} five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.|$|E
25|$|Lying on {{the edge}} of the Scafell Syncline, the various strata dip to the east. The summit area is formed from a dacite lava flow (Scafell Dacite), {{directly}} underlain by the Lingmell Formation. This tuff, lapilli tuff and breccia outcrops a little to the west of the summit. Around Beck Head is evidence of the <b>Crinkle</b> Member, welded rhyolitic tuff and lapilli-tuff with some breccia. A dyke of andesite and hybridised andesite porphyry is responsible for Kern Knotts.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} a nonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity defined via Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT) with a non-trivial measure {{term in the}} path integral. We are motivated to revisit this older formulation of dynamical triangulations by hints from renormalization group approaches that gravity may be asymptotically safe and {{by the emergence of}} a semiclassical phase in causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). We study the phase diagram of this model and identify the two phases that are well known from previous work: the branched polymer phase and the collapsed phase. We verify that the order of the phase transition dividing the branched polymer phase from the collapsed phase is almost certainly first-order. The nontrivial measure term enlarges the phase diagram, allowing us to explore a region of the phase diagram that has been dubbed the <b>crinkled</b> region. Although the collapsed and branched polymer phases have been studied extensively in the literature, the <b>crinkled</b> region has not received the same scrutiny. We find that the <b>crinkled</b> region is likely a part of the collapsed phase with particularly large finite-size effects. Intriguingly, the behavior of the spectral dimension in the <b>crinkled</b> region at small volumes {{is similar to that of}} CDT, as first reported in arXiv: 1104. 5505, but for sufficiently large volumes the <b>crinkled</b> region does not appear to have 4 -dimensional semiclassical features. Thus, we find that the <b>crinkled</b> region of the EDT formulation does not share the good features of the extended phase of CDT, as we first suggested in arXiv: 1104. 5505. This agrees with the recent results of arXiv: 1307. 2270, in which the authors used a somewhat different discretization of EDT from the one presented here. Comment: 36 pages, 27 figures.

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the fell, in excess of a mile square, is soft, peaty and drab. The {{exception}} is the ridge itself, which is considerably wetter. A fence runs along the ridge, a useful guide in mist and occasionally necessary for bog bouncing. The summit is set on a small rock platform with an Ordnance Survey column. A rocky knoll (called Man) stands {{on the other side of}} the fence. The views are extensive due to the central location and a lack of higher neighbours. The Helvellyn range is seen end to end, together with a panorama of high fells on the other side of the ridge from <b>Crinkle</b> Crags in the south to Blencathra in the north.|$|E
25|$|The Band {{provides}} the most popular means of ascent. Other routes from Langdale climb via Rossett Gill and Three Tarns. Bowfell can be reached from Stonethwaite via Angle Tarn although the way is long. Equally time-consuming although perhaps more picturesque is the long march up Eskdale from Brotherikeld, gaining the ridge at either Ore Gap or Three Tarns. Indirect climbs can also be made via <b>Crinkle</b> Crags, Esk Pike or Rossett Pike. The summit can also be reached {{from the top of}} Wrynose Pass by following the Right of Way starting close to the Three Shire Stone and heading in a northwesterly direction. The route takes in the summits of Cold Pike and Long Top.|$|E
25|$|Pike of Stickle rises steeply from Langdale, {{culminating}} in a narrow tapering summit which gives excellent views {{of the head of}} the valley, the fells of Bow Fell and <b>Crinkle</b> Crags showing well. The fell is usually climbed from Great Langdale with either the New or Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotels as the starting points. There are a number of routes, the most common ascent being a path that slants across the hillside from the New hotel passing between Thorn Crag and Gimmer Crag and then turning left at the col. A quieter route is by Troughton Beck; the walker starts from the Old hotel and goes four kilometres (2½ miles) towards the head of the valley before bearing right and following a zigzag path at the side of Troughton Beck. This route gives the walker an unusual view of the fell from this unfrequented side. There is another route directly up the Stickle Stone Shoot: this route is steep and has become severely eroded in recent years and is no longer recommended as a means of ascent or descent. The Langdale or Borrowdale sides of Stake Pass can also be used, giving access onto Martcrag Moor.|$|E
