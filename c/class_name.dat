5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the <b>class</b> <b>name</b> below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E

25|$|Ordinarily, when a {{function}} in a derived class overrides {{a function}} in a base class, the function to call {{is determined by the}} type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called dynamic dispatch. Virtual member functions or methods allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using virtual function tables. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified <b>class</b> <b>name</b> before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.|$|E

25|$|The Anzac class (also {{identified}} as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type) is a ship class of ten frigates; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). During the 1980s, the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate, and settled {{on the idea of}} modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions. Around the same time, the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities. A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand's nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations, particularly Australia. As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities, the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition. The project name (and later, the <b>class</b> <b>name)</b> is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War.|$|E

In India, locomotives are classified according to their gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The <b>class</b> <b>name</b> includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power, Diesel or Alternating current (Electric), and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic {{for which they are}} suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme, and even all diesel locos are not covered.

60|$|But though general {{names are}} {{imposed by the}} vulgar without any more {{definite}} connotation {{than that of a}} vague resemblance; general propositions come in time to be made, in which predicates are applied to those names, that is, general assertions are made concerning the whole of the things which are denoted by the name. And since by each of these propositions some attribute, more or less precisely conceived, is of course predicated, the ideas of these various attributes thus become associated with the name, and in a sort of uncertain way it comes to connote them; there is a hesitation to apply the name in any new case in which any of the attributes familiarly predicated of the class do not exist. And thus, to common minds, the propositions which they are in the habit of hearing or uttering concerning a class make up in a loose way a sort of connotation for the <b>class</b> <b>name.</b> Let us take, for instance, the word Civilized. How few could be found, even among the most educated persons, who would undertake to say exactly what the term Civilized connotes. Yet there is a feeling in the minds of all who use it, that they are using it with a meaning; and this meaning is made up, in a confused manner, of every thing which they have heard or read that civilized men or civilized communities are, or may be expected to be.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the minor premise in its formal shape, the minor as [...] it stands in the syllogism, predicating of Socrates a {{definite}} class [...] name, I readily admit {{that it is no}} more a necessary part of [...] reasoning than the major. When there is a major, doing its work by [...] means of a <b>class</b> <b>name,</b> minors are needed to interpret it: but [...] reasoning can be carried on without either the one or the other. [...] They are not the conditions of reasoning, but a precaution against [...] erroneous reasoning. The only minor premise necessary to reasoning [...] in the example under consideration, is, Socrates is like A, B, C, [...] and the other individuals who are known to have died. And this is [...] the only universal type of that step in the reasoning process which [...] is represented by the minor. Experience, however, of the uncertainty [...] of this loose mode of inference, teaches the expediency of [...] determining beforehand what kind of likeness to the cases [...] observed, is necessary to bring an unobserved case within the same [...] predicate; and {{the answer to this question}} is the major. The minor [...] then identifies the precise kind of likeness possessed by Socrates, [...] as being the kind required by the formula. Thus the syllogistic [...] major and the syllogistic minor start into existence together, and [...] are called forth by the same exigency. When we conclude from [...] personal experience without referring to any record—to any general [...] theorems, either written, or traditional, or mentally registered by [...] ourselves as conclusions of our own drawing—we do not use, in our [...] thoughts, either a major or a minor, such as the syllogism puts into [...] words. When, however, we revise this rough inference from [...] particulars to particulars, and substitute a careful one, the [...] revision consists in selecting two syllogistic premises. But this [...] neither alters nor adds to the evidence we had before; it only puts [...] us in a better position for judging whether our inference from [...] particulars to particulars is well grounded.|$|E
