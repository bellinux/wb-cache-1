25|$|Frustrated {{with what}} Bahlman called the “timid sort of nature” of GLAAD’s and CLGR’s tactics {{in the face}} of the AIDS crisis, Robinson and Noro {{determined}} that they needed to start a new group. In the late summer of 1986, in the wake of the Supreme Court of the United States’ ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, they began meeting with a small group of friends at Bahlman’s apartment. In addition to Robinson, Noro, and Bahlman, early participants included Henry Yaeger Jean Elizabeth Glass Eric Perez, and Petrelis. The group would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> itself the Lavender Hill Mob, after a well-known comic British film — a title they believed captured the personality of the group and its actions: gay, confrontational, creative, and humorous.|$|E

500|$|In 1689, Arsenije III, the Archbishop of Peć, incited Serbs in Kosovo, Macedonia and the Sandžak to {{revolt against}} the Ottoman Empire and support a Habsburg {{incursion}} into the Balkans. On 2 January 1690, the Habsburgs and Serbs were defeated in battle at the Kačanik Gorge. The Habsburgs began to retreat, prompting thousands of Serb villagers {{to leave their homes}} and flee north fearing Ottoman reprisals. In Serbian historiography, this event {{came to be known as}} the Great Serb Migration. Between 30,000 and 40,000 Serb refugees streamed into Habsburg-held Vojvodina, north of the Danube River, and settled there. The migrants would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the regions they had formerly inhabited Old Serbia, and dubbed their adopted homeland [...] "new Serbia". Tim Judah, a journalist specializing in the Balkans, describes the exodus as one of the most traumatic events in Serbian history.|$|E

2500|$|The Walking Dead occurs {{simultaneously}} with the events {{from the original}} comic series, where a zombie apocalypse overwhelms much of society. Characters in the game <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the zombies [...] "walkers", due to the slowness of their movement. Although the survivors initially think that being bitten by a zombie {{is the only way}} to become infected, it is later discovered that one becomes a zombie upon death irrespective of the manner in which one dies; only by damaging the brain can the reanimation be stopped. As with the comic and television series, the game's events occur in the state of Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|Owin {{returned}} {{a little later}} and saw Chad privately. He asked about the singing. Chad {{told him that he}} must keep it to himself for the time being: angels had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him to his heavenly reward, and in seven days they would return to fetch him. So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days– on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede writes that: [...] "he had always looked forward to this day– or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord". Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor that someone in Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad's soul and returning with it to heaven. Significantly, with the heavenly host was Cedd. Bede was not sure whether or not the vision was actually Egbert's own.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{linguistics}} has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{the resulting}} variety [...] "Standard Modern Greek" [...] to {{distinguish it from}} the pure original Demotic of earlier literature and traditional vernacular speech. Greek authors sometimes use the term [...] "Modern Greek Koiné" [...] (Νεοελληνική Κοινή Neoellinikí Koiní, literally 'Common Modern Greek'), reviving the term koiné that otherwise refers to the [...] "common" [...] form of post-classical Ancient Greek; according to these scholars, Modern Greek Koiné is the [...] "supra-dialect product of the composition of both the Demotic and Katharevousa." [...] Indeed, Standard Modern Greek has incorporated {{a large amount of}} vocabulary from the learned tradition, especially through the registers of academic discourse, politics, technology and religion; together with these, it has incorporated a number of morphological features associated with their inflectional paradigms, as well as some phonological features not originally found in pure Demotic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of what}} {{it meant}} to be noble went through a radical {{transformation}} from the 16th to the 17th centuries. [...] Through contact with the Italian Renaissance and their concept of the perfect courtier (Baldassare Castiglione), the rude warrior class was remodeled into what the 17th century would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> l'honnête homme ('the honest or upright man'), among whose chief virtues were eloquent speech, skill at dance, refinement of manners, appreciation of the arts, intellectual curiosity, wit, a spiritual or platonic attitude in love, and the ability to write poetry. [...] Most notable of noble values are the aristocratic obsession with [...] "glory" [...] (la gloire) and majesty (la grandeur) and the spectacle of power, prestige, and luxury. [...] For example, Pierre Corneille's noble heroes have been criticised by modern readers who have seen their actions as vainglorious, criminal, or hubristic; aristocratic spectators of the period would have seen many of these same actions as representative of their noble station.|$|E

[...] The Standing Committee members agreed to convene in the evening to discuss how to implement martial law. [...] That night, the five Standing Committee members could not agree on whether to impose martial law, with Li Peng and Yao Yilin in support, Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili in opposition and Qiao Shi abstaining. [...] Zhao offered to resign as Party General Secretary, but was dissuaded by Yang and asked for three days of sick leave. [...] Subsequently, Zhao Ziyang ceased to have political influence.|$|E
