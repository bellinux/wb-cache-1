Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something).

The central question of this thesis is how we ought to shape jobs to make them more ‘meaningful’, with a particular focus on the role that Kant’s notion of humanity can play in responding to this question. It will be argued that ‘humanity’ can be used for justifying a new way of working that is focussed on the employees’ ability to direct his own life. To argue that ‘humanity’ can serve this purpose, the meaning of ‘humanity’ will be explored within the context of Kant’s humanity formula. The outcomes of this exploration will then be used to form demandable requirements for corporations to live up to in order to respect their employees. Examples of feasible business practises will be given for support and to explain what is meant by the requirements. The last hurdle is to show what remains of these requirements in terms of enforceable demands justified by Kant’s political philosophy, focusing on his right to freedom. The consistent use of Kant’s humanity formula will lead us to conclude that requirements for meaningful work can justifiably be demanded, both ethically and politically...|$|R
40|$|A company {{reconstruction}} is {{an alternative}} procedure, for companies in payment difficulty, to receivership. Those {{in any kind of}} relationship with the ailing company ends up in a dif- ficult situation at a company reconstruction, as in any case when someone is in financial difficulties. Not only is there a risk for the providers not to get paid, the costumers are also at risk if the reconstruction company does not fulfil their agreement. These kinds of rela- tionships are controlled by a contractual relationship. Therefore the regulation has to con- tain how to deal with these contracts when the ailing company no longer can fulfil its obli- gations of the contract. In combination with this, the number of franchise companies is growing in Sweden. Franchise is where a franchisor grants a franchisee intellectual property rights for a fee. In a company reconstruction the franchise relationship becomes another important aspect to take into account because of the degree of dependence between the franchisor and the franchisee. Further the obligations are more comprehensive in the fran- chise agreement than in many other agreements. The question here is how a franchise rela- tionship is affected by a company reconstruction of the other party. This has two perspec- tives; first the contractual relationship between the parties, and second how their coopera- tion affects the end of the reconstruction. The <b>contractual</b> <b>matter</b> in this case is not statutory in Sweden. Therefore analogies are used in these kind of situations. The conclusion of this thesis is that problems occurs and for that reason an extended statutory regarding franchise relationships would be beneficial. On the other hand, the franchise relationship can be beneficial when one of the parties is in a company reconstruction. The close cooperation and support between the parties weighs out the disadvantages in this case. ...|$|R

40|$|Speaking of good {{medicine}} {{is a way}} to underline the moral dimension of the medical act and to subtract it both from any legalism and relativism of a subjective choice. In fact, deontology is exposed to a double risk: on the one hand, it can be reduced to private conscience and therefore to a scale of values of the doctor; on the other hand, it can be completely transformed and be assimilated into a code of positive laws. In the former case, the space for the decision-making autonomy of the doctor or the patient expands beyond any justifiable limit. In the latter case, deontology, which is actually an asymmetric interpersonal relation, becomes a purely <b>contractual</b> <b>matter,</b> where positive law is considered the only means for protecting oneself from risks and for solving any contentious by using legal proceeding. Neither the one nor the other concept of deontology consider that the professionalism of the doctor and the vulnerability of the patient move within a normative framework with conditions that are necessary but not sufficient, which has to be completed and justified in the light of virtue ethics. Therefore, Paul Ricoeur’s distinction between what is just, legal, and good proves to be of great importance, in particular in those uncertain and conflicting situations that demand delicate decisions from the doctor. It is in this context that prudence or phrónesis makes its appearance. In fact, prudence is indispensable to formulate a judgment that tends towards the best possible decision under specific circumstances, combining the rigor of the general norm with the singularity of the concrete situation. In his essays dedicated to medical art, Ricoeur is outlining something like a real architecture of therapeutic alliance, articulated in three moments: prudential, deontological, and theological. Prudential judgment is inseparable from deontology, which guarantees support and protects the vulnerability of the therapeutic alliance threatened by various requests. On the other hand, medical ethics is not justified if it is not based on an anthropological understanding respectful of the personal integrity and dignity of the patient...|$|R
40|$|The limited {{liability}} company {{is the most common}} society type on Brazil and it is gaining force on the United States. The possibility of vote restriction is a controversal theme within it. The goal of the present article is to analyze the admissibility of the preferential corporate participation, on a comparative analysis between the law systems of Brazil and USA. The method used consists on building a bibliographical reference base of both systems. It is argued that, in Brazil, the CC/ 02, art. 1. 055, caput, discuss about the theme on a simple and generic way, however, on the previewed quoruns, it doesn't allow the use of preferential quotas with no rights to vote. Not only that, the DNRC manifested for the inviability of the preferential quotas for the {{limited liability}} company. The doctrine, on the other side, splits itself in regards to this. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} problem on the business register departments of the country. On the other hand, the prohibition is justifiable and permissible. On the USA, the existance of preferential quotas is a purely <b>contractual</b> <b>matter.</b> A sociedade limitada é o tipo societário mais comum no Brasil e nos Estados Unidos vem ganhando espaço. Nela a possibilidade de restrição do direito de voto é tema controverso.   O objetivo do presente artigo é analisar a admissibilidade das participações societárias preferenciais, numa análise comparativa entre os sistemas jurídicos brasileiro e norte-americano. A metodologia utilizada consiste no levantamento da base bibliográfica nos dois sistemas jurídicos. Discute-se que, no Brasil, o CC/ 02, art. 1. 055, caput, dispõe sobre o tema de forma simples e genérica, contudo, nos quoruns previstos, não permite cotas preferenciais sem direito de voto. Além disso, o DNRC (Departamento Nacional de Registro do Comércio) manifestou-se pelo não cabimento para sociedade limitada da figura da quota preferencial. A doutrina, por sua vez, divide-se a este respeito. Conclui-se que há um equívoco dos órgãos de registro empresarial do país, por outro lado, a proibição é justificável e admissível.

40|$|Officially, Sweden has a {{very low}} level of {{corruption}} and in 2008 topped Transparency International’s list {{in terms of the}} perception of a lack of corruption. However, on closer examination {{it would appear that the}} Swedish public sector is not as clean as the Transparency International list suggests. What appears to be relatively common and quite widely accepted in Sweden, especially in local government, are conflict of interest situations in which public officials use their position to obtain advantages for themselves, their friends and their colleagues, in particular with respect to public procurement.   According to the Swedish constitution, the public administration shall be governed by the principles on legality and objectivity. Grave violations of these principles are deemed illegal and contrary to the penal code provisions relating to bribery, public misconduct and breach of confidentiality. This, however, is where the problem arises. The provisions of the law regarding public misconduct only cover those areas involving the exercise of public authority. Although the handling of public matters when a conflict of interest exists is prohibited, there are no sanctions in the penal code for occasions where these provisions are violated. As public procurement is considered to be a <b>contractual</b> <b>matter</b> rather than one that falls within the scope of public authority, there are technically no means, from a criminal law point of view, to address conflict of interest situations, unless the actions taken amount to for example bribery, fraud or a criminal breach of trust.   The aim of this paper is to answer the following questions:   Where does the improper influencing of public decisions due to a conflict of interest fit within the concept of corruption? How can improper influence and conflict of interest be tackled from a criminal law point of view under the current Swedish legislation; What changes, if any, would be required to permit that improper influence due to a conflict of interest can be properly addressed from a criminal law point of view?   My research established that a situation in which public officials improperly influence the official decision-making process because of private interests falls within most international definitions of corruption, i. e. “the abuse of public office for private gain”. It was also established that this type of behaviour in the Swedish public service is often impossible to deal with through criminal prosecution, although it violates the legal provisions on public conflict of interest. This paper therefore concludes that the improper use of influence due to a conflict of interest should be regarded as corrupt activities and be criminalised, thus safeguarding the constitutional principles of the public administration...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} {{controversy}} over {{official development assistance}} (ODA) and the reduction to Australia’s commitment to aid funding, {{it is important that}} Australia’s ODA is effective and is perceived to be so. Among the diverse objectives identified by AusAID’s Office of Development Effectiveness Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness is the need to build local capacity. “Capacity building” is one of the Paris Declaration’s development assistance effectiveness principles, and several of the 2013 DAC Recommendations for AusAID refer to capacity building. Australia works with private contractors, governments of partner countries, civil society organizations and multilateral agencies. Partnering with multilateral organizations represents over 30 % of Australia’s development assistance budget, and the DAC Report recommends further increases in partnering for sustainable capacity development. Because small, localized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) can be flexible, sensitive to local needs, offer grassroots networks, potential specialization, and the ability to assist directly, a strong focus on local NGOs (LNGOs) is recommended to sustainably achieve the aim of capacity building. As is characteristic of the development assistance channel, LNGOs do not work in isolation; their work often involves partnering and cooperation. At a time of increasing multilateral aid and partnering, this study looks at issues of concern to LNGOs through the lens of contracting. Contract and the contracting process can provide critical, though sometimes overlooked, levers of control in the development assistance. The politics of contract law, however, assumes supportive infrastructures of both the government and the market. The utility of contract may take on different dimensions where the legal infrastructure for enforcement is limited and the cultural infrastructure for interpretation requires a pluralistic approach. By framing development assistance effectiveness as a <b>contractual</b> <b>matter,</b> this research adduces relevant threads of contract and organizational theory in its empirical analysis of contracting in development assistance. Semistructured interviews conducted with international and local NGOs and AusAID officials in Southeast Asia shed light on how LNGOs understand the contracting process, how they view contracts and agreements in partnering, what they perceive to be the important issues, and how contracts function. Local context matters nevertheless, this study suggests several common themes with interesting parallels to those in commercial contracting, including issues of control, information, allocation of risk and balance of power. From a theoretical perspective, controversy over the significance and meaning of contract {{has been part of the}} academic discourse for decades. This study contributes to better understanding of the role of contract in the development assistance context. Its implications extend to contract theory generally applicable in both commercial and noncommercial realms. From a practical perspective, this study suggests ways contract can better serve the aim of capacity building, and it informs the design of contracting processes better tailored to the actual objectives of contracting parties...|$|R
