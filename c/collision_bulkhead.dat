25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} <b>collision.</b> Eight transverse <b>bulkheads</b> extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|R

5000|$|In {{early morning}} of 23 January 1909, while sailing from New York City to Gibraltar and Mediterranean ports with 742 {{passengers}} and crew and Captain Inman Sealby (1862-1942) in command, Republic entered a thick fog off the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Amongst the passengers were plenty of illustrious people such as Mrs. Sophie Curtis, wife of George M. Curtis, Mrs. Mary Severance, wife of Cordenio A. Severance, Professor John M. Coulter with wife and children, General Brayton Ives, St. Louis millionaire Samuel Cupples, and Mildred Montague, Countess Pasolini. Travelling in first class were also Mr. Leonard L.

5000|$|The Potosi was steel-built, with a {{waterline}} {{length of}} 110 m {{and a total}} hull length of 122.42 m. The hull was 15.15 m wide and the ship had a displacement of 8,350 tons, for an effective carrying capacity of 6,400 tons. The ship had only one bulkhead in the bow section—the <b>collision</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The ship had five masts, four of which were fully rigged, with courses, upper and lower topsails, upper and lower topgallant sails, and royals. Counting the staysails (12) including jibs (4), she carried 43 sails (24 square sails in six storeys, 12 (normally 9) staysails between the five masts, four foresails (jibs) and three fore-and-aft spanker sails including two spanker sails on two gaffs and a spanker topsail) with a total sail area of 56510.53 sq ft sq metres. Not only the hull was steel, but also her masts (2.82 ft in diameter on deck level, lower and top mast were made in one piece) {{and most of all}} spars (yards except for the royal yards, spanker boom) were constructed of steel tubing, and many of the rigging was steel cable. The only wooden spars were the four royal yards, the four topgallant masts and the two gaffs of the spanker fore-and-aft sails. She was designed as a so-called [...] "three-island-ship", i.e. a ship that has a midship island (67.2 ft), also called midship bridge or [...] "Liverpool house" [...] (the first ships equipped with that feature came from Liverpool yards), beside the forecastle (41.1 ft) and poop (26 ft) decks. There, inside the Liverpool house, dry and well-ventilated accommodations for crew, mates, and captain were installed, as well as the pantry and chart room. The main helm—a double rudder wheel of 5.8 ft diameter—stood on top, well protected against huge waves. A second helm were near the stern. Under good conditions, the huge barque could reach a speed of 19 kn. Her best 24-hour-run were 376 nm in 1900 under Capt. Hilgendorf. The Potosi was manned by a crew of 40-44. She was the fastest P-liner apart from the five-masted fully rigged ship Preußen which could reach speeds of more than 20 kn, but was less maneuverable.|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis {{the author}} has {{investigated}} the potential benefits from an active foil propeller. Foils are mounted on the hull {{and take advantage of}} the heaving and pitching motion of the vessel travelling and produce thrust, similarly to the tail find of aquatic mammals. Active foil means that the angle of the foil has been controlled to constantly maximise the thrust. The author has investigated the potential fuel savings for three vessels, an offshore supply vessel, a coastal tanker and a purse seiner. Calculations have been done considering 9 different foil configurations and five wave headings at forward velocities of 10, 12, 15 and 18 knots. In regular waves six wave periods have been used and irregular waves are also considered. The structural aspect and the possibility of fatigue are investigated and concepts for storing the foils when not used are suggested. ShipX, a program developed my MARINTEK, has been used to find the motions of the vessels and other vital information needed to predict the potential fuel savings. The thrust force is calculated using MATLAB. The results show large potential benefits. Especially for irregular waves we have calculated fuel savings of more than 60 % at 10 and 12 knots. Higher velocities are less beneficial. A large aspect ratio combined with a large foil area produces the most promising results, but if the aspect ratio becomes to large there is a danger of fatigue and the foil structure must be strengthened. The foils are quite large and when not in used they would be stowed away. The ideal method is to store the foils in a compartment of little use, like in the <b>collision</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> There is no easy way of doing this, so the storing system would probably be costly. Over all the potential fuel savings are large for a range of wave conditions up to a certain vessel velocity, but there are practical aspects that would reduce the total benefits. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is {{accidental}} iceberg collision with the bow shoulder area of a 150000 ton membrane-type LNG carrier. It is expected that the traffic of LNG-carriers will increase in the arctic areas {{in the years to}} come, and ice collisions are considered to be a real hazard. A finite element model of the ship side have been developed, where the area in question is the foremost tank of the ship. The collision point is assumed to be in the forward part of the tank, close to the <b>collision</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> However in the FE-analyses the collision point is moved to the centre of the tank, to avoid interference from the boundary conditions. A maximum size criterion for icebergs is used, where it is assumed that all icebergs with less than 2 meter sailing height are hazardous. This means that the ship is assumed to hit these iceberg at its cruising speed of 19. 5 knots. 2 meter sail height corresponds to 5 meter radius for a spherical iceberg. The steel material used is based on power-law formulations. This allows the material model to take into account increase in stress due to reduction in cross-section area. The ice material uses the elliptical Tsai-Wu yield surface. Elements are deleted when they violate the fracture criterion. The FE-analyses are carried out to find the critical energy levels. The analyses were done with spherically shaped icebergs, with radii of 1, 2, 5 and 10 meter. Failure of the ship structure is based on preventing the gas from leaking out due to fracture of the membranes in the cargo containment system. The criterion which is used is 700 mm deection of the inner hull {{in the middle of the}} tank. The internal energy for the ship structure when the failure criterion is reached is found to be approximately 70 MJ. The actual collision energy levels are found using a 3 D external mechanics model. The results indicate that the critical energy levels are not reached. The levels for 1 and 2 meter radius icebergs are negligible. For the 5 meter radius the level is 8 MJ, or 11 % of the critical value. For the 10 meter iceberg the margin is quite small, with 57 MJ or 81 % of critical value. The critical size is found to be 11 meter radius, although it is very conservative since icebergs larger than 5 meter radius will probably be detected before impact. In previous studies of ship-iceberg impacts, inner hull accelerations are found to be very high, up to 2000 g. There has also been concern about accelerations causing problems far from the impact zone. The accelerations have been investigated on several location on the inner hull, and none show higher levels than 200 g. Displacements corresponding to these accelerations show no rapid jumps or fluctuations in the curves. This should indicate that the accelerations cause no serious problems for the membrane and are more of a numerical issue than a real life problem.  </p...|$|E
