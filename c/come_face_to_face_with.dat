5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. Sarah Jane would have, {{as a result of}} a lightning storm, <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her father who has been dead for over 55 years.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> {{a lot of}} people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|Once Cloudsgate Citadel {{is back to}} normal, {{the party}} speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor's doings and how to reach the Dread Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds. The party’s horse fuses with Pegasus, {{allowing}} the party to fly to the Dread Realm. Several challenges await in the Dread Realm, with one such challenge being the party's strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor's Castle. After solving many puzzles, they <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that the Dread Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape. After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having {{to return to the}} Dream World since her Real World self doesn't exist anymore. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle being the remaining visible portion in the Real World. It's then shown that Ashlynn is in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{the only}} witness {{ever to have}} <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Bible John, Jean McLachlan, died aged 74, marking {{the end of the}} hunt for the killer. McLachlan, who shared a taxi with the mystery killer and her sister Helen Puttock, gave police the {{description}} used in the artist's impression, which remains the biggest clue to his appearance more than 40 years later. Although DNA had been used to rule out a previous suspect, detectives believe a DNA link to Tobin is unlikely because of deterioration of the samples through poor storage.|$|E
25|$|Later, Nina was {{approached}} by the CEO of Mishima Financial Empire, Jin Kazama who had already launched war around the world, to be his personal bodyguard and enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 to intercept any possible threat to him, which Nina accepted. Meanwhile, Anna, who vows to take revenge at Nina becomes Kazuya Mishima's personal bodyguard, knowing she is bound to <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Nina along the way. In the Scenario Campaign mode of the console version of Tekken 6, she served {{as one of the}} antagonist for the most part, assisting Jin at his scheme. After Jin sacrificed himself to kill Azazel at the end, she told Lars that she already knew Jin's plans about the world war since the beginning; so he can awaken Azazel's physical body, but she was unsure whether Jin's actions were right or wrong. She then left with a Mishima Zaibatsu helicopter, {{which may or may not}} signify that she became Mishima Zaibatsu's temporary new CEO during Jin's disappearance.|$|E

25|$|Raiden {{appears in}} the latest installment, Mortal Kombat X. During the Neatherrealm war Raiden and Fujin team up to take down a horde of demons and <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> some of the Defenders Raiden lost in the {{previous}} game that are now under Quan Chi's control. They manage to defeat Shinnok and lock him in an amulet thanks to Johnny Cage's unlocked power. During a confrontation with Quan Chi in his fortress, he is not only able to resurrect a mortally wounded Johnny with Sonya's help, {{but he is also}} able to resurrect Jax, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero by combining his magic with his, giving him hope that he can save the other fallen Earthrealm warriors. Years later he catches Kung Lao's cousin Kung Jin stealing a statue from his temple given to him from Jin's family. Raiden allows Jin to beat him in a fight to release his anger on Raiden for his involvement in Kung Lao's death, and encourages the young warrior to join the Shaolin Monks. Another couple of years later, Raiden finds that Shinnok's amulet has been stolen, and he and the new Earthrealm Defenders work to stop Shinnok from being freed. After conversing with Bo' Rai Cho over his regret of losing Liu Kang and Kung Lao and reminiscing an older mission, he is attacked by Shinnok and his corrupted former allies. The revenants badly injure Raiden allowing Shinnok to hold him prisoner and take over the Jinsei Chamber. Shinnok is later stopped by Johnny's daughter Cassie. After which, Raiden requests Kung Jin and Cassie to put him in the Jinsei Chamber, where he purifies it while drawing energy from Shinnok. In the epilogue, Raiden now appears in a darker form similar to his appearance in Deception and Armageddon and warns the new Neatherrealm rulers, Liu Kang and Kitana, that he will show no mercy to anyone who threatens Earthrealm, and gives them Shinnok's decapitated but still living head to prove his point.|$|E
500|$|... is a 1977 Japanese comedy horror film {{directed}} and produced by Nobuhiko Obayashi. The film stars mostly amateur actors with only Kimiko Ikegami and Yōko Minamida having any notable previous acting experience. The film {{is about a}} schoolgirl traveling with her six classmates to her ailing aunt's country home, where they <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> supernatural events as the girls are, one by one, devoured by the home.|$|E
500|$|... "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] {{is one of}} a {{minority}} of Captain Scarlet episodes whose incidental music was scored especially, as opposed to being recycled from the series' audio library. Composer Barry Gray devised the unique score following Anderson's determination that none of the used tracks fitted the episode's unusual tone. The recording was conducted on 3 December 1967, four months after Gray's last contribution to the series, with an orchestra of 14 instrumentalists. The new tracks were titled [...] "Desert Symphony" [...] and [...] "The Mysterons Attack!" [...] Music for [...] "Expo 2068" [...] originated from the same studio session. It is also one of four episodes where members of Spectrum <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Captain Black, the other three episodes being [...] "Manhunt", [...] "Spectrum Strikes Back" [...] and [...] "Flight to Atlantica".|$|E

500|$|The RhAR patrolled around Johore from May to September 1956 without major incident. The rain of the Malayan monsoon season seemed endless {{to many of}} the battalion's men, {{and actual}} {{sightings}} of the communists were rare in the extreme. Even when the guerrillas were spotted, they almost invariably fled after a few shots. [...] "We can but hope that the chaps will get a chance of seeing a CT [...] for a change," [...] reported an RhAR officer in August; [...] "they are all as keen as mustard to come to blows with them." [...] So determined were the RhAR's officers and men to <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the enemy that they ambushed around the railway line at Bekok for seven nights in a row, starting on 30 October 1956. Patrols were led by a different officer each night, but there were no contacts.|$|E
500|$|Cross was {{promoted}} to brigadier on 30 June 1996. He was appointed Director, Materiel Supply and Distribution (Army), a post which became Director, Materiel Support (Army) in 1997 {{as a result of}} re-organisation, based in Andover, Hampshire. At the end of 1997, he took command of the British National Support Element in the Balkans, responsible for supplying the British contingent of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR). At the same time, he commanded the Combat Service Support Group, later renamed 101 Logistic Brigade. He returned to the UK in April 1998, only to be told that he would be returning to the Balkans in January 1999 as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In this role, he was responsible for the humanitarian effort {{in the aftermath of the}} Kosovo War, establishing and maintaining refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. He was tasked with commanding multinational troops, as well as coordinating the humanitarian efforts of personnel from the British Department for International Development, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and multiple non-governmental organisations. Speaking about his service with KFOR, he later called it a [...] "challenging and demanding deployment" [...] and [...] "the first time that I have <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a large-scale humanitarian crisis." [...] He went on to say that the most challenging part was the military working alongside large numbers of civilian agencies and that the Army needed to learn how to better work with such organisations—a need he said was [...] "widely recognised" [...] outside the military. In recognition of his service in the Balkans, Cross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours List.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Lundgren {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the Mongolia-based action adventure, Diamond Dogs. Lundgren portrays the character of Xander Ronson, a mercenary hired {{by a group of}} American fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard, while they search for a priceless Buddhist artifact deep within the Chinese wilderness. They get more than they bargained for, however, as they <b>come</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet {{he did not want to}} spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E

[...] She also {{starred in}} the {{short-lived}} TV series Kidnapped (2006). One critic wrote [...] "Delany is alternately furious and despondent as Ellie, and she and Hutton (Timothy Hutton) can do more without words than other actors can do with pages of dialogue.
