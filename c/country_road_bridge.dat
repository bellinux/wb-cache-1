This headland (officially named Prince Edward County in 1792) is surrounded on the north and east by the Bay of Quinte. As the Murray Canal now connects the bay to Lake Ontario across the only land connection, the county is technically an island. Murray Canal is crossed by 2 swing bridges, the single lane county <b>road</b> 64 <b>bridge</b> and the two lane <b>country</b> <b>road</b> 33 <b>bridge.</b> Bay of Quinte is crossed by two, 2-lane bridges of about 850m length - one carrying Provincial Highway 62 near Belleville and the other about 24km east carrying Provincial Highway 49 near Deseronto.|$|R

40|$|A <b>country’s</b> <b>road</b> and <b>bridge</b> {{network is}} an {{enormous}} national asset. Management {{of the system is}} a highly sensitive and complex task, entrusted to the road administration and shaped by a constellation of political, technical, environmental, managerial and historical forces. Changing environmental concerns, social structures and the scale of road networks has increased the necessity for ever greater optimisation in terms of cost, use of materials and management. The political environment in which the road administration manager works is complex and sometimes even considered hostile by some professionals. Managers are asked not only to attempt to minimise the society’s expenditure on transport but also to meet user needs. These user needs range from an acceptable level of service, to a desire for a clean environment, sustained economic development, and a low share of user taxes to provide for the agency’s funding. The everyday reality for road administration professionals is that they must increase their effectiveness and productivity in accomplishing a mission that grows in complexity while budgetary constraints become increasingly severe. The difference between user costs and agency costs is striking and must be kept in mind (see section IV. 1) ...|$|R

50|$|Some of the Russian émigrés {{settled on}} the {{outskirts}} of Caracas, while others ventured into more distant regions of the country. Initially, Russians worked as low-skilled laborers, but having established their presence, they soon began to take on more interesting (and higher-paying) professions. For example, they took part in demarcating the <b>country’s</b> borders, built <b>roads,</b> <b>bridges,</b> tunnels, and took up work in the oil industry. Russian engineers helped build the Humboldt Hotel, which was once a symbol of Caracas. Many Russians, after learning Spanish, took positions in Venezuelan ministries, universities and private companies. The presence of Russians in Venezuela brought first theatre and ballet to the country for the first time. Even beauty contests have not taken place without the participation of Russian women. It’s well known that Venezuela has won many beauty contests worldwide, and it’s not surprising to hear such names as Milka Chulina and Lyudmila Vinogradoff among the participants.|$|R
