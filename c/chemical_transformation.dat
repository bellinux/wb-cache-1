5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction is {{a transformation of}} some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms {{on the left and}} the right in the equation for a <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of {{chemical reaction}}s a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.|$|E

40|$|Matched {{molecular}} pairs (MMPs) {{have previously}} {{been used to}} extract <b>chemical</b> <b>transformations</b> and study their effect on molecular properties such as activity [1, 2]. <b>Chemical</b> <b>transformations</b> {{have been used to}} direct com-pound optimization efforts towards defined activity pro-files [3]. Here we introduce a methodology to assess effects of <b>chemical</b> <b>transformations</b> based on MMPs of compounds active against specific targets. The effects of selected <b>chemical</b> <b>transformations</b> on drug design-relevant molecular properties were analyzed. For different data sets, transformations that were frequently found and induced favorable property changes were identified. These transformations were then iteratively applied to modify active compounds and move them into favorable regions of ADME-relevant property space. Activity of newly designed compounds was tracked using nearest-neighbor searches in ChEMBL. The results of our study indicate that activity-conservative data-set dependent transforma-tion can aid in the design of new active compounds with favorable ADME characteristics [4]...|$|R

25|$|In {{the context}} of chemistry, energy is an {{attribute}} of a substance {{as a consequence of}} its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> is accompanied by a change in {{one or more of these}} kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.|$|E
25|$|Structure {{determination}} {{refers to}} methods applied {{to determine the}} chemical structure of an isolated, pure natural product, a process that involves an array of chemical and physical methods that have changed markedly over the history of natural products research; in earliest days, these focused on <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> of unknown substances into known substances, and measurement of physical properties such as melting point and boiling point, and related methods for determining molecular weight. In the modern era, methods focus on mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance methods, often multidimensional, and, when feasible, small molecule crystallography. For instance, the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945, work for which she later received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1964).|$|E

500|$|Air quality {{forecasting}} {{attempts to}} predict when {{the concentrations of}} pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. [...] The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by their transport, or mean velocity of movement through the atmosphere, their diffusion, <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation,</b> and ground deposition. [...] In addition to pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data {{about the state of}} the fluid flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. [...] Meteorological conditions such as thermal inversions can prevent surface air from rising, trapping pollutants near the surface, which makes accurate forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling. Urban air quality models require a very fine computational mesh, requiring the use of high-resolution mesoscale weather models; in spite of this, the quality of numerical weather guidance is the main uncertainty in air quality forecasts.|$|E

2500|$|... 2-Pyridone {{is rapidly}} {{degraded}} by microorganisms {{in the soil}} environment, with a half life less than one week. [...] Organisms capable of growth on 2-pyridone as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy have been isolated {{by a number of}} researchers. [...] The most extensively studied 2-pyridone degrader is the gram positive bacterium Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, a member of the phylum Actinobacteria which includes numerous related organisms that have been shown to degrade pyridine or one or more alkyl-, carboxyl-, or hydroxyl-substituted pyridines. [...] 2-Pyridone degradation is commonly initiated by mono-oxygenase attack, resulting in a diol, such as 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, which is metabolized via the maleamate pathway. [...] Fission of the ring proceeds via action of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine monooxygenase, which is also involved in metabolism of nicotinic acid via the maleamate pathway. [...] In the case of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, {{at least part of the}} degradative pathway is plasmid-borne. [...] Pyridine diols undergo <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> in solution to form intensely colored pigments. [...] Similar pigments have been observed in quinoline degradation, also owing to transformation of metabolites, however the yellow pigments often reported in degradation of many pyridine solvents, such as unsubstituted pyridine or picoline, generally result from overproduction of riboflavin in the presence of these solvents. [...] Generally speaking, degradation of pyridones, dihydroxypyridines, and pyridinecarboxylic acids is commonly mediated by oxygenases, whereas degradation of pyridine solvents often is not, and may in some cases involve an initial reductive step.|$|E

6000|$|To {{turn the}} {{imagination}} not inwards, but outwards; {{to give it}} a class of objects which may excite wonder, reverence, the love of novelty and of discovering, without heating the brain or exciting the passions--this {{is one of the great}} problems of education; and I believe from experience that the study of natural history supplies in great part what we want. The earnest naturalist is pretty sure to have obtained that great need of all men, to get rid of self. He who, after the hours of business, finds himself with a mind relaxed and wearied, will not be tempted to sit at home dreaming over impossible scenes of pleasure, or to go for amusement to haunts of coarse excitement, if he have in every hedge-bank, and wood land, and running stream, in every bird among the boughs, and every cloud above his head, stores of interest which will enable him to forget awhile himself, and man, and all the cares, even all the hopes of life, and to be alone with the inexhaustible beauty and glory of Nature, and of God who made her. An hour or two every day spent after business-hours in botany, geology, entomology, at the telescope or the microscope, is so much refreshment gained for the mind for to-morrow's labour, so much rest for irritated or anxious feelings, often so much saved from frivolity or sin. And how easy this pursuit. How abundant the subjects of it! Look round you here. Within the reach of every one of you are wonders beyond all poets' dreams. Not a hedge-bank but has its hundred species of plants, each different and each beautiful; and when you tire of them--if you ever can tire--a trip into the meadows by the Thames, with the rich vegetation of their dikes, floating flower-beds of every hue, will bring you as it were into a new world, new forms, new colours, new delight. You ask why this is? And you find yourself at once involved in questions of soil and climate, which lead you onward, step by step, into the deepest problems of geology and chemistry. In entomology, too, if you have any taste for the beauties of form and colour, any fondness for mechanical and dynamical science, the insects, even to the smallest, will supply endless food for such likings; while their instincts and their transformations, as well as the equally wondrous <b>chemical</b> <b>transformation</b> of salts and gases into living plants, which agricultural chemistry teaches you, will tempt you to echo every day Mephistopheles's magic song, when he draws wine out of the table in Auersbach's cellar: ...|$|E

We demonstrate here an unconventional shape transformation of Au@Ag core-shell NPs (nanorods and nanocubes) into octahedral nanorattles via room-temperature galvanic replacement coupled with seeded growth. The corresponding morphological and <b>chemical</b> <b>transformations</b> were investigated in three dimensions, using state-of-the-art X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) tomography.
