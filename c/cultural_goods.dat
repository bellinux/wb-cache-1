5|$|Orders {{given by}} Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the {{movement}} of looted possessions from Königsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport <b>cultural</b> <b>goods</b> of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, {{who was in charge}} of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, as {{a result}} of the October Revolution, Russia became a {{communist}} state. In the aftermath of World War I, Poland reemerged as an independent country in the following year. From 1919 to 1921, the two states fought the Polish–Soviet War which was concluded with the Peace of Riga. Article 11 of the peace treaty required that the Soviet side return all culturally significant collections and items that had been removed from Poland since the First Partition in 1772. A special bilateral committee was set up to carry out the restitution of <b>cultural</b> <b>goods.</b> In 1928, the committee's efforts resulted in the return to Poland of, among other national treasures, Szczerbiec, which, after 133 years, was deposited back in the Wawel Castle.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 UNESCO report {{showed that}} {{cultural}} exchange {{is becoming more}} frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of <b>cultural</b> <b>goods.</b> In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of <b>cultural</b> <b>goods,</b> after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, two authors have {{introduced}} new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. Emmison & Frow's (1998) work centers on {{an exploration of}} the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital. The authors state that [...] "a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies of the information age can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing advantage on those families that possess them". Specifically computers are [...] "machines" [...] (Bourdieu, 1986:47) that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include <b>cultural</b> <b>goods</b> and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without.|$|E

2500|$|Adorno saw {{the culture}} {{industry}} as an {{arena in which}} critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture {{was identified as a}} reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. [...] "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them." [...] The differences among <b>cultural</b> <b>goods</b> make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that [...] "the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" [...] but this is concealed under [...] "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism". By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive [...] "add-ons" [...] {{in order to keep the}} consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as pseudo-individualisation and the always-the-same.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to concur to reduce some {{cognitive}} gaps existing in business model field of research, giving a theoretical contribution to issues referring to firms’ development paths. Even if some research on business model evolution has been done at theoretical level, few works have been done empirically. Moreover, the use of multiple case study has not been so well exploited, researchers having often preferred single case study approach. Nonetheless, we argue that the comparison within and between cases permits a deeper analysis, especially in such a variegated sector as that of high-technologies for <b>cultural</b> <b>good.</b> Hence, empirical analysis has allowed us not only to make suggestions regarding the way in which business models might be expected to evolve over time, but also to give some insights on the unexplored field of high-technology firms for <b>cultural</b> <b>good...</b>|$|R
