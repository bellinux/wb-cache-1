5|$|Using {{techniques}} of genetic <b>complementation,</b> Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, {{and concluded that}} luminosity in P.stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by {{a single pair of}} alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525nm, and shifted to 528nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.|$|E
25|$|They are not closed {{under general}} {{intersection}} (hence neither under <b>complementation)</b> and set difference.|$|E
25|$|Antimatroids are equivalent, by <b>complementation,</b> to convex geometries, a {{combinatorial}} abstraction of convex sets in geometry.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{maintenance}} of sex based on DNA repair and <b>complementation</b> applies widely to all sexual species.|$|E
25|$|Biochemical <b>complementation</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in subtilisin-cleaved bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, then expanded using β-galactosidase mutants that allowed cells to grow on lactose.|$|E
25|$|Because {{fluorophore}} reconstitution {{can occur}} {{at a distance}} of 7nm or more, fluorescence <b>complementation</b> may indicate either a direct or indirect (i.e. within the same complex) interaction between the fluorescent fragments' fused proteins.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the <b>complementation</b> it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for emptiness. This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).|$|E
25|$|If no {{fluorescence}} is detected, {{an interaction}} may still {{exist between the}} proteins of interest, as {{the creation of the}} fusion protein may alter the structure or interaction face of the target protein or the fluorescence fragments may be physically unable to associate. To ensure that this result is not a false negative, that there is no interaction, the protein interaction must be tested in a situation where fluorescence <b>complementation</b> and activation requires an external signal. In this case, if the external signal fails to cause fluorescence fragment association, {{it is likely that the}} proteins do not interact or there is a physical impediment to fluorescence <b>complementation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause epistasis. This is sometimes called allelic <b>complementation,</b> or interallelic <b>complementation.</b> It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example transvection, where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA. Similarly, at the protein level, proteins that function as dimers may form a heterodimer composed of one protein from each alternate gene and may display different properties to the homodimer of one or both variants.|$|E
25|$|In another sense, the Colombian 4–2–2–2 {{is closely}} related to the 4–4–2 diamond of Brazil, style {{different}} from the French-Chilean trend and is based on the <b>complementation</b> of a box-to box with 10 classic. Emphasises the triangulation, but especially in the surprise of attack.|$|E
25|$|M4 and M5 are {{two ways}} of asserting supplementation, the mereological analog of set <b>complementation,</b> with M5 being {{stronger}} because M4 is derivable from M5. M and M4 yield minimal mereology, MM. MM, reformulated in terms of Proper Part, is Simons's (1987) preferred minimal system.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} with the rare inherited syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum have mutations in ERCC4. These patients {{are classified as}} XP <b>complementation</b> group F (XP-F). Diagnostic features of XP are dry scaly skin, abnormal skin pigmentation in sun-exposed areas and severe photosensitivity, accompanied by a great than 1000-fold increased risk of developing UV radiation-induced skin cancers.|$|E
25|$|One {{branch of}} musical set theory deals with {{collections}} (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), {{which may be}} ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, inversion, and <b>complementation.</b> The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied {{to the analysis of}} rhythm as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of the repair and <b>complementation</b> hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair {{produces}} a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.|$|E
25|$|Several human {{patients}} with symptoms of Fanconi anemia (FA) have causative mutations in the ERCC4 gene. Fanconi anemia {{is a complex}} disease, involving major hematopoietic symptoms. A characteristic feature of FA is the hypersensitivity to agents that cause interstrand DNA crosslinks. FA {{patients with}} ERCC4 mutations have been classified as belonging to Fanconi anemia <b>complementation</b> group P (FANCP).|$|E
25|$|Closure {{properties}} of deterministic context-free languages (accepted by deterministic PDA by final state) are drastically {{different from the}} context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under <b>complementation,</b> but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a deterministic PDA is also accepted by a deterministic PDA is tricky. In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{mutations}} {{in two separate}} genes can be non-additive if those genes interact, {{mutations in}} two codons within a gene can be non-additive. In genetics this is sometimes called intragenic <b>complementation</b> when one deleterious mutation can be compensated for by a second mutation within that gene. This occurs when the amino acids within a protein interact. Due {{to the complexity of}} protein folding and activity, additive mutations are rare.|$|E
25|$|For the {{advantage}} due to DNA repair, {{there is an}} immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational DNA repair during meiosis, since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of <b>complementation</b> to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.|$|E
25|$|The laws {{listed above}} define Boolean algebra, {{in the sense}} that they entail the rest of the subject. The laws <b>Complementation</b> 1 and 2, {{together}} with the monotone laws, suffice for this purpose and can therefore be taken as one possible complete set of laws or axiomatization of Boolean algebra. Every law of Boolean algebra follows logically from these axioms. Furthermore, Boolean algebras can then be defined as the models of these axioms as treated in the section thereon.|$|E
25|$|The premise {{behind the}} test is the {{activation}} of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA-binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment <b>complementation</b> assay.|$|E
25|$|From the definition, split graphs {{are clearly}} closed under <b>complementation.</b> Another {{characterization}} of split graphs involves complementation: they are chordal graphs the complements {{of which are}} also chordal. Just as chordal graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees of trees, split graphs are the intersection graphs of distinct substars of star graphs. Almost all chordal graphs are split graphs; that is, in the limit as n goes to infinity, the fraction of n-vertex chordal graphs that are split approaches one.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent {{fragment}} linkage may {{alter the}} folding or {{structure of the}} protein of interest, leading to the elimination of an interacting protein's surface binding site. In addition, {{the arrangement of the}} fluorescent fragments may prevent fluorophore reconstitution through steric hindrance, although steric hindrance can be reduced or eliminated by using a linker sequence that allows sufficient flexibility for the fluorescent fragments to associate. Therefore, absence of fluorescence <b>complementation</b> may be a false negative and does not necessarily prove that the interaction in question does not occur.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many in vivo protein-interaction assays, BiFC {{does not}} require protein {{complexes}} to be formed by {{a large proportion of}} the proteins or at stoichiometric proportions. Instead, BiFC can detect interactions among protein subpopulations, weak interactions, and low expression proteins due to the stable <b>complementation</b> of the fluorescent reporter protein. In addition, successful fluorescent protein reconstitution has been reported for protein partners over 7nbsp&nm apart, so long as the linkers binding the fluorophore fragment to the protein of interest has the flexibility needed to associate with its corresponding fragment.|$|E
25|$|The recent spurt in {{information}} on various plant-related processes {{has largely been}} {{a result of the}} revolution in molecular biology. Powerful techniques like mutagenesis and <b>complementation</b> were made possible in Arabidopsis thaliana via generation of T-DNA containing mutant lines, recombinant plasmids, techniques like transposon tagging etc. Availability of complete physical and genetic maps, RNAi vectors, and rapid transformation protocols are some of the technologies that have significantly altered the scope of the field. Recently, there has also been a massive increase in the genome and EST sequences of various non-model species, which, coupled with the bioinformatics tools existing today, generate opportunities in the field of plant evo-devo research.|$|E
25|$|A linker {{is a short}} {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} that tethers the fluorescent reporter protein fragment to the protein of interest, forming the fusion protein. When designing a linker sequence, one must ensure that the linker is sufficiently soluble and long to provide the fluorescent protein fragments with flexibility and freedom of movement so that the fragment and its partner fragment will collide frequently enough to reconstitute during the interaction of their respective fused proteins. Although it is not documented, {{it is possible that}} the length or the sequence of the linker may influence <b>complementation</b> of some proteins. Reported linker sequences RSIAT and RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH (single amino acid code) and AAANSSIDLISVPVDSR (Sigma) have been successfully used in BiFC experiments.|$|E
25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and <b>complementation</b> (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).|$|E
25|$|After the {{demonstration}} of successful fluorescent protein fragment reconstitution in mammalian cells, Hu et al. described the use of fragmented yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) {{in the investigation of}} bZIP and Rel family transcription factor interactions. This was the first report bZIP protein interaction regulation by regions outside of the bZIP domain, regulation of subnuclear localization of the bZIP domains Fos and Jun by their different interacting partners, and modulation of transcriptional activation of bZIP and Rel proteins through mutual interactions. In addition, this study was the first report of an in vivo technique, now known as the bimolecular fluorescence <b>complementation</b> (BiFC) assay, to provide insight into the structural basis of protein complex formation through detection of fluorescence caused by the assembly of fluorescent reporter protein fragments tethered to interacting proteins.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor <b>complementation)</b> on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

500|$|Phenolic and ellagic acids were undetected in N. rajah, while {{concentrations}} of kaempferol {{were found to}} be very weak. [...] Chromatographic patterns of the N. × alisaputrana samples studied showed <b>complementation</b> of its putative parental species.|$|E
2500|$|The human ERCC4 gene can {{correct the}} DNA repair defect in {{specific}} ultraviolet light (UV)-sensitive mutant cell lines derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells. Multiple independent <b>complementation</b> groups of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been isolated, and this gene restored UV resistance to cells of <b>complementation</b> group 4. Reflecting this cross-species genetic <b>complementation</b> method, the gene was called [...] "Excision repair cross-complementing 4" ...|$|E
2500|$|In graph theory, a cograph, or complement-reducible graph, or P4-free graph, is a graph {{that can}} be {{generated}} from the single-vertex graph K1 by <b>complementation</b> and disjoint union. [...] That is, the family of cographs is the smallest class of graphs that includes K1 and is closed under <b>complementation</b> and disjoint union.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{controls}} include fluorophore fragments {{linked to}} non-interacting proteins, as {{the presence of}} these fusions tend to decrease non-specific <b>complementation</b> and false positive results.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motivation}} for the hierarchy is to follow {{the way in which}} a Borel set could be constructed from open sets using <b>complementation</b> and countable unions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fluorescent}} protein fragments used in BiFC {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} the colours blue, cyan, green, yellow, red, cherry, and Venus. This range in colours has made the development of multicolour fluorescence <b>complementation</b> analysis possible. This technique allows multiple protein complexes to be visualised simultaneously in the same cell. [...] In addition, proteins typically have {{a large number of}} alternative interaction partners. Therefore, by fusing fragments of different fluorescent proteins to candidate proteins, one can study competition between alternative interaction partners for complex formation through the <b>complementation</b> of different fluorescent colour fragments.|$|E
2500|$|The issue {{features}} {{in the writings of}} Aristotle, and modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) in the 18th century. [...] August Weismann picked up the thread in 1889, arguing that sex served to generate genetic variation, as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, Charles Darwin (1809-1882) concluded that the effects of hybrid vigor (<b>complementation)</b> [...] "is amply sufficient to account for the ... genesis of the two sexes". This is consistent with the repair and <b>complementation</b> hypothesis, given below under [...] "Other explanations".|$|E
