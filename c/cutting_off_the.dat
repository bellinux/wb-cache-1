5|$|The 14th Panzer Division swiftly {{captured}} Vrbosko, linking up {{with the}} Italians as they attacked down the Adriatic coast, thereby <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> remaining elements of the 7th Army. It was then ordered to split into three columns to pursue the Yugoslavs across Bosnia. The northern column headed for Doboj, the central column for Sarajevo, and the southern column drove towards Mostar in Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The first castle on the Thetford {{site was}} Red Castle and was {{probably}} built {{shortly after the}} Norman conquest of England by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey. The castle was a ringwork design and was positioned across {{the line of the}} defensive Saxon ditch, in the process enclosing and <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> local church from the inside of the town, and building over part of the local cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The former fort was {{captured}} by Murad Khan of Maqpon Dynasty, the ruler of Baltistan, in the Conquest of Khaplu in the 1590s by <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> water and other supplies to the fort. The troops of Murad besieged the fort for three months, resulting in the surrender of Rahim Khan, the 62nd Yabgo dynasty ruler of Khaplu. The fort again fell to invaders in the 1660s and 1674.|$|E

5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several scenes {{that did not}} make the film's final cut. One of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E
5|$|LGV Picardie is a {{proposed}} high-speed line between Paris and Calais via Amiens. By <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{corner of the}} LGV Nord at Lille, it would enable Eurostar trains to save 20minutes on the journey between Paris and Calais, bringing the London–Paris journey time under 2hours. In 2008 the French Government announced its future investment plans for new LGVs to be built up to 2020; LGV Picardie was not included but was listed as planned in the longer term. It has later been confirmed that LGV Picardie {{is intended to be}} built between 2020 and 2030.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, the Germans overran the 20th Battalion {{and split}} the 19th in half, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> 18th Battalion. The {{remnants}} of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade fell back through the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to Zaafran and the Ed Duda corridor was closed. The division retreated, led along the Trigh Capuzzo by C Squadron, which halted at Bir Gibni at 04:00 on 2 December. At noon, the squadron headed north to rejoin the regiment.|$|E

5|$|Shades of Deep Purple was reissued {{many times}} {{all over the}} world, often in a set with the two {{following}} albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI, which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances. All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> sound effects used as transitions in the original edition.|$|E
5|$|Von Wallenrode {{called for}} new volunteers from France, England, and Scotland. Among those who responded was William Douglas of Nithsdale. During {{the autumn of}} 1391 the Teutonic Knights {{organized}} another campaign against Vilnius. In Kaunas they organized a lavish feast, which was prominently featured in Konrad Wallenrod, an 1828 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. They devastated the nearby towns of Ukmergė and Maišiagala, but lacked the resources for a second siege on Vilnius. In November 1391 Vytautas attacked the areas near Merkinė and Hrodna, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> easiest communication route between Jogaila and Skirgaila.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, to the surprise of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E

50|$|Most {{rolling cutter}} and fixed {{cutter drill bits}} have {{internal}} passages to direct drilling fluid, conveyed by the drill pipe from surface pumps, through hydraulic nozzles directed {{at the bottom of}} the wellbore to produce high velocity fluid jets that assist in cleaning <b>the</b> old <b>cuttings</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bottom before the next tooth contacts the rock. Placement of the nozzles, particularly in rolling cutter bits, is also often done to assist in keeping the cutting elements free of cuttings build-up in certain kinds of clay and shale formations.|$|R

5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{started the}} withdrawal, while the {{motorized}} Allied forces broke {{out from their}} bridgeheads and pursued the German units from behind. The rapid Allied advance posed a major threat for the Germans, who could not retreat fast enough. The Germans tried to establish a defense line at the Rhône to shield the withdrawal of several valuable units there. The US 45th and 3rd Divisions were pressing to the north-west with uncontested speed, undermining Wiese's plan for a new defense line. Barjols and Brignoles were taken by the two American divisions on 19August, which also were about to envelop Toulon as well as Marseille from the north, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> German units there.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms, and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War (1754–63). In 1763, France surrendered the Louisiana Territory {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> supply of arms to the Southern Pawnees and Wichitas.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{began in}} May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months {{investing}} the city, which included <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> water supply. Eventually, {{it would last}} until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by {{the activity of the}} Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.|$|E
5|$|To the west, on 12 May, Givati brigade troops {{took the}} British {{detention}} {{camp on the}} road leading to Latrun, but abandoned it the next day. Between 14 and 15 May, its 52nd battalion took the villages of Abu Shusha, Al-Na'ani and al-Qubab north of Latrun, thus <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> zone from Ramla, the main Arab town in the area. Lapierre and Collins report also that a platoon of the Givati brigade fired on and then penetrated the fort without encountering any resistance {{on the morning of}} 15 May. Again to the east, on 15 May, the troops of the Harel brigade took Dayr Ayyub, which they abandoned the next day.|$|E
5|$|After an {{interlude}} {{of several}} months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at Cyzicus. Alcibiades {{had been forced to}} flee from Sestos to Cardia to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, {{but as soon as the}} Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and Mindarus, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Spartans' retreat.|$|E
