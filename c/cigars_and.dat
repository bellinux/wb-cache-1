5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|American comedian Bill Cosby was {{a popular}} {{spokesperson}} for advertising from the 1960sbefore his first starring television roleuntil the early 2000s. He started with White Owl <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> later endorsed Jell-O pudding and gelatin, Coca-Cola (including New Coke), Texas Instruments, E. F. Hutton & Co., Kodak, and the 1990 United States Census. , Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O. In 2011, he won the President's Award for Contributions to Advertising from the Advertising Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler. As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{eventually}} {{concentrated on}} the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E

25|$|Agricultural {{production}} is limited—only 2% {{of the land}} is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.|$|E

25|$|As {{was typical}} of many mills in those days, there was an {{affiliated}} company store where the mill employees could run up a bill and have it deducted from their next pay. It carried about everything they might need: groceries, dry goods, boots and shoes, fruit, confectionery, <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> tobacco, mill remnants, wall paper and window shades. Holden-Leonard also provided tenement housing for its employees and {{with a large number}} of children in the workforce found itself in the crosshairs of the Child Labor Reform movement {{at the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Garson {{was also}} convicted of two lesser charges, {{relating}} to his accepting {{a box of}} <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> $1,000 in cash from Siminovsky for having referred two clients. The charges were for receiving a reward for official misconduct in the second degree (a class E felony; the lowest under New York law, in violation of New York Penal Law § 200.25). The jury acquitted him on four other counts of receiving rewards for official misconduct in the second degree. Additionally, Garson was automatically disbarred as an attorney {{as a result of}} his felony convictions.|$|E
25|$|These {{works were}} all {{published}} {{in an era}} before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes, <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> chewing tobacco were still commonplace. Many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman. Pipe and Pouch came in a leather bag resembling a tobacco pouch and Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy (1901) came bound in leather, packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box. By the late 1920s, the publication {{of this type of}} literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Most was apprenticed to a bookbinder, {{for whom}} he had to bind books from dawn until sunset, a {{condition}} which Most later likened to slavery. At the age of 17 he became a journeyman bookbinder and plied his trade {{from town to town}} and job to job, working in 50 cities in 6 countries from 1863 to 1868. In Vienna he was fired and placed on a blacklist for having staged a strike. Unemployable in his trade, he learned to make wooden boxes for hats, <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> matches, which he sold on the street until police brought an end to his trade for lacking a license.|$|E

25|$|The Great Caesar is {{the head}} of the Los Angeles {{division}} of the TNT group. He is a former Chicago mobster who made his fortune during the Prohibition era. After Al Capone's downfall, he became the most powerful mafioso in Chicago and held this position until his early retirement from business. He is independent from the New York division, but he still acts on Number One's orders. He usually dresses in white or grey suits, smokes Cuban cigars, is completely bald and always wears his trademark sunglasses. He also runs a flower shop, which, in contrast to the New York one, is much larger and successful than its counterpart. He has his own crew of TNT agents, consisting of Tim, Tom and Tumb, Bob's brothers, Professor Lamb, an inventor and former adversary of the TNT group, and Clodoveo, who remained for a while with him until he sent him back to Number One due to their constant quarrels. He enjoys fine wines, <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> he owns a panther, a bulldog and a gorilla, all tamed.|$|E
25|$|Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909 he {{published}} the book Survival of Man which expressed {{his belief that}} life after death had been demonstrated by mediumship. His most controversial book was Raymond or Life and Death (1916). The book documented the séances {{that he and his}} wife had attended with the medium Gladys Osborne Leonard. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son's experiences in the spirit world. According to the book Raymond had reported that people who had died were still the same people when they passed over, there were houses, trees and flowers and the Spirit world looked similar to earth but there is no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> received whisky in the spirit world and because of such statements the book was criticised. Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge Reflections on Raymond (1917) that directly challenged Lodge's beliefs in Spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|The {{coming of}} the Great Depression in the early 1930s brought a sharp {{reduction}} in the worldwide demand for fine <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> Ybor City's economic base suffered greatly. Some cigar factories closed, others ended the hand-rolled tradition and turned to mechanization to reduce costs, and remaining operations sharply decreased production and payrolls, resulting in widespread unemployment and hardship across the entire neighborhood. Demand for cigars increased after World War II, but by that time, almost all of Ybor City's cigar factories were mechanized and did not re-hire the skilled and well-payed artisans they had once employed by the thousands. As veterans returned from the war, they largely chose to leave the aging neighborhood for areas with better housing and economic prospects, accelerating the trend of declining population and economic contraction. This process accelerated further through the 1950s and 60s, when the federal Urban Renewal program {{and the construction of}} Interstate 4 resulted in the demolition of many structures, including hundreds of housing units. Planned redevelopment never took place, and, with its commercial district and social core virtually abandoned, Ybor City lapsed into a period of neglect and decay.|$|E
