A website entitled VITTO, has been conceived and designed to the level of non-functional prototype for submission in conjunction with this dissertation. It demonstrates a platform for potential buyers to source, browse, purchase and compare products and services from various online wholesalers and retailers within a single application. It is proposed that VITTO would utilise content management system principles and application programming interfaces to provide tools enabling unskilled users to create online identities, virtual booths and social communities suitable for connecting sellers with buyers in ways that stimulate networking, heightened engagement and customer loyalty. The incorporation of a conference centre within VITTO provides a platform for users to host and attend conferences, seminars, lectures, focus groups special events and training sessions. User engagement with the site is incentivised through a <b>credit</b> <b>voucher</b> system.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to contribute to the knowledge base of effective Catholic schools research as a basis for informing Catholic school improvement efforts and contributing greater accountability of Catholic education in the interest of the greater society. The problem was to examine how individuals in their leadership roles as decision and policy makers, associated with Catholic elementary education in a diverse midwestern diocese (The Diocese), perceive their (a) Catholic elementary schools' effectiveness when analyzed by individual respondent information and institutional factors and (b) priorities for school improvement among effectiveness areas when analyzed descriptively by role. A survey developed by the author, which was based on effective public schools research and characteristics related to excellent Catholic elementary schools, was distributed to school leadership personnel. Principals, pastors, directors of religious education, school board presidents, and senior faculty members from each of the Catholic elementary schools in the diocese rated their perceptions of Catholic school effectiveness. Reported perceptions were analyzed by individual respondent information and institutional factors. Areas of effectiveness were also ranked as priorities for Catholic school improvement and analyzed descriptively by role. The results of this examination indicated a high degree of perceived Catholic school effectiveness, especially by pastors, principals, and senior faculty members. Responses from directors of religious education proved to be inconclusive, and school board presidents had lower perceptions of school effectiveness than any of the other four roles. The study indicated the priorities for school improvement, as ranked by all of the leadership roles, as physical plant, finances, decision making, parents/community, instructional programs, apostolic service, relationships, and student activities. Almost 50 % of the respondents ranked physical plant as the highest priority for school improvement. In light of the fact that accountability to the greater society may be at question, especially in regard to contemporary issues such as school choice, tuition tax <b>credits,</b> <b>vouchers,</b> and privatization, educational leaders from Catholic elementary schools in this diocese, who are currently accountable to the church and their public, perceived their schools as effective and recognized areas for school improvement...|$|R

40|$|The Challenge. The {{collapse}} of centrally planned economies led to falls in production and income {{of up to}} 60 percent in the new transition countries of the ECA region. As government revenue promptly plummeted, the old social protection strategy – guaranteed public employment, heavily subsidized consumer prices, and generous social benefits for pensioners and socially dependent groups – became unsustainable. New programs were clearly needed to assist burgeoning groups of poor and vulnerable people, although an adequate resource base for these programs was not apparent. Moreover, popular expectations for living standards had fallen more slowly than production. Economically sustainable reform options then seemed politically unattractive when compared with what was promised, but not deliverable, under past policies. One key element of the policy response was {{the introduction of new}} social assistance programs. Social Assistance.

30|$|There {{is a very}} {{heated debate}} about the choice between demand and supply-side {{measures}}. In essence, the demand side measures — such as tax <b>credits</b> or <b>vouchers,</b> employers’ subsidy to workers, income-contingent subsidies through the tax system — put money {{in the hands of}} parents and expect parents to choose the type of services they need. Economists, in general, favour this approach {{on the grounds that the}} approach provides for effective and efficient use of scarce public funds: parents choose the most attractive ECEC service and the inefficient suppliers are weeded out. The counter argument is that the underlying assumption that parents have good knowledge about the quality of services is rarely met so that the benefits of the parental choice approach are not realised. In fact, poor quality suppliers may drive quality providers out of the market. In addition, parents may divert funds for other purposes; the market is decentralised and chaotic and may not be available in the poor areas; and in general, it is extremely hard to assess the quality of provision ahead of time. The impact of a decision on the child may only be known when it is too late.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} ways in which parents are involved in their children’s education is through choosing the school they attend. Parents typically choose a school de facto, according to where they live. However, within the past decade, more parents are able to exercise explicit school choice because of specific educational policies, such as magnet schools, charter schools, open enrollment, tax <b>credits,</b> and <b>vouchers.</b> In the public school arena, magnet schools are the most prevalent type of school choice. Magnet schools played a central role during court-ordered busing to prevent white flight by providing avenues for voluntary integration; many parents chose magnet schools over cross-town bus rides. However, during the past decade, the role of magnet schools has changed as an increasing number of federal courts have lifted desegregation orders in urban school districts. Magnet schools are now a mechanism to provide public school parent choice. Thus, the market-place for parents in many urban districts includes magnet schools, charter schools, and private schools. Private schools are available to a broader group of parents because of the increasing availability of private-school vouchers that are targeted to low-income households in low- income, high minority, school districts...|$|R

40|$|This American Political Development {{research}} explains cross-state {{variation in}} aid for children at private religious {{schools in the}} United States {{up to the end}} of 2012. Using a mixed-methods approach I examine how the institutional orderings of Federalism, Constitution, Church and Party affect policymaker decisions to instigate and sustain programmes of aid. By ‘aid’ I mean education <b>vouchers</b> and tax <b>credits,</b> transportation, textbook loans, equipment, nursing and food services, and tax exemptions for private religious school property. I conduct Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis across all fifty states, supported by interview and archival research in six case-study states – California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, New York and Utah – and by statistical treatment of the constitutional amendments known as ‘No-Aid Provisions’. All of the aid policies examined here are ‘submerged’ in Mettler’s terms, in that they help private organizations to take on state functions, re-frame such functions in terms of the marketplace, and are poorly understood by the public. In this thesis I extend Mettler’s conception of submergedness to explain when institutions matter, which institutions matter, and why they matter for religious school student aid. State decentralization is necessary for high levels of aid and a high proportion of Catholics is sufficient for high levels of aid. Republican control of the state offices is a necessary condition for the passage of tax <b>credit</b> or <b>voucher</b> scholarships but not for other types of aid. No-Aid Provisions are unrelated to aid. Of the four institutional explanatory conditions, Federalism and Church have the most important effects on aid for children at private religious schools.

40|$|Mexico's Telmex {{undertook}} {{the first}} future-flow securitization transaction in 1987. From then through 1999, the principal credit rating agencies rated more than 200 transactions totaling $ 47. 3 billion. Studying several sources, the authors draw {{conclusions about the}} rationale for using this asset class, {{the size of its}} unrealized potential, and the main constraints on its growth. Typically the borrowing entity (the originator) sells its future product (receivable) directly or indirectly to an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV), which issues the debt instrument. Designated international customers make their payments for the exports directly to an offshore collection account managed by a trustee. The collection agent makes principal and interest payments to investors and pays the rest to the originator. This transaction structure allows many investment-grade borrowers in developing countries to pierce the sovereign credit ceiling and get longer-term financing at significantly lower interest costs. The investment-grade rating attracts a wider group of investors. And establishing a credit history for the borrower makes it easier for it to access capital markets later, at lower costs. This asset class is attractive forinvestors-especially buy-and-hold investors, such as insurance companies-because of its good credit rating and stellar performance in good and bad times. Defaults in this asset class are rare, despite frequent liquidity crises in developing countries. Latin American issuers (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela) dominate this market. Nearly half the dollar amounts raised are backed by receivables on oil and gas. Recent transactions have involved receivables on credit cards, telephones, workers'remittances, taxes, and exports. The potential for securing future receivables is several times the current level ($ 10 billion annually). The greatest potential lies outside Latin America, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (fuel and mineral exports), the Middle East (oil), and South Asia (remittances, <b>credit</b> card <b>vouchers,</b> and telephone receivables). One constraint on growth is the paucity of good collateral in developing countries. Crude oil may be better collateral than refined petroleum. Agricultural commodities are harder to securitize. Another constraint: the dearth of high-quality issuers in developing countries. Securitization deals are complex, with high preparation costs and long lead times. The ideal candidates are investment-grade entities (in terms of local currency) in sub-investment-grade countries (in terms of foreign currency). Establishing indigenous rating agencies can slash out-of-pocket costs. Developing standardized templates for certain types of securitizations might help. A master trust arrangement can reduce constraints on size. Multilateral institutions might consider providing seed money and technical assistance for contingent private credit facilities.

40|$|Abstract Background Since the mid- 1970 s, the {{dominant}} model for U. S. federal housing policy {{has shifted from}} unit-based programs to tenant based vouchers and certificates, intended to allow recipients a choice in their housing and neighborhoods. Surprisingly little research has examined {{the question of where}} those with Section 8 housing vouchers are able to live, but some research suggests that voucher holders are more likely to reside in distressed neighborhoods than unsubsidized renter households. Further, federal housing policy has limited drug users' access to housing subsidies. In turn, neighborhood disorder has been associated with higher levels of injection drug risk behaviors, and higher drug-related mortality. This paper explores rental accessibility and neighborhood characteristics of advertised rental housing in Hartford CT. Methods Brief telephone interviews were conducted with landlords or management companies with units to rent in Hartford to explore housing accessibility measured as initial move in costs, credit and criminal background checks, and whether rental subsidies were accepted. These data were supplemented with in-depth interviews with landlords, shelter staff and active users of heroin, crack or cocaine. Apartments for rent were geocoded and mapped using ArcGIS. We used location quotients to identify areas where low-income rental housing is concentrated. Finally, we mapped apartments in relation to drug and violent arrest rates in each neighborhood. Results High security deposits, criminal background and credit checks limit housing accessibility even for drug users receiving vouchers. While most landlords or management companies accepted housing subsidies, several did not. Voucher units are concentrated in neighborhoods with high poverty neighborhoods. Landlords reported little incentive to accept rental subsidies in neighborhoods with low crime rates, but appreciated the guarantee provided by Section 8 in high crime neighborhoods that were less likely to attract applicants with good jobs and <b>credit.</b> Conclusion Housing <b>vouchers</b> in themselves do not greatly improve recipients' choice of neighborhood and voucher units are concentrated in the most distressed neighborhoods. Policy changes are needed to increase landlords' incentives to accept housing subsidies. Interventions to improve neighborhood conditions are needed to improve the probability of success for those recovering from drug addictions. </p...|$|R
