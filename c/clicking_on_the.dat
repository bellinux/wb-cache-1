5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. <b>Clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. <b>Clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may {{be issued to}} controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E

25|$|Some puzzles are {{criticized for}} the obscurity of their solutions, for example, the {{combination}} of a clothes line, clamp, and deflated rubber duck used to gather a key stuck between the subway tracks in The Longest Journey, which exists outside of the game's narrative and serves only as an obstacle to the player. Others have been criticized for requiring players to blindly guess, either by <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right pixel, or by guessing the right verb in games that use a text interface. Games that require players to navigate mazes have also become less popular, although the earliest text-adventure games usually required players to draw a map if they wanted to navigate the abstract space.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cases have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the concept of}} initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E

The Home City functions differently inside a game. Instead of customizing a Home City or choosing cards, a player can ship cards chosen before the game (and added to a deck).|$|E
500|$|The puzzle is {{considered}} by many gamers and publications {{to be one of the}} most challenging and hardest video game puzzles of all time. Broken Sword creator and Revolution CEO Charles Cecil and Broken Sword designer Steve Ince, as well as publications which have covered it, explain that the puzzle was challenging because the player was not met with any [...] "time critical" [...] puzzle prior to this point in the game, which would mean they [...] "would not necessarily make the connection that <b>clicking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machinery at a key moment would make this happen." ...|$|E

This feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents. Another strategy that players use to defeat opponents is coiling around them in a loop until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.|$|E
