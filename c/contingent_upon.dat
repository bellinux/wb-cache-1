5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not <b>contingent</b> <b>upon</b> predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E

5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table.

Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7, 1805 to accept the appointment. He was the first U.S. cabinet-level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains, and his appointment boosted Jefferson's popularity in the west.

The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} economic and cultural (re) definition of labor and laborers. It traces the growing reliance <b>upon</b> <b>contingent</b> work {{as the foundation for}} industrial capitalism along the Pacific Coast; the shaping of urban space according to the demands of workers and capital; the formation of a working class subject through the discourse and social practices of both laborers and intellectuals; and workers’ struggles to improve their circumstances in the face of coercive and onerous conditions. Woven together, these strands reveal the consequences of a regional economy built <b>upon</b> <b>contingent</b> and migratory forms of labor. This workforce was hardly new to the American West, but the Pacific Coast’s reliance <b>upon</b> <b>contingent</b> labor reached its apogee after World War I, drawing hundreds of thousands of young men through far flung circuits of migration that stretched across the Pacific and into Latin America, transforming its largest urban centers and working class demography in the process. The presence of this substantial workforce (itinerant, unattached, and racially heterogeneous) was out step with the expectations of the modern American worker (stable, married, and white), and became the warrant for social investigators, employers, the state, and other workers to sharpen the lines of solidarity and exclusion. Beginning in the 1920 s, and coming to a point under the economic weight of the Great Depression, these various constituents created new urban spaces, expressive cultures, and discourses, along with new regulations and forms of protest that would shape the politics of labor in the coming decades. Highlighting the centrality of contingent labor, this study calls into question predominant liberal narratives about modern industrial capitalism. It challenges our understanding of capitalism’s stability and the opportunities afforded to workers in a so-called free market, and lays plain {{the economic and}} cultural realities of a workforce segmented by class and race...|$|R
