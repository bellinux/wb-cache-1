The atmosphere generated by the dystopian <b>Combine</b> state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman <b>Combine</b> characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2.

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of <b>Combine</b> construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the <b>Combine,</b> housing both <b>Combine</b> Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the <b>Combine</b> to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic <b>Combine</b> combat machines.|$|E
