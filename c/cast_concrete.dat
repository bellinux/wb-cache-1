The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the Near East, and large, windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave {{was not part of the}} original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E

25|$|The {{stations}} were very attractive <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> with marble interiors, and using high platforms for faster passenger loading and unloading.

From 180th Street to Columbus Avenue the line was four tracks, then double track to White Plains and Port Chester. Two stations on the White Plains line had four tracks, although express-train operation using the four-track stations did not prove to be warranted by the traffic volume.|$|E

One in every four sleepers are now steel, with a one in two ratio on curves with a radius under 120m. Some cuttings were also widened in the 1980s and 1990s. Most cuttings are in earth or rock, but some have concrete lining or stone pitching in parts. Some timber bridge components, {{such as the}} piles or headstocks of trestles, {{have been replaced by}} steel, or whole trestles have been replaced by concrete piers. There are a large number of small open concrete drains passing under the line. Early <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> pipes and culverts (not reinforced) along the line will be replaced with reinforced concrete pipes if the originals collapse.|$|E

In the rear, a second, shorter tower contained the restaurant. The main buildings were built of structural clay tile with terra-cotta glazed brick. The two towers are clad in stucco with decorative green and gold glazed terra-cotta tiles and <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> stepped forms. Designed {{to attract the attention of}} the passing motorists, the towers also feature geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, and are outlined with neon lighting added additional character and uniqueness to the building's design.|$|E

The two established a core of investors to build a new hotel on an [...] site in Scottsdale and to design it, they hired Edward L. Varney, one of the most prominent local architects of the time. Varney set the hotel around a central pool lounge and used extended horizontal lines in the wings where rooms included air conditioning for year-round operation, a first for Scottsdale. A curving porte-cochere with abstract Southwestern designs in <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> opened onto a high-ceiling lobby which gave guests a [...] "sense of arrival", a feature often used by Frank Lloyd Wright. The tall lobby connected the guests to a restaurant, a lounge, a nightclub, and the central pool.

The project was completed on December 20, 1956 at a cost of $1.5million, an amount equivalent to $million in current value.|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{has proven}} that the {{microscopic}} {{geometry of the}} human bone (figure 1) is able to bear weights {{and at the same}} time to be light in weight. This quality, in combination with the attractive image of it, gave us a new field of interest for using this kind of morphology in a façade element. This type of element – free form - is an example of the forms that are pursued more frequently by contemporary architects. The growing interest for these free formed elements sparks the need for new approaches to production processes. The approach of the production process of free formed concrete elements has usually been influenced by the traditional method of <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> into stiff moulds. In most cases this has lead to very complex and labor intensive production processes resulting into rather irregular concrete surfaces. In this project a different approach towards <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> has been chosen to develop a less complex production method that moreover, results into smoother surfaces. To achieve this goal a mould has been made out of EPDM rubber. Sheets of this material were locally pressed together with wooden discs. In the process of <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> the elasticity of the material under influence of the concrete pressure leads to deflections. By being able to control these deflections up to a certain level, it is possible to produce elements that resemble the microscopic bone structure up to a satisfying level. The research that has been done has lead to a mockup of a façade element out of fiber reinforced concrete (figure 2). In this particular project a model resembling a bone structure was chosen, however the production process enables several forms and patterns resulting in double curved and smooth surfaces...|$|R
