Deformation patterns of <b>co-extrusion</b> of two different materials are characterized by several process parameters. In this paper, the analysis is focused to investigate the effect of contact conditions along the interface between two different materials. The rigid-plastic finite element method was applied to the analysis of <b>co-extrusion</b> process. The selected materials are AA 1100 aluminum alloy as hard material and CDA 110 as soft one.

A functionally designed material has functional properties that are specifically tailored for an application by changing the macrostructure (100 ’s of microns) with little or no change in overall composition. Thus, <b>co-extrusion</b> can be used to improve the functional properties of composite materials, with or without a concurrent boost of its intrinsic properties. An example of a functionally designed material with a coaxially co-extruded architecture, known in the ceramic field as a “fibrous monolith”, has elongated cells of a major (70 - 90 vol. %) phase surrounded by cell boundaries of a minor (10 - 30 vol. %) phase.

40|$|Summary. Improvement of {{the theory}} and methods of {{calculation}} of extrusion equipment is a problem whose solution provides the optimal design of its components {{in order to obtain}} the desired product quality. As the quality of the extrudate, extrusion machine performance is largely determined by the mode of pre matrix zone worm, article considers the mathematical model of the extrusion process for this particular zone of the extruder. Using <b>co-extrusion</b> will greatly expand the range of multicomponent products, balanced chemical composition and with programmable features. In their manufacture the inner layer is formed from fatvitamin fillings and an outer shell - of the extrusion obtained cereal-based. To ensure the stability of the <b>co-extrusion</b> process forming head channels must be designed so that the pressure generated therein is sufficient to distribute the material and the residence time therein of the extrudate is minimized.

40|$|Prior to the {{restructuring}} of the Prometheus Program, the NRPCT was tasked with delivering a nuclear space reactor. Potential NRPCT nuclear space reactor designs for the Prometheus Project required dissimilar materials to be in {{contact with each other}} while operating at extreme temperatures under irradiation. As a result of the high reactor core temperatures, refractory metals were the primary candidates for many of the reactor structural and cladding components. They included the tantalum-base alloys ASTAR- 811 C and Ta- 10 W, the niobium-base alloy FS- 85, and the molybdenum base alloys Moly 41 - 47. 5 Rhenium. The refractory metals were to be joined to candidate nickel base alloys such as Haynes 230, Alloy 617, or Nimonic PE 16 either within the core if the nickel-base alloys were ultimately selected to form the outer core barrel, or at a location exterior to the core if the nickel-base alloys were limited to components exterior to the core. To support the need for dissimilar metal joints in the Prometheus Project, a <b>co-extrusion</b> experiment was proposed. There are several potential methods for the formation of dissimilar metal joints, including explosive bonding, friction stir welding, plasma spray, inertia welding, HIP, and <b>co-extrusion.</b> Most of these joining methods are not viable options because they result in the immediate formation of brittle intermetallics. Upon cooling, intermetallics form in the weld fusion zone between the joined metals. Because brittle intermetallics do not form during the initial bonding process associated with HIP, <b>co-extrusion,</b> and explosive bonding, these three joining procedures are preferred for forming dissimilar metal joints. In reference to a Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory report done under a NASA sponsored program, joints that were fabricated between similar materials via explosive bonding had strengths that were directly affected by the width of the diffusion barrier. It was determined that the diffusion zone should not exceed a critical thickness (0. 0005 in.). A diffusion barrier that exceeded this thickness would likely fail. The joint fabrication method must therefore mechanically bond the two materials causing little or no interdiffusion upon formation. <b>Co-extrusion</b> fits this description since it forms a mechanical joint between two materials by using heat and pressure. The two materials to be extruded are first assembled and sealed within a <b>co-extrusion</b> billet which is subsequently heated and then extruded through a die. For a production application, once the joint is formed, it is dejacketed to remove the outer canister. The remaining piece consists of two materials bonded together with a thin diffusion barrier. Therefore, the long-term stability of the joint is determined primarily by the kinetics of interdiffusion reaction between the two materials. An experimental design for <b>co-extrusion</b> of refractory metals and nickel-based superalloys was developed to evaluate this joining process and determine the long-term stability of the joints...|$|E

Selective dissolution of the PA(6) part of the assemblies permits to first dose the surface density of copolymer, and second to analyze by AFM imaging the incidence of the copolymer surface density on the crystalline morphology at the interface. These experiments are {{a first step toward}} the identification of the key parameters controlling the fracture toughness in these multilayer films...|$|E
40|$|Coating a layer onto {{a support}} {{membrane}} {{can serve as}} a means of surface functionalization of membranes. Frequently, this procedure is a two-step process. In this paper, we describe a concept of membrane preparation in which a coating layer forms in situ onto a support membrane in one step by a <b>co-extrusion</b> process. Our aim is to apply a thin ion exchange layer (sulfonated polyethersulfone, SPES) onto a polysulfone support. The mechanical stability and adhesion of the ion-exchange material to the hydrophobic support membrane (polysulfone) has been studied by a systematic approach of initial proof-of-principle experiments, followed by single layer and double-layer flat sheet casting. Critical parameters quantified by the latter experiments are translated into the <b>co-extrusion</b> spinning process. The composite hollow fiber membrane has low flux as a supported liquid membrane for the copper removal due to the low ion exchange capacity of the SPES. The coating layer of the composite membrane is porous as indicated by gas pair selectivity close to unity. However, our new composite membrane has good nanofiltration properties: it passes mono and bivalent inorganic salts but rejects larger charged organic molecules. The experimental work demonstrates that <b>co-extrusion</b> can be a viable process to continuously prepare surface tailored hollow fiber membranes in a one-step process, even if the support and coating material differ significantly in hydrophilicity...|$|E
