The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the earrings with a tiara from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop Earrings passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E

50|$|More {{complex and}} {{elaborate}} <b>chandeliers</b> {{continued to be}} developed throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, but the widespread introduction of gas and electricity had devalued the <b>chandelier's</b> appeal as a status symbol.|$|R
50|$|When {{originally}} constructed, the Great Hall {{also included}} three large <b>chandeliers</b> and ten long wooden benches that incorporated heating and lighting into their framework. However, {{sometime during the}} station's history prior to the 2012 renovation, the <b>chandeliers</b> were replaced with flat fluorescent panels.

5000|$|Classic <b>chandeliers</b> have {{arrays of}} hanging crystal prisms to {{illuminate}} {{a room with}} refracted light, while contemporary <b>chandeliers</b> assumes a more minimalist design that does not contain prisms and illuminates a room with direct light from the lamps, sometimes also equipped with translucent glass covering each lamp. Modern <b>chandeliers</b> has a more modernized design that uses LEDs, and combines the elements of both classic and contemporary designs; some also equipped with refractive crystal prisms or small mirrors ...|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} {{illuminated}} by two-tierd bronze <b>chandeliers,</b> each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The <b>chandeliers,</b> designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, {{although they are}} significantly smaller than the main <b>chandeliers.</b> The redesign also called for a gold smalt-covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor.|$|R
5|$|A silver cross {{originally}} {{stood on}} its conical dome and a crystal <b>chandelier,</b> bought by King Smbat II from India, {{hang in the}} cathedral. In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E

2500|$|Both Or Zaruaa Synagogues also {{resemble}} {{each other}} in several aspects of their interior design, such as the high ceilings, the marble stone walls with engraved dedications, colored stained glass tall curved windows, the ladies gallery (ezrat nashim) design and the unique multiple illuminating <b>chandeliers.</b> The <b>chandeliers,</b> originally from Italy, are still present in both synagogues, although they are now electric. The <b>chandeliers</b> gave the name Or Zaruaa a special meaning since [...] "Or" [...] in Hebrew means [...] "light".|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the chapel was {{extensively}} restored {{with the assistance}} of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the <b>chandelier,</b> given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel. The Chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Tobin and the Senior Organ Scholar for 2010-11 was Edwin Lock. At that time David Maw was appointed Director of Chapel Music.|$|E
5|$|The Unitarian Chapel retains {{much of its}} {{original}} interior, including square Corinthian columns, Oak galleries and a carved wooden pulpit. A large brass <b>chandelier</b> was donated to the chapel later in the 18th century by Nathaniel Webb, one the town's members of parliament. In 1881, the building's frontage was decorated with stucco to an Italianate style. Each floor is split {{by a number of}} Corinthian pilasters, and the doorway is framed by two pairs of similar identical pilasters, and topped by a triangular pediment. On the ground floor, there are four round-headed windows, while the first floor has five round-headed window bays, though the outer pairs are blocked. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1952.|$|E
5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long <b>chandelier</b> {{earrings}} made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond.

However, she {{was not able to}} use them until she had her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E

As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan <b>chandelier.</b> Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging <b>chandelier,</b> which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the <b>chandelier</b> took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a <b>chandelier</b> above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
