25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> <b>plants</b> are the lowest cost power plant option.

25|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of using}} coal as a fuel source is the emission {{of carbon dioxide}} and other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and particulates. Almost all coal-fired power <b>plants</b> use <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> combustion, which grinds the coal to increase the surface area, burns it to make steam, and runs the steam through a turbine to generate electricity. <b>Pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> <b>plants</b> can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted and harder to separate. In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion.

40|$|AbstractA {{conceptual}} design study {{was performed to}} quantitatively evaluate a range of solar augmented steam cycle design options for natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) and <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> power <b>plants.</b> Solar augmented steam cycle options were modeled for two direct steam generation (DSG) solar technologies: 500 °C line-focus (parabolic trough or linear Fresnel reflector) and 565 °C central receiver. Fossil-fuel power plant designs included NGCC with duct firing and subcritical <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal.</b> All of the {{conceptual design}}s utilized steam generated by a solar field to offset some of the fossil fuel required to generate power. The performance of multiple integration options was evaluated using thermodynamic models to provide a quantitative comparison of plant retrofit design options. Based on the available steam conditions for the DSG technologies {{and the results of}} past modeling studies, solar steam was assumed to be integrated with the main steam supply at the exit of the heat recovery steam generator superheater for the NGCC <b>plant.</b> For the <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> <b>plant,</b> solar steam was integrated into the main steam header after the superheater. Steam integration at these high temperature points in the Rankine cycle is the most thermodynamically optimal design. For both plant types, feedwater was extracted from the boiler feedwater pump discharge. Using the thermodynamic analysis results, the solar augment potential across nearly half of the U. S. states was estimated for existing coal and gas plants that met certain age, solar resource, land availability and other criteria. The gigawatt (GW) deployment potential for DSG solar technologies was compared to the equivalent potentials for previously analyzed oil-based parabolic trough and molten salt central receiver technologies [1]. Solar use efficiency and plant heat rate improvement were the primary metrics used to compare the relative performance of the solar technology options. The deployment potentials were significant, particularly for the technologies with the highest solar steam temperatures. If line-focus DSG technologies can successfully achieve temperatures approaching 500 °C (932 °F), this study indicates that the solar augment potential is nearly double the capacity estimates for lower temperature troughs. Over 25 GW of solar augment capacity was estimated in the U. S.

25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon.

The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v.

With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> <b>plant,</b> the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world.

The modeling methodology {{was based on an}} integrated use of furnace probing measurements coupled with different simulation tools: CFD code (IPSE) for 3 D simulation of combustion chambers, PROATES for the convection pass, and Chemical Engineering Models (RNA) for pollutant emissions and burnout predictions. The solid phase included heterogeneous NO reduction by char and heterogeneous char oxidation with a detailed population balance (800 size burnout classes) keeping track of size, density change and burnout. As working case, to better explain the potentiality offered by this analytical approach, a study addressed to evaluate the best firing configuration for a tangentially-fired utility boiler supplied with <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> by employing synthesis gas (syngas) as secondary fuel is presented. The case studied was chosen as increasing attention to the use of renewable and sustainable energy resources has led to consider, as near term option, the possibility of co-firing syngas (i. e. synthetic gas produced by gasification of biomass or waste) with coal in the existing large-scale <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> power <b>plants.</b> This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 30 th International Symposium on Combustion (Chicago, IL 7 / 25 - 30 / 2004) ...|$|R
