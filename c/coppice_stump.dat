40|$|Aims: Growers of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{plantations}} {{can establish}} second and later rotations from coppice or by replanting with seedlings. At most locations where E. globulus is grown commercially, water availability {{is a major}} driver for productivity. Thus growers must consider which reestablishment technique will maximize productivity whilst sustaining site resources for subsequent rotations. In this study we aimed to compare the stand-scale water balance components of young coppice and seedling E. globulus. Methods: A second rotation E. globulus coppice and seedling trial was monitored for two successive seasonal cycles. Coppice and seedling plots were instrumented with sap flow- and meteorological-sensors so that stand-scale water balance components could be estimated on a daily time step. Results: Stand-scale transpiration rate (E) and rate of interception (EI) were larger in coppice compared to seedlings, but the rate of soil evaporation (ES) was lower. At approximately 2 years of age each <b>coppice</b> <b>stump</b> {{was reduced to a}} single dominant stem, a standard management practice for E. globulus growers, which reduced stem biomass by approximately 70 % and caused E to fall to a value approximating that in seedlings. The cumulative transpiration of coppice was 425 mm greater than seedlings up to 34 months of age. Without the coppice reduction (down to one stem/stump), we estimate that the difference would have been much greater. The water-use efficiency of stem production (WUEstem) was greater in young coppice compared to seedlings but this benefit is likely to be offset by the loss of biomass (and thus transpired water) during coppice stem reduction. Conclusion: Under the conditions of this study, which included reducing coppice to a single stem, reestablishment with seedling E. globulus resulted in a higher water-use efficiency of stem biomass production compared to coppice of a similar age...|$|E

The following measurements were taken during September and October for the parameters: - Survival percent for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings and natural regeneration. - Coppicing power (number of <b>coppice</b> per <b>stump).</b> - <b>Coppicing</b> percent number of <b>coppicing</b> <b>stumps</b> out of the ten stumps for each age class. - Diameter at root collar for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings and natural regeneration and at the coppice shoot bas for coppice using a small caliber. - Height for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings, natural regeneration and coppice shoot using steal tape. The result indicated the superiority of seedlings giving 100 % survival 0. 54 cm diameter and 56. 5 cm height, while regeneration by seeds gave 4 % survival 0. 18 cm diameter and 15. 6 cm mean height. Also the result indicated that the best coppicing power (11 <b>coppice</b> shoot per <b>stump)</b> and best <b>coppicing</b> percent (80 - 90 %) was given by age class (5 - 10) (10 - 15 years), while coppicing power of (1 - 2) <b>coppice</b> shoot per <b>stump</b> and <b>coppicing</b> percent of (10 – 20 %) was given by age class (15 – 20 years) viii Acacia seyal variety seyal is recommended to be regenerated by seedlings in rain-fed areas on dark cracking clays in Gedarif state as the best methods of regeneration in small scale programs.

40|$|Regeneration of {{eucalypt}} plantations from coppice {{is increasingly}} {{being used in}} Australia to reduce the costs of re-establishment in subsequent rotations. However, little is known on {{whether there are differences}} between the performance of a cut-to-length harvester felling coppiced and planted eucalypt plantations in Australia. The study compared single-grip harvester cycle times, time elements and post-harvest stump dimensions between first rotation planted and second rotation coppiced Eucalyptus globulus stands with similar sized trees on two comparable sites in the south-west of Western Australia. Cycle times were significantly lower at the coppiced site compared with those at the planted site. At the mean pooled tree volume, harvester productivity at the planted site was 19. 1 Green Metric tonne(GMt) / productive machine hour (PMH 0) and 23. 4 GMt/PMH 0 at the coppiced site. The difference in harvester productivity was believed to be caused by reduced bark adhesion at the coppiced site following 51 mm of rain immediately prior to the study after an extended dry period. Felling time was significantly longer at the coppiced site (8 % more time than at the planted site) because the operator had to spend more time manoeuvring the harvester head to avoid or remove small shoots at the base of many <b>coppiced</b> trees. <b>Stump</b> height and volume were significantly greater at the coppiced site (7. 7 m 3 /ha) compared with those at the planted site (4 m 3 /ha) because the shape of the <b>coppiced</b> <b>stumps</b> and the design of the harvester head did not allow the stumps to be cut shorter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Over 90 % of {{the energy}} {{consumed}} {{in the country is}} depending on woody biomass. The rising demand for tree products and expanding population pressure resulted in decline of forest cover and consequently the demand for tree products exceeded the supply. This study was conducted at Armania Kebele with the aim of to evaluate different cutting time and management practices yielding more wood biomass volume. One indigenous tree species, preferable by the farmers, namely Acacia nilotica was selected and the experiment design in 3 x 4 factorial experiment with randomized complete block design arrangement and replicated three wise. Eight trees per plot were planted in two rows with 2 meter spacing. The result shows that, Acacia nilotica could be coppiced well with 13 to 29 numbers of <b>coppices</b> per <b>stump</b> at all stages of cutting time. Root collar diameter and plant height were highly correlated with growth period. Hence, Leaving of two and three number of coppices could give higher woody biomass volumes as compare to leaving one and all number of coppices and control (uncut). Therefore it is necessary that farmers should allow two and three number <b>coppice</b> per <b>stump</b> to get high woody biomass volume for fuel-wood consumption...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} natural {{regeneration}} involves {{the renewal of}} forests by means of self-sown seeds, root suckers, or coppicing. In natural forests, conifers rely almost entirely on regeneration through seed.

50|$|Ancient woods were {{valuable}} {{properties for}} their owners, {{as a source}} of wood fuel, timber (estovers and loppage) and forage for pigs (pannage). In southern England, hazel was particularly important for coppicing, the branches being used for wattle and daub in buildings, for example. Such old <b>coppice</b> <b>stumps</b> are easily recognised for their current overgrown state, now that the practice has largely disappeared. Large boles emerge from a common stump in such overgrown coppice stools. Originally, the term of 'forest' did not refer solely to woodland; it also included parkland, open heathland, upland fells, and any other territory, between or outside of manorial freehold, and was the exclusive hunting preserve of the monarch, or granted to nobility. The ancient woods that were within forests, were frequently Royal Parks, enjoying special protection against poachers and other interlopers, and subject to tolls and fines where trackways passed through them or when firewood was permitted to be collected or other licence granted. The forest law was very strictly enforced, by a hierarchy of foresters, parkers and woodwards. In English land law, it was illegal to assart any part of a royal forest. This was the greatest trespass that could be committed in a forest, being more than a waste: for whereas waste of the forest involves felling trees, they can grow again; assarting involves completely rooting up trees within the woodland of the afforested area.|$|R

Depending on the severity of decay this could threaten the productivity of the coppice rotation by affecting wood quality or causing complete loss of trees due to wind-throw. A trial {{was set up in}} an 18 - 24 month old E. globulus coppice plantation to test the relative ability of each of the commonly observed fungi to decay wood of actively growing coppice shoots. Each of the six species was inoculated into coppice shoots using wooden dowels previously colonised in the laboratory.

A hole slightly larger than the dowel was drilled at each inoculation point, the dowel introduced and then covered with Parafilm™. Control inoculations were performed by inoculating a separate coppice stem on the same stump with sterile dowels. All coppice shoots were harvested after 6 months. Decay was assessed by measuring and calculating the volume of lesions or discoloration at the point of inoculation. Differences in wood density between sound and discoloured wood were also measured.

40|$|The {{technical}} standards and regulations ruling coppicing procedures {{have been changed}} in recent years, and they mainly focused on the minimal rotation age of the coppice woodland, on the size and contiguity of area to be coppiced, and on the standard trees. For the latter, the discussion concerned almost exclusively the number, characteristics and spatial distribution of standards whereas the traditionally reported role played by them in term of future gamic regeneration process, {{as well as the}} characteristics and dynamics of the long term process itself, is far to be studied and clarified. The objective of this work, carried out in a Quercus pubescens coppice woodland in the province of Florence, Central Italy, is to analyze the dynamics of the population of seedlings since the time of felling in 1980 over the next 20 years. This work examined changes in number of seedlings, the age of seedlings, the development of agamic regeneration. Main results: (a) in about 20 years since felling any of the survived seedling grew to sapling; (b) mortality rate of seedlings was initially very high, gradually decreasing over the years; (c) spatial distribution varies in space and time, and is related to the presence either absence of the standard trees; (d) over the years, there was a severe selection among the <b>coppice</b> <b>stumps</b> and among the coppice shoots, some of which die, without however be replaced by seed-born trees. It emerged the marginal role of the populations of seedlings, both in terms of replacement of died stumps, and in recruitment of the new standards (&# 8220;allievi&# 8221;).

This ‘wild’ Prosopis, in Tana River County popularly known as Mathenge, did not limit itself to the canal banks and it also blossomed along roads, in the fields and villages. By 1991, Prosopis had solved the fuelwood problem and tenants even earned income by burning charcoal. The pods were used as animal food and wind erosion in the area was reduced.

40|$|The {{economics}} of short-rotation pulpwood plantations of Eucalyptus globulus as a coppice crop {{are influenced by}} stump survival and subsequent coppice growth rates. This study revealed significant genetic diversity in coppicing traits, both within and between subraces, following felling in a progeny trial after 9 years of growth. A total of 67 % of trees coppiced after 14 months, but subraces varied from 43 to 73 %. Heritabilities for coppice success (0. 07) and subsequent growth (0. 16 – 0. 17) were low but statistically significant. Strong genetic correlation between presence/absence of coppice, the number of stems <b>coppicing</b> from the <b>stump</b> and modal <b>coppice</b> height, indicate that selection is possible by using the binary trait. The ability of a tree to coppice was genetically correlated with tree growth prior to felling (rg = 0. 61) and with nursery-grown seedling traits, where large genetic differences were observed {{in the development of}} lignotubers. Coppicing was genetically correlated with the number of nodes with lignotubers (rg = 0. 66) and seedling stem diameter at the cotyledonary node (rg = 0. 91). These traits were uncorrelated with later age growth and with each other. The results suggest that coppicing is influenced by three independent mechanisms—lignotuber development, enlargement of the seedling stem at the cotyledonary node and vigorous growth—which enhance ability to survive catastrophic damage, and indicate that both lignotuber and coppice development can be altered by both natural and artificial selection...|$|R

Grey alder stands {{currently}} take up 10. 2 % or 329 700 ha of {{the total}} forest area, and the area of these stands is continuing to increase mainly in non-managed agricultural lands of private owners (Central Statistical Bureau, 2007). The reforestation of cutting areas harvested in the wintertime by grey alder root and <b>stump</b> <b>coppices</b> reaches 35 - 150 thousand per hectare in the first year. The amount of coppices decreases to 16 - 47 % in the following 3 years. The first thinning of young alder stands can be recommended at an age of 3 - 5 years by decreasing the number of trees to 4000 - 5000 per ha. The research showed that the resurgence with root and stump offspring in grey alder clearings was intense, and no expenses were required for forest restoration.

40|$|Student Number : 0215337 D - MSc {{research}} report - School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Science - Faculty of ScienceThe impact of charcoal production on populations of selected savanna tree species was investigated on clay soils in Catuane, southern Mozambique. The {{study focused on}} answering questions related to the contribution of charcoal production to the local economy, the way populations of selected species were changed by the activity {{and the way in}} which they recover. Acacia nigrescens, Acacia nilotica and Ziziphus mucronata were identified as being amongst the most utilised species for charcoal production due to their hard wood quality. The charcoal production is being done by individuals from outside the local community. They are able to generate relatively high revenues from their product, which they sell to external markets, notably Maputo. The local community do not share in the benefits of the production. Interviews with members of the local community, indicated that they would prefer the activity to be stopped or more rigourously controlled. A comparison was made between adjacent harvested and un-harvested areas to assess the effects of charcoal production on the tree populations. Population structure by stem circumference classes were broadly similar in all three study species being characterised by a high frequency in the smallest circumference class. All other classes had considerably lower frequencies. With regards density, Acacia nigrescens and Acacia nilotica showed significantly lower densities in the harvested area. Ziziphus mucronata showed no significant difference. The frequency of stump circumference classes of Acacia nigrescens and Acacia nilotica were normally distributed with the class 81 - 90 cm being the most common. Ziziphus mucronata data were skewed to the left, with most stumps in the class 52 - 60 cm. Stump heights were mostly in the region of 20 cm. Circumferences of stumps were similar across the study species, being in the region of 90 cm. <b>Coppicing</b> in <b>stumps</b> was relatively poorly developed, with the majority of stumps having no successful coppice shoots. Kilns had an average density of two kilns per hectare. There was an inverse relationship between species abundance and mean harvesting radius. The results of the study indicate that harvesting has had an effect on species abundance and population structures. With decreases in density and a shift in age distribution towards a predominance of juvenile trees. However, the results are not unequivocal, since the area is not pristine and may have been subjected to other activities before harvesting for charcoal. The charcoal producers appear to harvest all sizes of tree. Their production data, approximately 1300 kg of charcoal produced per hectare, indicate the potential for over utilisation of the woodland resource. Futhermore their practice of cutting at low height subjects the stumps to growth retarding elements such as herbivory and fire, possibly contributing towards relatively unsuccessful coppicing and exacerbating the sustainability issue. To address these issues, along with the socio-economics issues, appropriate structures need to be implemented by government, in consultation with communities...|$|R
40|$|In {{northeast}} Brazil grazing {{is a major}} use {{of much of the}} semiarid woodlands (caatinga). Animal {{production is}} limited by lack of dry season forage, primarily deciduous tree leaves. Management is constrained by the persistence of undesirable trees that sprout from the <b>stump</b> (<b>coppice).</b> This study evaluates the possibility of manipulating coppicing trees to improve caatinga management, particularly dry season forage production. The season of cutting can influence coppicing. Trees were cut early and late in the wet and dry seasons. After two years, trees of all species cut in the late wet season produced less biomass than those cut in other seasons. Production of most species was maximized by cutting in the dry season. Desirable species should be cut during the dry season to maximize production and less desirable ones in the late rainy season to reduce coppicing. Seasonal cutting does not cause mortality, nor can it cause any prolonged change in the leaf: stem ratio. Another study quantifies the response to defoliation of coppice growth by goat browsing or manual removal. The palatable browse species sabia and catingueira suffered no mortality while less palatable species experienced significant mortality. One year after defoliation, defoliated trees still produced less biomass than non-defoliated trees. Browsed stumps sprouted again during the dry season. Changes in the abscission phenology of coppice growth were observed. Coppice growth retained leaves from 2 to 12 weeks longer than intact trees of the same species. Regrowth on browsed stumps remained green {{for the duration of the}} S month dry season. Delaying abscission regulates the availability of dry season forage, and has implications for animal production that merit further investigation. Coppice growth can be manipulated to change the species composition of the regenerating stand, improve seasonal forage balance, and reduce site disturbance. Changing from even-aged to uneven-aged management might facilitate these changes. Prospects for improving wood production are better than animal production because of the limits imposed by mixed production systems, land tenure, and human population growth...|$|R

Ten villages located in the former communal areas and homelands within three broad vegetation types (i. e., Mixed lowveld bushveld, Eastern thorn bushveld, and Natal lowveld bushveld) were studied. The study, conducted in the framework of the coupled human-environment system poses challenges to both scientists and managers (e. g., setting common goals). Data were collected using modified Whittaker plots (MWP) and focus group discussions (FGD), denoting ecology and society, respectively. There were nine 1000 m² MWP plots sampled per village, each having nested 1 m², 10 m² and 100 m² subplots. The FGD involved six groups of local people based on gender and age. The study revealed that the harvesting of woody plant species is a source of local disturbance to woody vegetation. Generally, there were more woody species in locations farther from settlements, having a mean of 41. 97 ± 3. 9, than for the intermediate (38. 27 ± 5. 6) and near locations (19. 9 ± 4. 2) within the 1000 m² plots, the result of the reduction in species closer to settlements from higher harvesting levels. The larger sampling plot size of 1000 m² of the MWP had the highest diversity, decreasing sequentially to the smallest scale (1 m²). The density of the woody species was highest in the intermediate locations (517 ± 80 plants/ha), followed by the far and near, relative to the settlements. The Natal lowveld bushveld broad vegetation type had the highest mean density of trees (573 ± 71 trees/ha) compared to the Mixed lowveld bushveld (366 ± 64 trees/ha) and the Eastern thorn bushveld (312 ± 40 trees/ha). The stem diameters of trees were generally higher in the villages of the Mixed lowveld bushveld than the other two vegetation types. The study reaffirmed that anthropogenic disturbances within savannas impact vegetation and need to be studied concurrently with other disturbance factors (e. g., biotic and abiotic or environmental).
