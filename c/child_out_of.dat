5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired {{her for the first}} time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E

25|$|From a legal standpoint, the Moroccan {{penal code}} {{still does not}} reflect the {{principles}} of gender equality established within the provisions of the Mudawana.

Judges also retain the right to oversee mandatory reconciliation in the case of divorce, which many women's organizations fear will be used to limit women's autonomy during divorce proceedings.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with tears in his eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock.|$|E
25|$|Dinesen's {{early years}} were {{strongly}} influenced by her father's relaxed manner and his love of the outdoor life. He also wrote throughout {{his life and his}} memoir, Boganis Jagtbreve (Letters from the Hunt) became a minor classic in Danish literature. From August 1872 to December 1873, Wilhelm had lived among the Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin, where he fathered a daughter. On returning to Denmark, he suffered from syphilis which resulted in bouts of deep depression. After conceiving a <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock with his maid Anna Rasmussen, he was devastated by breaking his promise to his mother-in-law to remain faithful to his wife. He hanged himself on 28 March 1895 when Karen was almost ten.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that sexual messages contained in film, television, and music {{are becoming more}} explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In television programming aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes {{had at least one}} sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour. Researchers have found a correlation between the amount of television with high sexual content that teenagers watch and an increased likelihood of them becoming pregnant or fathering a <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock, and believe that reducing the amount of sexual content adolescents watch on television could substantially reduce the teen pregnancy rate. By contrast, other scholars have argued that such claims have been premature; Steinberg and Monahan found that media effects diminished once other factors were controlled.|$|E

25|$|As {{traditional}} folklore {{tends to}} portray Wu {{as a power}} hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of asphyxiation or crib death, considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method {{could lead to a}} build-up of fumes that would lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as empress.|$|E
25|$|Born Rakotomavo ("Yellow Man") at Ambohitrontsy (also Ambohitrosy) to Princess Rangorinimerina and her husband, Prince Andriamifonozozoro. He was the {{grandson}} of King Andriamasinavalona of Imerina on his mother's side and was therefore a prince of Imerinatsimo, one of several independent principalities within {{the borders of the}} formerly united Merina kingdom. At the time of Rakotomavo's birth, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana Andriandrazaka was the ruler of Imerina Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest of these Merina principalities. The king's marriages to multiple spouses did not yield heirs, although he was able to father an illegitimate <b>child</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock with a woman of non-noble blood. To satisfy the ancestral requirements establishing legitimacy of a sovereign of Imerina, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana adopted prince Rakotomavo as his heir. The people of Avaradrano had great difficulty accepting him as their legitimate ruler regardless of the king's wishes.|$|E
