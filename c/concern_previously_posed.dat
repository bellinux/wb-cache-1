Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror: here, it is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (in which he may be cured of his madness).|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} issue of {{uplifting}} the potential to de Sitter (dS) vacua in type IIB flux compactifications of Kachru, Kallosh, Linde and Trivedi (KKLT). We shed light on some tension between two constraints on dS vacua in type IIB string theory. One is the well-known and much-discussed constraint {{which leads to the}} no-go theorem that can in principle be evaded. The other follows from 4 -dimensional Einstein's equations, which has, however, been much less discussed in connection with the former constraint. In addition to the challenges <b>previously</b> <b>posed,</b> it is suggested that the uplifting scenarios, in particular, obstruct the evasion of the no-go theorem more strongly than one might have assumed.

Despite the intense research activity {{in the field of}} Temporal MBD, there are three issues that not been analysed in depth: (a) modelling complex interaction of contextual information, (b) evaluation of hypotheses possibility degrees and (c) the structure of explanations.

40|$|AbstractThe star graph, as an {{interesting}} network topology, {{has been extensively}} studied in the past. In this paper, we {{address some of the}} combinatorial properties of the star graph. In particular, we consider the problem of calculating the surface area and volume of the star graph, and thus answering an open problem <b>previously</b> <b>posed</b> in the literature. The surface area of a sphere with radius i in a graph is the number of nodes in the graph whose distance from a given node is exactly i. The volume of a sphere with radius i in a graph is the number of nodes within distance i from the given node. In this paper, we derive explicit expressions to calculate the surface area and volume in the star graph...|$|R
40|$|This piece, {{completed}} {{one month}} after the events of 11 September, examines the sociological presuppositions of the major intellectual and journalistic frameworks used to understand the unfolding 'war on terrorism'. The major frameworks include sociobiology, theodicy, political realism and 'the clash of civilizations'. Mainstream sociological theorizing has been largely absent from the debate, and some of its more fashionable claims (e. g. about our 'informatized world-order') may even be cast into doubt. In general the discussion has resembled the old 'Cold War' rhetoric that was supposedly laid to rest with the fall of the Soviet Union, with 'terrorism' and 'Islam' replacing the threats <b>previously</b> <b>posed</b> by 'totalitarianism' and 'Communism'. The sociology we teach our students may influence whether this tendency continues...|$|R

40|$|Inelastic x-ray {{scattering}} (IXS) now a widely used technique {{for studying the}} dynamics of electrons in condensed matter. We <b>previously</b> <b>posed</b> {{a solution to the}} phase problem for IXS [P. Abbamonte, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 237401 (2004) ], that allows explicit reconstruction of the density propagator of a system. The propagator represents, physically, the response of the system to an idealized, point perturbation, so provides direct, real-time images of electron motion with attosecond time resolution and Å-scale spatial resolution. Here we show that the images generated by our procedure, as it was originally posed, are spatial averages over all source locations. Within an idealized, atomic-like model, we show that in most cases a simple relationship to the complete, un-averaged response can still be determined. We illustrate this concept for recent IXS measurements of single crystal graphite. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
