5000|$|Mental {{toughness}} {{has been}} equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as resilience and hardiness. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness. However, psychologists define resilience {{as a positive}} adaptive process of coping with stress and adversity, {{as opposed to a}} collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a personality trait, which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues {{the use of the term}} mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013). She reported that [...] "the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} age-related changes in the topological organization of structural brain networks by applying a longitudinal design over 6 years. Structural brain networks were derived from measurements of regional gray matter volume and were constructed in age-specific groups from baseline and follow-up scans. The structural brain networks showed economical small-world properties, providing high global and local efficiency for parallel information processing at low connection costs. In the analysis of the global network properties, the local and global efficiency of the baseline scan were significantly lower compared to the follow-up scan. Moreover, the annual rate of changes in local and global efficiency showed a positive and negative quadratic correlation with the baseline age, respectively; both <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> peaked at approximately the age of 50. In the analysis of the regional nodal properties, significant negative correlations between the annual rate of changes in nodal strength and the baseline age were found in the brain regions primarily involved in the visual and motor/ control systems, whereas significant positive quadratic correlations were found in the brain regions predominately associated with the default-mode, attention, and memory systems. The results of the longitudinal study are consistent with the findings of our previous cross-sectional study: the structural brain networks develop into a fast distribution from young to middle age (approximately 50 years old) and eventually became a fast localization in the old age. Our findings elucidate the network topology of structural brain networks and its longitudinal changes, thus enhancing the understanding of the underlying physiology of normal aging in the human brain...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{compositional}} {{spectrum of}} the Variscan batholiths of the Urals, a continuum from gabbros (or diorites) to leucogranites, was produced by crystal fractionation, but the physical mechanisms involved in formation of the bodies remains obscure. To test whether syn-magmatic deformation was essential to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} process, we studied the Main Series of Stepninsk, a pluton emplaced into an active crustal-scale strike-slip shear zone. The Main Series (N 95 vol. % of total granitoids) is high-K calc-alkaline, comprises rocks with SiO 2 from 51 to 77 wt. %, and stands out because most major and many trace elements yield excellent linear or <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> with silica. It includes deformed gabbrodiorites to monzogranites, and undeformed syenogranites to alaskites. Deformed and undeformed rocks are coeval (283 F 2 Ma). All rocks, irrespective of their silica content, have the same initial Sr and Nd isotope ratios (87 Sr / 86 Sr 283 Ma= 0. 70488 F 0. 000131; e(Nd) 283 Ma = 0. 79 F 0. 49), and contain amphibole and biotite with the same compositions. Based on thermodynamic and trace-element fractionation simulations, we propose a model of deformation-driven filter-pressing differentiation consistent with these features. The Main Series is derived from a hydrous high-K granodioritic magma which intruded containing ~ 0. 3 of earlyformed solids. These accumulated locally by flow differentiation to produce the gabbrodiorites. The crystallization continued until the fraction of solids was higher than ~ 0. 55, after which different magma batches were efficiently squeezed by differential stress coupled with the opening of tensile fractures in the shear zone. This process produced a range of residua and segregates...|$|R

A distinct <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> was found between volume and proportion of juvenile wood in tree stems and breast height diameter, height and stem total volume.

It was found that the above-mentioned macrostructural elements of wood structure showed a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with the height of measurement points along the tree trunk. As the distance from the base of trunk increased, the width of the annual ring and the width of the latewood zone decreased, while the proportion of the latewood increased.

40|$|The {{perioperative}} {{management of}} dabigatran is challenging, and recommendations based on activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) are unsatisfactory. Dedicated coagulation tests have limitations at plasma concentrations < 50 ng/ml. Therefore, a more sensitive test, which is available 24 / 7, is required. It was the aim of this study to investigate the performance of the Hemoclot Thrombin Inhibitors® LOW (HTI LOW) kit, a diluted thrombin time, and the STA® – ECA II (ECA-II) kit, a chromogenic variant of the ecarin clotting time, that were developed to measure low dabigatran concentrations, compared to reference dabigatran analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study included 33 plasma samples from patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who had plasma concentrations < 200 ng/ml. HTI LOW and ECA-II were performed along with HTI, aPTT (STA®-C. K. Prest® and SynthasIL ®) and TT (STA® – Thrombin). All procedures were performed according to recommendations by the manufacturers. Linear (or <b>curvilinear)</b> <b>correlations</b> and Bland-Altman analyses were calculated. For free dabigatran concentrations < 50 ng/ml, the R 2 of linear correlations were 0. 69, 0. 84 and 0. 61, with HTI, HTI LOW and ECA-II, respectively. The R 2 for TT, STA®-C. K. Prest® and SynthasIL® were 0. 67, 0. 42 and 0. 15. For HTI, HTI LOW and ECA-II, Bland-Altman analyses revealed mean differences of – 6 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 25 – 14 ng/ml), 1 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 18 – 19 ng/ml) and – 1 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 25 – 23 ng/ml), demonstrating that tests dedicated to measuring low concentrations are more accurate than HTI.

The results of two sampling campaigns corresponding to the rainy season (April-May/ 2000) and rising water season (January/ 2001) are presented. Bioamplification of Hg through the trophic chains of the three lakes was observed. During the rainy season, Hg concentrations in 31 % of predator fish were above the critical value of 500 ng/g, compared to only 28 % in the rising water period. Linear or <b>curvilinear</b> positive <b>correlations</b> between Hg concentrations of muscular tissue and the total length of fish were rarely observed. Various species of commercial importance did not show any variation in Hg concentrations with increasing length of fish. Linear-negative and non-linear positive or negative correlations with Hg throughout the development of fish were also observed. Our data suggest that Hg concentrations may vary seasonally. On the other hand, no spatial variation in Hg concentrations was observed for most of the studied species over the two seasons.

40|$|Continuous wave Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{was performed}} before cardiac catheterisation in 69 consecutive patients with suspected aortic stenosis. Agreement between the maximum {{and the mean}} Doppler gradients and catheterisation gradients was good. Doppler echocardiography, however, systematically underestimated the maximum and mean gradients, particularly in the high range. Stepwise regression analysis of the small pressure {{difference between the two}} methods showed that it could not be explained by age, sex, stroke volume, differences in heart rate, ejection fraction, the presence of coronary artery disease, or severity of aortic regurgitation. There was a negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between the maximum and mean Doppler gradients and the aortic valve areas that were measured at catheterisation in patients with pure aortic stenosis. The degree of correlation decreased when patients with concomitant aortic regurgitation were included. The scatter of gradients above and below the correlation line was large and this was caused by low and high transvalvar flow. These results show that the usefulness of Doppler gradients for judging the severity of aortic stenosis, both in relation to immediate diagnosis and follow up, is severely limited if transvalvar flow is not taken into account...|$|E

However, different INR assays may vary in their results. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the agreement of three different INR methods, compared with thrombin generation, in patients on VKA treatment. Methods: Sixty patients attending the Anticoagulation Clinic at Mater Dei Hospital (Msida, Malta) for VKA monitoring between August and September 2015 were enrolled. The INR was tested using a point-of-care (POC) device (CoaguChek XS Plus, Roche Diagnostics) for both capillary and venous blood samples, a photo-optical (Sysmex CS- 2100 i/CA- 1500, Siemens) and a mechanical clot detection system (Thrombolyzer XRC, Behnk Elektronik). All assays used human recombinant thromboplastin as reagent. Thrombin generation was performed using the calibrated automated thrombogram. Results: There was a negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between the endogenous thrombin potential and different INR assays (râ 8 ̆ 9 ¤-. 75) and a strong positive linear correlation between the CoaguChek XS Plus on capillary samples and the other INR methodologies (râ 8 ̆ 9 ¥. 96).

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to ascertain the relative precision and accuracy of certain estimators on several forest populations and to determine if relative performance could be predicted from knowledge of population characteristics. Performance was tested on three populations of trees drawn from stands in northern Ontario. The first population consisted of 479 spruce and fir trees drawn from an uneven aged second growth spruce-fir stand. The second consisted of 309 maple and birch trees from a mature hardwood stand. The third population was composed of 500 red pine drawn from a forty year old plantation. Measurement data obtained for each tree included breast height diameter and total height. For the spruce-fir and hardwood stands, measurements o height and crown area were also obtained from large scale aerial photography. Estimators for total volume, height and crown area were compared for the test populations. Independent or supplementary variables employed were diameter, height and crown area plus several transformations and combinations of these variables. Four sample sizes, n = 4, 12, 24, and 40 were employed for each of 25 dependent-independent variable combinations considered. Simple expansion, ratio, unbiased ratio, regression and unequal probability estimators and stratified sampling with the simple expansion estimator were compared using Monte Carlo techniques. Relative performance was evaluated using estimates of sampling variances, biases and mean square errors obtained from repeated sampling of the test populations. Results indicated linear and parabolic regression and the Horvitz- Thompson pps estimator were usually among the best three estimators for the two largest sample sizes studied. For the smaller sample sizes, linear egression, the Horvitz- Thompson pps and ratio of means estimators were best. For the estimation of volume using diameter- squared as the supplementary variable, linear regression was the best approach. Parabolic regression using diameter and diameter- squared was equal precise for the larger sample sizes. Major factors affecting the relative performance of estimators were: 1) the form of the dependent-independent variable relationship (linear or <b>curvilinear),</b> 2) the <b>correlation</b> between these variables, 3) the position of the intercept of the population regression line, 4) the variance of the dependent variable given the independent variable and 5) sample size...|$|R

Repetitive Rint measurements were performed in 125 healthy children and 107 asthmatic children (age range 0. 8 – 16. 8 years). In 42 asthmatic patients Rint and MEFV values were compared and in 29 asthmatic children bronch-odilation testing was performed. Successful Rint measurements were possible in 91 % of the children. The mean coefficient of variation of repeated measurements was 7. 1 (± 6. 1) %. Rint values of healthy children showed a significant <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with age (r=− 0. 80, P< 0. 001) and height (r=− 0. 81, P< 0. 001).

Each polymeric sample was oscillated at different frequencies with fixed stress amplitude {{and the changes}} in elastic modulus, viscous modulus, and apparent viscosity were measured at 30 [deg]C. The moisture absorption rate of HPMC in PG:GF solvent mixtures in a 94 % relative humidified environment was also studied.

40|$|Background: Diagnostic reviews {{often include}} the sensitivity/specificity results of {{individual}} studies. A problem occurs when {{these data are}} pooled because the correlation between sensitivity and specificity is generally strongly negative, causing overestimation of the pooled results. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), defined as the odds of true positives vs. that of false positives, may avoid this problem. The aim {{of the study was}} to review the advantages and limitations of the DORs. Methods: A systematic review of 44 previously published diagnostic studies was used as an example. Results: DORs can be readily implemented in diagnostic research. Advantages include: (1) they adjust for the negative and curvilinear correlations between sensitivities and specificities, (2) they take account of the heterogeneity between studies with respect to the different thresholds chosen by the investigators in the original studies, and (3) it is easy to extend the model with covariates representing between-study differences in design. Limitations include: 1) the outcome parameter is a summary estimate of both sensitivity and specificity, and 2) the magnitude of the studies included is not taken into account. Conclusions: Reported sensitivities and specificities of different studies assessing similar diagnostic tests are not only negatively correlated, but also negatively correlated in a curvilinear manner. It is appropriate to take this negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> into account in the data pooling of such meta-analyses. The DORs can be applied for that purpose.

Reflectance was measured in parallel to moisture content and chlorophyll fluorescence in five species of Sphagnum exposed to progressive drought. Decreases in moisture availability caused {{a significant reduction in}} ?PSII for all samples tested. An objective was to ascertain whether Sphagnum ?PSII was better correlated with (i) spectral indices directly related to photosynthetic processes through association with xanthophyll cycle pigmentation (the photochemical reflectance index; PRI), or (ii) indices indirectly correlated with photosynthetic activity but able to detect changes in canopy morphology (the normalized difference vegetation index; NDVI), chlorophyll stability (the structure insensitive pigment index; SIPI), or canopy moisture content (the floating water band index; fWBI). Strongest correlations were found between ?PSII and indices which were indirectly related to ?PSII. Both the SIPI and the NDVI exhibited linear correlations although these relationships were sometimes sample-specific. The fWBI was the index least affected by sample-specific relationships and showed a strong <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with ?PSII. Photosynthetic efficiency was correlated with the PRI but relationships were much weaker than for the other indices used, and in some cases negative. The NDVI and the fWBI show the most potential for monitoring Sphagnum photosynthetic activity at the ecosystem scale.

40|$|Background: Degenerative {{joint disease}} (DJD) in the lumbar spine {{is a common}} {{condition}} {{that is associated with}} chronic low back pain. Excessive loading of lumbar joints is a risk factor for DJD. Changes in lumbar lordosis significantly redistribute the forces of weight-bearing on the facet joints and the intervertebral discs. However, the relationship between lumbar lordosis and DJD has not been characterized in men and women. Methods: We characterised the correlation between standing lumbar lordosis and DJD in standing radiographic images from 301 adult female and male chiropractic patients. DJD was rated using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale, and lordosis was measured using the Cobb angle. Linear and curvilinear correlations were investigated while controlling for age and sex. Results: We found a highly significant <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between lordosis and DJD of the lower lumbar spine in both sexes, but especially in women, irrespective of the effects of age. We found the effect size of lordosis on lower lumbar DJD to be between 17. 4 and 18. 1 % in women and 12. 9 % in older men. In addition, lordosis of 65 (95 % CI 55. 3 - 77. 7) and 68 (98 % CI 58. 7 - 73. 3) degrees were associated with minimal DJD in the lower lumbar spine of women and men respectively, and were therefore considered &# 039;optimal&# 039;. This optimal lordotic angle was 73 (95 % CI 58. 8 - 87. 2) degrees in older men. Conclusions: Both hypo- and hyper-lordosis correlate with DJD in the lumbar spine, particularly in women and in older men.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the relationship between}} subgrade strength and moisture content. Major function of subgrade is to provide support to pavement. Subgrade soil type, compacted density and moisture significantly affect pavement design. Surface and subsurface drainage of pavement and from adjoining land also affect subgrade strength significantly. Subgrade strength is mostly {{expressed in terms of}} California Bearing Ratio. The subgrade strength owing to its inconsistency or variable nature poses a challenge for the engineer {{to come up with a}} perfect design pavement. For example, the subgrade is always subjected to change in its moisture content due to precipitation, capillary action, and flood or subside of water table. Change in moisture content causes change in subgrade strength. It becomes quite essential for an engineer to understand the exact nature of dependence of subgrade strength on moisture content. In this study variation of subgrade strength with moisture content was studied considering, the variation of subgrade strength with days soaking and to analyse the relationship between subgrade strength, moisture and days soaking by used statistical software Mnitab 16. Thus the different soil samples were tested for their proctor density, optimum moisture content, California Bearing Ratio after being soaked in water for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days and Un-soaked for each sample. Study shows that a strong <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between subgrade strength and moisture content. On increasing number of days of soaking, subgrade strength decreases due to increases of moisture content. The rate of change in subgrade strength per percentage change in moisture content during un-soaked from the optimum moisture content was one to seven times larger than during soaking for four days from optimum moisture content with the average of about five times. So it will help design a good road pavement because subgrade is the foundation of road pavement...|$|E

We studied six levels of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (0, 200, 400, 800, 1, 200 and 2, 000 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)) over several growth seasons at high (2, 600 m a. s. l.) and low (800 m a. s. l.) elevation sites. In comparing the same species or genus, I broken vertical bar PSII and PRI were closely correlated in darkness or under {{the same level of}} PPFD, with data obtained from different seasons and elevations pooled for regression analysis. Because both the intercept and slope of the I broken vertical bar PSII-PRI equation showed a negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with PPFD, we could fit an empirical regression model, I broken vertical bar PSII = c + d center dot ln(PPFD) + e center dot[ln(PPFD) ](2) + f center dot PRI + g center dot PRI center dot ln(PPFD) + h center dot PRI center dot[ln(PPFD) ](2), for multiple regression analysis. Using this model, {{we found a}} close correlation between the estimated and measured I broken vertical bar PSII (r (2) = 0. 842 - 0. 937, P < 0. 001) for all four species examined and for mango (Mangifera indica) measured under both artificial illumination and sunlight (data from Weng et al. 2010). This empirical regression model could simulate both seasonal and diurnal variations of leaf-scale photosynthetic efficiency at high and low elevations...|$|E
40|$|Texture is an {{important}} quality parameter in fresh horticultural products. However, its complexity and variability entails that instrumental analyses describe it only partial whereas various properties are involved. For example, product water status, cell wall physical properties and tissue structure interdependently determine compressive and tensile strength, and elastic properties, which all together characterise texture. Furthermore, short-term effects on texture under unfavourable conditions during shelf five may be functionally different from those occurring during long-term storage. During recent years, new methods such as the acoustic impulse-response technique have become available to non-destructively analyse the elastic texture components. In addition, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor can be non-destructively assessed with the pressure bomb in combination with pressure volume analyses in many products. An experiment was designed to comprehensively {{study the effects of}} water status on different tissue elastic parameters. Water potential (Psi), fresh mass, apparent elastic modulus (E, quasi-static compression test), and stiffness factor (S, acoustic impulse-response test) were repeatedly determined on radish tubers during desiccation by free transpiration. E showed a two-phased linear relationship with Psi. At water potentials beyond the turgor-loss-region, the slope of this relationship largely declined. In turgescent tubers a considerable part of the variation of E could be explained by water potential. S showed a less clear two-phased relation and wilting seems to exhibit only minor effects on stiffness. Both E and S increased linearly with pressure potential but S showed a weaker correlation with turgor. While the decline in acoustic stiffness with increasing relative water deficit seemed to follow an exponential model, the correlation between E and RWD could be best described by a power function. E and S increased with increasing volumetric modulus of elasticity (epsilon) in a curvilinear manner. When E and S were compared directly, a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> was found. These results show that S is a good indicator for changes in produce water content. Both parameters are useful to indicate postharvest texture changes. However, the results point toward the possibility, that S is less related to short-term changes of product rigidity than E. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{definitions}} is used to distinguish subjects in whom blood pressure (BP) falls at night (dippers) from their counterparts (nondippers). In an attempt to standardize the definition of nondipping, we determined the nocturnal BP fall and night-day BP ratio by 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring in 4765 normotensive and 2555 hypertensive subjects from 10 to 99 years old. In all subjects combined, the systolic/diastolic nocturnal fall and corresponding ratio averaged (+/- SD) - 16. 7 +/- 11. 0 / - 13. 6 +/- 8. 1 mm Hg and 87. 2 +/- 8. 0 %/ 83. 1 +/- 9. 6 %, respectively. In normotensive subjects, the 95 th percentiles were - 0. 3 /- 1. 1 mm Hg for the nocturnal fall and 99. 7 %/ 98. 3 % for the night-day ratio. Both the fall and ratio showed a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with age. The smallest fall and largest ratio were observed in older (> or = 70 years) subjects. A higher BP on conventional sphygmomanometry {{was associated with a}} larger systolic (partial r =. 11) and diastolic (r =. 12) nocturnal BP fall. The diastolic (r =. 08) but not the systolic night-day ratio increased with higher conventional BP. The nocturnal BP fall was larger and the corresponding night-day ratio smaller in oscillometric (n = 5884) than in auscultatory (n = 1436) recordings, in males (n = 3730) than in females (n = 3590), and in Europe (n = 4556) than in the other continents (n = 2764). The distributions of the nocturnal BP fall and night-day ratio showed considerable overlap among normotensive and hypertensive subjects, but the overlap tended to be larger for the ratio than for the fall. Of all subjects, 3. 2 % had systolic and diastolic ratios of 100 % or more. With adjustments applied for confounders, the probability of being a nondipper increased 2. 8 times (95 % confidence interval, 2. 0 - 4. 0) from 30 to 60 years and 5. 7 times (4. 4 - 7. 4) from 60 to 80 years. The odds ratios were 1. 0 (0. 8 - 1. 4) for males versus females. 1. 6 (1. 2 - 2. 1) for subjects with definite hypertension versus normotensive subjects, 2. 4 (1. 2 - 4. 7) for Asians (n = 2213, 96 % Japanese) versus inhabitants of the other continents, and 2. 4 (1. 5 - 3. 8) for subjects examined with auscultatory versus oscillometric devices. In conclusion, the mathematical definition of nondipping, ie, having a night-day ratio of 100 % or more for systolic and diastolic BPs, closely approximated the 95 th percentiles of the night-day ratio in normotensive subjects. The ratio depends less on BP level than the nocturnal BP fall and is therefore to be preferred in the definition of dipping status. Notwithstanding the present findings, the reproducibility of nondipping and its prognostic significance need further clarification. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} 30 years, at-sea studies of seabirds and marine mammals {{in the oceans}} south of the Subtropical Front have {{described}} an association with major frontal areas. More recently, the advancement in microtechnology has allowed the tracking of individuals and investigations into how these marine predators actually use the frontal zones. In this review, we examine 1) the relative importance to apex predators of the different frontal zones in terms of spatial distribution and carbon flux; 2) the processes that determine their preferential use; and 3) how the mesoscale dynamics of frontal structures drive at-sea foraging strategies of these predators. We review published results from southern waters {{and place them in}} a broader context with respect to what has been learned about the importance of fronts in oceans farther north. Some fronts constitute important boundaries for seabird communities in southern waters. At a mesoscale the maximum values of seabird diversity and abundance correspond to the location of the main fronts. At-sea surveys show a strong <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between seabird abundance and sea surface temperatures. High mean species richness and diversity for whales and seabirds are consistently associated with the southern water mass boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Subtropical Front and the Subantarctic Front; {{in the case of the}} Polar Front mean seabird densities are more variable. At small-scales, variation in seabird occurrence has been directly related to the processes at fronts in a limited number of cases. A significant positive relation was found between some plankton feeding species and frontal temperature gradient–phytoplankton variables. Telemetric studies have revealed that several apex predators (penguins, albatrosses, seals) perform long, directed foraging trips either to the Subtropical front or Polar Front, depending on locality. Seabirds with low flight costs, such as albatrosses, are able to reach fronts at long distances from colonies, showing variable foraging strategies as a function of the distances involved. Diving birds such as King penguins, that travel at a higher cost and lower speed, rely on the predictable spatial distribution of mesopelagic fish found close to the Polar Front. They may use the currents associated with eddies as oceanographic cues in the active search for frontal zones. Once in these areas they dive preferentially in and below the depth of the thermocline where catches per unit effort are high. Elephant seals concentrate foraging activity principally inside or at the boundary of cyclonic eddies. These mesoscale features appear to offer exceptional productivity favourable for foraging by various diving top predators. The connection between biophysical parameters at fronts and predators is likely to be made through biological enhancement. Top predators appear to forage at locations where prey are advected by physical processes and others where prey are produced locally. Long-term research on at-sea distributions and demographic parameters of top predators are essential to assess the consequences of potential shift in front distributions in relation to global warming. Such environmental changes would add to the impact of fish extraction by the industrial fisheries on the southern food webs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there was a significant relationship between scores on the Extraversion and Neuroticism scales of the Eysenck Personality Inventory and the academic achievement and attrition of freshman students in the Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning for academic year 1974 - 75. The study also attempted to determine whether the addition of Extraversion and Neuroticism scores to the objective admission criteria presently used by the University would add significantly to the predictability of achievement and attrition. The sample used in this study consisted of 76 students beginning their freshman year in the College of Architecture and Planning in the Fall Quarter of 1974. The students were administered the Eysenck Personality Inventory on their first day on campus together. At the end of Spring Quarter, 1975, grade point averages were compiled. Twenty-one of the original 76 students in the sample had dropped out of the Architecture and Planning program. Multiple linear regression equations were used to ascertain the degree of correlation between Extraversion and academic achievement as well as to determine whether the addition of Extraversion to the objective criteria used by the University would significantly increase the accuracy of prediction of academic achievement and attrition of the sample. The relationship between Neuroticism and academic achievement was tested using a polynomial regression equation and the coefficient of <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation.</b> The relationship between Neuroticism and attrition was presented in a scattergram. The following conclusions regarding the relationship between the Eysenckian variables Extraversion and Neuroticism and the academic achievement and attrition of the sample were drawn from the research data: 1. There was no significant correlation between Extraversion scores and the academic achievement of the sample in coursework within the College of Architecture and Planning. 2. There was no significant correlation between Extraversion and the overall University academic achievement in the sample. 3. There was no significant correlation between Extraversion and attrition of the sample. 4. Extraversion did not add to the predictability of achievement or attrition which was obtainable from the criteria presently used by the University to screen applicants for admission to the College of Architecture and Planning. 5. There was no significant correlation between prior college experience and attrition of the sample. 6. There was no significant linear or curvilinear relationship between Neuroticism and the academic achievement or attrition of the sample. It was found to have no value at all as a predictor for the sample. In the literature reviewed, the majority of the research studies on the relationship between Neuroticism and academic achievement reported a curvilinear relationship between the two, with moderately high scores on the Neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory being considered optimal for high academic achievement. The results of the present study on not conform to these findings; no relationship was found between Neuroticism and the achievement and attrition of the sample. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
