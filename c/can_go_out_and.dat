500|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined {{the first two}} positions, {{while the rest of}} the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The main thing [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race. I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> have fun and not worry about where I finish or getting a good starting spot for the Daytona 500." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, during {{qualifying}}, forty-six {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three {{were able to}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Edwards clinched his seventh pole position during his career, {{with a time of}} 26.395, which made a new track record. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Allmendinger. Kurt Busch qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Jamie McMurray started fifth. Hamlin, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Johnson was scored twenty-first. The three drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Joe Nemechek, Michael McDowell, and Jason Leffler. Once the qualifying session completed, Edwards commented, [...] "The first thing that we’re going to have an advantage Sunday is with our pit stall, that’s going to help us a lot. I think we have an advantage because [...] {{have to be a little}} bit conservative. Guys like myself we’re really battling for fourth in points and battling for wins. We <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> be a little more aggressive and maybe take advantage of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E

2500|$|Often {{recognized}} for their live performances, the band generally does not perform in larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters {{outside of the}} UK. Instead, they regularly play smaller venues such as House of Blues, as was their intention from the start. Myles Kennedy {{said in an interview}} with Artistdirect, [...] "We're definitely a live band. That's what it's all about for us. We make records so we <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> play for people." [...] The band has been joined on stage by several surprise guests, including Slash, Paul Reed Smith, Wolfgang Van Halen, and Eric Friedman, and several other notable musicians, such as Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones, have been reported to have attended an Alter Bridge concert. Alter Bridge's live performances are generally praised.|$|E
2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of}} the resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but we want to go out and harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E

The little mother kept nothing for herself but the pleasure of giving everything away; yet, I think, she was both richer and happier than if she had kept them all.
