40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel distributed deterioration detection method in single pipelines using a time-domain pressure response trace and the impulse response function (IRF) of the pipeline. The hydraulic impedance of a deteriorated section is determined from {{the size of}} the first deterioration-induced reflection. The wave speed, internal diameter, and wall thickness of the deteriorated section can be estimated if the anomaly impedance is due solely to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> Sensitivity analyses are performed to study the relationship between the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and {{the size of the}} reflected and transmitted waves. The IRF of the pipeline system is used to determine the arrival time and duration of the first deterioration-induced reflection, which are then used to determine the location and length of the deterioration. Experimental verification has been performed on a single pipeline that includes a thinner-walled pipe section. The hydraulic impedance, wave speed, wall thickness, length and location of this section have been determined successfully. Jinzhe Gong, Martin F. Lambert, Angus R. Simpson and Aaron C. Zecchi...|$|E

The vessels in the germfree animals were also less responsive to vasopressin but not angiotensin.

BackgroundThe degree of mechanical dyssynchrony has been suggested as a predictor of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. There have been no published reports of dyssynchrony assessment with the use of CT. MethodsThirty-eight subjects underwent electrocardiogram-gated contrast-enhanced 64 -slice multidetector CT. The left ventricular endocardial and epicardial boundaries were delineated from short-axis images reconstructed at 10 % phase increments of the cardiac cycle. Global and segmental CT dyssynchrony metrics that used <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> <b>wall</b> motion, and volume over time were assessed for reproducibility. We defined a global metric using <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> as the dyssynchrony index (DI). ResultsThe DI was the most reproducible metric (interobserver and intraobserver intraclass correlation coefficients ≥ 0. 94, p < 0. 0001) and was used to determine differences between the 3 groups: HF-wide QRS group (ejection fraction [EF] 22 ± 8 %, QRS 163 ± 28 ms), HF-narrow QRS (EF 26 ± 7 %, QRS 96 ± 11 ms), and age-matched control subjects (EF 64 ± 5 %, QRS 87 ± 9 ms). Mean DI was significantly different between the 3 groups (HF-wide QRS: 152 ± 44 ms, HF-narrow QRS: 121 ± 58 ms, and control subjects: 65 ± 12 ms; p < 0. 0001) and greater in the HF-wide QRS (p < 0. 0001) and HF-narrow QRS (p = 0. 005) groups compared with control subjects. We found that DI had a good correlation with 2 -dimensional (r = 0. 65, p = 0. 012) and 3 -dimensional (r = 0. 68, p = 0. 008) echocardiographic dyssynchrony.

A third portion, detectable only by x-ray diffraction, was associated with other components and could not be extracted, even with prolonged boiling. It was removed by hot, dilute alkali and was associated in the wall with another glucan fraction. Dry heating of A. niger walls altered their susceptibility to enzymic digestion of nigeran in situ.

40|$|Pipeline {{condition}} {{assessment is}} essential for targeted and cost-effective maintenance of aging water transmission and distribution systems. This article proposes a technique for fast and non-invasive assessment of the wall condition of cement mortar–lined metallic pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves (water hammer waves). A step transient pressure wave can be generated by shutting off a side-discharge valve in a pressurised pipeline. The wave propagates along the pipe and reflections occur when it encounters sections of pipe with changes in wall thickness. The wave reflections can be measured by pressure transducers as they are indicative of the location and severity of the wall deterioration. A numerical analysis is conducted to obtain {{the relationship between the}} degree of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> in a cement mortar–lined pipe {{and the size of the}} corresponding pressure wave reflection. As a result, look-up charts are generated for any specific cement mortar–lined pipeline to map this relationship. The wall thickness of a deteriorated or distinct section can be determined directly and quickly from the charts using the size of the reflected wave, thus facilitating on-site pipeline condition assessment. The validity of this time-domain pipeline condition assessment technique is verified by numerical simulations and a case study using the field data measured in a mild steel cement mortar–lined water main in South Australia. The condition of the pipe as assessed by the proposed technique is generally consistent with ultrasonic measurements.

40|$|In {{order for}} wind energy {{to become a}} well {{established}} source of alternative energy that is able {{to compete with the}} traditional forms of energy production, the costs of (offshore) wind energy should be lowered. This can be achieved by either increasing the energy output of a turbine or by reducing its production and maintenance costs. Current research on lowering the costs of energy of wind energy is conducted by multiple fields of engineering. In the field of structural engineering great effort is put into creating more accurate structural models of the turbine and the surrounding environment, such as the soil-structure interaction. Having more accurate models of the turbine potentially lowers the turbines costs by using a less conservative design when optimizing the system or by extending the lifetime by better understanding the applied loads to the system. In the field of control engineering there is a focus on control techniques which increase the energy output of the turbine or actively reduce the forces which act on the turbine. Integrating the controller and structural design into a single optimization routine is a heavily investigated area in other, less conservative, fields of engineering. Currently, little research focuses on applying this principle to wind turbine design. This research was partly conducted in collaboration with the SIEMENS wind power Centre of Competence in The Hague, to provide a framework for simultaneously redesigning the controller and structural parameters of their state of the art, multi-megawatt, offshore wind turbine and to define the key limitations of this framework. In order to meet this goal a framework has been presented that allows for simultaneously varying both structural and controller parameters of the wind turbine design. The framework allows one to find an combination of the controller and structural design parameters which optimize the overall performance of the turbine. This is achieved by evaluating the overall system performance in the frequency domain, while simultaneously optimizing over all tunable parameters. The capabilities of the method have been demonstrated on two design cases. In the first case a simple academic problem was optimized an the performance of the framework was analysed. The framework of simultaneously varying the structural and controller parameters is also applied to a commercial, state of the art, multi-megawatt, offshore wind turbine. The integrated design framework allows for varying physical properties of the structural model, in this case the wall thickness of the support structure. The derivatives of the mass and stiffness matrices of the turbine’s equations of motion are computed. Thereby obtaining a sensitivity description of the structural dynamics to the wall thickness. These derivatives are used to relate a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> of tower elements to a change in the structural properties, and thereby the dynamical behaviour, of the entire wind turbine model. With the number of in- and output channels in the framework being linearly dependent to the number of states of the turbine model, the full turbine model description complicates the application of the integrated design framework. Therefore, the overall model of the wind turbine is reduced to capture only the relevant structural dynamics of the system. By using the reduced basis of the original system the derivative matrices are reduced, while keeping the dependency to the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters. This makes it possible to change the system dynamics, through wall thickness changes, while using a reduced number of in- and outputs in the framework. The integrated framework is used to design the rotor-speed controller parameters of the system, which is limited by the dynamics of the structural turbine model. The structural dynamics limited the overall performance of the system in two ways. First, a further increase in the frequency peak of the sensitivity function describing the closed loop system, is bounded by the designed performance weight. Second, due to the presence of right half plane zeros in the transfer function of the pitch angle to rotor-speed. A further increase of the system bandwidth is not possible due to controller limitations. Using the integrated design framework it is possible to minimize the net wall thickness of the tower elements in the turbine model and thereby changing the location of both the resonance frequency and the right half plane zeros. It can thus be concluded that the integrated wind turbine design, using the framework as shown in this work, allows one to optimize the structural and controller parameters simultaneously. Fundamental limitations in the controller design are analysed and used for redesigning the system for an increased overall performance.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this PhD {{research}} is to develop non-invasive and cost-effective techniques for assessing the structural condition of pressurised pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. The specific objectives include the detection of leaks and localised deterioration that is distributed along a pipeline, such as extended sections of corrosion or the spalling of cement lining. The latter is described by pipeline condition assessment in this thesis. The transient behaviour of a leak is studied in the frequency domain. Numerical studies conducted in this research demonstrate that two leak-induced patterns (on the resonant and the anti-resonant responses) can exist in a frequency response diagram (FRD). The amplitudes of the responses {{are related to the}} impedance of the valve in a reservoir-pipeline-valve (RPV) system. A new leak detection technique has been developed in this research based on the further understanding of the leak-induced patterns. This technique uses the relative sizes of the first three resonant responses to determine the location and size of a single leak in RPV systems. In reservoir-pipeline-dead end systems, the information required for single event leak detection is further reduced to the first two resonant responses. A new measurement strategy for the extraction of the FRD of single pipelines is proposed in this research. The boundary valve loss is used to adjust the amplitude of the leak-induced pattern on the resonant responses and also the sharpness of the resonant peaks. A specific type of pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) termed the inverse repeat sequence (IRS), is used as the excitation signal. The antisymmetric property of IRS enables part of the nonlinear responses of the system under excitation to be cancelled out, yielding a measured FRD close to the theoretical linear system response. A side-discharge valve based transient generator is designed and fabricated in this research to implement the new FRD measurement strategy. Laboratory experiments are conducted on an intact pipeline and a pipeline with a leak. This research also conducts analysis of the characteristics of distributed pipe wall deterioration and develops new detection techniques. In a measured pressure trace, the size of the reflection resulting from a section of pipeline with a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> is indicative of the characteristic impedance of this section. Once the impedance of this section is determined, the wave speed and wall thickness can be estimated. A technique for the detection of a single deteriorated section in pipelines is developed based on the above analysis. Two other condition assessment techniques are developed to deal with the complexities induced by multiple deteriorated sections. The first technique is termed reconstructive MOC (method of characteristics) analysis, which uses the pressure trace measured at the upstream face of the valve in a RPV system to determine the distribution of the impedance along the pipeline. The algorithm reconstructs a MOC grid by calculating the MOC compatibility equations backwards in time, estimating the properties of the pipeline (impedance, wave speed) and the length of each pipe reach as discretised by the MOC grid from the valve towards the reservoir. Preliminary experimental verification is conducted to verify the applicability of the new technique. The second technique is reconstructive transient analysis (RTA), which can be conducted at any interior accessible points along a pipeline, and does not require a RPV boundary condition. The RTA uses two pressure transducers in close proximity to measure two transient pressure traces in one test. A signal processing algorithm is developed to extract the directional transient waves (traveling upstream and downstream). The use of the directional transient waves enables the step response function (SRF) of the section of pipe upstream or downstream of the paired pressure transducers to be obtained. The reconstructive MOC analysis is then adapted to interpret the SRF to yield the distribution of the impedance, from which the location and severity of distributed deterioration can be identified.

Cross-sectional studies suggest the presence of systemic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> {{as a result of}} exercise in healthy subjects, but no previous study has examined this question in humans undertaking exercise training. OBJECTIVE: To examine the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> superficial femoral (SFA, i. e. local effect) and carotid (CA, i. e. systemic effect) artery <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> across 8 weeks of lower limb cycle training in healthy young men. METHODS: Fourteen healthy young male subjects were assigned to an 8 -week training study of cycling exercise (n = 9) or a control period (n = 5). Before, during (2, 4 and 6 weeks) and after training, SFA and CA <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was examined using automated edge-detection of high resolution ultrasound images. We also measured resting diameter and calculated the wall:lumen(W:L) -ratio. RESULTS: Exercise training did not alter CA or SFA baseline diameter (P = 0. 14), but was associated with gradual, consistent and significant decreases <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and W:L-ratio <b>in</b> both the CA and SFA (P < 0. 001 and 0. 002, respectively). Two-way ANOVA revealed a comparable magnitude of decrease <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and W:L-ratio <b>in</b> both arteries across the 8 -week period (interaction-effect; P = 0. 29 and 0. 12, respectively). No <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> artery diameter, <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> or W:L-ratio were apparent in controls (0. 82, 0. 38 and 0. 52, respectively).

Echocardiographic measurements in 92 children (0 - 18 years) with ESRD, made by original analysists, were reassessed offline, twice, by 3 independent observers. Smallest detectable changes (SDC) were calculated for continuous measurements of diastolic interventricular septum (IVSd), Left ventricle posterior <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> (LVPWd), Left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), and Left ventricle mass index (LVMI). Cohen's kappa was calculated to assess the reproducibility of LVH defined in two different ways. LVH(WT) was defined as Z-value of IVSd and/or LVPWd> 2 and LVH(MI) was defined as LVMI> 103 g/m² for boys and > 84 g/m² for girls. The intra-observer SDCs ranged from 1. 6 to 1. 7 mm, 2. 0 to 2. 6 mm and 17. 7 to 30. 5 g/m² for IVSd, LVPWd and LVMI, respectively.

40|$|Analysis of {{transient}} {{fluid pressure}} signals {{has been investigated}} as an alternative method of fault detection in pipeline systems and has shown promise in both laboratory and field trials. The advantage of the method {{is that it can}} potentially provide a fast and cost effective means of locating faults such as leaks, blockages and pipeline wall degradation within a pipeline while the system remains fully operational. The only requirement is that high speed pressure sensors are placed in contact with the fluid. Further development of the method requires detailed numerical models and enhanced understanding of transient flow within a pipeline where variations in pipeline condition and geometry occur. One such variation commonly encountered is the degradation or thinning of pipe walls, which can increase the susceptible of a pipeline to leak development. This paper aims to improve transient-based fault detection methods by investigating how <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> pipe <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> will affect the transient behaviour of a system; this is done through the analysis of laboratory experiments. The laboratory experiments are carried out on a stainless steel pipeline of constant outside diameter, into which a pipe section of variable <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> is inserted. <b>In</b> order to detect the location and severity of these <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> conditions within the laboratory system an inverse transient analysis procedure is employed which considers independent variations in wavespeed and diameter. Inverse transient analyses are carried out using a genetic algorithm optimisation routine to match the response from a one-dimensional method of characteristics transient model to the experimental time domain pressure responses. The accuracy of the detection technique is evaluated and benefits associated with various simplifying assumptions and simulation run times are investigated. It is found that for the case investigated, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the wavespeed and nominal diameter of the pipeline are both important to the accuracy of the inverse analysis procedure and can be used to differentiate the observed transient behaviour caused by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> from that caused by other known faults such as leaks. Further application of the method to real pipelines is discussed...|$|R

Key words: gastric lesions, bowel wall layers, rectal carcinoma, gastrointestinal tract. JDMS 1 : 13 - 17, JanuarylFebruary 1990 Because sonography is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive, it is often one of the first methods used to evaluate a patient with symptoms of upper abdominal discomfort. Usually sonography is requested to evaluate the gallbladder, bile ducts, liver, pancreas, or kidneys as the cause of the abdominal symptoms.

40|$|Purpose. For noninvasive {{diagnosis}} of atherosclerosis, {{we attempted to}} evaluate the elasticity of the arterial wall by measuring small <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> thickness caused by the heart-beat. The elasticity of the arterial wall has been evaluated noninvasively by measuring the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> diameter of the artery or the pulse-wave velocity; however, there is no method for noninvasively evaluating the elasticity of the arterial <b>wall</b> from <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> its <b>thickness.</b> Methods. Employing the phased tracking method that we developed, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> thickness of less than 100 µm were measured in each regional area, which corresponded to {{the diameter of the}} ultrasonic beam. Results. The elasticity of the arterial wall could be evalu-ated with better spatial resolution from the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> thick-ness than from the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> diameter of the artery or pulse-wave velocity. We therefore propose a method for evaluating the elastic modulus of an arterial wall of nonuni-form <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> Conclusions. <b>In</b> basic experiments employing silicone rubber tubes with nonuniform <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> as arterial models, the elastic moduli of silicone rubber tubes were evaluated by measuring <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> These results confirm the value of the proposed method.

Further investigation of this disease as well as monitoring of disease progression and treatment effect demand for accurate and reproducible assessment of airway <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>in</b> CT datasets. With <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> <b>in</b> the sub-millimeter range, this task remains challenging even with today's high resolution CT datasets.

The general accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated using basic tubular software and hardware phantoms. Furthermore, we present results on the reproducibility of the algorithm with respect to clinical CT scans, varying reconstruction kernels, and repeated acquisitions, which is crucial for longitudinal observations...|$|R

40|$|Water leakage from {{buried pipes}} {{is a subject}} of great concern in Britain and across the world because of {{decreasing}} water supplies due to changing rainfall patterns, deterioration of antiquated distribution systems, and an increasing population. Correlation techniques are widely used to locate the leaks, however, difficulties are encountered when repairs {{have been made to}} a pipe by inserting a new length of pipe to replace a damaged section. Although this practice is now discouraged, the new sections might be of a different material or possibly different cross-section or <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> The wave propagation behaviour at such joints is poorly understood at present. In earlier work, simple expressions for the wavenumbers of the s= 1 (fluid-dominated) and s= 2 (shell dominated) axisymmetric wave types were derived for a fluid-filled elastic pipe, both in vacuo and surrounded by an elastic medium of infinite extent. In this paper, the wave transmission and reflection characteristics of these waves at an axisymmetric pipe <b>wall</b> discontinuity <b>in</b> a fluid-filled piping system are investigated theoretically. For <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> or <b>wall</b> elasticity, simple expressions may be used to characterise the joint. The {{reason for this is that}} negligible energy conversion between the wavetypes occurs, so the wavetypes can be considered separately.

The effects of simulated microgravity on the static and dynamic properties of large arteries are still mostly unknown. The present study evaluated, using an integrated vascular approach, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> structure and function of the common carotid and femoral arteries (CCA and CFA) after prolonged head-down tilt bed rest (HDTBR). Ten healthy men were enrolled in a 5 -week HDTBR study endorsed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Arterial geometry, flow, stiffness, and shear rate were evaluated by ultrasound. Local carotid pulse pressure and wave reflection were studied by applanation tonometry. After five weeks of HDTBR, CFA showed a decrease in lumen diameter without significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> (IMT), resulting <b>in</b> an inward remodeling. Local carotid pulse pressure decreased and carotid-to-brachial pressure amplification increased. The ratio of systolic-to-diastolic volumetric flow in CFA decreased, whereas in CCA it tended to increase.

In nine blood-perfused isolated pig hearts, perfusion pressure was uncoupled from left ventricular pressure generation (Langendorff method) and isovolumic contraction and relaxation were realized by inserting a noncompressible water-filled balloon into the left ventricle. In a first experiment, at constant perfusion pressure (85 mmHg), the integrated backscatter (3 - 7 MHz), the myocardial <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and the left ventricular pressure were determined simultaneously at various balloon volumes (5 - 25 mL). A quasistatic increase of balloon volume by 50 % resulted in an average decrease of <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> of 6. 5 % @ < 0. 01) and a mean increase in the integrated backscatter level of 1. 1 dB @ < 0. 01).

40|$|Filamentous {{fungi play}} vital roles in human health, {{agriculture}} and bioprocessing. In all of these situations fungi are often exposed to nutrient limitation, which can impact their behavior. Autophagy is a eukaryotic cellular process, induced under nutrient deficient conditions, which recycles internal components for cell survival. Autophagy can also be gratuitously induced in rich growth medium, using the drug rapamycin. To address our hypotheses, we have studied fungi and cell wall material properties of the model fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, under autophagic conditions. For example, {{it has been observed}} that during fungal fermentation nutrient limitation leads to a greater degree of hyphal fragmentation. We hypothesize that under nutrient deprived conditions autophagy is involved <b>in</b> recycling cell <b>wall</b> components, thereby weakening the <b>wall</b> and resulting <b>in</b> this increased degree of fragmentation. In all experiments, fungi were subjected to two media conditions - with and without rapamycin. To understand <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the cell <b>wall</b> material properties we studied <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> tensile strength using a fragmentation assay, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> using transmission electron microscopy, and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> elastic properties using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The fragmentation assay showed that cells grown in presence of rapamycin for 16 hours were stronger than the cells grown in the absence of rapamycin. More data is required to determine whether the observed <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> strength are due to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> Typical techniques used to study the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>wall</b> material properties are tedious, time intensive and only measure the population average.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{saphenous vein}} grafts (SVG) in {{coronary}} artery bypass surgery is established but little is known of SVG remodeling {{during the first year}} in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: The feasibility of measuring total vessel diameter (lumen plus wall), lumen diameter, and <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> by a novel computed tomography (CT) method was established in phantom model tubes (r= 0. 98 for lumen diameter and r= 0. 98 for <b>wall</b> <b>thickness)</b> and <b>in</b> an initial clinical study of 14 patients correlating CT and intravascular ultrasound measurements of SVG (r= 0. 88 for total vessel diameter, r= 0. 85 for lumen diameter and r= 0. 89 for <b>wall</b> <b>thickness).</b> <b>In</b> a separate group of 42 patients (aged 66 +/- 10 years; 36 male, 6 female) undergoing {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting, SVG total vessel diameter, lumen diameter, and <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> were determined prospectively with multi-slice CT angiography at 1 and 12 months postoperatively. Mean total vessel diameter decreased from 5. 95 +/- 0. 83 mm to 5. 39 +/- 0. 87 mm, P 5 %. Mean lumen diameter decreased from 3. 69 +/- 0. 66 mm to 3. 36 +/- 0. 68 mm, P< 0. 001, (range, - 40 to + 11 % change).
