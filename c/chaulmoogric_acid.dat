50|$|An early {{scientific}} {{analysis of}} the oil {{was carried out by}} Frederick B. Power in London in 1904. He and his colleagues isolated a new unsaturated fatty acid from the seeds, which they named 'chaulmoogric acid'. They also investigated two closely related species: Hydnocarpus wightiana and Hydnocarpus anthelmintica. By comparing material from the trees, they isolated both <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid</b> and a closely related compound, 'hydnocarpus acid'. They also investigated Gynocardia odorata and found that it produced neither of these acids. Later investigation showed that 'taraktogenos' (Hydnocarpus kurzii) also produced <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The oil is {{semi-solid}} at {{room temperature}} and {{does not have a}} strong odor. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis has shown the oil to contain the following fatty acids - hydnocarpic acid, <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid,</b> gorlic acid, lower cyclic homologues, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacities}} of certain compounds at pH 7. 3 – 7. 5 to inactivate the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis have been demonstrated. Among the more effective substances were the fatty <b>acids</b> <b>chaulmoogric,</b> linolic, linolenic, myristic, oleic, and ricinolic, and the detergents zephiran, duponol LS, and aerosol OT. Upon the oleic acid inactivation of the virus, {{studies have been}} made of such variables as pH, rate of inactivation, and relative amounts of virus and oleate for removal of the infectivity. The rôle of oxidation in the process was determined as negligible. Attempts to recover infectious virus from oleate-inactivated mixtures have been unsuccessful. It {{has been found that}} neither oleate nor ether-inactivated virus was capable of producing immunity in mice under the experimental conditions in which untreated virus induced a moderate immunity...|$|R
40|$|Hirsch's {{recent review}} 4 of the {{literature}} concerning the local tissue response to parenteral injection of lipids of varying chemical composition indicates that few facts have thus far been established experimentally. These concern straight chain fatty acids and <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid.</b> Sabin's demonstration 5 that phthioic acid ' applied parenterally produces epithelioid cell accumulation and tubercle formation stimulated great interest in the chemical structure of this fatty acid, whose empirical formula is given as C 26 H 5202. The problem of the chemical structure of this acid has been approached by two methods. Spielman and Anderson, ' {{on the basis of}} analytical studies, believe that the phthioic acid molecule contains a long chain of approximately 22 carbon atoms with several methyl groups attached laterally. A second group of investigators, Wagner-Jauregg, 8 Chargaff, 2 attacked the problem by synthesizing fatty acids whose structure theoretically should be similar to that of phthioic acid. More recently, Schneider and Spielman' have succeeded in synthesizing various methylated long chain fatty acids. Samples of these, as listed in Table 1, have been made available to this laboratory for investigation of their biological effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract － The {{extract from}} Hydnocarpi Semen (HS) {{has been used}} to treat leprosy and its {{anti-inflammatory}} activity has been reported. However, the effect of HS on the treatment of diabetic or peripheral ulcer is not well known. We therefore examined its wound healing effects on ulcer area in diabetic mice. GC and GC/MS analysis with the total extract of HS show that the main constituents of the extract are <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid,</b> hydnocarpic acid, and gorlic acid. Whereas HS showed wound healing effect in diabetic ulcer, there was no hypoglycemic effect in diabetic mice. The treatment of HS extract significantly decreased the level of total WBC and neutrophils in mice compared to control mice. Cutting ulcer was induced by the round-shaped punch on the backside of diabetic mice and the extract of HS was given orally or topically. The wound area score significantly decreased after treatment of HS at dose of 50 mg/kg. The treatment of HS also induced the activation of macrophages and increased the production of IL- 12 and TNF-α in macrophages, indicating that the wound healing by HS extract is associated with the inflammatory effect via the activation of macrophages. Our results suggest that HS extract can be a new therapeutic candidate for treatment of diabetic ulcer...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the immunomodulatory (IM) activity of IM- 133 N, a herbal combination in various immunotherapeutic experimental models. Methods: The IM activity of IM- 133 N was evaluated against three experimental models namely, effect of IM- 133 N against Escherichia coli (E. coli) -induced abdominal sepsis in mice, and carbon clearance test was performed in Wistar albino rats to evaluated the phagocytic potential of IM- 133 N, in addition IM- 133 N was evaluated for its immunoglobulin enhancing potential in rats, where the immunoglobulin levels were measured by zinc sulphate turbity (ZST) test. Further, IM- 133 N was subjected for detailed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) /MS analysis to identify the probable active constituents present in it. Results: The findings {{of the present study}} has demonstrated very promising IM property of IM- 133 N in all the experimental models. Briefly, pretreatment with IM- 133 N at 125, 250, 500 and 1, 000 mg/kg, p. o. doses had protected the mice against E. coli-induced abdominal sepsis and mortality, further the effect of IM- 133 N was found to be significant and dose-dependent. In support of this, in another study administration of IM- 133 N showed a significant and dose-dependent increase in serum immunoglobulin levels, estimated by ZST test. In line with the above findings, in the carbon clearance test the low doses (125 and 250 mg/ kg, p. o.) of IM- 133 N increased the rate of carbon clearance, whereas the higher doses (500 and 1, 000 mg/kg, p. o.) did not sustain the response, and saturation effect was considered as one of the possible reason for futility of higher doses for IM- 133 N. In addition, A detailed LC-MS/MS analysis of IM- 133 N showed 17 bioactive phytochemical constituents: namely, apigenin, <b>chaulmoogric</b> <b>acid,</b> mesquitol, quercetin, symphoxanthone, salireposide, β-sitosterol, nonaeicosanol, β-amyrin, betulic acid, oleanolic acid, symplososide, symponoside, symploveroside, symplocomoside, symconoside A and locoracemoside B. Conclusion: These findings suggest that IM- 133 N possesses significant IM activity and, hence, could be useful for eradicating opportunistic disease-triggering pathogens via immunotherapeutic mechanisms. The findings also suggest IM- 133 N may also useful in other immunity disorders...|$|E
