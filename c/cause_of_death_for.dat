5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed.

The autopsy report confirmed that the primary <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem.

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> women under the age of 60.|$|E

Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months.

The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic.
