5|$|Radiotherapy {{can also}} be used before surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, singly or in combination, when there is a <b>contraindication</b> for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a <b>contraindication</b> for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E
5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a <b>contraindication.</b> Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization found {{chiropractic}} care {{in general}} is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe but complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and <b>contraindications.</b> Absolute <b>contraindications</b> to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions {{that should not be}} manipulated; these <b>contraindications</b> include rheumatoid arthritis and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative <b>contraindications</b> are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these <b>contraindications</b> include osteoporosis. Although most <b>contraindications</b> apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to emergency medical services; these include sudden and severe headache or neck pain unlike that previously experienced.• [...] Indirect risks of chiropractic involve delayed or missed diagnoses through consulting a chiropractor.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a prospective {{study in which}} we investigated why children fail to get vaccinated against whooping cough, including {{an assessment of the}} attitudes of parents and professionals and the impact of different views of the <b>contraindications.</b> There was considerable disagreement among the professionals on the interpretation of the <b>contraindications</b> to immunisation, and the commonest reason for omitting pertussis vaccine was advice from the doctor based on dubious <b>contraindications.</b> When faced with parents anxious about the risks of immunisation health professionals are unable to find reassurance in the list of <b>contraindications</b> to immunisation...|$|R
5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on the {{presumption}} that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a <b>contraindication</b> to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested. NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a <b>contraindication</b> for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a <b>contraindication,</b> {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E

30|$|This study {{extends the}} work of {{previous}} authors who also challenge commonly invoked <b>contraindications</b> to vaginal approach: enlarged uteri > 180  g, functional or actual nulliparity, and previous cesarean or pelvic laparotomy [18]. In our study, however, we chose the most commonly invoked <b>contraindications</b> to vaginal route—oophorectomy, prior cesarean delivery, and uterine enlargement > 14  weeks. We did not address less commonly invoked <b>contraindications</b> to vaginal hysterectomy—nulliparity, obesity, absence of uterine descent or vaginal access, history of prior major pelvic surgery, and known or unknown adhesive disease. Though such lesser <b>contraindications</b> were not differentially represented between the two comparative groups, neither were they dissuasive against a primary intent vaginal approach.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{indications}} for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty remain controversial. Previously recommended <b>contraindications</b> {{include the}} following: age under 60 years, weight 180 lb (82 kg) or over, patients undertaking heavy labor, chondrocalcinosis, and exposed bone in the patellofemoral joint. This study explores whether these <b>contraindications</b> are valid in mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Methods Using a prospective series of 1000 consecutive medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasties {{in which the}} reported <b>contraindications</b> were not applied, the functional outcome and survival in patients with or without <b>contraindications</b> were compared. Results Of the 1000 consecutive unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (818 patients), 68 % (678 knees) would be considered contraindicated based on published <b>contraindications.</b> At a mean follow-up of 10 years (5 - 17), {{there was no difference}} in American Knee Society (AKS) Objective Scores (P =. 05) or Oxford Knee Score (P =. 08) between groups. However, knees with <b>contraindications</b> had significantly (P =. 02) fewer poor outcomes and significantly better AKS Functional Scores (P <. 001) and Tegner Activity Scores (P <. 001). At 15 years, no difference in implant survival (P =. 33) was observed. The 3 % of unicompartmental knee arthroplasties performed in young men (age < 60) weighing 180 lb or over with high activity levels, who have been reported to have poor outcomes after fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, had significantly better AKS Functional Scores (P <. 001), Oxford Knee Score (P =. 01), and Tegner Activity Score (P <. 001) at 10 years. No difference in AKS Objective Scores (P =. 54) at 10 years or implant survival at 15 years (P =. 75) was seen. Conclusion This large case series provides evidence that patients with the previously reported <b>contraindications</b> do as well as, or even better than, those without <b>contraindications.</b> Therefore these <b>contraindications</b> should not apply to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty...|$|R

25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a <b>contraindication</b> per se, but severe {{spasticity}} must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a <b>contraindication.</b> The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
