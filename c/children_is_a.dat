5|$|Lessons for <b>Children</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} four age-adapted reading primers {{written by the}} {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, {{the needs of the}} child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E

25|$|Fractures {{and their}} {{underlying}} causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, {{depending on the}} location of the fracture. A common long bone fracture in <b>children</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Salter–Harris fracture. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote bone healing. In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used. Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Predictor {{models have}} {{consistently}} found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, and familial stressors increase risk for PTSD {{as well as}} risk for biological markers of risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. Experiencing bullying as a child or an adult has been correlated {{with the development of}} PTSD. Peritraumatic dissociation in <b>children</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> predictive indicator of the development of PTSD later in life. This effect of childhood trauma, which is not well understood, may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems. Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact, and interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal ones.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied <b>children</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot {{different}} than walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical {{for the children}} who are amputees.

Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
