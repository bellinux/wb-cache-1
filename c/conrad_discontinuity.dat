5000|$|The <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> (named {{after the}} seismologist Victor Conrad) is {{considered}} to be the border between the upper continental crust and the lower one. It is not as pronounced as the Mohorovičić discontinuity, and absent in some continental regions. [...] Up to the middle 20th Century the upper crust in continental regions was seen to consist of felsic rocks such as granite (sial, for silica-aluminium), and the lower one to consist of more magnesium-rich mafic rocks like basalt (sima, for silica-magnesium). Therefore, the seismologists of that time considered that the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> should correspond to a sharply defined contact between the chemically distinct two layers, sial and sima.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> {{corresponds}} to the sub-horizontal boundary in continental crust at which the seismic wave velocity increases in a discontinuous way. This boundary is observed in various continental regions {{at a depth of}} 15 to 20 km, however it is not found in oceanic regions.|$|E
50|$|However, {{from the}} 1960s onward this theory was {{strongly}} contested among geologists. The exact geological {{significance of the}} <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> is still not clarified. The possibility that it represents the transition from amphibolite facies to granulite facies metamorphism has been given some support from observations of the uplifted {{central part of the}} Vredefort Dome and the surrounding Kaapvaal craton.|$|E
30|$|This {{analysis}} {{demonstrates that}} the lower boundary of anomaly 2 corresponds with {{the boundary between the}} lower and upper crust. GF amplitudes from subsources in the upper crust are about three times larger than those from subsources in the lower crust. There are two possible causes of the lower GF amplitudes from subsources in the lower crust and mantle: the effect of lower seismic potency at greater depths, as previously discussed, and the effect of waves reflected at the Moho and <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> Reflection of upward incident waves would decrease GF amplitudes, whereas reflection of downward incident waves would increase GF amplitudes. Because it is difficult to isolate the effect of reflection of long-period waves in a complex 3 D velocity structure, we instead evaluated the effects of properties of the source media. That is, we examined the effects of seismic potency and seismic impedance on GF amplitudes and assumed that wave reflections at the Moho and <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuities</b> accounted for all that we could not attribute to seismic potency or seismic impedance.|$|R
30|$|In {{the thermal}} {{distribution}} at 45 -km depth in Fig. 6 (b), ranging between 800 and 1200 °C, the temperatures in northeastern Japan were generally {{lower than in}} southwestern Japan owing to differences in the reference temperature of the mantle xenoliths. Not shown here, the temperatures at {{the depths of the}} <b>Conrad</b> and Moho <b>discontinuities</b> (Katsumata, 2010) ranged between 400 and 700 °C and between 600 and 900 °C, respectively.|$|R

These are represented by the depth variations of each layer and the medium parameters below each depth.|$|R
5000|$|Sial {{has a lower}} density (2700-2800 kg/m3) than sima, {{which is}} {{primarily}} due to increased amounts of aluminium, and decreased amounts of iron and magnesium. The base of the sial is not a strict boundary, the sial grades into the denser rocks of the sima. The <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> has been proposed as the boundary, but {{little is known about}} it, and it doesn't seem to match the point of geochemical change. [...] Instead, the boundary has been arbitrarily set at a mean density of 2800 kg/m3.|$|E
50|$|Victor Conrad was an Austrian-American physicist, seismologist and meteorologist. He was {{the first}} {{director}} of the Austrian seismological service, and a reputed academician of international accomplishment. He was politically victimized twice, in 1919 for his ethnicity and in 1934 as a socialist. He emigrated to the United States in 1938, continuing his academic career in New York, California and at Cambridge. Conrad’s scientific work is documented in more than 240 papers concerning meteorology, climatology and seismology. He first deduced the continental crust transition structure what is now named the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{continental}} {{crust is}} {{the layer of}} igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks that forms the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as continental shelves. This layer is sometimes called sial because its bulk composition is more felsic compared to the oceanic crust, called sima which has a more mafic bulk composition. Changes in seismic wave velocities have shown that at a certain depth (the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity),</b> there is a reasonably sharp contrast between the more felsic upper continental crust and the lower continental crust, which is more mafic in character.|$|E

30|$|Clear {{images of}} the seismic {{velocity}} discontinuities in the crust and the uppermost mantle beneath southwest Japan have been obtained with Receiver Function (RF) analyses of teleseismic waveforms observed at extraordinary dense short-period and broadband stations. For imaging, we construct several 2 -D profiles of depth-transformed RFs to delineate the fine crustal structure and the 3 -D configuration of the Philippine Sea plate (PHS). The Moho is clearly seen and locally depressed just beneath the Chugoku Mountains. The <b>Conrad,</b> the velocity <b>discontinuity</b> within the crust, in the northern Kinki region is recognized and depressed just beneath the Chugoku Mountains {{as well as the}} Moho. RF analyses also clearly elucidate the largely contorted configuration of the PHS including aseismic portions. The PHS subducts aseismically under the western Chugoku region with a high dip angle of 35 degrees at least to a depth of 65 km. In the western Kii Peninsula, it descends steeply to a depth of 90 km with some curvature, while it subducts with a low dip of 20 degrees to a depth of 60 km from the eastern Kii Peninsula to the Lake Biwa.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to use a}} combination of travel-time and surface wave tomography to obtain compressional and shear wave velocity distributions in the crust and upper mantle under China and surrounding areas. The first phase of the study is directed at producing a P-wave velocity model based on travel-time tomography. Travel data from the Annual Bulletin of Chinese Earthquakes (ABCE) and the International Seismological Centre (ISC/EHB) are used. The tomographic inversion is carried out in two steps. First, the regional travel-time data from ABCE is used to obtain the crust/uppermost mantle (0 to 100 km depth) velocity model. A total of 345, 000 P-wave regional travel times are used for the tomography. Two <b>discontinuities</b> (<b>Conrad</b> and Moho) are allowed in the inversion. The tomographic model provides three-dimensional (3 -D) velocities in the crust and uppermost mantle, depth to the Moho, and detailed Pn velocities. To extend the model deeper into the mantle through the upper mantle transition zone, ISC/EHB data for P and pP phases are combined with the ABCE data. To counteract the “smearing effect, ” the crust and upper mantle velocity structure derived from regional travel times, as described above, are used for teleseismic tomography. A variable grid method based on ray density is used in the inversion. A 3 -D P-wave velocity model extending to 1700 km depth is obtained. The combined regional teleseismic tomography provides a high-resolution, 3 -D P-wave velocity model for the crust, upper mantle, and transition zone. The crustal models correlate well with geologic and tectonic features. The mantle models show the images of current and past subduction zones. A surprising result is that the “roots ” of some geologic features, such as the Sichuan Basin and Ordos Plateau, extend deep into the upper mantle...|$|R
5000|$|Both the {{continental}} and oceanic crust [...] "float" [...] on the mantle. Because {{the continental}} crust is thicker, it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust. The slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock {{contributes to the}} higher relative elevation {{of the top of}} the continental crust. As the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic, water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust. Because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust (sial) becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust (sima), and the transition zone {{is referred to as the}} <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1910 Conrad {{accepted}} a newly created chair for [...] "cosmic physics" [...] at the University of Czernowitz (now Chernivtsi in Ukraine) which {{at this time}} belonged to Austria-Hungary's Bukovina region, and had native German speakers accounting {{for more than half}} of its students.From 1916 to 1918, during World War I, he was a director of Meteorological and Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade, Serbia. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy at the end of World War I the university was rumanized and Conrad was forced to leave Czernowitz at the end of July 1919, losing not only his professorship but also his private assets. He returned to his former position at the Central Meteorological Institute and later as a full professor at Vienna. During his analyses of two earthquakes that occurred in Austria in 1923 and 1927 he discovered what is today known as the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> considered to be the border between the upper and the lower continental crust.|$|E
50|$|The crust {{ranges from}} 5 - 70 km in depth {{and is the}} {{outermost}} layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5-10 km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories - sial and sima (Suess,1831-1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11 km below the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most {{commonly known as the}} Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> a {{boundary}} between the upper and the lower crusts, has long been identified in many continental crusts. The influence of the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> on seismic hazards, however, has been rarely known. Strong regional phases corresponding to thewaves refracted from theConraddiscontinuity are observed in the Korean Peninsula. These phases show strong amplitudes of 2 – 4 times larger {{than those of the}} directwaves. The observation is confirmed bynumericalmodeling ofwave-forms. These observations not only support the existence of the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the Korean Peninsula but also suggest the potential of seismic hazards by the Conrad phases. Such strong Conrad-refracted phases are typically recorded in thePn coda por-tion,whichmay cause overestimation ofPn body-wavemagnitudes for regional events...|$|E
30|$|The {{anomalous}} simulated GF amplitudes {{reflect the}} combined effect of various factors (Table  2). For anomaly 1, {{the most important}} factors are source radiation pattern, wave reflection from the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> and seismic potency. For anomaly 2, they are the generation of basin waves, wave reflection from the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> and seismic potency. For anomaly 3, they are source radiation pattern, seismic potency, and generation of surface waves in the accretionary prism.|$|E
30|$|GF amplitudes for subsources in {{the upper}} crust are larger {{by a factor of}} 1.33 than those in the lower crust (Table  1), which is smaller than the factor of 3.0 for {{corresponding}} GF amplitudes shown in Fig.  11. We assigned the difference (around 2.25) to the combined effect of amplitude losses due to reflection at the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of waves coming from subsources below the discontinuity, and amplitude increases due to constructive interference of direct waves and waves reflected from the discontinuity for subsources above it. Thus, in addition to seismic potency, wave reflections at the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> may contribute to the formation of the lower boundaries of anomalies 1 and 2.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} relation {{has been}} derived {{for the number}} of earthquakes occurring at a given depth in the South Australian crust. There is no significant deviation of the expression from a theoretical curve (derived here on certain assumptions) below 20 - 25 km depth. However energy considerations suggest that a transition may occur at this depth in the mode of stress release. There is no significant evidence for a boundary in the crust equivalent to the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> observed in continental crusts elsewhere...|$|E
30|$|In the {{strength}} structure model thus obtained, there are parts where {{the strength}} is markedly low, such as directly below volcanic fronts, {{even though these}} parts are shallower than <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> This feature was also indicated by Shimamoto (1992), who speculated the rheology structure of northeastern Japan {{on the basis of}} rock experiments. The viscoelastic crustal model in this study quantifies this idea. Meanwhile, the effective viscosity coefficient of the lower crust in our model takes values roughly on the order of 1020 − 1021 Pa s.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{we found}} a zone of {{distinct}} north dipping high reflection strengths at depths of 21 – 30  km (X = − 20 to 0, Y = − 35 to 3), which we call the S wave reflector. We calculated the averaged value and standard deviation of reflection strengths using the data for all the blocks, where reflection strengths were obtained. Then, {{we found that the}} reflection strengths in the S wave reflector are within one standard deviation (σ) from the mean value. Katsumata (2010) reported the depth of the Moho and the Conrad discontinuities beneath the Japanese islands. According to Katsumata (2010), the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> exists at depth of 15 – 20  km in this district. Therefore, it is thought that the high reflection strengths zone is not the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> We also found small zones of high reflection strengths at depths of 32 – 34  km (R 3), 28 – 32  km (R 4) and 32 – 35  km (R 5). Katsumata (2010) estimated the depth of the Moho discontinuity is deeper than 34  km near these zones. Since these zones are basically located deeper than the Moho discontinuity and the extents of these zones are limited in small portions, it is likely that these zones do not reflect the Moho discontinuity but heterogeneities in the crust.|$|E
30|$|As {{concluded}} above, {{reflection of}} waves from deep or shallow subsources at the Moho and Conrad discontinuities has a considerable effect on attenuation or amplification of those waves; {{this can be}} attributed {{in part to the}} relative simplicity of the JIVSM model, which consists of layers of constant internal velocity and with large impedance contrasts at layer boundaries. For a model such as this, Graves and Pitarka (2010) considered that reflections from the Moho discontinuity make an important contribution to GF amplification because they arrive simultaneously with the direct waves. This was supported during validation of the JIVSM model by Petukhin et al. (2012) and T. Masuda (personal communication) using records of crustal earthquakes; they noted that the amplitudes of waves reflected at the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity</b> were larger than the observed waves. It may be necessary to revise the structure of the velocity model by introducing velocity gradients within layers and reducing impedance contrasts between them to improve simulations and strong ground-motion predictions.|$|E

We first applied this modified NMT method over the Kii Peninsula, southwestern Japan, undertaking two-dimensional conductivity modeling along a transect across {{the central part of the}} peninsula.

A few explosive sources generated clear S waves with amplitudes large enough to be read. We obtained an average POISSON'S ratio of around 0. 246 in the uppermost crust from S to P travel time ratios.

Such low heat flow values have been determined at different sites in Oman (Rolandone et al. 2013) but are nevertheless atypical for the crustal setting. Heat-flow {{values in the}} middle and upper 50 mW m− 2 are determined in other regions for provinces of Neoproterozoic age (Nyblade and Pollack 1993; Rudnick et al. 1998). A crustal transect generated from seismic data (Al-Lazki and Barazangi 2002) indicates a Moho depth of about 40  km under the passive continental margin of north-eastern Oman. The metamorphic basement is around 25  km thick, and the average thickness of the sedimentary cover is around 15  km. In this study a transition from the upper to the lower crust (<b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity)</b> is not indicated. The upper crust consists of the sedimentary cover, metamorphic rocks and granites/granodiorites, whereas the lower crust is defined by a more mafic composition with plagioclase-rich and pyroxenite-rich granulite. Assuming a normal heat flow at the Moho (qm[*]=[*] 25 mW m− 2, Artemieva and Mooney 2001) and moderate radiogenic heat production in each of the crustal layers a surface heat flow of around 58 mW m− 2 would be expected. Thus, the surface heat flow determined in the present and previous study (Rolandone et al. 2013) are around 10 mW m− 2 lower, than the crustal setting would imply.

Hata et al. (2016) concluded three-dimensional (3 -D) model of electrical resistivity and identified a magma pathway in the upper crust beneath the caldera. On the other hand, findings regarding seismic velocity and attenuation structure (Sudo 1991; Sudo and Kong 2001) have indicated that the magma chamber has a roughly spherical shape centered under Eboshidake at a depth of 6 – 10  km and exhibits low Vs, a high P-wave velocity (Vp)-to-Vs ratio, and high attenuation (low Q value). Yamamoto et al. (1999) detected a crack-like conduit along the chain of craters that dipped toward the magma chamber. They suggested that volcanic gases, hydrothermal fluids, and pyroclastic fragments were being discharged along the conduit. Tsutsui et al. (2003) obtained 3 -D Vp structures beneath the post-caldera central cones form the seismic data of a controlled-source experiment. Tsutsui and Sudo (2004) further detected seismic reflection voids, indicating high-temperature areas beneath the crater at a depth of 1.5 – 3.5  km and {{to the west of the}} crater at a depth of 3.5 – 7  km.

40|$|International audienceWhile most impact craters are characterised by {{negative}} magnetic anomalies {{over their}} central regions, aeromagnetic surveys over the Vredefort meteorite impact crater reveal multiple concentric magnetic patterns with no significant anomaly at its centre. We performed ground magnetic surveys across {{a portion of}} a prominent negative magnetic anomaly that extends in a broad semicircular belt about half way into the basement floor of the crater. Magnetic anomalies defined by our data are most often negative and occur over a wide range of wavelengths. The longest wavelength negative anomaly coincides well with aeromagnetic data. We find that this feature is centred over the amphibolite to granulite metamorphic facies transition exposed in the basement floor. The transition zone is analogous to the <b>Conrad</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> observed at depths of about 20 km elsewhere in the Kaapvaal craton. Petrographic studies show a marked increase in the intensity of the impact-related thermal and shock metamorphism at this transition, which we explain by the focusing and defocusing of shock waves at a rheologic interface during impact. We therefore suggest that the magnetic signature at this boundary is caused by a combination of both thermal and shock effects related to the impact event. A numerical model of the long wavelength anomaly suggests that it is underlain by a body of coherently magnetised rock whose direction and intensity are similar to those found in pseudotachylites and impact melts that formed during impact. On the other hand, negative anomalies occurring over smaller (100 to 20 m) wavelengths often do not coincide with the surface geology. These features cannot be modeled using the same criteria as that for the long wavelength anomaly...|$|E
