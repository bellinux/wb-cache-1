Following Tomasello (2003), we assume that children initially learn concrete <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> linguistic gestalts that can take different sizes and shapes, in dialogue. They then generalize across those various elements in order to assemble more abstract constructions (Fillmore 1988, Goldberg 1995) {{in the process of}} creating new utterances. These linguistic constructions are units <b>of</b> <b>language</b> that contain multiple elements used together for a coherent communicative function.

5000|$|Following {{the seminal}} work of Milman Parry, most classicists agree that, {{whether or not there}} was ever such a {{composer}} as Homer, the poems attributed to him are to some degree dependent on oral tradition, a generations-old technique that was the collective inheritance of many singer-poets (or , aōidoi). An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the Iliad and Odyssey shows that the poems contain many regular and repeated phrases; indeed, even entire verses are repeated. Thus according to the theory, the Iliad and Odyssey may have been products of oral-formulaic composition, composed on the spot by the poet using a collection of memorized traditional verses and phases. Milman Parry and Albert Lord have pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of epic poetry in an exclusively oral culture. The crucial words here are [...] "oral" [...] and [...] "traditional". Parry starts with the former: the repetitive <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> he says, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition. Parry calls these <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> repetitive <b>language</b> [...] "formulas".|$|R

It also attempted {{to determine whether there}} was a developmental relationship between formulae and productive forms called constructions. Tasks used to elicit the data included picture description tasks and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that formulae were minimally present in the learner output and that constructions and formulae of similar structure coexisted, but that a developmental relationship between formulae and constructions was not clearly evident. The discussion proposes the existence of a pre-formulaic stage account for the data, and submits that the relationship between formulae and productive constructions requires more intensive study...|$|R

As such, this qualitative action research project intended to describe content-subject teachers’ EFL oral behavior when blended learning was implemented in a professional development course and to determine the influence of blended learning in EFL oral skill behavior. The participants were seven content-subject teachers from a private school in Huila, Colombia.

The participants {{of this study}} were some MA andBA translators selected from several universities in Iran. To this aim, a proficiency test was firstly administered among the volunteers. Then, think aloud protocol and retrospective interview were used to collect data. Meanwhile, Angelone coding system was used to categorize the data. To identify the significance of differences, chi-square nonparametric test was utilized. The findings indicated that MA translators had greater tendency to show uncertainty at larger <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> such as collocation and sentence, while BA ones were more inclined to show uncertainty in textual level. At the same time, behavioral and locus options were compared and contrasted between MA andBA translators. It was also found out that look-up and rereading strategies were frequently used to manage uncertainty. The findings of this study can be helpful for translators to improve their translation ability by being more aware of what is happening inside their minds.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{measures}} of fluency and pauses appear to be useful in indicating differences in writers’ processes. The findings show that Ben who scored higher on the task had a higher writing fluency and paused less during text production than Mary. It is {{reported in the literature}} that skilled writers have a higher writing fluency than unskilled writers as most of the lower-level writing processes have become automatic for skilled writers (Field, 2004; Kellogg, 1996). Excessive pauses usually indicate writers’ lack of ability to produce <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> when writers translate ideas into linguistic forms (Matsuhashi, 1981). But {{in the context of this}} study, it seems that the differences observed in the two writers’ fluency and pausing patterns may also be because of their reading-into-writing strategies (or inappropriate use of these strategies). For example, Mary’s strategy to rely heavily on the sources during writing resulted in more frequent and longer pauses. This is in line with previous research that suggests that the high demand of integrated tasks results in lower fluency and longer pauses in most writers’ text production, especially those who do not have a good schema for constructing discourse from sources (Severinson Eklundh & Kollberg 2003).|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a corpus-based {{analysis of the}} use of “wh” sentences by language learners, in language textbooks and in authentic written discourse. It focuses on the polysemeous nature of “wh” words, which can be usedas interrogatives, declaratives and to introduce subordinate clauses. The analysis of “wh” sentences in EFL textbooks showed that there are more prototypical examples at low proficiency levels. When teaching the interrogative, textbooks focus almost exclusively on grammatical words, particularly at the beginners’ level. The analysis of “wh” sentences elicited from Chinese speaking learners of English and Expert users of English suggested that the prototypical structure is very strong in both sets of data, although native speakers tend to use more prefabricated <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> “wh” sentences from native speakers and non-native speakers’ written corpora suggested that subordinate clauses are strongly present in both corpora, except for the word “why” in non-native speakers’ data. The use of different words occurring immediately after “wh” words in the two corpora can be explained by (1) the relatively small vocabulary size of the L 2 speakers; (2) non-native speakers’ lack of awareness of restricted collocations; (3) L 1 transfer; (4) over/under-generalization of rules and (5) textbooks.

50|$|<b>Chunking</b> {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>language</b> acquisition {{constitute a}} group of theories related to statistical learning theories, in that they assume the input from the environment plays an essential role; however, they postulate different learning mechanisms. The central idea of these theories is that language development occurs through the incremental acquisition <b>of</b> meaningful <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> elementary constituents, which can be words, phonemes, or syllables. Recently, this approach has been highly successful in simulating several phenomena in the acquisition of syntactic categories and the acquisition of phonological knowledge. The approach has several features that make it unique: the models are implemented as computer programs, which enables clear-cut and quantitative predictions to be made; they learn from naturalistic input, made of actual child-directed utterances; they produce actual utterances, which can be compared with children's utterances; and they have simulated phenomena in several languages, including English, Spanish, and German.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the movements subjacent to the act of the erasure produced by pairs {{of students in the}} scholar context when they were discussing and writing a made-up story. In this work, the focused erasures attested the presence of the equivocalness as a language constitutive and the sense produced thereby. The methodological procedure of data collection consisted in filming a pair of students from the moment in which they discussed an invented a story to the moment of writing and concluding it. The registers named by Lacan as Real, Symbolic and Imaginary revealed themselves to be essential in the development of this work, since they combine unconsciousness, subjecthood, language and discourse. This work shows that the erasure is not, in spite of the student’s intentions, an instrument of “correction”. We show that the erasures made by the students point to a movement that searches for the similarity, for the recognition between what is said/written and what “should” be said/written. However, the “listening” effect of this recognition does not flow in the same direction, because there are erasure cases that encompass not only the “listening” but also what here is named “equivocal-listening”: the student, when searching for similarity, the unity <b>of</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> sometimes erases what is already “correct”, producing in this way an ambiguity/equivocalness...|$|R
40|$|Forensic authorship {{attribution}} {{is concerned}} with identifying authors of disputed or anonymous documents, which are potentially evidential in legal cases, through the analysis of linguistic clues left behind by writers. The forensic linguist “approaches this problem of questioned authorship from the theoretical position that every native speaker has their own distinct and individual version <b>of</b> the <b>language</b> [...] , their own idiolect” (Coulthard, 2004 : 31). However, given the difficulty in empirically substantiating a theory of idiolect, there is growing concern in the Veld that it remains too abstract to be of practical use (Kredens, 2002; Grant, 2010; Turell, 2010). Stylistic, corpus, and computational approaches to text, however, are able to identify repeated collocational patterns, or n-grams, two to six word <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> similar to the popular notion of soundbites: small segments {{of no more than}} a few seconds of speech that journalists are able to recognise as having news value and which characterise the important moments of talk. The soundbite offers an intriguing parallel for authorship attribution studies, with the following question arising: looking at any set of texts by any author, is it possible to identify ‘n-gram textbites’, small textual segments that characterise that author’s writing, providing DNA-like <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> identifying material? Drawing on a corpus of 63, 000 emails and 2. 5 million words written by 176 employees of the former American energy corporation Enron, a case study approach is adopted, first showing through stylistic analysis that one Enron employee repeatedly produces the same stylistic patterns of politely encoded directives in a way that may be considered habitual. Then a statistical experiment with the same case study author finds that word n-grams can assign anonymised email samples to him with success rates as high as 100 %. This paper argues that, if sufficiently distinctive, these textbites are able to identify authors by reducing a mass of data to key segments that move us closer to the elusive concept of idiolect...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{improving}} the listening skills of Grade VIII students of SMPN 5 Panggang, Gunungkidul in the Academic Year of 2013 / 2014 through digital media. This collaborative action research study {{was carried out in}} three cycles. The design consisted of: (1) planning, (2) action, (3) observation, and (4) reflection. The data of this research study consisted of qualitative and quantitative data gathered through observations, interviews/testimonies, rating, video/audio recording, and performance tests. The qualitative data were analyzed using the interactive qualitative data analysis which included: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The quantitative ones were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Efforts were done to fulfill the validity, those are: democratic validity, outcome validity, process validity, and dialogic validity. On the other hand, the reliability of the data was established through methodological triangulation, time triangulation, and investigator triangulation. The findings show that the digital media are believed to improve the listening learning processes which lead into the improvement of students’ listening skills. The process of using the digital media are done through the modified three-stage listening in the following actions: (a) using pictures to direct students’ attention to the lesson, (b) using audio/audio-visual media to do extensive listening activities, (c) using audio media to do pronunciation intensive practices, (d) using audio/audio-visual media to apply word recognition activities, and (e) using audio/audio-visual media to conduct listening comprehension activities. The results of the actions are as follows. First, pictures in the pre-listening activity are found to increase students’ interest in the lesson, direct their minds into the topic, and motivate them to learn. Second, audio media make students happy during the instruction and actively involved in the listening instructional process. Third, the audio media also enable students to: recognize the communicative functions of the texts, retain the <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> distinguish among the distinctive sounds of English, recognize English stress patterns and intonation, recognize words in the given spoken texts, and comprehend the texts. Fourth, the digital stories (audio- visual media) are able to grab students’ attention, make them happy, facilitate them to focus on the monologues and comprehend them better so they are able to infer situations, participants, goals of the spoken texts...|$|R
