This paper suggests a comprehensive evaluation model {{for one of the most}} important e-commerce systems, which is <b>cyber</b> <b>trading</b> system for stocks and bonds. Through an empirical study based on the evaluation model, this research identifies critical design factors for <b>cyber</b> <b>trading</b> systems that are closely related to the level of user satisfaction, and consequently, thelevel of customer loyalty. Keywords <b>Cyber</b> <b>Trading</b> Systems, e valuation model, design factors INTRODUCTION As the Internet business is growing rapidly, more people are looking for a comprehensive evaluation model that includes not only a sound theoretical background but also concrete design factors. However, most prior evaluation models usually focus on either theoretical or practical issues only [1, 2, 3]. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation model that can identify the relationship between concrete d [...] ...|$|E

Information is not enough just through text and graphics alone, but the information includes text, graphics, animated images, video and audio. Multimedia computer applications that are widely used today is e-commerce, e-commerce where the buying or selling activity conducted electronically on the Internet. E-commerce can also be more specific means of advertising, sales, delivery and service {{to take advantage of}} a web show 24 hours a day for all customers. E-commerce is a fraction of the facilities provided in the wilds Internet (cyber space). However, its existence is vital to boost the business of a company that wants to go-International. E-commerce is a combination of technology, apllications, proceses and strategic bussinees. Object of this study discusses the success factors (opportunities) and failures (challenges) in e-commerce menerepkan especially in Indonesia and this study also discusses the application of e-commerce as a bridge to <b>cyber</b> <b>trade</b> transactions between the consumer and the merchant bank, a payment server that will authorize a credit card or debit card online. Data taken from the successes and failures of previous studies beberpa survey were analyzed and presented in this study. Based on the results of this study found that the role of government to impose regulations to create a market trend and pioneering e-commerce, especially in the improvement of the trading system. To boost interest in e-commerce is not independent of consciousness, beliefs, customs and culture of a society of Indonesia. Cultures in Indonesia who still believe in the traditional trades of the e-commerce. However, e-commerce will still be needed in the face of the global market. To petrify the small and medium industries (SMEs) in creating a market trend of digital government intervention is needed in creating a framework in a comprehensive system such as applications, technical infrastructure and non-technical, regulatory management, monetary policy, including banking and other financial institutions Key words: provider, <b>cyber</b> <b>trade,</b> e-mail, <b>cyber</b> space, framework, Comercene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{reports on}} a trade study we {{performed}} to support {{the development of a}} Cyber ontology from an initial malware ontology. The goals of the Cyber ontology effort are first described, followed by a discussion of the ontology development methodology used. The main body of the paper then follows, which is a description of the potential ontologies and standards that could be utilized to extend the Cyber ontology from its initially constrained malware focus. These resources include, in particular, Cyber and malware standards, schemas, and terminologies that directly contributed to the initial malware ontology effort. Other resources are upper (sometimes called 'foundational') ontologies. Core concepts that any Cyber ontology will extend have already been identified and rigorously defined in these foundational ontologies. However, for lack of space, this section is profoundly reduced. In addition, utility ontologies that are focused on time, geospatial, person, events, and network operations are briefly described. These utility ontologies can be viewed as specialized super-domain or even mid-level ontologies, since they span many, if not most, ontologies [...] including any Cyber ontology. An overall view of the ontological architecture used by the trade study is also given. The report on the trade study concludes with some proposed next steps in the iterative evolution of the Cyber ontology. Index Terms—ontology, malware, <b>cyber,</b> <b>trade</b> study...|$|R

50|$|Mbita Point is a rural {{community}} in the former province of Nyanza, Kenya, currently in Homa Bay County, {{on the shores of}} Lake Victoria. It is home to the Thomas Odhiambo campus of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE). A public primary school formerly international and a clinic are hosted by the centre. Mbita has several other primary schools as well as secondary schools. A small sub-district hospital is in the town. The main district hospital is in the neighbouring town of Sindo, 17 km away. Mbita has had water and electricity since 2005. Mbita Point has an urban population of 6100, but the population grows rapidly due to urbanization, new technologies like cell phone coverage and internet connection through <b>cyber</b> cafes, electrification, <b>trade</b> and education.http://treasury.go.ke/cbs.go.ke/pdf/authority.pdf The town was the capital of the former Suba District.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Great Depression in Australia, and attempts to explain the reasons why the orthodox economic theories of the day did little to relieve the hardship and suffering caused by unemployment. The study highlights the influence of leading Australian economists, such as L. F. Giblin, D. B. Copland, J. B. Brigden and E. O. Shann, in shaping government policy towards the unemployed. It also {{examines the}} role of the Bank of England, which exercised a great deal of control over the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and public policy during the Depression in Australia. The advice given by the Bank of England to the Commonwealth Bank made it difficult, if not impossible, for politicians and economists to introduce initiatives that would have created jobs and lifted the burden from the most vulnerable in society. As banks and financial institutions now operate in the sphere of <b>cyber</b> finance, and <b>trading</b> in derivatives is commonplace, perhaps a detailed analysis of the 1930 s in Australia will ensure that the lessons of history are understood.
