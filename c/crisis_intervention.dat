5|$|Members of the Vanderlip family, {{particularly}} Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, {{continued to}} administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, {{and the creation of}} an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977. The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978. In 1980, the buildings and property were taken over by The Clear View School, which opened in September 1981 after major renovations. The school runs a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21, and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester; its program involves education, treatment, and <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> and parent involvement.|$|E

The following day, twelve disaster recovery centers were opened in the affected counties for residents to apply for federal funding. On September9, two more disaster recovery centers were opened for residents in south Texas. Later that day, $831,593.28 (1999USD) in disaster housing grants was distributed to affected residents. On September15, roughly 10,200 people applied for disaster loans, amounting to $3.1million (1999USD). A total of 167 also received <b>crisis</b> <b>intervention</b> from FEMA.

40|$|Background Crisis {{situations}} in dementia {{can lead to}} hospital admission or institutionalisation. Offering immediate interventions may help avoid admission, whilst stabilising measures can help prevent future crises. Objective Our objective was to identify the main causes of <b>crisis</b> and <b>interventions</b> to treat or prevent crisis in persons with dementia based on different stakeholder perspectives. Methods An online questionnaire was developed to identify the causes of <b>crisis</b> and appropriate <b>interventions</b> in a <b>crisis.</b> Participants included people with dementia, family carers and staff working in health and social care, including emergency and voluntary sectors, and academia. Results The results ranked the main causes of <b>crisis,</b> <b>interventions</b> that can prevent a <b>crisis</b> and <b>interventions</b> that {{can be useful in}} a crisis. Wandering, falls and infection were highly rated as risk factors for crises across all stakeholder groups. Consumers rated aggression as less important but severity of memory impairment as much more important than the other groups did. Education and support for family carers and home care staff were highly valued for preventing crises. Well-trained home care staff, communication equipment, emergency contacts and access to respite were highly valued for managing crises. Conclusions We identified triggers and interventions that different stakeholders see as important for crisis in dementia. Recognition of these may be critical to planning effective and accepted support and care for people with dementia...|$|R
