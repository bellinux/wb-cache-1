5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally <b>challengeable</b> on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E

A strong emphasis on experimentation and empiricism led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as Rhazes, Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi (Haly Abbas), Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulasis), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, the experiments carried out by Rāzi and Ibn Zuhr contradicted the Galenic theory of humorism, while Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the pulmonary circulation contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.|$|E
500|$|The act or {{decision}} {{of a public}} authority is <b>challengeable</b> if it acted in bad faith, that is, it [...] "intentionally abused its power or was reckless {{as to whether it}} did so". Thus, the Singapore Court of Appeal held in Law Society of Singapore v.

The applicant must adduce sufficient evidence to prove bad faith; mere suspicion is inadequate. The court will consider all the evidence as well as any explanation provided by the respondent, and an inference against the respondent can be drawn if no explanation is given. In the UK context, bad faith is seldom relied on as a ground of review as it is absent in most cases, or difficult to prove.|$|E

It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd.

The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously.

5000|$|... 2012: The {{prime time}} contest became infamous for the [...] "Butt fumble", an {{incident}} in which Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez ran headfirst into the buttocks of his own offensive lineman. He subsequently fumbled the ball; it was recovered by New England, who returned it for a touchdown. In the earlier game, one of the NFL's most infamous rule changes came when former Lions coach Jim Schwartz challenged a play in which Texans running back Justin Forsett's knee clearly touched the ground before sprinting for an 81-yard touchdown. Referee Walt Coleman stated that, by rule, scoring plays are automatically reviewed and the play was not <b>challengeable</b> by a coach. Because of the improper attempted challenge, the review was cancelled and Coleman assessed a 15-yard kickoff penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. The NFL then passed a new rule that stated that if a coach attempted to challenge a play that is automatically reviewed, the review would continue. It was called the 'Jim Schwartz rule'.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} video game AI (artificial intelligence) is to {{generate}} AI {{that is both}} <b>challengeable</b> and satisfactory. Most existing game AI is implemented by FSM (finite state machine) which has drawbacks in the three respects: requirement of designer’s intensive participation; no existence of meta-programming; no planning and looking forward. Contributions of the paper is to propose CI (computational intelligence) as an approach to create both <b>challengeable</b> and satisfactory game opponents better than using FSM in the above three respects. During the research, two prey and predator genre games of Dead-End and Pac-Man are used as test-beds to prove the proposed theory. To create a <b>challengeable</b> game opponent, we proposed two CI approaches: “CI-controlled-NPC ” and “knowledge-based-CI-controlled-NPC”. As the latter is based on knowledge and is more computational resource efficient than the former, so the latter is more applicable for multi-player online games, while the former is only applicable for standalone PC game. To create a satisfactory game opponent, is to optimize player’s experience {{through the creation of}} an even game. To better satisfy the player, we proposed two CI-based DDAs (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) : DDA by “timeconstrained-CI” and DDA by “knowledge-based-time-constrained-CI”; both of which outperform the existing DDA. As the latter is based on knowledge and more computational resource efficient than the former, so it is more applicable for multi-player online games, while the former is only applicable for standalone PC game.

40|$|Background The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the postural control in patients underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction pre and post wearing functional knee brace. Methods Eighteen athletes undergone unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction included in the study. They had unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction {{at least six months}} before session test. Postural control was assessed pre and post wearing custom-fit functional knee brace using a posturographic platform prokin 254. The balance tests included: 1) standing on prokin platform with eyes open/closed on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction limb, 2) standing on prokin platform with eyes open/closed on both limbs. The standard deviation (SD) of body sway along the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) axis, mean velocity of center of pressure (COP) along AP/ ML axis and the area ellipse (measured in 2 mm) were calculated. Results Results of the paired T-test revealed a significant effect on selected postural control variables for the brace conditions especially in low <b>challengeable</b> conditions (double leg, eyes open test situations) (P < 0. 05). But in high <b>challengeable</b> conditions this effect was not significant.
