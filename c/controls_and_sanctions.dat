40|$|AIMS - This article {{describes}} and analyses prisoners’ experiences of drug treatment {{in prison in}} four Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The article examines how prisoners experience drug treatment, control and sanctions as related to three main topics, namely motivation; {{the content of the}} measure and relations to staff; and control and sanctions. METHODS & DATA - The article is based on data from twelve prisons, three {{in each of the four}} countries; 91 interviews with prisoners; and around six months of observation. The two main kinds of drug treatment measures are drug treatment units and day programmes. RESULTS - Prisoners described several motives to participate in drug treatment measures: to leave drugs and crime; to renew relations with family and friends; to solve health problems; and to improve their prison conditions. Prisoners found that drug treatment measures offered possibilities to acquire new ways of being. Staff behaviour seemed to be more important to prisoners than the methods used, and some prisoners seemed more positive to staff involved with the drug treatment than to other staff. A surprising finding was the prisoners’ limited critique of <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> We see this as embedded in the situation of being a prisoner, and also in relation to contexts outside prison. CONCLUSION - In discussing their experiences in the treatment units, prisoners are not so concerned about the rehabilitative features or the <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> They evaluate their present situation in light of a future, which is their real concern. This is in line with a main task for staff, which is to prepare prisoners for release...|$|E

40|$|Agri-environmental {{schemes and}} {{cross-compliance}} {{are the two}} main components of the Common Agricultural Policy that address environmental issues. Under regulation 1698 / 2005, agri-environmental scheme design {{has been established in}} such a way as to use cross-compliance as the baseline against which prescriptions and payments are identified. In this framework, agri-environmental payments to farmers are justified only for the component of public goods produced (if any) above the cross-compliance prescription level. This constraint has become a major determinant of the design of agri-environmental schemes in all EU Member States in which both instruments are implemented. This paper investigates farmer participation, compliance choices and socially optimal level of monitoring when cross-compliance and agri-environmental schemes are jointly considered, and when information about compliance is asymmetrically distributed between farmers and the public regulator. The results show that the two policy instruments interact with each other, with agri-environmental payments actually providing incentives for cross-compliance, when the cross-compliance monitoring and sanction system does not guarantee full compliance. However, the numerical example in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) demonstrates that with the present combination of <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions,</b> farmers have very little incentive to be compliant with both cross compliance and agri-environmental schemes. Hence, the results highlight that the monitoring in CC or in AES does not have the same effect on the farmers’ compliance.

30|$|In both approaches, {{it must be}} {{ensured that}} the {{additionality}} and permanency of forest conservation not be undermined by counteracting reactions. So-called leakage must be prevented. This refers to {{the risk that the}} previous owners might shift their deforestation activities to other areas, that the current project owners might neglect their forest areas and that the state itself might conduct or at least tolerate forest degradations elsewhere. The very fact that this is possible is due to shortcomings in existing forest law, because previous users of the rainforest who relocate to other areas must be legally authorised to do so, and indeed are able to do so {{due to a lack of}} <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> This becomes impossible if other people and organisations own the rights to use the land in question and if their rights are effectively protected. The same is true for leakage through the investor. Once his project is authorised, he might be tempted to neglect the necessary upkeep and protection of the land against exterior impacts, as this would result in cost savings for him. After all, his commitment would be considered ‘permanent’. It is also conceivable that, at a later date, an investor could intentionally carry out deforestations so as to acquire further revenue in addition to the gains from the emission rights. In such cases, forest law could also offer protection: once the authorised right of use is specified for the conservation of a forest area, its destruction would be illegal and forbidden.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol {{intoxication}} and overserving {{of alcohol}} at sporting events are of great concern, given {{the relationships between}} alcohol consumption, public disturbances, and violence. During recent years this matter {{has been on the}} agenda for Swedish policymakers, authorities and key stakeholders, with demands that actions be taken. There is promising potential for utilizing an environmental approach to alcohol prevention as a strategy to reduce the level of alcohol intoxication among spectators at sporting events. Examples of prevention strategies may be community mobilization, Responsible Beverage Service training, policy work, and improved <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> This paper describes the design of a quasi-experimental control group study {{to examine the effects of}} a multi-component community-based alcohol intervention at matches in the Swedish Premier Football League. Methods A baseline assessment was conducted during 2015 and at least two follow-up assessments will be conducted in 2016 and 2017. The two largest cities in Sweden are included in the study, with Stockholm as the intervention area and Gothenburg as the control area. The setting is Licensed Premises (LP) inside and outside Swedish football arenas, in addition to arena entrances. Spectators are randomly selected and invited to participate in the study by providing a breath alcohol sample as a proxy for Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Actors are hired and trained by an expert panel to act out a standardized scene of severe pseudo-intoxication. Four types of cross-sectional data are generated: (i) BAC levels among[*]≥[*] 4   200 spectators, frequency of alcohol service to pseudo-intoxicated patrons attempting to purchase alcohol at LP (ii) outside the arenas (≥ 200 attempts) and (iii) inside the arenas (≥ 200 attempts), and (iv) frequency of security staff interventions towards pseudo-intoxicated patrons attempting to enter the arenas (≥ 200 attempts). Discussion There is an urgent need nationally and internationally to reduce alcohol-related problems at sporting events, and it is essential to test prevention strategies to reduce intoxication levels among spectators. This project makes an important contribution not only to the research community, but also to enabling public health officials, decision-makers, authorities, the general public, and the sports community, to implement appropriate evidence-based strategies...|$|E

40|$|NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Rapporten er en evaluering av Regionprosjektet, et statlig styrt, lokalt basert forebyggingsprosjekt som ble initiert av Bondevik II-regjeringen. Ingeborg Rossow, Bergljot Baklien, Hilde Pape og Elisabet E. Storvoll står bak evalueringen, som er gjort på oppdrag av det tidligere Sosialdepartementet. Analysene bygger på et omfattende datamateriale der bl. a. intervjuer med aktører på sentralt og lokalt nivå, observasjon av møter og iverksetting av tiltak, spørreskjemaundersøkelser av 40 000 skoleungdommer og kjøpsforsøk i butikker som selger øl inngår. Ingen kortsiktige effekter Regionprosjektet hovedmålsetting om å redusere rusmiddelbruk og begrense rusrelaterte skader blant ungdom ble ikke innfridd i løpet av den perioden som evalueringen dekker (2004 - 2006). Prosjektet bidro heller ikke til å begrense ungdoms tilgang på alkohol. Rapporten peker på flere mulige forklaringer på de manglende resultatene. Bare et fåtall av tiltakene som kommunene ble anbefalt av Sosial- og helsedirektoratet hadde dokumentert effekt på rusmiddelbruk og rusrelaterte skader. Mange av tiltakene hadde et langt tidsperspektiv og noen ble satt i gang i ufullstendige "light"-versjoner. Samarbeid og ny kunnskap Regionprosjektet har derimot ført til at en del av kommunene har etablert nye tverrfaglige samarbeidsformer både internt og seg i mellom. Når det gjelder tilpasning og videreutvikling av forebyggingstiltak, har dessuten den lokale kompetansen økt. Organiseringen i kommunene har vært funksjonell, og prosjektet har hatt god politisk og administrativ forankring lokalt. Samarbeidet med Sosial- og helsedirektoratet på sentralt nivå opplevde derimot mange av de involverte kommunene som problematisk. Framtidig forebygging Rapporten peker på at ingen av kommunene i Regionprosjektet har tatt i bruk de mest virksomme strategiene i rusforebygging. Forskning viser at det å begrense tilgjengeligheten på alkohol har effekt. Strengere håndheving av salgs- og skjenkebestemmelsene kan også være virksomme forebyggingstiltak. Fakta om Regionprosjektet Regionprosjektet var en del av Bondevik II-regjeringens Handlingsplan mot rusmiddelproblemer (2003 - 2005). Hovedmålsettingen var å utvikle gode forebyggende tiltak og å videreutvikle eksisterende tiltak med sikte på å begrense rusmiddelbruk og rusmiddelrelaterte skader, med hovedfokus på barn og unge. Seks kommuner/regioner ble valgt ut til å delta i prosjektet: Larvik, Haugesund, Narvik, Os, Nesodden og fire kommuner på Ytre Søre Sunnmøre. De mottok til sammen 20 millioner kroner over en periode på tre år, og fikk i tillegg faglig veiledning fra de regionale kompetansesentrene for rusmiddelspørsmål. Sosial- og helsedirektoratet sto for den sentrale styringen av prosjektet. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This report {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the Regional Project. This project was part of the Plan of Action to Prevent Alcohol and Drug Problems (2003 - 2005) of the Norwegian Government under Prime Minister Bondevik (II). As we interpret the Plan of Action, the main aim of the project was to develop effective preventive measures and to develop further existing measures with a view to limiting the use of alcohol and drugs, and harms related to substance use, with the main focus on children and young people. Six municipalities / regions (called test municipalities) were chosen to participate in the Regional Project. Altogether they were granted NOK 20 million over a period of three years; the amount per municipality reflected the population size. In addition they were given professional guidance from the Regional Resource Centres for Alcohol and Drug Issues. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs was responsible for the central management of the project. The aims of the evaluation were: • to assess how the intentions of the Plan of Action were translated and interpreted by the Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs, and subsequently by the test municipalities • to find out how the extra allocation of funding for preventive work in the field of alcohol and drug problems, together with central management and professional follow-up from the Regional Resource Centres, were transformed into measures at the local level • to investigate how organization of the Regional Project, both centrally and locally, influenced the implementation and accomplishment of the measures • to identify whether there were indications that the activities had resulted in reduced use of alcohol and drugs, fewer alcohol-related problems, and more limited availability of alcohol for young people under the age-limit • to find out whether the use of resources had had other positive effects in the local community, for example in the form of increased skills or new structures for cooperation • to highlight positive experiences that can be developed in other locally-based measures. We carried out both process and effect evaluation of the Regional Project. The analyses were based on a comprehensive data material, which included documents, videos, observations of meetings and implementation of measures, a large number of interviews with key persons at the central and local levels, questionnaire surveys of almost 40 000 school children in the test and control municipalities before and after implementation of the measures, attempts to buy beer in shops before and after the measures, and a survey of preventive activities in all the lower secondary and upper secondary schools in all the test and control municipalities during the project period. A central working group for the project was appointed with representatives from all the seven Regional Resource Centres and the central project leader in the Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs. In addition to professional follow-up of the test municipalities, the Regional Resource Centres acted as coordinators between the central and local levels. This organization meant that the test municipalities had limited influence on the central management of the project. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs operationalized the Plan of Action, and developed a list of twelve recommended preventive measures. However, only a few of these measures had documented effect on substance use and related harms. This recommendation of preventive measures reduced the sense of ownership of the intervention at the local level Follow up from the Regional Resource Centres varied between the municipalities both in extent and content. The local conditions for implementation also varied, both with regard to continuation of established projects and cooperation, and with regard to organization of the project. At the start of the project, the management of the project by the Directorate was fairly strong and detailed. Moreover, communication from the central to the local level was unclear, both with respect to the time scale for the project, how much funding each test municipality would receive, and whether the municipalities could choose measures that were not on the list. The unclear signals from the central level led to frustration as well as a delay in implementation of measures the local level. The test municipalities’ own considerations (regarding factors such as whether the measures were easy to implement) were of primary importance when the test municipalities chose preventive measures. In addition to the measures on the Directorate’s list, most of the municipalities also chose a range of other interventions. In several cases this involved continuation of projects that were already underway. Children and young people were the most important target groups, and many of the measures had a long-term perspective. Not all the measures were implemented according to the plan. Several of the municipalities implemented more measures than they had originally committed themselves to, and we saw much enthusiasm and drive in the test municipalities. Effect evaluation was primarily based on questionnaire surveys of 13 - 19 year old school children in the test municipalities and in seven control municipalities. The results gave no indication that the Regional Project had led to reduced alcohol use, drug use or related harms. There was also nothing to indicate that the project had contributed to limiting the availability of alcohol to young people. The analyses also did not give any indication that the Regional Project had contributed to improving young people’s knowledge or changing their attitudes to alcohol and drugs, or to the limits set by parents with regard to alcohol and drugs, or parents’ communication about this. We also evaluated the effect of one measure, for which the aim was to limit sale of alcohol to young people under the age-limit, and found no effects. There are several possible explanations for the discouraging results of the effect evaluation: The measures had very limited potential for prevention, several measures had long-term perspectives and some of them were implemented as incomplete “light versions”. It is also worth mentioning that background figures indicate that the number of establishments for selling and serving alcohol in the test municipalities was relatively stable during the project period. However, the Regional Project seems to have had other positive effects. Local coordination and local ownership were central concepts in the Plan of Action. The project’s only example of inter-municipal cooperation and coordination showed that this is both demanding and productive. Some municipalities had their own coordination measures, and they all succeeded in improving multi-sectoral and inter-agency cooperation. In addition, local skills in adaptation and development of measures were improved. The local organization in the test municipalities was generally good and functioned well, and led to coordination of personnel resources between agencies and departments. The Regional Project had a sound political basis in most of the test municipalities, as a result of both the involvement and active commitment of the chairperson of the municipal council and the chief municipal executive. Personal factors such as enthusiasm and competence, legitimacy and ability to find room to manoeuvre, were important for the project at all levels. Another important experience gained was related to the time-scale. Several of the municipalities regarded prevention of alcohol and drug problems as long-term work. Both building the foundation and implementing the work take time, but the centrally-determined time-scale took little account of long-term ambitions. In conclusion, we found that the Regional Project achieved the aims of the Plan of Action only in some areas. This was primarily in the areas of local coordination and cooperation. We found no evidence that the main aims of limiting use of alcohol and drugs, limiting alcohol related harms, and limiting availability of alcohol to young people, were achieved. This is probably related to the fact that none of the municipalities implemented measures that {{are most likely to be}} effective; - i. e. limiting the availability of alcohol (number and opening hours of outlets), and increased enforcement of alcohol sales regulations (<b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions)</b> ...|$|E

The objective of this paper is to present a framework for the analysis of cross-compliance under asymmetric information with the option of differentiating commitments across farmers. The methodology is applied to a case study represented by the province of Bologna (Italy). The results show that, in the present conditions of <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions,</b> only a small share of farms is interested in complying with cross-compliance. The profitability of the choice of compliance/non-compliance depends mainly on the amount of single farm payment entitlements compared with the total land.
