50|$|Triangular {{arbitrage}} (also {{referred to}} as cross <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage</b> or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. A triangular arbitrage strategy involves three trades, exchanging the initial currency for a second, the second currency for a third, and the third currency for the initial. During the second trade, the arbitrageur locks in a zero-risk profit from the discrepancy that exists when the market cross exchange rate is not aligned with the implicit cross exchange rate. A profitable trade is only possible if there exist market imperfections. Profitable triangular arbitrage is very rarely possible because when such opportunities arise, traders execute trades that {{take advantage of the}} imperfections and prices adjust up or down until the opportunity disappears.|$|E

His {{assignments}} advanced and he eventually became {{the head of the}} bank’s <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage</b> section. Due to Japanese occupation in China, it resulted in replacement of many bank personnel, including Au. Au and Mickey Markarov started a bicycle assembly venture. Eventually his business expanded into a tricycle taxi service. In February 1949, Au and his family subsequently returned to Hong Kong. Due to China on becoming a communist country, Au had no opportunity to liquidate or bring along any asset. [...] In Hong Kong, Au started Dalen Export Company and his wife was his secretary. He then gradually started his own trading business, King Merritt & Co., in Hong Kong.|$|E
5000|$|To reduce profiteering from <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> the U.S. {{military}} {{devised the}} MPC program. MPCs were paper money denominated in amounts of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, and starting in 1968 20 dollars. Unlike US currency, these certificates were issued {{under the authority}} of the Department of War (later Department of Defense) rather than the Department of the Treasury. Consequently they do not bear the US Treasury seal found on virtually every example of US currency. MPCs were fully convertible to U.S. dollars upon leaving a designated MPC zone, and convertible to local currencies when going on leave (but not vice versa). Because they were and are not obligations of the US Treasury, they are (unlike all US currency) no longer redeemable. It was illegal for unauthorized personnel to possess MPC, and that policy, in theory, eliminated U.S. dollars from local economies. Although actual greenbacks were not circulating, many local merchants accepted MPC on par with US dollars, since they could use them on the black market. This was especially evident during the Vietnam War when the MPC program was at its zenith. To prevent MPC from being used as a primary currency in the host country and destroying the local currency value and economy, MPC banknote styles were frequently changed to deter black marketers and reduce hoarding, as the old style would become worthless. Many veterans can recount a conversion day or C-Day.|$|E

50|$|In 1528, Beatrice de Luna {{married her}} uncle, {{the very rich}} black pepper trader and new Christian in Lisbon, Francisco Mendes. Francisco also {{happened}} {{to belong to the}} same very prominent Jewish family as her mother - Benveniste from Castile and Aragon - and was also the great grandchild of Don Abraham Benveniste of Castile. The couple were believed to have been married in the great cathedral of Lisbon, in a public Catholic wedding, and then to have had a Crypto-Judaic ceremony with the signing of a ketubah. Francisco Mendes and his brother, Diogo, were the directors of a powerful trading company and bank of world renown, with agents across Europe and around the Mediterranean. The House of Mendes/Benveniste probably began as a company trading precious objects and <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> Following the beginning of the Age of Discovery and the finding, by the Portuguese, of a sea route to India, the Mendes brothers became particularly important spice traders. They also traded in silver - the silver was needed to pay the Asians for those spices. In January 1538, when Beatrice was only twenty-eight years old, Francisco died. In his will Francisco divided his fortune between Beatrice and his brother and business partner, Diogo; this bold decision put Beatrice on the path to becoming the successful and renowned business woman of the sixteenth century that we know her for today. Later on, Beatrice ask the Pope to move the remains of Francisco to a new location. When the approval arrived she moved them to the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.|$|E

By looking into cross-listed and cross-currency stocks in several exchanges, {{it is found that}} arbitrage is indeed a viable option, since price differences of the same assets exist in a numéraire currency at the same instant of time. Taking advantage of such arbitrage opportunities, profit is made first in the assets trade, and then the initial profit is churned further in an iterative arbitrage process in the <b>currency</b> market where <b>arbitrage</b> is covered by forward and option contracts.

The redefinition of the MSCI world equity index in December 2000 provides an ideal natural experiment identifying exogenous capital flows of index tracking equity funds. Currency speculators are shown to front-run international capital flows. Furthermore, they actively manage the portfolio risk of their speculative positions through hedging positions in correlated currencies. The exchange rate effect of separate risk hedging is economically significant {{and amounts to}} a return difference of 3. 6 percent over a 5 day event window between currencies with high and low risk hedging value. The results of the classical event study analysis are confirmed by {{a new and more}} powerful spectral inference isolating the high frequency cospectrum of currency pairs. The evidence supports the idea that international <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is limited by the speculators' risk aversion.

40|$|The Hong Kong {{currency}} board arrangement (CBA) is reviewed historically and tested empirically, {{in terms of}} its ability to “fix ” the officially announced exchange rate of HK$ 7. 80 /US $ since October 1983. We confine our attention to the CBA’s technical viability. Keeping track of all major documents and reports, the historical review is based on a detailed account of the institutional changes in the system while the empirical part relies on econometric techniques. The key theoretical and institutional hypothesis of ours is that the system behaved like a narrow target zone, before the seven technical measures implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in September 1998 that turned the system into a more self-adjusting entity with an effective <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage</b> mechanism. Credibility tests and mean-reversion tests are applied to historical data. The findings point to a Hong Kong CBA that suffered periodic shocks and attacks, yet showing an ability to return to a mean, with the notable exception of the several months following the speculative attack in 1997. While elements of the defense mechanism of a classical CBA contributed partly to this relative robustness, it was also a result of the HKMA’s intervention in the foreign exchange and the money markets.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{commodity}} {{money and the}} method of money analysis through its function formulated by Copernicus belong to the significant achievments {{of the history of}} economic thought. In the field of money theory there is so called Copernic Law, whose invention has been unjustly attributed to Gresham. The above mentioned Law can be formulated in short as follows: if there are two sorts of currency in circulation, having the same nominal value but not the same real (substantial) value, then the full-value coins (standart money) are driven out of circulation by undervalued money. Another Copernicus intellectual inventions in the domain of money theory are the following, 'still actual conceptions: a) unity of official and market price of currency metal constitutes the basic condition of functioning of metallic commodity money, b) transgression of the threshold of <b>currency</b> <b>arbitrage</b> (melting of currency into the pure metal) brings that unity down and therefore should be corrected by the state interventionism, c) creeping depreciation of currency originates usually negative and grave in results economic changes in the structure of prices. The Copernican views of money, especially the principle of periodicity of currency system reforms (every 25 years) and also that one concerning the subordination of currency to raison d'Etat are of great importance. To Copernicus the money has not been an object of its own, but it was the mean serving to an end. One of his statements said that the countries with full-value coins were prosperous in contradiistinctioin to those ones having had currency... and "good coin is not only advantegous to the state but also [ [...] . ] to all classes of population while the bad money is disastrous".

5000|$|Some {{types of}} hedge funds {{make use of}} a {{modified}} form of arbitrage to profit. Rather than exploiting price differences between identical assets, they will purchase and sell securities, assets and derivatives with similar characteristics, and hedge any {{significant differences between the}} two assets. Any difference between the hedged positions represents any remaining risk (such as basis risk) plus profit; the belief is that there remains some difference which, even after hedging most risk, represents pure profit. For example, a fund may see that there is a substantial difference between U.S. dollar debt and local currency debt of another country, and enter into a series of matching trades (including <b>currency</b> swaps) to <b>arbitrage</b> the difference, while simultaneously entering into credit default swaps to protect against country risk and other types of specific risk.|$|R
40|$|If {{financial}} markets displayed the informational efficiency postulated in the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), arbitrage operations would be self-extinguishing. The present paper considers arbitrage sequences in foreign exchange (FX) markets, in which trading platforms and information are fragmented. In Kozyakin et al. (2010) and Cross et al. (2012) {{it was shown}} that sequences of triangular arbitrage operations in FX markets containing 4 currencies and trader-arbitrageurs tend to display periodicity or grow exponentially rather than being self-extinguishing. This paper extends the analysis to 5 or higher-order currency worlds. The key findings are that in a 5 -currency world arbitrage sequences may also follow an exponential law as well as display periodicity, but that in higher-order currency worlds a double exponential law may additionally apply. There is an "inheritance of instability" in the higher-order <b>currency</b> worlds. Profitable <b>arbitrage</b> operations are thus endemic rather that displaying the self-extinguishing properties implied by the EMH.

40|$|Currency board {{arrangements}} (CBAs) are a {{very strong}} form of fixed exchange rate regime. Like the gold standard, they rely on market forces, rather than on foreign exchange controls or interventions, to fix the exchange rate. CBAs have been adopted {{in a variety of}} institutional forms and with varying degrees of success in a number of economies. In theory, the classical CBA, which originated in the 19 th century, uses three anchors to fix the exchange rate: (i) economic discipline, because of the requirement that currency issues should be fully backed by foreign reserves; (ii) specie flow and interest arbitrage; and (iii) <b>currency</b> (cash) <b>arbitrage,</b> which binds the spot exchange rate. In practice, not all three anchors function effectively in every CBA. Regarding economic optimality, the case for or against CBAs is broadly similar to the debate on fixed versus floating exchange rate, but the link between the narrower monetary aggregate and the balance of payments in a CBA tends to be even closer than in other fixed rate regimes. Williamson (1995) has identified some advantages and disadvantages of CBAs. Insofar as a great deal of resources have been committed to CBAs to make them more credible and robust, they may have difficulty adjusting to major structural changes and irreversible divergence in the longer run. Modifying or abandoning them would carry very high adjustment cost or exit cost. In the extreme, total commitment begs the question of why the “dollarization ” option—replacing the home currency with the foreign currency to which it is pegged—was not adopted instead...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.
