They authorize water abstrations and wastewater discharges for all users, based on a basin master plan (Plan directeur d'aménagement intégré des ressources en eau, PDAIRE) that they prepare. They also <b>collect</b> <b>charges</b> for abstraction and effluent discharges. They are also supposed to provide financial help and technical assistance to service providers for the prevention of water pollution and the efficient use of water resources. They also monitor {{the quality and quantity of}} both surface and groundwater and are in charge of managing water-related emergencies. Finally, they should increase public awareness about water resources. The agencies cover the following basins ranked in the order of the available water resources in each basin: Sebou River, Moulouya River, Oum Er-Rbia River, Bou Regreg River, Tensift River, Loukkos River and the Souss-Massa basin, Ziz-Er Gheris et Sakia el Hamra-Oued Eddahab. The means available to the basin agencies are largely insufficient to carry out their functions.|$|E

This project studies game-theoretic formation of a type of wireless access network: community-based multi-hop wireless network.

Results show that if gateways (node with wired connection) can <b>collect</b> <b>charges</b> from other nodes, the network can be sustained.

This article presents {{a new approach to}} analysing applications of market-based instruments for water resources in China. Expanding the analysis beyond a rational choice approach, it demonstrates the institutional dimension of policy implementation at the local level in China. Four peculiar features of China's water institutions influence local governments in dealing with {{water abstraction}} differently from how regulators might expect. This explains local governmental failures and the implementation of water abstraction policies in several ways, including the setting of charges at low levels, a lack of necessary monitoring and sanctions, few incentives to <b>collect</b> <b>charges</b> diligently, and failure to provide accessible information for the public. 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The key {{topic of}} this paper is to explain the above average {{increase}} of local waste charges in Germany, in addition the special importance of local within national environmental policies. The jump of waste charges, especially since 1990, has originated in the changed institutional setting of waste management, for its part a result of increasing waste material. It includes an expansion of waste management services (for instance, waste treatment, waste disposal), higher technical demands referring to waste disposal (waste incineration, waste disposal sites) and excess capacity of municipal incinerators resulting from a higher percentage of waste recycling. In addition to financing disposal and treatment, waste charges shall also give financial incentives to waste avoidance considering the social costs of waste management (for instance, pollutants of waste incineration) ("ecological waste charges"). The authors recommend to apply new approaches to <b>collect</b> <b>charges,</b> that give rise to waste avoidance and recycling.

With its continuous development in the past years, the driving roll of marine economy in China’s economy has become remarkable. It is of strategic significance for China’s economic sustainable development to strengthen the exploration of marine resources and promote the quality and profit of the marine economy. To explore sustainable marine resources, one important economic management method is to implement paid use system, specify marine resource property rights and <b>collect</b> <b>Charges</b> for Sea Area Utilization (CSAU). With the approval of the “Guangdong Marine Economic Experimental Zone Program”, Guangdong province targets the building of an economically strong marine province. The collection and rational expenditure of CSAU not only play a positive role in the rapid and sustainable development of the marine economy, but also offer financial guarantee and support for the building of an economically strong marine province. In this paper, the CSAU collection and expenditure in the past decade after the issuance of the Sea Area Use Management Law and the corresponding performance were evaluated and analyzed, and the problems in the CSAU collection and management were discussed. Furthermore, countermeasures were proposed to perfect the CSAU expenditure management policy, define the distribution proportion at all levels, optimize the expenditure structure, and strengthen the supervision and management mechanism. The results and conclusion of this paper could not only greatly promote the construction of marine economy, rational development and sustainable use of marine resources, but also provide a reference for other coastal provinces in China...|$|E

40|$|Pixelated CdZnTe {{detectors}} {{can achieve}} 3 D position reconstruction, which enables 4 pi Compton imaging of gamma rays {{with a single}} detector and energy resolution better than 1 % full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 662 keV. The detector configuration, readout electronics, event reconstruction algorithms, multiple-pixel event performance, depth reconstruction, and complications due to readout electronics are discussed. In pixelated CdZnTe two dimensions of position sensitivity are determined based on which pixel <b>collects</b> <b>charge.</b> The third dimension comes from the signal ratio of the planar cathode to the pixelated anode, or, from the electron drift time for each pixel that <b>collects</b> <b>charge.</b> This work investigates the depth reconstruction using a collimated fan beam of gamma rays oriented such that counts are restricted to a narrow range of depths in a detector. The depth uncertainty is evaluated by measuring the fluctuation of the reconstructed depths of interaction. The depth accuracy is evaluated by calibrating the beam position and measuring the offset between the true depth of interaction and the reconstructed depth of interaction. Depth uncertainty and accuracy better than 1 mm FWHM is achieved at 662 keV for both single and multiple interaction events in 15 mm thick CdZnTe detectors. The energy reconstruction of pixelated CdZnTe is challenging for gamma rays that deposit energy on multiple pixels, due to factors such as signal crosstalk and system nonlinearity. This work details the impact of such factors on multiple pixel event energy resolution and, when possible, uses experimental data to put an upper bound on their effect. A correction is developed for the peak-hold circuitry of the readout electronics, improving the performance of events with at least three pixels that <b>collect</b> <b>charge.</b> The linearity of the system was also studied, especially {{as a function of}} the number of pixels that <b>collect</b> <b>charge,</b> resulting in energy resolution of 0. 36 % FWHM at 2614 keV.

In contrast to expectations, along with formation of donors, acceptor-type defects (electron traps) are introduced into the silicon bulk. This suggests that the current models describing charge collection in irradiated silicon detectors require an extension for taking into account trapping at low temperatures with a contribution of shallow levels.
