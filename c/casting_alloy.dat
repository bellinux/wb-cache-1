40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, the {{microstructural}} features, wear characteristics, and corrosion behaviour of spray cast Al– 12 Si, Al– 15 Si, and Al– 20 Si alloys have been investigated. The <b>alloys</b> were spray <b>cast</b> and hot isostatically pressed. Hot isostatic pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The microstructure of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> showed fine and globular-shaped Si {{particles in the}} Al matrix in contrast to needle-type eutectic Si and blocky-type primary Si in the Al matrix in chill <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The dry sliding wear tests showed that the wear rates of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> are invariably lower and the potentiodynamic polarization tests showed that the corrosion resistance of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> is considerably {{higher than that of}} chill <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The high wear and corrosion resistance of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> have been discussed {{in the light of the}} microstructural modification induced during the spray casting process...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} accuracy experts noted that perfectly concentric {{thickness of the}} cartridge neck were beneficial in lining up bullet to the bore - a feature mostly lacking in commercially available brass of the time. Most 6PPC chamber reamers are ground with a tight neck section that requires removing some case neck material ("turning the necks") to create a cartridge with a concentric fit and consistent neck-to-chamber clearances which contribute to the 6PPCs accuracy. While the SAAMI specification for neck thickness in a 6mm cartridge is usually [...]272 inches, {{it is common to}} see 6PPCs with [...]262, [...]268, or [...]269 custom neck sizes, hence modern factory ammunition is not commonly produced for the 6PPC as it would be dangerous to shoot in these custom chambers. To help clarify this, factory guns and ammunition are usually specified as the [...] "6PPC-USA" [...] cartridge which has a CIP/SAAMI specification. To the Note that a neck expanded, [...] "unturned" [...] (thickness of neck reduced) and loaded 220 Russian case neck will almost always be larger in diameter than the 6PPC rifle's chamber neck; if so, Method One does not apply—see Method Two.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop a high {{strength}} and heat-resistant magnesium alloy, we focused on controlling microstructure of Mg 96 Zn 2 Y 2 (at %) <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> {{by the addition of}} a 4 th element. Initially, we investigated the effects of zirconium addition and cooling rate for grain refinement on microstructure and mechanical properties. Consequently, Mg 95. 8 Zn 2 Y 2 Zr 0. 2 <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> contains fine equiaxed grains (approx. 0. 01 mm), and it exhibits tensile and fatigue properties equivalent to or higher than those of commercial aluminum alloys at high temperature above 473 K. At 523 K, this alloy exhibited a tensile strength of 223 MPa nearly twice that of A 4032 -T 6 alloy used in typical automotive pistons. The Mg 95. 8 Zn 2 Y 2 Zr 0. 2 <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> also reveals sufficient ductility and good castability, characteristics not common in current heat-resistant magnesium alloys.

40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} in titanium <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> {{were estimated}} by X-ray stress measurement technique. There are two {{problems in the}} condition of X-ray stress measurement. Firstly, the titanium <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> has the large crystal grains. These coarse grains were generated under solidification processes and those sizes are approximately 2 millimeter in this study. These coarse crystal grains interfere with an accurate stress measurement due to the unstable diffraction profile [1]. This is because {{the existence of a}} sufficient number of isotropic crystal grains in the X-ray irradiation area are based on the X-ray diffraction theory. In this study, the stress measurement technique of single crystal materials was adopted for the solution of this fundamental problem [2, 3]. Because the coarse crystal grain was treated as a single crystal, the high intensity diffraction profiles were observed from a certain direction with investigations of crystal orientation. The problem with the coarse crystal grain in titanium <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> were cleaned up by the employment of the single crystal measurement technique. Secondly, the results from this study show that the position of crystal grain within the X-ray irradiation area greatly influenced the residual stress values. Therefore, in the present paper the erasing method of this position effect was tried and discussed [4]. Finally, the improvement of the accuracy of this method for the residual stress measurement in titanium <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> under the several bending stresses was confirmed. These results show that the erasing method in this study is an effective correction method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A high {{strength}} Al-Cu-Mg alloy was prepared by squeeze casting. The effects of squeeze casting and heat treatment on the microstructures and mechanical {{properties of the}} alloy were studied. It was found that squeeze casting refined the microstructure and reduced the micro-segregation markedly, and also accelerated the diffusion process of solute atoms during solution heat treatment. Tensile strength and elongation of squeeze <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> were much {{higher than those of}} gravity <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> under both the as-cast and heat-treated conditions. In addition, the Al-Cu-Mg alloy prepared by squeeze casting showed good natural aging response, and the naturally-aged alloy possessed a slightly lower tensile strength but better elongation compared to full artificial aging. After solution heat treatment at 495 ℃ for 9 h and further natural aging for 48 h or artificial aging at 190 ℃ for 6 h, the tensile strength of squeeze <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> reached to 472 MPa and 475 MPa, respectively, and the elongation was 18. 9 % and 12. 7 % accordingly.
