25|$|Originally, the {{newspapers}} reported that Mayo had pneumonia and was resting at his mansion. Mayo didn't stay resting for long. A week later, Mayo conducted business as usual, but citizens of Paintsville <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seriously ill.|$|E
25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E
60|$|It was a man's voice, and by its sound we <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> well-nigh exhausted.|$|R
40|$|My {{interview}} with Melvin young takes {{places in the}} sun porch of the senior center where he tends to eat {{the majority of his}} meals. Melvin has hearing aids in both his ears but surprisingly it seems as though he hears better than I do. Melvin is a Korean War vet and seems very pleased to be interviewed even though through the duration of the interview I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a man of few words...|$|R
60|$|Of course Guy <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> had <b>been</b> {{pledged to}} secrecy {{as to the}} cause.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} media critics, {{including}} Toronto Sun columnist and former radio personality Ted Woloshyn, criticized CP24 Radio 1050 {{as a poor}} substitute for a true news radio format. In his column on the format change, Woloshyn noted {{a number of instances}} where he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> listening to content that had been prepared for television, not radio, presentation: ...|$|E
2500|$|McKagan {{was one of}} {{the last}} people {{confirmed}} to have seen Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain before he died on April 5, 1994. He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1. McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bummed out, and I'd been that way before... I thought I'd ask him to come stay at my house; I turned around and he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he {{never talked about it}} all that much.... I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|More {{than this}} the boy <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> excused. Squire Haggerty {{shook his head}} in perplexity.|$|R
60|$|For {{the life}} of him Mr. Polly <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fullest of tender anticipations or regretful panic.|$|R
60|$|It was a German {{commercial}} letter; I translated it; I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gratified or not--his countenance remained fixed.|$|R
60|$|This {{was all the}} trader <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> of the opinion, however, {{that the}} whaler had been finally crushed in the ice, and all those aboard had been lost.|$|E
60|$|The wrappings {{were removed}} from his head, and as nearly as the {{prisoner}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{some distance from the}} breaker; at the mouth of what appeared to be an abandoned shaft.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went away}} {{and left me}} when you was a little baby, and he never come back till he come back here. I never had any word from him. For all I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead. I never {{wanted him to be}} dead," [...] she defended herself to herself in {{something}} above the intelligence of the boy. [...] "I married Laban, who's been more of a father to you than what he was." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} a pensive torpor. The {{immediate}} dangers and stresses {{of his position}} he saw {{with a sort of}} static clearness. What would they do to-morrow? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> What would Elizabeth think of his brutalisation? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> exhausted. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> aroused presently by a hand upon his arm.|$|R
6000|$|He ruminated {{a moment}} and then said, in such a fashion that March <b>could</b> hardly <b>tell</b> if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{changing}} the subject or no: ...|$|R
5000|$|Jia Jia {{reference}} to Chua's online handle {{did not get}} why he had to re-do the scenes so many times. <b>He</b> thought it <b>was</b> all his fault and started getting very frustrated, even though I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really trying as hard as <b>he</b> could. It <b>was</b> very painful for a mother to watch.|$|R
60|$|At last an old colonel starts up, {{and asked}} the general what he thought might {{occasion}} the writing this letter? The general told him, he could not tell; but he <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sure, of one thing, that {{he knew what was}} not the occasion of it, viz., that is, not any want of force in their army to oblige us to other terms. Then a doubt was started, whether the king and Parliament were not in any treaty, which this agreement might be prejudicial to.|$|E
60|$|Made {{reckless}} by this, I {{stepped down}} to another branch {{directly over the}} bear, and tried again to rope him. It was of no use. He {{slipped out of the}} noose with the sinuous movements of an eel. Once it caught over his ears and in his open jaws. He gave a jerk that nearly pulled me from my perch. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> growing angrier every instant, and also braver. Suddenly the noose, quite by accident, caught his nose. He wagged his head and I pulled. The noose tightened.|$|E
60|$|And so, {{take it all}} around, we made a good haul. When we {{was ready}} to shove off we was {{a quarter of a}} mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no {{accidents}} and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.|$|E
60|$|He drew Mr. Brown {{a little}} on one side, out of hearing of the others, but nearer to her than any of them, and {{commenced}} talking earnestly to him. This time she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disturbed and uneasy, {{but she could not}} follow connectedly all her father said. Only a few stray words reached her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} call {{such a thing}} a confession--I wormed it out bit by bit--I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> truth or not, till I called Norman in." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{spent almost}} half his time {{out on the}} railway. It <b>is</b> said that <b>he</b> knew the 1,647 miles of track between Kansas City and the Gulf of Mexico so well <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{by the sound of}} the wheels on the rails. Under the impetus he {{provided}} the Kansas City Southern, its net income was twice the industry average.|$|R
60|$|These {{were the}} {{reflections}} which now troubled Crayford, and which presented him, after his rescue, in the strangely inappropriate {{character of a}} depressed and anxious man. His brother officers, as he well knew, looked to {{him to take the}} chief responsibility. If he declined to accept it, he would instantly confirm the horrible suspicion in Clara's mind. The emergency must be met; but how to meet it--at once honorably and mercifully--was more than Crayford <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> still lost in his own gloomy thoughts when his wife entered the boat-house. Turning to look at her, he saw his own perturbations and anxieties plainly reflected in Mrs. Crayford's face.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt that}} he had engaged himself by a rash promise to an action big with incalculable consequences. And then he asked himself if the girl had {{understood}} what he meant. Who <b>could</b> <b>tell?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> assailed by all sorts of doubts. Raising his head, he perceived something white flitting between the trees. It vanished almost at once; but there could be no mistake. He was vexed at being detected roaming like this {{in the middle of the}} night. Who could that be? It never occurred to him that perhaps the girl, too, would not be able to sleep. He advanced prudently. Then he saw the white, phantom-like apparition again; and the next moment all his doubts as to the state of her mind were laid at rest, because he felt her clinging to him after the manner of supplicants all the world over. Her whispers were so incoherent that he could not understand anything; but this did not prevent him from being profoundly moved. He had no illusions about her; but his sceptical mind was dominated by the fulness of his heart.|$|E
60|$|Whether or not {{the father}} wolf ever knew where his cubs were hidden only he himself <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> an {{enormous}} brute, powerful and cunning beyond measure, that haunted the lonely thickets and ponds bordering the great caribou barrens over the ridge, and that kept a silent watch, within howling distance, over the den which he never saw. Sometimes the mother wolf met him on her wanderings and they hunted together. Often he brought the game he had caught, a fox or a young goose; and sometimes when she had hunted in vain he met her, {{as if he had}} understood her need from a distance, and led her to where he had buried two or three of the rabbits that swarmed in the thickets. But spite of the attention and the indifferent watch which he kept, he never ventured near the den, which he could have found easily enough by following the mother's track. The old she-wolf would have flown at his throat like a fury had he showed his head {{over the top of the}} ridge.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, {{the lawyer}} who {{experienced}} the interrupted conversation called the Swedish foreign office {{to figure out what}} was going on, but could not find anyone who <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> Instead, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told that no decision had been reached. The Foreign office sent certified letters to the lawyers, but these arrived two days after the men were in Egyptian custody.|$|R
6000|$|He {{sat down}} in the chair before the hearth, and covered his face with his hands. By the quivering of those hands, and the {{movement}} of his shoulders, she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stifling emotion, perhaps even crying; and sinking down on his knees she pressed his hands and face to her, murmuring: [...] "Oh, Daddy dear! Oh, Daddy dear!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --You {{remind me}} of Antisthenes, the {{professor}} said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> bitterer against others or against himself. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of a}} noble and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are as God {{and your}} work have made you," [...] was the quiet answer; and, drawing closer to me, she added, [...] "And I {{would not have}} you otherwise. Don't lapse into heroics, Ralph. What you did {{that day in the}} cañon will speak better than words for you. Instead you must listen while I tell you the whole story. As it was with you and your cousin, Geoffrey and I--we are distantly related too--were always good friends. He was older, and, as you say, polished, and in many ways I looked up to him, while my father was trustee for him under a will, and when he joined the army my father continued, I understand, to manage his property. Still--and I know now that I must have been blind--I never looked upon Geoffrey as--as a {{possible}} husband until twelve months ago. Since then my eyes have been opened, and I understand many things--most of all that my father wished it, for he has told me so, and that Geoffrey is heavily interested financially in his ventures. I know that he has sunk large sums of money in the mine, and they have found no ore, while I heard a chance whisper of a mortgage on Carrington. Yet Geoffrey has never even hinted to me that he was more than a small shareholder. My father has grown aged and worn lately, though only those who know him well <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> carrying a heavy load of anxiety. He has always been kind to me, and it hurt, horribly, to refuse to meet his wishes when he almost pleaded with me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "As far as I <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> happy," [...] said fellow Cracked artist Dan Clowes. [...] "I dont {{think he}} ever {{seemed to notice}} that Mad was respected, whereas Cracked was loathed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Decidedly {{he has had}} {{too much}} wine," [...] I thought; and I {{did not know what}} answer to make to his queer question: how <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> capable of being re-transformed? ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{burst into}} a fit of laughter. [...] "How <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to fall flat upon the ground and shout a million murders, when I fired {{straight}} into the air?" ...|$|R
60|$|We need hardly {{say that}} the Prince, who is a consummate master of ten languages, speaks English quite as fluently as he does Chinese. Indeed, for a moment, we <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>tell</b> which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking.|$|R
