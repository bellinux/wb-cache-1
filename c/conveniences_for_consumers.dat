40|$|The growing {{market for}} smart home IoT devices {{promises}} new <b>conveniences</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> while presenting novel challenges for preserving privacy within the home. Specifically, Internet service providers or neighborhood WiFi eavesdroppers can measure Internet traffic rates from smart home devices and infer consumers' private in-home behaviors. Here we propose four strategies that device manufacturers and third parties {{can take to}} protect consumers from side-channel traffic rate privacy threats: 1) blocking traffic, 2) concealing DNS, 3) tunneling traffic, and 4) shaping and injecting traffic. We hope that these strategies, and the implementation nuances we discuss, will provide a foundation for the future development of privacy-sensitive smart homes.

40|$|The growing {{market for}} smart home IoT devices {{promises}} new <b>conveniences</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> while presenting new challenges for preserving privacy within the home. Many smart home devices have always-on sensors that capture users' offline activities {{in their living}} spaces and transmit information about these activities on the Internet. In this paper, we demonstrate that an ISP or other network observer can infer privacy sensitive in-home activities by analyzing Internet traffic from smart homes containing commercially-available IoT devices even when the devices use encryption. We evaluate several strategies for mitigating the privacy risks associated with smart home device traffic, including blocking, tunneling, and rate-shaping. Our experiments show that traffic shaping can effectively and practically mitigate many privacy risks associated with smart home IoT devices. We find that 40 KB/s extra bandwidth usage is enough to protect user activities from a passive network adversary. This bandwidth cost is well within the Internet speed limits and data caps for many smart homes. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Software agents help {{automate}} {{a variety}} of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. Although shopping agents provide <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> and yield more efficient markets, today's first-generation shopping agents are limited to comparing merchant offerings only on price instead of their full range of value. As such, they do a disservice to both consumers and retailers by hiding important merchant value-added services from consumer consideration. Likewise, the increasingly popular online auctions pit sellers against buyers in distributive negotiation tug-of-wars over price. This paper analyzes these approaches from economic, behavioral, and software agent perspectives then proposes integrative negotiation as a more suitable approach to retail electronic commerce. Finally, we identify promising techniques (e. g., multi-attribute utility theory, distributed constraint satisfaction, and conjoint analysis) for implementing agent-mediated integrative negotiation. 1...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{innovation}} {{and the subsequent}} technological advancements have gained significance in shaping consumer behavior to a disruptive extent. Especially with the advancements in mobile technology, consumer behaviors shifted towards an elevated expectation of mobility and increased interactivity. Marketers who seek a better degree {{of access to the}} consumer market and provide customer satisfaction needed to adopt new tools and methods in communication, which would align with their target groups more effectively. Mobile marketing emerged as an innovative technique that is based on and driven by this change in consumer behavior; therefore it is necessary {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} its approach and implementation. In this light, this research paper employs a quantitative approach based on the results' analysis of an online survey conducted by the Author of the thesis, aimed at testing whether there is a strong correlation between mobile marketing efforts and customer satisfaction. Consequently, one can conclude that the same mobile devices that serve as <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers,</b> serve as an effective channel of communication for marketers, whereas with an integrated approach where other components of the marketing mix support mobile content, the likeliness of attaining consumer satisfaction is higher...|$|R
40|$|Online banking is {{essentially}} safe, but equally fraud {{is also on}} the rise and consumers need to be more aware. The widespread use of online banking means more <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> and offers better ways to monitor account activity. The client accesses the ATM using a private key which is the security token that is sent to client’s mobile through an SMS by the bank’s authentication server. The key is generated by implementing SHA 256 and Base 64 algorithms using the registered IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers of the client’s mobile. SMS based mechanism makes sure that the key is delivered to the registered client. The client is given a PIN and a Master key when registered to the Online banking service. If in case a client’s mobile is lost, authentication is done using Unique Master key, else the private key token is used thereby making transactions secured and simple without the need of carrying any USB Tokens. The additional functionality provides the client more security with their transactions. Phishing attacks by the hackers are avoided to an extent in the proposed methodology. The proposed method has been implemented and tested in Java (J 2 ME). Initial results show the success of the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{is used by}} {{practitioners and}} policy-makers {{to help them understand}} the sustainability impacts of packaging. LCA is useful because it quantifies the impact of a product throughout its life cycle, from raw materials extraction through to disposal or recovery. However, it can only ever be one input to decisions about the design or procurement of packaging. LCA has limitations as a tool to measure environmental impact and it does not currently evaluate social or financial impact. This paper provides a critical review of the role of LCA in evaluating packaging sustainability. It does this by evaluating the results of LCA studies that compare different types of carry bags and their implications for policy and practice. The benefits and limitations of this type of analysis are discussed. The case study of plastic carry bags demonstrates that while a scientific understanding of life cycle impacts is essential to support informed decision-making, a broader sustainability analysis is required to ensure that all relevant issues are considered. These include the functionality of alternative bags, their relative cost, <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> and retailers, and the availability of reuse and recovery systems. An alternative approach, which evaluates packaging design within a broader sustainability framework, is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{transitions}} {{have been}} taking place continuously since the Industrial Revolution. These transitions primarily involve national energy mixes. In general, countries keep moving up the energy ladder, meaning that they integrate larger and larger proportions of specialized fuels into their energy mixes for dedicated types of energy demand (heat, cooling, electricity, mobility). These fuels often emit less carbon per unit of energy consumed and, due to technological developments, create more economic efficiency and <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers.</b> The availability of domestic sources {{plays an important role}} in the composition of a national energy mix, and the ability to transport and trade energy is crucial in matching demand and supply. This report shows some of the history of how the nature of these transitions has changed over time. The emphasis on transitions lays out a different way of thinking about the approaches to the phenomenon known as the ‘carbon bubble’ or the potential of future stranded assets and value loss in the fossil energy industries as a result of climate change policies. A core message is that the role of coal without CCS, as the largest source of future CO 2 emissions, would need to be addressed first. Such a policy focus would allow space for fuels with a higher energy output per unit of carbon emission to stay in the mix for a longer period of time [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} of RFID (radio frequency identification device) for improving the current waste and resource management system in Switzerland. It presents the following three possible options for utilizing RFID tags to support waste management processes: "at source automation" (using a "smart" trash can), "end of pipe I" (combination of the current system with an additional separation of recyclables before incineration), and "end of pipe II" (replacement of the current recycling infrastructure by sorting at the incineration plant). These options tackle the waste and resource management chain during different processes (i. e., waste generation, waste separation, and treatment). Based on an MFA (material flow analysis), we performed a multicriteria assessment of these options with experts from the waste management sector. The assessment of ten experts in the waste management field regarding the proposed options for batteries and electrical appliances showed that, from an ecological perspective, the implementation of RFID in waste management would be desirable and would lead to an improvement in the current recycling rate in Switzerland for the goods studied. From an economic perspective, new investments would be required {{in the range of}} 1 to 5 times the maintenance costs of the current separate collection system. From a social perspective, the utilization of RFID tags in the waste management process was ambiguous. In particular, the end of pipe II option would, on the one hand, significantly improve <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers.</b> On the other hand, experts see privacy and, what is more, social responsibility as being under threat. The experts considered the ecological and social aspects to be more relevant than the economic ones, preferring the end of pipe I option over the other options and the status quo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the large-scale expansion of retail stores in Senboku New Town {{and the implications}} for the elderly households in the area. The population in Senboku New Town is rapidly aging, and the available space for large-scale retailers has expanded remarkably; as a result, there have been complex and diverse effects. The expansion of the commercial district has increased the <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> consumers: <b>consumers</b> prefer to shop in large-scale stores {{with a variety of}} goods, a choice made possible by the development of motorization. But for elderly households that cannot use cars, the expansion of the commercial district is disadvantageous.

Local shopping, which is made possible by the presence of shops within walking distance, is important when we consider the growth of the elderly population; it is necessary to enhance the shopping space suitable for the elderly, not only for their sake but for that of the regional community...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the pork}} {{industry}} has faced numerous challenges. As consumer resistance to fatter meats has increased, {{the industry has}} had two options, 1) argue against popular opinion that fat consumption posed a health risk or 2) strive to reduce the fatness of their products. Since the first option is highly unlikely, the NPPC and commodity leaders have moved rapidly, decisively, and aggressively to promote and reposition pork as a vital, healthful part of the U. S. diet. Pork consumption from 1965 to 1985 was reasonably stable (1965, 45 lb; 1985, 44. 2 lb). Demand has been stable to declining in recent years. However, Glenn Grimes, University of Missouri economist, says pork consumption increased about 3 % last year, despite higher prices and stiff competition. Certainly, pork producers {{can be proud of}} what has been accomplished, but to be certain that pork remains competitive, progress must be made in reducing fatness of the pork carcass. Additional concerns for the industry are uniformity of the product, <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> the <b>consumer,</b> and price competitiveness. New buying systems encourage production of lean, uniform lots of market hogs, often at heavier weights than in previous years.

In The Innovator’s Dilemma, he argues that well-managed companies fail because the structure, procedures, and strategies that enabled them to become industry leaders are actually counterproductive {{to the development of}} and response to disruptive innovations. These disruptions tend to have several common attributes including improved simplicity, reliability, and <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> the <b>consumer.</b> Christensen contends that listening to customer feedback and expert opinions causes companies to focus on sustaining technologies, improvements to existing technologies within the established value proposition. Using the example of Intuit and their Quicken software, Christensen demonstrates that observing how customers use a product rather than customer feedback is a more effective method of developing disruptive innovations. While Christensen’s work focuses on for-profit commercial firms, Montgomery C. Meigs observed a similar methodology in his analysis of subsurface warfare in World War II.

40|$|<b>Consumer</b> demand <b>for</b> {{freshness}} and <b>convenience</b> {{food has}} led to the evolution and increased production of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Moreover this may represent a way to increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and therefore a benefit for the crops sector economy. Since the increase in <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> the <b>consumer</b> has a detrimental effect on product quality, attention must be focused on extending shelf life while maintaining quality. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is a packaging technology which by making qualitative or quantitative changes to the atmosphere composition around the product, can improve product preservation. However, MAP must be carefully designed, as a poorly designed system may be ineffective or even shorten product shelf life. Thus, while in the past a trial and error approach to package food was predominant, nowadays the need has emerged for an engineering approach to properly design a package to improve product shelf life. Therefore, to ensure an appropriate gas composition during the product’s shelf life, a model should take into account all the variables that play a critical role, such as product respiration and its mass; packaging material and its geometry; and environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity and gas composition. In this chapter a procedure to design a package for fresh-cut produce is described. An engineering approach is used to develop a mathematical model with the experimental data obtained for product respiration and package permeability and solve the mass balance equations using computer software. A case study on fresh-cut apples is reported in order to validate the model...|$|R
