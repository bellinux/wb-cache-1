40|$|The {{behavioral}} and physical traits of adults can be {{strongly influenced by}} conditions experienced during development. Consequently, variation in natal habitat quality across a landscape and through time {{can also lead to}} differences in the traits of adults. When individuals move across the landscape, this could create <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> where differences in the natal habitat quality of colonizers influence population dynamics and species interactions in new habitats. I studied how these <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects,</b> which are known to alter individual traits and population dynamics, scale up to larger effects on community and metacommunity (multiple communities across a landscape connected by dispersing individuals) dynamics. I tested these questions on <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> in a spatial context using a Tribolium spp. flour beetle system with habitat patches of flour. I generated <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> by using flour types which predictably alter the traits of flour beetles who develop in them. The first chapter identified that <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> which alter population dynamics occur in this system. It also discovered novel and powerful mechanisms for <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> to influence population dynamics. The second chapter shows how <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> and population density interact to affect dispersal decisions, which is important for understanding how <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> will propagate across landscapes. The third chapter shows that <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> can decisively alter competitive dynamics and outcomes, but that how may not be immediately predictable from their influence on single population dynamics. Finally, my fourth chapter manipulated whether <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> occurred across multi-patch landscapes to test whether they influence species dynamics across a metacommunity. This final chapter shows that at the landscape scale, <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> can have even more strong emergent <b>effects.</b> For example, <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> increased population sizes across landscapes by ~ 10 % while dramatically promoting different species under different conditions of dispersal and habitat arrangement. Thus, the influences of <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> on population and community dynamics at the landscape level may be strong, but context dependent on other spatial processes. Further work to understand how landscape habitat patterns and dispersal shape the influence of <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> on metacommunity dynamics could improve understanding of natural population and community dynamics...|$|R
40|$|For {{many species}} living in {{changing}} environments, processes during one season influence vital rates {{in a subsequent}} season in the same annual cycle. The interplay between these <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> between seasons and other density-dependent events can have a strong influence on population size and variability.

Therefore, falling all <b>effects,</b> <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> and interaction effects into a linear mixed effects model, it is concluded that the <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of milker and hand-milking techniques cannot be neglected, and the interaction effects among hand-milking techniques, different milkers, days and periods can be substantial. ...|$|R

Yet it is largely unknown whether such programmes actually help population size recovery. While a negative genetic effect of captive breeding that decreases fitness of captive-bred organisms has been detected, {{there is no direct}} evidence for a <b>carry-over</b> <b>effect</b> of captive breeding in their wild-born descendants, which would drag down the fitness of the wild population in subsequent generations. In this study, we use genetic parentage assignments to reconstruct a pedigree and estimate reproductive fitness of the wild-born descendants of captive-bred parents in a supplemented population of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The estimated fitness varied among years, but overall relative reproductive fitness was only 37 per cent in wild-born fish from two captive-bred parents and 87 per cent in those from one captive-bred and one wild parent (relative to those from two wild parents).

The Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus is a coastal wader with sedentary populations at temperate sites and migratory populations in northern breeding grounds of Europe. We pooled continental European ringing-recovery datasets from 1975 to 2000 to estimate winter and summer survival rates of migrant and resident populations and to investigate long-term effects of winter habitat changes.

40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of year-round habitat use {{is essential for}} determining how <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> shape population dynamics in long-distance migratory songbirds. The recent discovery of long-term migratory staging sites in many species, prior to arrival at final wintering sites, adds complexity to efforts to decipher non-breeding habitat use and connections between sites. We investigated whether habitat conditions during migratory staging carry over to influence great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) body condition at final wintering sites in Zambia. We asked whether the presence/absence and strength of such <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> were modified by contrasting rainfall conditions during 2  years. Results: First, we found that individuals staging in a dry year had higher corticosterone (CORTf) and stable nitrogen isotope values (suggesting higher aridity) than birds staging in a wet year, indicating that regional weather affected staging conditions. Second, we found that <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> from staging habitat conditions (measured via carbon and nitrogen isotopes) to final winter site body condition (measured via scaled mass index and β-hydroxybutyrate) were only present in a dry year, suggesting that environmental factors have consequences for the strength of <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects.</b> Our results also suggest that wet conditions at final winter sites may buffer the effects of poor staging conditions, {{at least in the}} short term, since individuals that staged in a dry year had higher scaled mass indices in Zambia than individuals that staged in a wet year. Conclusions: This study provides a first insight into the connections between long-term migratory staging sites and final wintering sites, and suggests that local environmental factors can modify the strength of <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> for long-distance migratory birds...|$|R
40|$|Water deficit {{increases}} boll shedding. Large squares, however, {{are much}} less likely to shed, possibly because they contain high concentrations of free and total auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid or IAA). Our previous research indicated that much of this IAA disappears by the time the squares open as flowers and the IAA content remains low for about four days after anthesis. If water deficit decreases the IAA content, or increases the ABA conten 4 of squares and flowers, then water deficit before flowering could have a <b>carry-over</b> <b>effect</b> and increase the shedding rate of young bolls that subsequently develop from them. In field plots, water deficit increased the ABA content of flowers as much as 66 %.

Flowers contained much less IAA than squares. Despite pronounced effects of water deficit on the IAA content of squares it is unlikely that it had any <b>carry-over</b> <b>effect</b> on the free IAA content of young bolls that subsequently developed from them. Water deficit slightly increased the total IAA content of flowers, but had no effect on their free IAA.

Here we tested the role of variation in litter quality, water supply, and UV radiation as drivers of litter decomposition in arid lands. And show that <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of litter photodegradation during dry periods can regulate decomposition during subsequent wet periods. We present data from a two-phase experiment, where we first exposed litter from a drought-deciduous and an evergreen shrub to natural UV levels during five, rainless summer-months and, subsequently, in the laboratory, we assessed the <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of photodegradation on biomass loss under different irrigation treatments representing the observed range of local rainfall variation among years (15 to 240 mm). Photodegradation of litter in the field produced average carbon losses of 12 %, but deciduous Proustia pungens lost > 25 %, while evergreen Porlieria chilensis less than 5 %. Natural exposure to UV significantly reduced carbon-to-nitrogen and lignin:N ratios in Proustia litter but not in Porlieria. During the subsequent wet phase, remaining litter biomass was lower in Proustia than in Porlieria. Indeed UV exposure increased litter decomposition of Proustia under low and medium rainfall treatments, whereas no <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> were detected under high rainfall treatment. Consequently, for decidous Proustia <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of UV exposure were negligible under high irrigation. Litter decomposition of the evergreen Porlieria depended solely on levels of rainfall that promote microbial decomposers. Our two-phase experiment revealed that both the <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of photodegradation and litter quality, modulated by inter-annual variability in rainfall, can explain the marked differences in decomposition rates and the frequent decoupling between rainfall and litter decomposition observed in semiarid ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|In many animals, {{processes}} {{occurring in}} one season carry over to influence reproductive success and survival in future seasons. The strength of such <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> {{is unlikely to be}} uniform across years, yet our understanding of the processes that are capable of modifying their strength remains limited.

In years of bad weather during breeding, all birds suffered reduced reproductive output irrespective of pre-migration mass. Our results suggest that the magnitude of reproductive benefits gained by maximising body stores to fuel breeding fluctuates markedly among years in concert with conditions during the breeding season, as does the degree to which <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> are capable of driving variance in reproductive success among individuals. Therefore while <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> have considerable power to drive fitness asymmetries among individuals, our ability to interpret these effects in terms of their implications for population dynamics is dependent on knowledge of fitness determinants occurring in subsequent seasons. ...|$|R

However, there was no effect of treatment of rearing females on nestling BKA in control nestlings, even though cooled females made significantly fewer feeding visits than did control females. This suggests {{that the effect of}} cooling occurred during incubation and was not due to <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> on nestling condition. Nestlings that were exposed to experimental cooling as embryos had lower residual body mass and absolute body mass at all four ages measured. Our results indicate that environmental conditions and trade-offs experienced during one stage of development can have important <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> on later life-history stages...|$|R

Although most studies examine <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> across 2 seasons in single populations, the effects may persist beyond the following season and vary across a species’ range. To assess potential <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> across the annual cycle and among populations, we deployed geolocation loggers on black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla at 10 colonies in the north-east Atlantic and examined relationships between the timing and destination of migratory movements and breeding success {{in the year of}} deployment and sub - sequent season. Both successful and unsuccessful breeders wintered primarily in the north-west Atlantic. Breeding success affected the timing of migration, whereby unsuccessful breeders departed the colony earlier, arrived at the post-breeding and main wintering areas sooner, and departed later the following spring. However, these patterns were only apparent in colonies in the south-west of the study region. Furthermore, the effect of breeding success was stronger on migration timing {{in the first part of}} the winter than later. Timing of migratory movements was weakly linked to subsequent breeding success, and there was no detectable association between breeding success in the 2 seasons. Our results indicate temporal structure and spatial hetero - geneity in the strength of seasonal interactions among kittiwakes breeding in the north-east Atlantic. Variable fitness consequences for individuals from different colonies could have important implications for population processes across the species’ range and suggest that the spatiotemporal dynamics of <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> warrant further study.

40|$|Visual-tactile <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of global/local {{processing}} (attention to the whole, {{versus the}} details) {{have been reported}} under active touch conditions. We investigated whether <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of global/local processing also occur for passive touch and whether global/local processing has differential effects on affective and discriminative aspects of touch. Participants completed two tactile tasks involving pleasantness rating and discrimination {{of a set of}} tactile vibrations before and after completing a version of the Navon task that encouraged a focus on the global (n = 30), local (n = 30), or both (n = 30) features of a series of visual stimuli. In line with previous research suggesting a link between global processing and positive emotion, global processing increased pleasantness ratings of high (but not low) frequency tactile vibrations. Local processing did not improve the ability to discriminate between vibrations of different frequencies, however. There was some evidence of a tactile-visual carry-over effect; prior local processing of tactile vibrations reduced global precedence during the Navon task in the control group. We have shown <b>carry-over</b> <b>effects</b> of global versus local processing on passive touch perception. These findings provide further evidence suggesting that a common perceptual mechanism determines processing level across modalities and show {{for the first time that}} prior global processing affects the pleasantness of touch...|$|R
