Forty-one congenital SOP patients without a trochlear nerve (absent group) and 23 patients with a trochlear nerve (present group) who underwent IO myectomy as the primary surgical treatment were retrospectively reviewed. "Motor success" was defined as postoperative ipsilateral hypertropia ≤ 4 prism diopter (PD). "Head tilt improvement" was regarded as postoperative angle of head tilt < 5 degrees (°). Success rates for motor alignment and head tilt improvement, <b>cumulative</b> <b>probabilities</b> of success, and factors influencing surgical responses were evaluated. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>probabilities</b> of motor success at 2 years after IO myectomy were 92 % in patients with a trochlear nerve and 86 % in patients without a trochlear nerve (P = 0. 138). The <b>cumulative</b> <b>probabilities</b> of undercorrection and recurrence of hypertropia after 2 years were 0 % in the present group versus 21 % in the absent group (P = 0. 014).

A greater preoperative angle of head tilt was associated with persistent head tilt after surgery (P = 0. 038).
