Strengthening of the most heavy loaded <b>cable's</b> <b>sections</b> is necessary to decrease the difference between maximum and minimum axial forces in the cable, which depends on the deflection. Strengthening of the <b>cable's</b> <b>sections</b> was carried out by the increase of volumetric fraction of steel in some sections by the length. The behaviours of tensioned hybrid composite element with strengthened sections were investigated analytically and by experiment. The hybrid composite tensioned element with strengthened sections was considered as a material of cable net of prestressed saddle-shaped cable roof 50 x 50 m in plan, together with the steel cables. It was stated, that the using of the tensioned hybrid composite element with strengthened sections enables to decrease consumption of cable net materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{new study}} of the {{electrical}} conductivity of crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) mid-voltage (MV) cable insulation is presented. Its main objective is to show the effect of annealing treatments on MV cables under actual service conditions. Complementary time domain (absorption/resorption currents) and frequency domain (dynamic electrical analysis) techniques are applied on different laboratory samples containing XLPE insulations: sections of XLPE insulated cable (with and without semiconducting screens) {{in the case of}} absorption/resorption currents and, in the case of dynamic electrical analysis, a thin ribbon obtained from the cable insulation by mechanical procedures. For annealing temperatures below a certain critical temperature, conductivity decreases both for XLPE cylinders (<b>cable</b> <b>sections</b> from which inner and outer semiconducting screens have been removed) and for real <b>cables</b> (<b>sections</b> of <b>cable</b> with semiconducting screens) but its value is smaller in the case of cables. If the annealing temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the behaviour of conductivity is more complex. In XLPE, cylinders conductivity initially decreases with the annealing time but after some annealing time it begins to increase, it passes over a maximum and eventually it decreases monotonically. In the case of real <b>cable</b> <b>sections,</b> conductivity grows, tending to a saturation value, which is noticeably higher than the corresponding value of the maximum obtained for XLPE cylinders. The experimental results are explained satisfactorily by means of the Mott equation that takes into account hopping conduction assisted both by temperature and electric field...|$|R

50|$|The {{high-voltage}} cable of the Kontek is implemented as paper-isolated oil-filled cable with two copper conductors with {{a cross section}} of 800 mm2 permanently joined in parallel. For better monitoring of the oil, the land sections of the Kontek cable are divided in sections of approx. 8 km, which are separated by oil-impermeable sockets from each other. In the proximity of these sockets - at some distance from the cable route - there are automatic stations for the monitoring of the oil pressure, the oil temperature and other operating parameters of the cable. For practical reasons, the 45 km long submarine <b>cable</b> <b>section</b> through the Baltic Sea between Germany and Denmark was implemented as a single oil-filled section without sockets.

40|$|Silicone rubber multiple-lumen nerve cuffs {{were used}} to compare the {{effectiveness}} of two varieties of nerve growth stimulants (collagen and a mixture of collagen, fibronectin, and laminin) at the same time for regenerating cables across the same gap. The right sciatic nerve was transected in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The proximal and distal stumps were inserted each into an end of the single lumen portion of a multiple-lumen cuff in which different chemical fillings were used in 6 tubes of the multiple lumen portion of the cuff. The filling pattern alternated with collagen gel or with a gel mixture of collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. A 15 mm gap was then created between stumps in ten animals. After 8 weeks implantation period, 53 % (32 of 60) of the lumens displayed successful cable regeneration across the 15 mm gaps in the animals implanted with the multiple-lumen cuffs (each gap conduit diameter = 0. 5 mm) for both material fillings;Regenerates had an organized cellular matrix. Features that resembled axonal profiles (regeneration units) were seen in six proximal <b>cable</b> <b>sections,</b> three from the mixture-filled lumen and three from the collagen-filled lumen. These axonal profiles were restricted to proximal sections and were not seen in the middle and distal sections for both chemical environments for this 8 week implantation period. Schwann cells were consistently observed in the core of the majority of cables. Blood vessels were common in proximal and distal <b>cable</b> <b>sections</b> and were seldom seen in the middle <b>cable</b> <b>sections.</b> No blood vessels were observed in the middle <b>cable</b> <b>sections</b> from the collagen-filled lumens.

However, the cores of cables from the mixture-filled lumens had relatively small acellular region fractions as compared to those from the collagen-filled lumens when area data were normalized using an acellular area of core to total area of core ratio for comparison for the two environments (collagen versus mixture), especially for sections in the middle regions (p = 0. 003).

40|$|The {{society of}} today is largely {{dependent}} on electricity and the dependence {{does not show}} any signs of declining. Reliability of supply will become increasingly important {{in the future and}} it is therefore important to investigate factors affecting the failure rates in electrical components. Sweden was hit by several severe storms during the 00 ’s. As a result of this many overhead lines in forests were cablified. In urban areas underground cable systems have been the norm for many years. Despite the increase in cablification in forest areas and the large amount of underground cables in urban areas there is relatively little known about the life expectancy of different cables and the external factors affecting the durability of the cables. To increase this knowledge the purpose of this master thesis was to develop a risk model for medium voltage underground cables.   The risk model consisted of two parts; a statistical model to determine the probability of failure for different types of cables, and a model to determine the consequences from a power outage on a specific <b>cable</b> <b>section.</b> The result was a risk assessment which can be used when making investment decisions. The result from the statistical model showed that paper insulated-lead covered cables (PILC) and an older type of cross-linked polyethylene cable (XLPE) seemed to increase the probability of failure. The model also indicated that grids in urban areas and grids with many joints and different cable types increased the probability of failure. However, the model needs further improvement to ensure these results.   The consequence from a power outage was calculated as a community cost. The cost increases with the length of the outage and the average power on the <b>cable</b> <b>section</b> examined. The highest cost occurs when consumers in the group commerce and services are affected. Based on the results, a strategy when renewing the grid should be focusing on replacing cable types that increase the probability of failure, but also focusing on replacing larger parts of a <b>cable</b> <b>section</b> rather than several small parts. By doing this the number of joints and cable types will be reduced, also decreasing the probability of future failures. To minimize the community cost, focus should be on ensuring the security of supply on cable sections with a high average power and with customers sensitive to power outages (commerce and services, industry and the public sector), but also where there is a large risk for long power outages. ...|$|E

Applying a maximum insulation temperature as boundary condition, the power conducting capacity of LV-cables will substantially be affected by asymmetry, unbalance and especially nonlinearity of loads.

Space charge accumulation in insulation system will {{give rise to}} acceleration of ageing and even cause premature failure of the material. However, from another angle, space charge might be also considered as a diagnostic tool of ageing for insulation materials. In this paper, a trapping-detrapping model has been developed to estimate trapping parameters of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) <b>cable</b> <b>sections,</b> which were taken from different HVAC operation conditions of 12 years and 8 years. The results reveal that, for both <b>cable</b> <b>sections,</b> samples from the inner location have the greatest trap density and the deepest trap depth. Additionally, breakdown strength tests and FTIR (Fourier- transform infrared) measurements on those samples have been carried out. From FTIR measurement results, the degree of oxidation among three layers could be found by the carbonyl index values. The oxidation degree of aged cable at the outer layer is higher than that at the other two layers probably because of the most sufficient contact with oxygen. Also, it has been noticed that the results from these measurements show some correlations with the estimated trapping parameters, especially for breakdown strength...|$|R
