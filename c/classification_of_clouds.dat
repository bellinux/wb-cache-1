5000|$|Throughout the 19th century {{nomenclatures}} and classifications {{of cloud}} types were developed, followed {{late in the}} century by cloud atlases. The first nomenclature ("naming", also [...] "numbering") of clouds in English, by Luke Howard, was published in 1802. [...] It followed a similar effort in French by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1801. Howard's nomenclature defined four fundamental types of clouds: cirrus or thread-cloud, cumulus or heap-cloud, stratus or flat cloud (level sheet), and nimbus or rain-cloud (see <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds).</b> There followed {{a long period of}} development of the field of meteorology and the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> leading up to 1896, the International Year of Clouds. The history of this period {{is the subject of a}} popular book, The Invention of Clouds. [...] During that time, the Englishmen Rev. Clement Ley and Hon. Ralph Abercromby, were influential. Both men died before the classification was settled, however. Ley wrote a book, Cloudland, that is well known to meteorologists. Abercromby contributed a number of papers on the subject, stressing the most important (and then novel) fact that clouds are the same everywhere in the world. He also wrote in collaboration with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson a detailed <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> This was adopted in Hildebrandsson's 1890 Cloud Atlas.|$|E
5000|$|Howard's cloud {{classification}} {{had a major}} influence on the arts as well as on science. His <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> was later adopted by Ralph Abercromby and Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, who developed and popularised the system laid out by Howard. Abercromby noted in a paper on the naming of clouds that to the Quaker Howard [...] "any name connected with heathen mythology was specially distasteful". Howard corresponded with Goethe, who wrote a series of poems in gratitude to him, including the lines: ...|$|E

30|$|Most domain {{adaptation}} algorithms {{focus on}} generalized classification tasks. However, as for ground-based cloud classification, {{there are a}} few literature studying domain adaptation when the cloud images are presented with the domain shift. What is more, successful <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> types {{plays an important role in}} the research of climate change and meteorological services [21 – 23]. Therefore, this is an especially important problem to apply domain adaptation to ground-based cloud classification.|$|R

He continued to reside in Plaistow until 1812, {{when he moved to}} Tottenham. [...] The family's pharmaceutical business was instrumental in the development of quinine and both Howard and his son, quinologist John Eliot Howard (who was born in Plaistow), were elected Fellows of the Royal Society.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first edition}} was {{inspired}} {{in part by}} the observation of the English meteorologist Ralph Abercromby that clouds were of the same general kinds everywhere in the world. Abercromby and Hildebrandsson developed a new <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> that was published in an earlier atlas, the 1890 Cloud Atlas by Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, Wladimir Köppen, and Georg von Neumayer. [...] Other, similar works published prior to this were M. Weilbach's Nordeuropas Sky-former (Copenhagen, 1881), M.

5000|$|The {{following}} year, {{a derivative}} cloud atlas {{was published in}} the United States through the Government Printing Office, titled Illustrative cloud forms for the guidance of observers in the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> [...] A reviewer noted [...] "We are not sure that it is desirable that there should be several cloud atlases in existence concurrently; but, probably, administrative difficulties would be raised if in any country copies of the International Cloud Atlas were purchased sufficient in number to supply an entire navy.

5000|$|The International Cloud Atlas was revised {{numerous}} times {{in response to}} requirements of its principal user community, meteorologists. Nonetheless, it was not sufficient for all users, and consequently {{a number of other}} cloud atlases and critiques have been published. A 1901 popular German book about the weather reproduced photographs from the International Cloud Atlas, and one reviewer of the 1901 book judged these reproductions to be its best feature. [...] Atlas photographique des Nuages, a 1912 cloud atlas of grayscale photographs, was praised for its sharp photographs but criticized for not following the International Cloud Classification. [...] The 1923 book, A Cloud Atlas, despite its title is not a cloud atlas. The author, the American meteorologist Alexander George McAdie, then director of the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, advocated a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> that was not typological but rather predictive: a classification that did not merely describe what was before the observer. As McAdie put it, when we look at a cloud we want to know, not what it resembles, but whether it portends fair or foul weather. [...] The book is a discussion of what characteristics of clouds such a classification might take into account.|$|E

40|$|The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and aerosol {{by means}} of {{multi-axis}} {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} (MAX-DOAS) is studied in this paper. Firstly, the characters of variation of color index (CI), radiance, and O- 4 air mass factor (AMF) are analyzed in the following kinds of weather cases, i. e. "clear and low aerosol load", "clear and high aerosol load", "broken cloud", "continuous and thin cloud" as well as "continuous and thick clouds". We found that the CI consecutively decreases with the growing up of optical depth <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and aerosol. And the speedy temporal variation of CI is always going along with the occurrence <b>of</b> broken <b>cloud.</b> For the case <b>of</b> continuous <b>cloud,</b> the CIs <b>of</b> observations for all the elevation angles are similar to each other. At the same time, the thick cloud case normally causes radiance dropping and O- 4 AMF growing up strongly. Based on these characters, the scheme <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>classification</b> for MAX-DOAS is built. Using this scheme, the classification results for the MAX-DOAS observations in the period from 1 June 2012 to 30 October 2012 are analyzed statistically. The occurrence probabilities <b>of</b> the broken <b>cloud</b> and thin continuous cloud are the two largest weather kinds. The percentage <b>of</b> the broken <b>cloud</b> in all the observations is 66 %, and that of the thin continuous cloud case is 14. 3 %. For these two kinds of weathers, the mean NO 2 tropospheric vertical column densities (V-CD) are respectively 35 % and 66 % larger than the value for the clear and low aerosol. Meanwhile, the standard deviation, which represents the stability of the measured NO 2 V-CD is two times larger than that of the clear and low aerosol cases. In the weather <b>of</b> thick continuous <b>cloud,</b> suddenly appearing <b>of</b> peak and valley are often observed. In conclusion, the real time <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and aerosol is very important and valuable in analyzing of MAX-DOAS data and the guarantee of data quality...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the climatological {{classification}} of precipitating clouds in the Northeast of Brazil using the radar on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Thus, for this research a time series of 15 years of satellite data (period 1998 – 2012) was analyzed {{in order to identify}} what types of clouds produce precipitation estimated by Precipitation Radar (PR) and how often these clouds occur. From the results of this work it was possible to estimate the average relative frequency of each type of cloud present in weather systems that influence the Northeast of Brazil. In general, the stratiform clouds and shallow convective clouds are the most frequent in this region, but the associated rainfall is not as abundant as precipitation caused by deep convective clouds. It is also seen that a strong signal of shallow convective clouds modulates rainfall over the coastal areas of Northeast of Brazil and adjacent ocean.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the calibration of the colour index (CI) and the O 4 absorption derived from {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} (DOAS) measurements of scattered sunlight. The method is based on the comparison of measurements and radiative transfer simulations for well-defined atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries. Calibrated measurements of the CI and the O 4 absorption are important for the detection and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> from MAX-DOAS observations. Such information is needed for the identification and correction of the cloud influence on Multi AXis (MAX-) DOAS profile inversion results, but might be also be of interest on their own, e. g. for meteorological applications. The calibration algorithm was successfully applied to measurements at two locations: Cabauw in the Netherlands and Wuxi in China. We used CI and O 4 observations calibrated by the new method as input for our recently developed cloud classification scheme and also adapted the corresponding threshold values accordingly. For the observations at Cabauw, good agreement is found with the results of the original algorithm. Together with the calibration procedure of the CI and O 4 absorption, the cloud classification scheme, which has been tuned to specific locations/conditions so far, can now be applied consistently to MAX-DOAS measurements at different locations. In addition to the new threshold values, further improvements were introduced to the cloud classification algorithm, namely a better description of the SZA (solar zenith angle) dependence of the threshold values and a new set of wavelengths for the determination of the CI. We also indicate specific areas for future research to further improve the cloud classification scheme...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the nowcasting of clouds and direct normal irradiance (DNI) {{based on the}} Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite is presented for a forecast horizon up to 120  min. The basis of the algorithm is an optical flow method to derive cloud motion vectors for all cloudy pixels. To facilitate forecasts over a relevant time period, a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> into objects and a weighted triangular interpolation of clear-sky regions are used. Low and high level clouds are forecasted separately because they show different velocities and motion directions. Additionally a distinction in advective and convective clouds together with an intensity correction for quickly thinning convective clouds is integrated. The DNI is calculated from the forecasted optical thickness of the low and high level clouds. In order to quantitatively assess {{the performance of the}} algorithm, a forecast validation against MSG/SEVIRI observations is performed for a period of 2 months. Error rates and Hanssen–Kuiper skill scores are derived for forecasted cloud masks. For a forecast of 5  min for most cloud situations more than 95  % of all pixels are predicted correctly cloudy or clear. This number decreases to 80 – 95  % for a forecast of 2  h depending on cloud type and vertical cloud level. Hanssen–Kuiper skill scores for cloud mask go down to 0. 6 – 0. 7 for a 2  h forecast. Compared to persistence an improvement of forecast horizon by a factor of 2 is reached for all forecasts up to 2  h. A comparison of forecasted optical thickness distributions and DNI against observations yields correlation coefficients larger than 0. 9 for 15  min forecasts and around 0. 65 for 2  h forecasts...|$|E

The laser beam is always attenuated when it penetrates through the clouds. However, when a powerful laser (e.g., Nd:YAG laser with high energy per pulse) is used, cloud top can be retrieved too.

40|$|<b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> cirrus, snow, {{shadows and}} clear sky areas {{is a crucial}} step in the {{pre-processing}} of optical remote sensing images and is a valuable input for their atmospheric correction. The Multi-Spectral Imager on board the Sentinel- 2 ’s of the Copernicus program offers optimized bands for this task and delivers unprecedented amounts of data regarding spatial sampling, global coverage, spectral coverage, and repetition rate. Efficient algorithms are needed to process, or possibly reprocess, those big amounts of data. Techniques based on top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra for single-pixels without exploitation of external data or spatial context offer the largest potential for parallel data processing and highly optimized processing throughput. Such algorithms {{can be seen as}} a baseline for possible trade-offs in processing performance when the application of more sophisticated methods is discussed. We present several ready-to-use classification algorithms which are all based on a publicly available database of manually classified Sentinel- 2 A images. These algorithms are based on commonly used and newly developed machine learning techniques which drastically reduce the amount of time needed to update the algorithms when new images are added to the database. Several ready-to-use decision trees are presented which allow to correctly label about 91 % of the spectra within a validation dataset. While decision trees are simple to implement and easy to understand, they offer only limited classification skill. It improves to 98 % when the presented algorithm based on the classical Bayesian method is applied. This method has only recently been used for this task and shows excellent performance concerning classification skill and processing performance. A comparison of the presented algorithms with other commonly used techniques such as random forests, stochastic gradient descent, or support vector machines is also given. Especially random forests and support vector machines show similar classification skill as the classical Bayesian method...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to infer cloud liquid water path (LWP in kg/m 2) over the ocean from passive microwave measurements of SSM/I. The algorithm to retrieve LWP is based on simulated satellite observations. They are calculated with a radiative transfer model applied to about 3000 radiosonde ascents over the Atlantic Ocean. Since radiosonde observations do not contain direct information about cloud water and ice, these parameters are parameterized based on relative humidity and temperature using modified adiabatic liquid water density profiles. A multiple linear regression {{is applied to the}} simulated radiances and the calculated LWP to derive the algorithm. The retrieval accuracy based on the regression analysis including instrumental noise is 0. 03 kg/m 2. Validation of the LWP-algorithm was pursued through a comparison with measurements of a ground-based 33 GHzmicrowave radiometer on board of R. V. "Poseidon" during the International Cirrus Experiment 1989 at the North Sea (ICE' 89). The LWP values agree within the range of uncertainty caused by the different sampling characteristics of the observing systems. The retrieval accuracy for clear-sky cases determined using colocated METEOSAT data over the North Sea is 0. 037 kg/m 2 and confirms the accuracy estimated from regression analysis for the low liquid water cases. The algorithm was used to derive maps of monthly mean LWP over the Atlantic Ocean. As an example the Octobers of the 5 years 1987 - 1991 were selected to demonstrate the interannual variability of LWP. The results were compared with the cloud water content produced by the climate model ECHAM-T 2 from the Max-Planck-Institut Hamburg. Observations during ICE' 89 were used to check the accuracy of the applied radiative transfer model. Brightness temperatures were calculated from radiosonde ascents launched during the overpass of DMSP-F 8 in cloud-free situations. The channel-dependent differences range from about - 2 to 3 K. The possibility to identify different cloud types using microwave and infrared observations was examined. The main conclusion is that simultaneous microwave and infrared measurements enable the separation of dense cirrus and cirrus with underlying water clouds. A <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> with respect to their top heights and LWP was carried out using a combination of SSM/I derived LWP and simultaneously recorded Meteosat IR-data during ICE' 89...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTComplexity in Climatic Controls on Plant Species Distribution: Satellite Data Reveal Unique Climate for Giant Sequoia in the California Sierra NevadabyEric Kindseth WallerDoctor of Philosophy in Environmental Science, Policy, and ManagementUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Dennis D. Baldocchi, ChairA better {{understanding}} of the environmental controls on current plant species distribution is essential if the impacts of such diverse challenges as invasive species, changing fire regimes, and global climate change are to be predicted and important diversity conserved. Climate, soil, hydrology, various biotic factors (e. g., competition, disease, dispersal), fire, history, and chance can all play a role, but disentangling these factors is a daunting task. Increasingly sophisticated statistical models relying on existing distributions and mapped climatic variables, among others, have been developed to try to answer these questions. Any failure to explain pattern with existing mapped climatic variables is often taken as a referendum on climate as a whole, rather than on the limitations of the particular maps or models. Every location has a unique and constantly changing climate (challenging our definition of climate), so that any distribution could be explained by some aspect of climate. This is not a rationale for doing so - such models would certainly be overly fit to the given conditions and not generalizable. It is an argument for a more complete evaluation of possible climatic controls and the interaction of climate with other important variables (e. g., soil). A lack of adequate maps for various climate and climate-derived variables plays a large role in the failure of modelers to sufficiently address climatic complexity. In particular, site water balance, radiation, humidity, wind, and temporal variability in all of these factors may be poorly understood factors in controlling distributions. Weakness in the mapping of these variables is well recognized in the water balance modeling field, but is less emphasized in the species distribution modeling field, despite the fact that variables that affect the water balance are also likely {{to play a major role}} in species distribution. In this dissertation, I 1) improve the mapping of cloud cover from satellite imagery, in order to generate accurate monthly cloud frequency variables; 2) use these cloud frequency variables to demonstrate the possible importance of cloud cover, a previously overlooked climate variable, to the distribution of a particularly charismatic plant species, giant sequoia; and 3) further investigate the climate associated with the frequent cloud cover in the vicinity of giant sequoia, to identify other climatic factors that may also be important to the tree's distribution. Chapter 1 of this dissertation reviews some of the major flaws in species distribution modeling (with existing climate data) and addresses concerns that climate may therefore not be predictive of, or even relevant to, species distributions. Despite problems with climate-based models, climate and climate-derived variables still have substantial merit for explaining species distribution patterns. Additional generation of relevant climate variables and improvements in other climate and climate-derived variables are still needed to demonstrate this more effectively. Satellite data have a long history of being used for vegetation mapping and even species distribution mapping. They have great potential for being used for additional climatic information, and for improved mapping of other climate and climate-derived variables. Improving the characterization of cloud cover frequency with satellite data is one way in which the mapping of important climate and climate-derived variables (e. g., water balance) can be improved. An important input to water balance models, solar radiation maps could be vastly improved with a better mapping of spatial and temporal patterns in cloud cover. Chapter 2 of this dissertation describes the generation of custom daily cloud cover maps from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from 1981 - 1999 at ~ 5 km resolution and Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiomter (MODIS) satellite reflectance data at ~ 500 meter resolution for much of the western U. S., from 2000 to 2012. Intensive comparisons of reflectance spectra from a variety of cloud and snow-covered scenes from the southwestern United States allowed the generation of new rules for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and snow in both the AVHRR and MODIS data. The resulting products avoid many of the problems that plague other cloud mapping efforts, such as the tendency for snow cover and bright desert soils to be mapped as cloud. This consistency in classification across cover types is critically important for any distribution modeling of a plant species that might be dependent on cloud cover. In Chapter 3, monthly cloud frequencies derived from the daily classifications were used directly in species distribution models for giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindley) Buchholz) and were found to be the strongest predictors of giant sequoia distribution. A high frequency of cloud cover, especially in the spring, differentiated the climate of the west slope of the southern Sierra Nevada, where giant sequoia are prolific, from central and northern parts of the range, where the tree is rare and generally absent. Other mapped cloud products, contaminated by confusion with high elevation snow, would likely not have found this important result. The result illustrates the importance of accuracy in mapping as well as the importance of previously overlooked aspects of climate for species distribution modeling. But it also raises new questions about why the clouds form where they do and whether they might be associated with other aspects of climate important to giant sequoia distribution. What are the exact climatic mechanisms governing the distribution? Detailed aspects of the local climate warranted more investigation. Chapter 4 investigates the climate associated with the frequent cloud formation over the western slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada: the "sequoia belt". This region is climatically distinct in a number of ways, all of which could be factors in influencing the distribution of giant sequoia and other species. Satellite and micrometeorological flux tower data reveal characteristics of the sequoia belt that were not evident with surface climate measurements and maps derived from them. Results have implications for species distributions everywhere, but especially in rugged mountains, where climates are complex and poorly mapped.

Given a set of points in a high-dimensional space, a key question is to determine its topological characteristics. One potential route toward topological classification would be through the standard machine learning methods. However, this approach is too inefficient due to the tremendous variability in the possible examples. Two surfaces that are topologically equivalent may be completely different as subsets of Euclidean space. In other words, the set <b>of</b> point <b>clouds</b> that are topologically equivalent (i. e. homeomorphic) to a given surface is so vast {{that it would be}} computationally infeasible to approach the problem in this way. On the other hand, the theory of persistent homology developed by Gunnar Carlsson and his collaborators presents a tractable method for topological <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> point <b>clouds.</b> More information on the subject can be found in [1], and [2]. There is one catch, however, in that the point cloud must have a well-defined metric.
