50|$|The {{church was}} {{constructed}} of red brick {{on a stone}} foundation, and it has stone trim. The Romanesque Revival style is evoked {{by the use of}} the round arch for the entrance portals, the windows, and bell tower elements. The side elevations are seven bays in length and are divided by buttresses that are flanked by flat brick pilasters. Each bay contains a stained glass window and a corbel table just below the eaves. The east side of the church building has two brick structures that <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> entrances into the basement. On the west side is a brick structure that covers a handicap entrance into the church itself. The main facade is dominated by a two-stage, central bell tower that is capped by an octagon-shaped spire. At the base of the tower is the main entrance into the church. The tower is flanked by narrower side entrances. The three entrance portals are framed by compound round arches that feature limestone keystones and impost blocks. Above the main entrance is two pairs of round arch windows, and above them is the bell chamber whose cornices are arched to accommodate a clock on each face of the tower. The building is capped by a gable roof with no exterior apse on the rear of the building.|$|E

40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the <b>cover</b> <b>side,</b> the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{spindle motor}} {{in a hard}} disk drive spins at a high {{rotational}} speed. These rotations generate air flow and thermal stress. Air flow is induced by the surface roughness of the media that is moving at a high speed through air. This air passes {{over the surface of}} many parts in the drive, including the media. Thermal stress is generated by heat in the parts, e. g. voice coil motor, pre-amplifier, slider pole tips, which are heated by electric power and by the spinning of the spindle motor. The air flow and thermal stress cause a change in the media shape called deformation. Simulation results show the trend of deformation has more bending when the slider moves outward from the media axis. The pressure acted more on the underside than on the upper side which caused the media to bend up to the top <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> of hard disk drive. The maximum deformation, 15 µm, occurred at the rim of media while the distance between the media and the slider is 30 µm; thus they did not contact each other...|$|E
40|$|Check valves {{are used}} {{frequently}} {{within the field}} of microfluidic MEMS, particularly in micropump applications. Check valves serve to limit the flow of a fluid to one direction through a channel. This project was an attempt to manufacture an efficient check microvalve using polysilicon as the valve cover material. Previous work on a microvalve at RIT has been unsuccessful, as the final KOH etch has attacked the polysilicon, thus removing the valves from the openings in the silicon. It was determined that pinholes in the LPCVD nitride were allowing KOH to penetrate the etch mask and attack the substrate surface and the polysilicon. In this attempt, black wax was used as a protective coating over the LPCVD nitride on the <b>cover</b> <b>side</b> of the substrate. A crucial part of this project was the testing of the produced microvalves. In this project, nine valve designs were patterned; with each valve differing in arm length and flap overlap across the substrate opening. Of these, one valve functioned correctly after processing. The remaining valves either failed to release during the final oxide etch or were etched through during KOH etching. Testing consisted of forward and reverse flow rate measurements using compressed gaseous nitrogen...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{composite}} resin restoration with adhesive material {{is used for}} dental treatment frequently, because the studies of caries and {{the research and development}} of the adhesive system for tooth have advanced. However, it is reported that the adhesive decline by various factors causes the detachment of the dental restoration, marginal leakage, secondary caries. It is reported that the factor of the adhesive decline is the following: the deterioration of the stress concentration to the resin-dentin interface by the polymerization shrinkage of resin, the pollution with blood or saliva of the arrival at <b>cover</b> <b>side,</b> survival of the caries dentin, the penetration defectiveness to a sound tooth substance of the adhesive material, the survival or elution of non-olymerization monomer, and the deterioration of adhesive material or the tooth substance. At present, the approaches to improve the long-term durability of dental adhesive materials are the following three. The first one is the study of materials of inhibiting MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinases) in dentin: MMPs hydrolyzes the collagen fiber of the adhesion interface part. Second is the study to improve osmosis and polymerizing ability of the monomer to inhibit the flow of the water in the adhesion interface. Final one is the study to blockade the microcavity which occurred in the adhesion interface. This report is the brief explanation of our research: long-term durability of dental adhesive restoration materials...|$|E
