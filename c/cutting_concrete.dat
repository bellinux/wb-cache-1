Chainsaws with specially designed bar and chain combinations have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills.

With the knowledge of well-known assumptions we developed the design scheme of a string experiencing bending deformation from the cutting and axial forces caused by the tension of pneumatic cylinder. Analytical force dependence is defined resulting in a string from rheological properties of raw, feed force generated by a pneumatic cylinder. The string efficiency areas are identified in the constraints on the allowable level of its bending and axial deformations.

50|$|Abrasive saws {{typically}} use composite {{friction disk}} blades to abrasively {{cut through the}} steel. The disks are consumable items as they wear throughout the cut. The abrasive disks for these saws are typically 14 in in diameter and 7/64 in thick. Larger saws use 410 mm diameter blades. Disks are available for steel and stainless steel. Abrasive saws can also use superabrasive (i.e., diamond and cubic boron nitride or CBN) blades, which last longer than conventional abrasive materials and do not generate as hazardous particulate matter. Superabrasive materials are more commonly used when <b>cutting</b> <b>concrete,</b> asphalt, and tile; however, they are also suitable for cutting ferrous metals.|$|E
50|$|A {{concrete}} saw (also {{known as a}} consaw, road saw, cut-off saw or quick cut) is a power tool used for <b>cutting</b> <b>concrete,</b> masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. It can be a small hand-held cut-off saw, a big walk-behind saw or other styles, {{and it may be}} powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or electric motors. The saw blades used on {{concrete saw}}s are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive cut-off wheels can also be used on cut-off saws to cut stone and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust.|$|E

The paper {{discusses}} abrasive water-jet {{cutting of}} hard-to-cut materials represented by {{high carbon steel}} DIN norm No. 1. 2436 (CSN EN 19437) plate 61 -mm-thick and high-strength concrete cube sized 150 mm. Four relatively hard minerals with different densities not commonly used in water-jet technology were tested and their cutting results compared to those of three types of almandine garnets: Ukraine, Australian, and sorted Australian. Cutting efficiency was evaluated utilizing declination angle. Dependence of cutting efficiency on abrasive density and hardness was investigated. High density of abrasive appeared to be disadvantageous in our experiment. Cutting efficiency dependence on hardness exhibited nearly linear course, the increase was much more significant for concrete than for steel. Evaluation of experimental results led {{to the conclusion that}} cutting mechanism in case of very thick samples is different from common abrasive waterjet cutting. The limit declination angle for thick samples is significantly smaller, it was found to be approximately 22 A degrees. This result represents entirely new finding. The most promising finding from the economical point of view appears to be behavior of corundum, when <b>cutting</b> <b>concrete.</b> Our experimental results promise 20 % increase in cutting speed for brittle materials.

30|$|Openings in slabs {{are usually}} {{required}} for many different {{applications such as}} aeriation ducts and air conditioning. Opening in concrete slabs due to cutouts significantly decrease the member stiffness. There are different techniques to strengthen slabs with opening cutouts. This study presents experimental and numerical investigations {{on the use of}} Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) as strengthening material to strengthen and restore the load carrying capacity of R.C. slabs after having cutout in the hogging moment region. The experimental program consisted of testing five (oneway spanning R.C. flat slabs) with overhang. All slabs were prismatic, rectangular in cross-section and nominally 2000 mm long, 1000 mm width, and 100 mm thickness with a clear span (distance between supports) of 1200 mm and the overhang length is 700 mm. All slabs were loaded up to 30 kN (45 % of ultimate load for reference slab, before yielding of the longitudinal reinforcement), then the load was kept constant during <b>cutting</b> <b>concrete</b> and steel bars (producing cut out). After that operation, slabs were loaded till failure. An analytical study using finite element analysis (FEA) is performed using the commercial software ANSYS. The FEA has been validated and calibrated using the experimental results. The FE model was found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results. The investigated key parameters were slab aspect ratio for the opening ratios of [1 : 1, 2 : 1], CFRP layers and the laminates widths, positions for cutouts and the CFRP configurations around cutouts.|$|E

The construction activities observed, studied, researched and sampled include <b>concrete</b> sawing, <b>concrete</b> <b>cutting</b> and application, and dry/wet sanding drywall mud. High construction tasks, for example, produce respirable dusts often containing crystalline silica. Such tasks include <b>concrete</b> saw <b>cutting</b> and <b>concrete</b> core drilling.

After reviewing the sampling results and the conclusions of the literary review articles, findings show it is possible for workers to reduce exposures to silica during the construction activities discussed in this study, through work practices, engineering controls and PPE. The long-term benefit of upfront adoption of the work practices, engineering controls and PPE is consistent with the conservative approach the Company embraced regarding the safety and well-being of its workers, and may possibly prevent future cases of over-exposure to silica...|$|R
