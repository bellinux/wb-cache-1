40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of court {{congestion}} in Indian lower courts. We use several measures to capture court congestion. These include: caseloads per capita and per judge, {{the number of cases}} older than a year per capita and per judge, and <b>congestion</b> <b>rates</b> calculated as the ratio of cases older than a year to cases disposed. We conclude that the Indian state judiciaries differ with respect to the nature and the level of congestion. We can also identify the reasons why some judiciaries are more congested than others. The results show that the large number of judges per capita is negatively related to <b>congestion</b> <b>rates,</b> while judgeship vacancies {{have a positive effect on}} caseloads per judge. Court productivity captured by the clearance rates has a significant and negative effect on both caseloads and <b>congestion</b> <b>rates</b> and seems to be crucial for the effectiveness of congestion-reduction programs. Finally, judiciaries with lower litigation rates display a relatively better performance with respect to current caseloads, but are not efficient in addressing the ï¿½realï¿½ backlogs of cases pending for more than a year.

40|$|Abstract — A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} deployment of multicast services is the daunting technical complexity of developing, testing and validating congestion control protocols fit for wide-area deployment. Protocols such as pgmcc and TFMCC have recently made considerable {{progress on the}} single rate case, i. e. where one dynamic reception rate is maintained for all receivers in the session. However, these protocols have limited applicability, since scaling to session sizes beyond tens of participants necessitates {{the use of multiple}} rate protocols. Unfortunately, while existing multiple rate protocols exhibit better scalability, they are both less mature than single rate protocols and suffer from high complexity. We propose a new approach to multiple <b>rate</b> <b>congestion</b> control that leverages proven single <b>rate</b> <b>congestion</b> control methods by orchestrating an ensemble of independently controlled single rate sessions. We describe a new multiple <b>rate</b> <b>congestion</b> control algorithm for layered multicast sessions that employs a single <b>rate</b> multicast <b>congestion</b> control as the primary underlying control mechanism for each layer. Our new scheme combines the benefits of single <b>rate</b> <b>congestion</b> control with the scalability and flexibility of multiple rates to provide a sound multiple <b>rate</b> multicast <b>congestion</b> control policy.

Heavy infections of Myxobolus insidiosus (Myxozoa) and metacercariae of Nanophyetus salmincola and Apophallus sp. occurred in parr (subyearlings) from the lower mainstem of this river collected in 2007 and 2008. Smolts (yearlings) collected in 2006 - 2009 always harbored fewer Apophallus sp. with host mortality recognized as a function of intensity for this parasite. Mean intensity of Apophallus sp. in lower mainstem parr was 753 per fish in 2007 and 856 per fish in 2008, while parr from the tributaries had a mean of only 37 or 13 parasites per fish, respectively. Mean intensity of this parasite in smolts ranged between 47 - 251 parasites per fish. Over-dispersion (variance to mean ratios) of Apophallus sp. was always lower in smolts compared with all parr combined or lower mainstem parr.

Secondly, we propose the cross-layer scheme to minimize the power cost of the whole network by a linear optimization problem.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a model based on SIR epidemic model that comprises a congestion propagation model and a propagation rate calculation method {{to utilize the}} propagation theories of the oversaturated conditions in rail transit. The application of the congestion propagation model aims to simulate the propagation process of the whole network under oversaturated conditions. In this paper, a new approach consisting of a separate method that calculates the <b>congestion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> is studied and presented. The <b>congestion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> model is used to generate measures to solve the oversaturated condition, improve congestion and finally enable us to analyze the incidents for future reference. The two models establish a solid foundation {{for the study of}} large-scale network congestion propagation. The influential factors of the propagation rate can be classified into six classes: passenger flow characteristic, train departure interval, passenger transfer convenience, the time of congestion occurring, the initial congested station and station capacity. Nevertheless, there are some other influential factors for these models. Hence, further research on other influential factors is suggested to extend the models. The congestion propagation model provides an extensive analysis of the propagation process related to congestion. Moreover, the model depicts the forecasting and trends of congestion so that traffic controllers obtain a quantitative observation of the process. The <b>congestion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> model distinguishes the efficiency of the alternatives related to congestion improvement measures. As a result, traffic controllers evaluate the outcome and subsequently select the optimal measure to resolve the oversaturated conditions. The expansion of urban transit networks magnifies the propagation of congestion and oversaturated conditions. The goal of the comprehensive quantitative model is to integrate congestion propagation analysis with efficiency differentiation of propagation rate to promote effective congestion recovery measures. The paper hopes to initialize a new approach in the quantitative model of the congestion propagation through the utilization of the two models and integrate the two results for the development of urban transit. Thus, the models proposed in this paper optimize the recovery measures and more importantly simulate the current circumstances and forecast the propagation trends in urban transit systems.|$|R
