The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E

This would have included a new lane from junction 12 to 15 and a new lane from junction 8 to 12 near the Trafford Centre. Both these projects were subsequently cancelled in favour of a new project that includes speed cameras on this section but no additional lane or hard-shoulder running. An 'environmental assessment' was cited as the reason an additional lane will not be provided. Consequently, daily congestion on this section {{is expected to continue}} indefinitely. A <b>combined</b> <b>approach</b> was initiated in 2014, comprising managed motorway system and lane gain scheme. Work commenced in July 2014 and is expected to be completed by summer 2018.|$|E

30|$|The ZM {{descriptor}} provides {{three different}} sets of features, namely, magnitude features, combined magnitude and phase features [31, 32], and the modified real and imaginary component features [29]. In this study, these diverse feature sets of ZMs {{are referred to as}} ZMmag, ZMmagPhase, and ZMcomponent, respectively. The performance of the feature sets of ZMs combined with LBP descriptor, in comparison to that of the ZMs coupled with the LTP descriptor, is also analyzed. Consequently, the proposed fusion of the diverse feature sets of ZMs and the LBP/LTP descriptors provides various <b>combined</b> <b>approaches</b> such as ZMmagLBP, ZMmagPhaseLBP, ZMcomponentLBP, ZMmagLTP, ZMmagPhaseLTP, and ZMcomponentLTP. In order to compare the performance of these <b>combined</b> <b>approaches</b> to that of the individual ZM and LBP/LTP approaches, exhaustive experiments are performed on three prominent face databases, namely, FERET, Yale, and ORL, against pose, illumination, expression, and noise variations. The results obtained show that the recognition rate of the <b>combined</b> <b>approaches,</b> in comparison to that of their individual counterparts, is significantly better varying between 10 and 30 %. Experimental results also prove the efficacy of the proposed methods over other existing works. A significant improvement in recognition rate is achieved for the case of single training image per person.|$|R
