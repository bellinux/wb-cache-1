5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} <b>cortisone</b> {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce <b>cortisone</b> and hydrocortisone.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. <b>Cortisone</b> is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered <b>cortisone</b> into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6, an isozyme of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system. Alcohol causes {{an increase}} of CYP2B6 in the liver, and persons {{with a history of}} alcohol use metabolize bupropion faster. Bupropion is metabolized to threo-hydrobupropion via <b>cortisone</b> reductase. The metabolic pathway responsible for the creation of erythro-hydrobupropion remains elusive.|$|E
5|$|Louis Fieser – {{organic chemist}} and {{professor}} emeritus at Harvard University renowned as the inventor of a militarily effective form of napalm. His award-winning research included work on blood-clotting agents including the first synthesis of vitamin K, synthesis and screening of quinones as antimalarial drugs, work with steroids leading to the synthesis of <b>cortisone,</b> and study {{of the nature of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang struck Youkilis on {{his right}} wrist with a pitch, {{resulting}} in a deep tendon bruise that kept him out until September 25, when he returned {{with the aid of}} a <b>cortisone</b> shot. In 2007, Youkilis was 6th in the AL with 15 hit by pitch (HBP).|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with <b>cortisone</b> injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 1952, {{biochemist}} Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to <b>cortisone</b> or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).|$|E
5|$|While in Aberdeen, Woodruff also {{visited the}} United States on a World Health Organization (WHO) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met {{many of the}} leading American surgeons, an {{experience}} that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff experimented {{with the effects of}} <b>cortisone</b> and the impact of blood antigen on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts. When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors. In 1951 Woodruff was awarded a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application.|$|E
5|$|On May19, 2002, Rivera {{recorded}} his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves. Over {{the next few}} months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47ERA and 21saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August8 after receiving a <b>cortisone</b> shot but returned to the disabled list after a recurrence of shoulder tightness. For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74ERA and 28saves in 32opportunities in just 46innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|He was demoted to {{the reserve}} side soon {{thereafter}} by manager Míchel, who had replaced Bielsa {{early in the}} season, and made only one more senior appearance for the campaign. Much of his absence {{in the second half}} of the season also came as a result of him suffering from glue ear, a condition which traps liquid behind the eardrum and affects hearing. Míchel confirmed that Sparagna had been suffering from the condition since the start of the season and had unsuccessfully undergone treatment in late 2015. In April he began a new <b>cortisone</b> treatment but was unable to return to the pitch for fear that he would fall short of doping regulations as a result of the medication. Míchel later revealed that his reluctance to play Sparagna, despite the risks involved had he done so, ultimately contributed towards him being sacked by Vincent Labrune and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who at the time were the president and owner of the club respectively. Sparagna ultimately made 15 appearances across all competitions as Marseille ended the season in 13th position in Ligue 1 and as runners-up in the Coupe de France.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use <b>cortisone</b> on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> has {{marginally}} reduced glucocorticoid activity {{compared to}} cortisol (80-90%), and thus, <b>cortisone</b> {{can be considered}} an active metabolite of cortisol. However, 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase can catalyze the reverse reaction as well, and, thus, <b>cortisone</b> is also a precursor molecule of cortisol. <b>Cortisone</b> is activated through hydrogenation of the 11-keto-group, and cortisol is, thus, {{sometimes referred to as}} hydrocortisone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> {{was first}} {{produced}} commercially by Merck & Co. in 1948 or 1949. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced {{an improvement in}} the process of producing <b>cortisone</b> from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical. In the UK in the early 1950s, John Cornforth and Kenneth Callow at the National Institute for Medical Research collaborated with Glaxo to produce <b>cortisone</b> from hecogenin from sisal plants.|$|E
25|$|Subcutaneous {{adipose tissue}} regenerates {{cortisol}} from <b>cortisone</b> by the enzyme 11-beta HSD1.|$|E
25|$|John F. Kennedy {{needed to}} {{regularly}} use corticosteroids such as <b>cortisone</b> {{as a treatment}} for Addison's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> is {{also used}} by dermatologists to treat keloids, relieve the {{symptoms}} of eczema and atopic dermatitis, and stop the development of sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|Oral use of <b>cortisone</b> has {{a number}} of {{potential}} systemic side-effects: hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, amenorrhoea, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome and glaucoma, among other problems.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for active disease includes Mesalazine suppositories and <b>cortisone</b> foam (Cortifoam). Mesalazine 1 g SUPP QHS or Cortifoam QHS/BID is continued until remission, with response seen usually within three weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone,</b> a glucocorticoid, and {{adrenaline}} are {{the main}} hormones released by the body {{as a reaction to}} stress. They elevate blood pressure and prepare the body for a fight or flight response.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol is also metabolized into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), {{reactions}} {{for which}} 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase {{is also the}} rate-limiting factor in the conversion of <b>cortisone</b> to tetrahydrocortisone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> is one {{of several}} end-products of a process called steroidogenesis. This process starts with the {{synthesis}} of cholesterol, which then proceeds through a series of modifications in the adrenal gland (suprarenal) to become any one of many steroid hormones. One end-product of this pathway is cortisol. For cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland, a cascade of signaling occurs. Corticotropin-releasing hormone released from the hypothalamus stimulates corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which relays the signal to the adrenal cortex. Here, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis, in response to ACTH, secrete glucocorticoids, in particular cortisol. In the peripheral tissues, cortisol is converted to <b>cortisone</b> by the enzyme 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> {{may also}} be used to {{deliberately}} suppress immune response in persons with autoimmune diseases or following an organ transplant to prevent transplant rejection. The suppression of the immune system {{may also be}} important in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisone</b> {{was first}} {{identified}} by the American chemists Edward Calvin Kendall and Harold L. Mason while researching at the Mayo Clinic. In 1929, Philip S. Hench and colleagues discovered that <b>cortisone</b> is effective {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis. Kendall was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine along with Philip S. Hench and Tadeus Reichstein for the discovery of adrenal cortex hormones, their structures, and their functions. As it turns out, both Reichstein and the team of O. Wintersteiner and J. Pfiffner had separately isolated the compound prior to Mason and Kendall, but failed to recognize its biological significance. Mason's contributions to the crystallization and characterization of the compound have generally been forgotten outside of the Mayo Clinic.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Woodward {{synthesized}} many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, <b>cortisone,</b> strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward {{opened up a}} new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{suffered}} from a torn meniscus {{in his right knee}} for much {{of the first half of}} the 2011 season, and received <b>Cortisone</b> shots in an attempt to manage the pain. When this became ineffective, he elected to undergo arthroscopic surgery and was placed on the disabled list on July 9, 2011. He returned to the lineup on July 25.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Peter Medawar, {{working for the}} National Institute for Medical Research, {{improved}} the understanding of rejection. Identifying the immune reactions in 1951, Medawar suggested that immunosuppressive drugs could be used. <b>Cortisone</b> had been recently discovered and the more effective azathioprine was identified in 1959, {{but it was not}} until the discovery of cyclosporine in 1970 that transplant surgery found a sufficiently powerful immunosuppressive.|$|E
25|$|Addiction to <b>cortisone</b> was {{the subject}} of the 1956 motion picture, Bigger Than Life, {{produced}} by and starring James Mason. Though it was a box-office flop upon its initial release, many modern critics hail it as a masterpiece and brilliant indictment of contemporary attitudes towards mental illness and addiction. In 1963, Jean-Luc Godard named it one of the ten best American sound films ever made.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{infection}} determines the appropriate treatment. It may include oral or topical antibiotics and/or antifungal creams, antibacterial creams, or similar medications. A cream containing <b>cortisone</b> may {{also be used to}} relieve some of the irritation. If an allergic reaction is involved, an antihistamine may also be prescribed. For women who have irritation and inflammation caused by low levels of estrogen (postmenopausal), a topical estrogen cream might be prescribed.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{palliative care}} {{following}} discharge often {{consists of a}} weak or moderate strength opioid (e.g. codeine or tramadol, respectively) depending on pain scores, an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. naproxen, <b>cortisone),</b> and an antispasmodic (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, diazepam), {{for a few days}} to a week. If the pain and/or spasms have not resolved by this time, a second medical evaluation is generally advised, and differential diagnoses may be considered. Occasionally, an antibiotic is prescribed as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} which a tendon is {{reparable}} depends on its quantity and quality. Degenerated tendons are often frail and retracted and may not be amenable to repair. Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had <b>cortisone</b> injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury.|$|E
25|$|Stuart was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer {{at the age of}} 94, many decades after she had quit smoking. Until that point, she had enjoyed remarkably good health for her advanced age aside from taking <b>cortisone</b> shots for knee pain. She underwent radiation treatment, but in time the cancer returned and she underwent a shorter course of radiation. The malignancy continued to spread, but slowly. She lived six years after her initial diagnosis and reached her centenary.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 Tour de France, Rasmussen, {{while wearing}} the yellow jersey and {{well on his}} way to winning the Tour, had his {{contract}} terminated by his team and was removed from the Tour. He served a two-year ban from July 2007 to July 2009 for lying about his whereabouts. At a press conference on 31 January 2013, Rasmussen admitted that he had used performance-enhancing drugs and methods, including EPO, growth hormones, insulin, testosterone, DHEA, IGF-1, Oxyglobin, <b>cortisone</b> and blood doping, for most of his professional career.|$|E
25|$|At the 1960 Democratic {{convention}} in Los Angeles, Connally led supporters of Senator Lyndon Johnson. He claimed that John F. Kennedy, if nominated and elected, {{would be unable}} to serve as president for a full term because of Addison's disease and dependence on <b>cortisone.</b> Kennedy, however, had wrapped up the needed delegates for nomination before the convention even opened. Kennedy realized that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Johnson. Therefore, Johnson was offered the vice-presidential nomination.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2014, Burnett {{signed a}} one-year, $15 million {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Phillies. The deal included a mutual option for the 2015 season and a limited no-trade clause. On April 27, 2014, {{it was revealed that}} Burnett was diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. He received a <b>cortisone</b> shot {{to see if he could}} forgo surgery until the end of the season. He ended the 2014 season 8–18 with a 4.59 ERA. His 96 walks issued and 18 losses each led the Major Leagues.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} (a {{condition in}} which the body contains excess amounts of cortisol) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing abdominal surgery. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of <b>cortisone</b> to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and insulin. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The MR is {{stimulated by}} both {{aldosterone}} and cortisol, but a mechanism protects {{the body from}} excess aldosterone receptor stimulation by glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), which happen to be present at much higher concentrations than mineralocorticoids in the healthy individual. The mechanism consists of an enzyme called 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). This enzyme co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors and converts cortisol into <b>cortisone,</b> a relatively inactive metabolite with little affinity for the MR. Liquorice, which contains glycyrrhetinic acid, can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.|$|E
