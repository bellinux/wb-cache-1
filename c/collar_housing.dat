50|$|<b>House</b> <b>collars</b> {{are also}} used in clubs, homes and in {{organizations}} that provide social spaces to protect submissives. <b>House</b> <b>collars</b> show that the submissive is {{under the guidance of}} the house and is not to be approached. This is often used with inexperienced submissives who are not ready to make their own choices yet and need time to learn.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War most {{patients}} were moved, first to Blackpool {{and then to}} <b>Collar</b> <b>House</b> in Prestbury, Cheshire, {{well away from the}} city centre, where there were 45 maternity beds. Prestbury Hall and later Adlington Hall were also used - Adlington Hall being reserved for the wives of junior officers. Many conscientious objectors worked in the hospital as porters. In 1947 11,750 inpatients and 14,017 outpatients were treated. At the start of the NHS in 1948 it formed part of The United Manchester Hospitals, and has been managed with the other hospitals in Central Manchester ever since. An X-ray department was established in 1949.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Satellite and {{conventional}} radio telemetry {{were used to}} obtain information on daily and seasonal movements of Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) on south-central Queen Elizabeth Islands, Northwest Territories, Canada. Seventeen Peary caribou were captured in 1993 and fitted with telemetry neck <b>collars.</b> Seven <b>collars</b> <b>housed</b> both a Satellite Platform Transmitter Terminal package and radio telemetry package; the other 10 <b>collars</b> all <b>housed</b> only the radio telemetry package. Three of the collared caribou, along with at least 16 of their companion animals, made inter-island water crossings by swimming between Île Vanier and Massey Island or between Massey Island and Île Marc in August 1993. Of particular note is that two-month-old calves, as well as adult caribou, were involved {{in some of the}} frigid saltwater crossings. The water crossing between Île Vanier and Massey Island required a minimum straight-line swim of 2. 5 km and that between Massey Island and Île Marc a minimum 1. 6 km swim, depending on points of entry and exit from the water. That evidence composes the first documented account of Peary caribou swimming between any of the Queen Elizabeth Islands. Key words: Peary caribou, Queen Elizabeth Islands, Northwest Territories, inter-island summertime water crossings, swimming RÉSUMÉ. On a utilisé la télémesure par satellite et la télémesure radioélectrique traditionnelle pour obtenir de l’information sur les déplacements quotidiens et saisonniers du caribou de Peary (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) dans la partie centre-sud des îles de la Reine-Élisabeth situées dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest au Canada. En 1993, on a capturé 17 caribous de Peary qu’on a équipés de colliers émetteurs pour télémesure. Sept de ces colliers contenaient à la fois un ensemble de terminal émetteur à plate-forme satellite et un ensemble de télémesure radioélectrique, le restant des colliers ne contenant que ce dernier.

5|$|In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons {{were entered}} into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was {{purchased}} by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation {{with the help of}} a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The <b>collar</b> is <b>housed</b> at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Hemichordates are marine acorn {{worms and}} a sister group to the echinoderms. Acorn worms share {{numerous}} developmental features with the chordates that the echinoderms do not share, suggesting that the common ancestor of the deuterostome clade was likely more similar to hemichordates than to echinoderms. Hemichordates possess pharyngeal gill slits that are homologous to chordate gill slits, a Hox specified anterior-posterior body plan, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail in some species. The hemichordate, Ptychodera flava, progresses from a pelagic, feeding tornaria larva to a tripartite, benthic worm with an anterior head or proboscis, a middle collar region, and a long posterior trunk. The <b>collar</b> <b>houses</b> a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates and numerous chordate genes involved in brain and spinal cord development are expressed in a similar anterior–posterior spatial arrangement along the hemichordate body axis. Remarkably, P. flava regenerates all structures, including their dorsal neural tube. This work investigates the morphological and genetic mechanisms underlying this fascinating trait I examined anterior regeneration in the hemichordate Ptychodera flava and detailed the spatial and temporal morphological changes that occur. Additionally, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the transcriptome for eight stages of regenerating P. flava, and revealed significant differential gene expression between regenerating and control animals. Importantly, we uncovered developmental steps that are regeneration-specific and do not strictly follow the embryonic program. We also showed that P. flava larvae are capable of robust regeneration after bisection through the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. We used antibody staining {{to show that the}} anterior apical region, including the eyespots and larval brain, regenerates a rich, serotonin positive complex of cells within two weeks after amputation. Cells labeled with EdU (5 -ethynyl- 2 '-deoxyuridine) confirmed that regeneration is occurring through epimorphic processes as new cells are added at the cut site and throughout the regenerating tissue. This study verified that P. flava larvae can be used for future functional studies aimed at identifying the genetic and morphological mechanisms controlling CNS regeneration in a stem deuterostome...|$|R
2500|$|The {{captain of}} the flight, aged 45, was a veteran pilot with more than 9,800 flying hours to his credit. An article {{published}} in The New York Times on 14 November 1996 stated that 215 Indians who boarded the flight worked in Saudi Arabia; many of them worked or planned to work in blue <b>collar</b> jobs as <b>house</b> maids, drivers, and cooks. The article also stated that 40 Nepalis and [...] Americans boarded the Saudi flight. According to {{an article in the}} same newspaper published a day earlier, the passenger manifest included 17 people of other nationalities, including nine Nepalis, three Pakistanis, two Americans, one Bangladeshi, one Briton, and one Saudi. Twelve of the crew members, including five anti-terrorism officials, were Saudi citizens.|$|R
40|$|The project {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} measurements-while-drilling (MWD) module that provides real-time reports of drilling conditions at the bit. The module is to support multiple types of sensors and to sample and encode their outputs in digital form under microprocessor control. The assembled message is to be electromagnetically transmitted along the drill string back to its associated receiver located in a collar typically 50 [...] 100 feet above the bit. The receiver demodulates the transmitted message and passes it data to the third party wireline or MWD telemetry system for relay to the surface. The <b>collar</b> also <b>houses</b> the conventional MWD or wireline probe assembly. The completed Phase 1 program began with the preparation of detailed performance specifications and ended with the design, fabrication and testing of a functioning prototype. The prototype was sized for operation with 6 - 3 / 4 -inch multi-lobe mud motors due to the widespread use of this size motor in horizontal and directional drilling applications. The Phase 1 prototype provided inclination, temperature and pressure information. The Phase 2 program {{objective is to}} expand the current sensor suite to include at least one type of formation evaluation measurement, such as formation resistivity or natural gamma ray. The Near-Bit system will be subjected to a vigorous series of shock and vibration tests followed by field testing to ensure it possesses the reliability and performance required for commercial success...|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} {{established}} in 1950 by British and South African Jews and by some ex-kibbutz members, near the ruins of an Arab village of Bashshit. It was named after Mordechai Eliash, Israel's first envoy to the United Kingdom. When the first settlers (Olim) arrived they discovered that the houses {{had not yet been}} built and they were housed in semi-detached huts (tzrifim) consisting of one large room, one kitchen and one toilet sited about a kilometer from their allocated farms. Here they languished for 12 months waiting for Rassco, the national builders to put up their homes. Eventually they got Rassco to agree to supply the materials and they self-built their homes. Since the many of the settlers had come from white <b>collar</b> backgrounds, the <b>houses</b> they built were never going to {{stand the test of time}} and today the homes are modern, well built and the original houses are long gone.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Lacey Park {{was renamed}} Warminster Heights, {{although}} {{to this day}} many older area residents prefer the former name when referring to the neighborhood. [...] Deserved or not, it had a somewhat odious reputation among the local population {{as it was a}} lower class, blue <b>collar,</b> low-rent public <b>housing</b> district during the 1960s and '70s up to the mid-1980s. The housing project had over 10,000 health and safety violations and was known as the [...] "worst suburban slum in Pennsylvania." [...] It suffered from a high crime rate and a high rate of house fires. Built in the 1940s by the US federal government, most of the housing units consisted of cinder block on slab construction, in units of four dwellings per structure (similar to Philadelphia row homes), in either one or two stories, generally with central heating via coal or heating oil furnaces with mostly electric appliances. Between 1957 and 1975 the housing units were under private ownership; in 1975 the Redevelopment Authority of Bucks County took over and managed the properties, and in 1986 ownership was turned over to a housing cooperative called the Warminster Heights Home Owners' Association. The housing cooperative began renovating the units following the assumption of ownership.The neighborhood has worked hard to repair its image. It has been known over the years for instances of murder and other violent crimes. The Park, as it is often referred to, has a history and longstanding association with poverty, alcohol abuse, and constant drug activity. (See references) ...|$|R
