50|$|It was {{revealed}} in March 2009 that Cohen had received £104,701 {{over the previous}} five years under the Additional <b>Costs</b> <b>Allowance</b> for his Wanstead home based upon the representation that this was his second home. The home that Cohen represented as his primary home was a house in Colchester, despite the fact that Cohen spent very little time at that location and used it only as a holiday home. As his Wanstead home is where Cohen resides both when going to Westminster and attending to his constituency, the claim of the Additional <b>Costs</b> <b>Allowance</b> was criticised as an abuse of an expense allowance intended to help Members of Parliament who need to maintain one home in their constituency and another in London. Cohen responded to criticism by stating that the Additional <b>Costs</b> <b>Allowance</b> was intended to be de facto salary for Members of Parliament.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Discussions {{of college}} costs often focus on {{tuition and fees}} but living <b>cost</b> <b>allowances</b> for room, board and other {{expenses}} {{account for more than}} half of the total cost of attending college. The allowances, developed by colleges and universities, also affect student eligibility for federal financial aid and the accuracy of accountability systems. This paper examines trends over time in living <b>cost</b> <b>allowances,</b> examines institutional variation, and assesses the accuracy of allowances by comparing them to living cost estimates specific to the college’s region. Estimates suggest that one-third of colleges and universities understate living costs by at least $ 3, 000 with extensive within-region institutional variation in allowances. *The authors thank participants in a September 2014 Lumina Foundation convening on living costs for useful feedback. The Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation, through a gift to the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, provided financial support for this work...|$|R
