5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>cyclones</b> are {{stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of oceanic turbulence and air-sea interactions on the sea surface temperature (SST) of the extra-tropical oceans on spatial scales {{of a few hundred}} kilometres (the so-called "mesoscale"). Using satellite-based measurements of SST and sea level, as well as surface tracks of mesoscale oceanic cyclones and anticyclones, it is shown that turbulence does not transport heat through systematic motions of <b>cold</b> <b>cyclones</b> and warm anticyclones, as was previously thought in regions of strong mean flows like the Gulf Stream. Rather, it is suggested that heat is transported {{as a result of the}} slight phase shift between temperature and pressure fluctuations developing on the mean flow. In addition, tentative estimates of the rate at which air-sea heat fluxes damp the SST signatures of cyclones and anticyclones are provided. The weak values obtained (20 W/m 2 K) contrast sharply with theoretical expectations, but are in agreement with the observed long-lived thermal heat content anomalies associated with the cyclones and anticyclones. These observations provide important benchmarks for high-resolution ocean models and may moreover guide the parametrization of subgrid-scale heat transport in climate models.

The vortex formed between two large cyclones to the southwest of Oahu, Hawaii. The radius of the core was ~ 15 km; the azimuthal velocity reached 35 cm s- 1; and the surface vorticity remained below - f for 9 days, reaching an extremum of - 1. 7 f. The flow was ageostrophic near the center and around {{the periphery of the}} vortex. The initial growth may have been driven by negative wind stress curl in the lee of Oahu. The vortex was prone to inertial, symmetric, and anticyclonic ageostrophic instabilities, but the temporal {{evolution of}} radial profiles of vorticity was inconsistent with angular momentum redistribution by inertial instability. A tongue of surface water 0. 7 °C warmer became entrained northward between the vortex and the <b>colder</b> <b>cyclone</b> to the west. As the vortex strengthened, a 0. 14 °C km- 1 front formed along the eastern flank of the tongue. The sea surface temperature gradient remained weaker on the western flank. The flow was anticyclonic (- 0. 4 f) and divergent (0. 1 f) on the warm side of the front but cyclonic (0. 6 f) and convergent (- 0. 2 f) on the cold side. This suggests ageostrophic cross-frontal circulations maintaining alongfront thermal wind balance in the presence of large-scale strain.

An overview of the dependence of the eddy diffusivity D on the bottom friction �, the deformation radius �, the vertical variation of the large-scale flow U, and the domain size L is provided by numerical simulations at 70 different values of the two nondimensional control parameters ��/U and L/�. Strong, axisymmetric, wellseparated baroclinic vortices dominate both the barotropic vorticity and the temperature fields. The core radius of a single vortex is significantly larger than � but smaller than the eddy mixing length � mix. Onthe other hand, the typical vortex separation is comparable to � mix. Anticyclonic vortices are hot, and cyclonic vortices are cold. The motion of a single vortex is due to barotropic advection by other distant vortices, and the eddy heat flux {{is due to the}} systematic migration of hot anticyclones northward and <b>cold</b> <b>cyclones</b> southward.

However, large amount of the resulting available potential energy is not converted into kinetic energy.

Closed circulation lows in the Tasman Sea region are termed East Coast Cyclones (ECC); they can evolve {{in a range}} of climatic environments and have proven most destructive during the late autumn-winter period. Using criteria based on pressure gradients, inferred wind field, and duration, an objectively determined database of ECC occurrences is established to explore large-scale influences on ECC evolution. Subclassification based on evolutionary trajectory reveals two dominant storm types during late autumn-winter: easterly trough lows (ETL) and southern secondary lows (SSL). Synoptic composites are used to investigate the climatological evolution of each storm type. ETL cyclogenesis occurs along the eastern seaboard at the confluence of warm moist subtropical easterlies and cool air over the continent that is advected from higher latitudes.

The sources and transport of atmospheric water vapor in the North Atlantic storm track during that month are examined by means of a mesoscale model fitted with water vapor tracers. De-composition of the modeled total water vapor field into numerical water vapor tracers tagged by evaporation latitude shows that when an atmospheric river was present, a higher fraction of water vapor from remote, southerly source regions caused more intense precipitation. The tracer transport analysis revealed that the atmospheric rivers were composed of a sequence of meridional excursions of water vapor, in close corre-spondence with the upper-level flow configuration. In cyclone cores, fast turnover of water vapor by evap-oration and condensation were identified, leading to a rapid assimilation of water from the underlying ocean surface. In the regions of long-range transport, water vapor tracers from the southernmidlatitudes and subtropics dominated over local contributions. By advection of water vapor along their trailing <b>cold</b> fronts <b>cyclones</b> were reinforcing the atmospheric rivers.

40|$|The eastern North Pacific Ocean has {{the highest}} density of {{tropical}} cyclone genesis events of any tropical basin in the world, {{and many of these}} systems form near land before moving westward. However, despite the level of tropical cyclone activity in this basin, and the proximity of the main genesis region to land, tropical cyclone behavior in the eastern North Pacific has been relatively unexplored. When synoptic conditions are favorable, moisture from northward-moving tropical cyclones can be advected into northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, often leading to the development of summertime thunderstorms during the North American monsoon season. An interaction with a mid-latitude trough produces the most rainfall, and the spatial variability of precipitation is greatly affected by the complex topography of the region. Moisture can be advected from a tropical cyclone around the subtropical ridge in place for much of the eastern North Pacific hurricane season and contribute to precipitation. This ridge, when it extends westward over the Pacific Ocean, can also prevent tropical cyclone moisture from impacting the southwestern United States. Northward-moving tropical cyclones often enter an environment with decreasing sea surface temperatures, increasing vertical wind shear, and meridional air temperature and moisture gradients. These key ingredients for extratropical transition are generally present in the eastern North Pacific, but the subtropical ridge prevents many named systems from moving northward, and only 9 % of eastern North Pacific tropical cyclones from 1970 to 2011 complete ET according to cyclone phase space.

However, previous work has demonstrated the existence of rare but intense subsynoptic-scale cyclones displaying remarkable similarities to tropical cyclones and polar lows, including, but not limited to, an eye-like feature in the satellite imagery. The terms polar low and tropical cyclone have been often used interchangeably when referring to small-scale, convective Mediterranean vortices and no definitive statement has been made so far on their nature, be it sub-tropical or polar. Moreover, most of the classifications of Mediterranean cyclones have neglected the small-scale convective vortices, focusing only on the larger-scale and far more common baroclinic cyclones. A classification of all Mediterranean cyclones based on operational global analyses is proposed The classification is based on normalized horizontal shear, vertical shear, scale, low versus mid-level vorticity, low-level temperature gradients, and sea surface temperatures. In the classification system there is a continuum of possible events, according to the increasing role of barotropic instability and decreasing role of baroclinic instability. One of the main results is that the Mediterranean tropical cyclone-like vortices and the Mediterranean polar lows appear to be different types of events, {{in spite of the}} apparent similarity of their satellite imagery. A consistent terminology is adopted, stating that tropical cyclone- like vortices are the less baroclinic of all, followed by polar lows, <b>cold</b> small-scale <b>cyclones</b> and finally baroclinic lee cyclones. This classification is based on all the cyclones which occurred in a four-year period (between 1996 and 1999).

An average Nusselt number correlation is proposed for heat transfer in a cyclone under constant wall temperature conditions, {{as a function of the}} inlet Reynolds number Rei (400 Rei 20 000), and for different values of the dimensionless geometrical parameters L* (0. 75 L* 2. 5). dc 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of cloud and precipitation properties across oceanic extratropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>cold</b> fronts is examined using {{four years of}} combined CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar retrievals. The global annual mean cloud and precipitation distributions show that low-level clouds are ubiquitous in the post frontal zone while higher-level cloud frequency and precipitation peak in the warm sector along the surface front. Increases in temperature and moisture within the cold front region are associated with larger high-level but lower mid-/low level cloud frequencies and precipitation decreases in the cold sector. This behavior seems {{to be related to}} a shift from stratiform to convective clouds and precipitation. Stronger ascent in the warm conveyor belt tends to enhance cloudiness and precipitation across the cold front. A strong temperature contrast between the warm and cold sectors also encourages greater post-cold-frontal cloud occurrence. While the seasonal contrasts in environmental temperature, moisture, and ascent strength are enough to explain most of the variations in cloud and precipitation across cold fronts in both hemispheres, they do not fully explain the differences between Northern and Southern Hemisphere cold fronts. These differences are better explained when the impact of the contrast in temperature across the cold front is also considered. In addition, these large-scale parameters do not explain the relatively large frequency in springtime post frontal precipitation...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} report on an eddy-feature {{phytoplankton}} bloom induced by a tropical cyclone (the spiral structure of the bloom was coincident {{with that of a}} cold eddy) in the South China Sea (SCS). Applying satellite data, this report can furnish fresh evidence {{of the relationship between the}} bloom and the <b>cold</b> eddy. Tropical <b>cyclone</b> Linfa passed over the northern SCS from 16 to 21 June 2009. While it looped over for 2 days (from 17 to 19 June), a cold eddy, which lasted for 11 days in the looping area, was observed on 18 June. Subsequently, an eddy-feature phytoplankton bloom (central location: 18 degrees N, 117. 5 degrees E) was detected on 22 June and it remained for 17 days. The character of both the cold eddy and the bloom was rotating counterclockwise, with two arms. High Ekman pumping velocity (> 4. 5 x 10 (- 4) m s(- 1)) was estimated during the passage of Linfa (from 17 to 19 June). The monthly climatology of the mixed layer depth was about 20 m in June, and the maximum Ekman layer depth was about 346 m after Linfa. The analysis indicated that Linfa may have induced the cold eddy, where it looped around. With upwelling and entrainment, the eddy potentially provided nutrients to the bloom in the surface water. The results suggested that the sea surface current changes that Linfa induced had caused the bloom in an eddy feature. Tropical cyclones appear frequently in the SCS, which may affect the activities of mesoscale eddies in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between springtime mid-latitude cyclones and background ozone (O 3) is explored {{using a combination}} of observational and reanalysis data sets. First, the {{relationship between}} surface O 3 observations at two rural monitoring sites on the west coast of Europe – Mace Head, Ireland and Monte Velho, Portugal – and cyclone track frequency in the surrounding regions is examined. Second, detailed case study examination of four individual mid-latitude cyclones and the influence of the associated frontal passage on surface O 3 is performed. Cyclone tracks have a greater influence on the O 3 measurements at the more northern coastal European station, Mace Head, located within the main North Atlantic (NA) storm track. In particular, when cyclones track north of 53 °[*]N, there is a significant relationship with high levels of surface O 3 (>[*] 75 th percentile). The further away a cyclone is from the NA storm track, the more likely it will be associated with both high and low (<[*] 25 th percentile) levels of O 3 at the observation site during the cyclone's life cycle. The results of the four case studies demonstrate a) the importance of the passage of a <b>cyclone's</b> <b>cold</b> front in relation to surface O 3 measurements, b) the ability of mid-latitude cyclones to bring down high levels of O 3 from the stratosphere and c) that accompanying surface high pressure systems and their associated transport pathways {{play an important role in}} the temporal variability of surface O 3. The main source of high O 3 to these two sites is from the stratosphere, either from direct injection into the cyclone or associated with aged airstreams from decaying downstream cyclones that can become entrained and descend toward the surface within new cyclones over the NA region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew {{atmospheric}} particles with diameters of 3 ? 10 nm and their subsequent growth to cloud condensation nucleus {{have been observed}} at various places in the European boundary layer. These events have been observed simultaneously within wide geographical areas (over 1000 km) in connection to specific weather systems, the <b>cold</b> air behind <b>cyclones.</b> Here we show that atmospheric aerosol formation (i. e. nucleation and initial growth) is favoured by the outbreak of cold Arctic air over northern Europe. Aerosol formation was about twice as common in Arctic air as in sub-Polar air, {{and even more so}} compared to other air masses. The most important general factor favouring aerosol formation in Arctic air and marine air was weaker competing condensational sink (CS) for the precursor gases (less pre-existing aerosols), while high CS prevented aerosol formation in heated sub-Polar air and mid-latitude air. High SO 2 levels favoured nucleation in continental air and high UV-B radiation in sub-tropical air. The critical factor that determined if aerosol formation would start on a day with Arctic air was the UV-B radiation. The same applied to sub-Polar air and continental air, while increased SO 2 concentration could trigger formation in heated sub-Polar and mid-latitude air, and reduced CS could cause formation in mid-latitude, marine or mixed/transient air. We speculate that strong emissions of volatile organic compounds from the Boreal forest and strong boundary layer dynamics may have caused aerosol formation in sub-Polar air masses and air in transition from a marine to a continental character. The monthly frequency of Arctic air masses and the probability for photo-chemically driven aerosol formation explains the observed annual cycle in monthly particle formation frequency as well as much of the inter annual variability. The same <b>cyclones</b> that transport <b>cold,</b> clean air from the Arctic to Europe will also transport warm polluted air in the other direction, which help cause the Arctic Haze phenomena. The cyclones have a key role for the atmospheric aerosol life cycle in mid to high latitudes. Due to the observed growth to the size of CCN in one to two days, there is a potential feed back from the effects on the CCN population and cloud albedo even within the same weather system, but also on the climatic time scale...|$|R
40|$|Central America and Mexico is {{a region}} that account for many World Heritage Sites. Among the climate hazards that affects this rich world {{heritage}} place {{of the world are}} the boreal winter cold fronts intrusions, also known as cold outbreaks or more locally as “Nortes”. During summer-autumn the region is affected by easterly waves and by the activity of two tropical cyclone regions, the Atlantic-Caribbean and the Eastern Tropical Pacific. For the study of regional impacts caused by these hazards are generally used public data bases like HURDAT or EMDAT, but these data bases have two major concerns for local impact studies. First, the methodologies used and the centers in charge to quantify them are sometimes different trough the history. For example, besides the satellite technologies use, the study of tropical cyclones in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, was in charge by centers located in San Francisco & Redwood City-California and finally in Coral Gables-Florida (National Hurricane Center until today) during the 1970 - 1980 decades. Second, some events are not consider relevant for regional or basin scale, but are very important for local purposes. An example of this was the low pressure system in May 2010 located in front of the Costa Rican pacific coast. These system developed later in Tropical Storm Agatha, but its major impacts in Costa Rica were associated with the first cyclone stages, e. g. low pressure and tropical depression. For the reasons mentioned above, this study review local information sources like national newspapers and bulletins produced by the National Weather Service, to account for relevant climate events and their associated impacts in Costa Rica. Cold fronts, easterly waves and tropical cyclones were considered as study objects from 1977 to 2011. It is state that this kind of study is very important to complement regional data bases and to avoid underestimation in the event-impact accounts. Impacts associated with <b>cold</b> fronts (tropical <b>cyclones)</b> were located mainly in the Costa Rican Caribbean (Pacific) slope while those associated with easterly waves have a more even spatial distribution trough the country. Finally, because of their nature, {{it is also important to}} develop these kind of works within a multidisciplinary team, that include researchers from climatology, history and geography fields.
