Some previous studies have suggested that corrective foundation can improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients with facial dermatoses; in particular, in patients with acne vulgaris or pigmentary disorders. Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of the skin conditions of patients with various skin diseases affecting their face (scars, acne, rosacea, melasma, vitiligo, hypo or hyperpigmentation, lentigines, etc) on their QOL and the improvement afforded by the use of <b>corrective</b> <b>makeup</b> for 1 month after being instructed on how to use it by a medical cosmetician during an initial medical consultation. Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with various skin diseases affecting the patients&rsquo; face were investigated. The patients were instructed by a cosmetician on how to use <b>corrective</b> <b>makeup</b> (complexion, eyes, and lips) and applied it for 1 month. The safety of the makeup application was evaluated and the QOL was assessed via a questionnaire (DLQI) and using a 10 -cm visual analog scale (VAS) completed before the first application and at the final visit. The amelioration of their appearance was documented by standardized photography. Results: No side effects occurred during the course of the study. A comparison of the standardized photographs taken at each visit showed the patients&rsquo; significant improvement in appearance due to the application of <b>corrective</b> <b>makeup.</b> The mean DLQI score dropped significantly from 9. 90 &plusmn; 0. 73 to 3. 49 &plusmn; 0. 40 (P &lt; 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that dermatologists should encourage patients with disfiguring dermatoses to utilize appropriate and safe makeup to improve their appearance and their QOL. <b>Corrective</b> <b>makeup</b> can also complement the treatment of face dermatological diseases in order to improve patient&rsquo;s adherence.
