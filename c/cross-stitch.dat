5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, <b>cross-stitch,</b> crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with <b>cross-stitch</b> and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
25|$|Art and Handwork is {{introduced}} with painting, drawing, knitting, and beeswax modeling. As students progress, more sophisticated painting and drawing {{is introduced}}, {{as well as}} carving, pottery, sculpture, <b>cross-stitch,</b> sewing, carpentry, and woodworking.|$|E

25|$|Embroidery {{and other}} {{decorative}} needlework are done {{by women and}} {{are one of the}} most common handcrafts done in the state. These have origins in the pre Hispanic period although various techniques have since been added. Embroidering of blouses and guanengos (Michoacan style huipils) can be done in openwork, straight stitching, <b>cross-stitch</b> and tucks. San Felipe de los Herreros is particularly noted for this work, as well as Zacán Tócuaro, Erongarícuaro, Tarecuato and Angahuan.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) and SERRV International were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in developing countries. The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from jute goods to <b>cross-stitch</b> work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than {{to indicate that}} a donation had been made.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in <b>cross-stitch.</b> Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white linen fabric embroidered with red silk thread. The headdress or smadeh worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{clothing}} and embroidery can be most easily {{found in the}} La Huasteca area, where elaborately decorated women's blouses can be seen, especially in the El Higo and Tlalixcoyan area. In Totonacalpan, men are still often seen in white shirts and pants with a bag to hold personal items. This dress {{dates back to the}} early colonial period and had not changed much since then. Other areas specialize in wool items such as Naranjos de Amatlán, Minatilán and the city of Veracruz where items such as dresses, skirts and jackets. These and other textils such as tablecloths and napkins are often decorated with <b>cross-stitch.</b> Leather items include shoes, jackets, bags, wallets, belts and boots and are usually made in the La Huasteca region, Teocolo, Citlaltépetl and Naolinco.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{dress for}} women {{consists}} of a skirt decorated with stripes and a cotton blouse with short sleeves and a square neckline which is embroidered in bright colors. This embroidery often has images of humans and animals done in <b>cross-stitch</b> or with beads. A poncho-like garment called a quezquémetl is worn over the blouse, which is usually white with a wide purple or red trim. If it is sunny, this garment is then usually folded to be worn on the head. Traditional dress for men consists of pants and a shirt in plain cotton with a white cotton belt, with a macramé fringe and bright colored embroidery. A heavier shirt in black or blue with white stripes may be worn over this along with an ixtle fiber bag and huarache sandals. A local type of basket which is still in use is called a tancolote, which has a frame of tree branches.|$|E
500|$|... from Bayt Jibrin, dated about 1900, in the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) {{collection}} in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The dress {{is made of}} handwoven indigo linen with long, pointed wing-sleeves. The qabbeh ("chest-piece") is embroidered with the qelayed pattern; the maya ("water") motif, el-ferraneh ("the bakers wife") pattern, and the saru ("cypress") motif. The side panels are also covered with <b>cross-stitch</b> embroidery {{in a variety of}} traditional patterns.|$|E

500|$|Mathematics and art {{have a long}} {{historical}} relationship. Artists {{have used}} mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made {{for the use of}} the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De Divina Proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on [...] perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of [...] tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesberg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, <b>cross-stitch,</b> crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jaali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.|$|E

50|$|A (needlework) sampler is a {{piece of}} {{embroidery}} or <b>cross-stitching</b> produced as a demonstration or a test of skill in needlework.

60|$|The {{sense that}} this was not the whole truth made her {{especially}} miserable; {{and all the rest of}} the evening was one misery of embarrassment, when her limbs did not seem to be her own, but as if somebody else was sitting at her little table, walking upstairs, and doing her work. Even Mrs. Umfraville's kind ways could not restore her; she only hung her head and mumbled when she was asked to show her work, and did not so much as know what was to become of her piece of <b>cross-stitch</b> when it was finished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, wait one minute, papa, till {{we get our}} work," [...] {{said the}} girls, who, to say the truth, always exhibit a {{flattering}} interest in anything their papa writes, and who have the good taste never to interrupt his readings with any conversations in an undertone on <b>cross-stitch</b> and floss-silks, as the manner of some is. Hence the little feminine bustle of arranging all these matters beforehand. Jane, or Jenny, as I call her in my good-natured moods, put on a fresh clear stick of hickory, of that species denominated shagbark, which is full of most charming slivers, burning with such a clear flame, and emitting such a delicious perfume in burning, that I would not change it with the millionaire who kept up his fire with cinnamon.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} <b>cross-stitching</b> [...] "guilds" [...] and groups across the United States and Europe which offer classes, {{collaborate}} on large projects, stitch for charity, and provide other ways for local cross-stitchers {{to get to}} know one another.

50|$|Aida cloth has a {{tendency}} to fray and often needs hemming before use. It should never be laundered prior to craft work and tends to contract when the finished item is washed in soap and water. Hand washing improves the appearance of finished <b>cross-stitching</b> because Aida cloth naturally contracts in specific areas where it is embroidered. It is good material.|$|R
40|$|There are two {{stitching}} {{methods used}} to repair and strengthen cracks or joints in concrete pave-ment. The first, and most common, is <b>cross-stitching.</b> <b>Cross-stitching</b> uses deformed tie bars epoxied or grouted into holes drilled at an angle through a crack. The second, slot-stitching, uses deformed tie bars grouted into slots cut across a joint or crack. Each technique is beneficial for certain circumstances. Recommendations on where to use these methods are outlined in this special report. Stitching is applicable {{for a number of}} situations where strengthening joints or cracks is required. Among these are: • Strengthening longitudinal cracks in slabs to prevent slab migration and maintain aggregate interlock • Mitigating omission of tie bars from longitudinal contraction joints due to construction error • Tying roadway lanes or shoulders that are separating and causing a maintenance problem • Tying centerline longitudinal joints which are starting to fault • Strengthening keyed joints for heavy loads (aircraft, gantry cranes, straddle carriers, etc. ...|$|R
6000|$|At length my {{task was}} ended, and the fair circle rained odours upon me, as they pelt beaux at the Carnival with sugar-plums, and drench them with scented spices.

[...] While the dear souls were thus smothering me with rose leaves, the merciless old lady carried them all off by a disquisition upon shawls, which she had the impudence to say, arose entirely out of my story. Miss Katie endeavoured {{to stop the flow}} of her eloquence in vain; she threw all other topics out of the field, and from the genuine Indian, she made a digression to the imitation shawls now made at Paisley, out of real Thibet wool, not to be known from the actual Country shawl, except by some inimitable <b>cross-stitch</b> in the border. [...] "It is well," [...] said the old lady, wrapping herself up in a rich Kashmire, [...] "that there is some way of knowing a thing that cost fifty guineas from an article that is sold for five; but I venture to say there are not one out of ten thousand that would understand the difference." ...|$|E
50|$|The double <b>cross-stitch,</b> {{also known}} as a Leviathan stitch or Smyrna cross stitch, {{combines}} a <b>cross-stitch</b> with an upright <b>cross-stitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{stitches}} which {{are related to}} <b>cross-stitch</b> and were used in similar ways in earlier times. The best known are Italian <b>cross-stitch,</b> Celtic Cross Stitch, Irish Cross Stitch, long-armed <b>cross-stitch,</b> Ukrainian <b>cross-stitch</b> and Montenegrin stitch. Italian <b>cross-stitch</b> and Montenegrin stitch are reversible, meaning the work looks the same on both sides. These styles have a slightly different look than ordinary <b>cross-stitch.</b> These more difficult stitches are rarely used in mainstream embroidery, {{but they are still}} used to recreate historical pieces of embroidery or by the creative and adventurous stitcher.|$|E
50|$|Stitching {{designs on}} other {{materials}} {{can be accomplished}} by using a Waste Canvas. This waste canvas is a temporary gridded canvas similar to regular canvas used for embroidery that is held together by a water-soluble glue, which is removed after completion of stitch design. Other crafters have taken to <b>cross-stitching</b> on all manner of gridded objects as well including old kitchen strainers or chain-link fences.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1980s, Whiten's work took a {{new course}} when she began making {{small-scale}} stitched works. The <b>cross-stitched</b> needlework's imagery was sourced from daily newspapers. The first series focussed on the male newsmakers of the world, specifically political leaders, represented in a traditionally female craft. The second series of needlepoint works again used images from media as sources, but of women. The women represented by the media are typically in groups, either mourning or protesting.|$|R
