Mineral soil measurements were restricted to the top 10 cm. Data were analyzed with both multivariate and univariate analyses of variance. Multivariate analyses were conducted with and without soil mesofauna or forest floor mesofauna, as data for those taxa were not collected on some sites. In multivariate analysis with soil mesofauna, the model giving the strongest separation among stand types (P = 0. 019) included abundance and richness of soil mesofauna and anaerobic mineralizable nitrogen. The best model with forest floor mesofauna (P = 0. 010) included anaerobic mineralizable nitrogen, soil moisture content, and richness of forest floor mesofauna. Old growth had the highest mean values for all variables, and in both models differed significantly from mature stands, while the latter did not differ. Old growth also averaged higher percent soil organic matter, and analysis including that variable was significant but {{not as strong as}} without it. Results of the multivariate analyses were mostly supported by univariate analyses, but there were some differences. In univariate analysis, the difference in percent soil organic matter between old growth and thinned mature was due to a single site in which the old growth had exceptionally high soil organic matter; without that site, percent soil organic matter did not differ between old growth and thinned mature, and a multivariate model containing soil organic matter was not statistically significant. In univariate analyses soil mesofauna had to be compared nonparametrically (because of heavy left-tails) and differed only in the Siskiyou Mountains, where they were most abundant and species rich in old growth forests. Species richness of mineral soil mesofauna correlated significantly (+) with percent soil organic matter and soil moisture, while richness of forest floor mesofauna correlated (+) with depth of the forest <b>floor.</b> <b>Composition</b> of forest <b>floor</b> and soil mesofauna suggest the two groups represent a single community.

For each case, minority students from {{two or more}} racial or ethnic identities composed at least 40 % of the floor's population. The study provides descriptions of diverse peer interactions and subsequent learning outcomes as described by residents. Characteristics and conditions which support or impede diverse peer interactions and impact learning are suggested. 	Anxious to make friends and seeking support to reach academic goals, first year students developed relationships with other residents {{in close proximity to}} them regardless of perceived differences before later branching out to form relationships outside of the floor. The strategies residents used to interact with diverse peers and included: 1) participating in neutral activities, 2) finding similarities, and 3) joking. By observing the living environments and actions of diverse others and by participating in neutral activity residents discovered hidden similarities. Residents in these diverse environments avoided serious conversations about race and ethnicity instead navigating diverse peer relationships by joking about differences. Prior diversity experiences, heightened emotions and desire for friends influenced students' initial comfort with diverse peer interaction, but over time students with and without prior diversity experience engaged in diverse peer interaction due to diverse <b>composition</b> of <b>floor</b> and expectations of sustained contact. By living in close or intimate quarters with others different from themselves, residents encountered simple cultural differences. Observations of similarities and simple differences stimulated questions and conversations. Curiosity, proximity and increased comfort allowed students to encounter new values and beliefs creating both confusion and excitement. Diverse peer observations and interactions facilitated a variety of desirable learning outcomes including increased openness to diversity, willingness to consider new ideas, reduction of prejudice and stereotyping, increased perspective taking, better listening and communication skills and an increased willingness to compromise and act with polite consideration of others.

30|$|Changes {{in forest}} <b>floor</b> <b>{{composition}}</b> and root composition will have long-lasting effects on soil C cycling in these systems, since roots and the litter layer are sources of {{soil organic matter}} inputs. The increasing loss of forest floor material with increasing burn severity is a commonly noted, important consequence of wildfire. Increases in the woody debris content of the forest floor in the severely burned plots {{may serve as a}} significant and continuing source of charcoal as the debris is degraded and incorporated into the soil (Schulze et al. 1999, Donato et al. 2009 a). Although differences in root abundance can only be commented on speculatively due to the high withintreatment variability, increases in fine root abundance concurrent with decreases in medium root abundance in burned soils may indicate a shift to early succession species (e.g., grasses, forbs), as found by Irvine et al. (2007) on another fire in Oregon, and thus in the amount of C contributed to soils from roots each year. This can ultimately lead to a change in the composition of the organic matter. Taken as a whole, data indicate that soils subjected to fire undergo significant changes in soil organic matter character, with changes increasing in magnitude with increasing burn intensity. These changes in soil organic matter characteristics cause fundamental changes in the soil organic C cycling in these systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} {{knowledge}} about the structure and composition of icy satellite interiors has been significantly extended by combining direct measurements from spacecraft, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. The existence of potentially habitable liquid water reservoirs on icy satellites is dependent on the radiogenic heating of the rock component, additional contributions such as the dissipation of tidal energy, the efficiency of heat transfer to the surface, and the presence of substances that deplete the freezing point of liquid water. This review summarizes the chemical evolution of subsurface liquid water oceans, taking into account a number of chemical processes occurring in aqueous environments and partly related to material exchange with the deep interior. Of interest are processes occurring at the transitions from the liquid water layer to the ice layers above and below, involving the possible formation of clathrate hydrates and high-pressure ices on large icy satellites. In contrast, water-rock exchange is important for the chemical evolution of the liquid water layer if the latter is in contact with ocean floor rock on small satellites. The <b>composition</b> of oceanic <b>floor</b> deposits depends on ambient physical conditions and ocean chemistry, and their evolutions through time. In turn, physical properties of the ocean floor affect the circulation of oceanic water and related thermal effects due to tidally-induced porous flow and aqueous alteration of ocean floor rock...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a current}} trend towards {{managing}} forests with multiple objectives, {{in particular to}} preserve or increase biodiversity and sustainability. There is renewed interest in understorey vegetation as a way both {{to increase the number}} of species and, indirectly, to favour fauna, including game, or improve soil quality. However, this stratum of herbaceous or shrubby species can also compete with young tree seedling and jeopardise tree regeneration. Hence a compromise has to be found among the different management objectives for the forest and in particular the understorey. Light is one of the main environmental factors controlling ecological and biological processes in forests. For example, light quantity and light quality control the success of seed germination and the establishment and growth of tree seedlings in the understorey. Light also promotes the development of the <b>floor</b> vegetation, the <b>composition</b> of which varies with site conditions in addition to light. Modifying light availability in the understorey, for example with thinning operations, thus interferes with tree regeneration and flora cover and composition. The understorey plants can intercept a significant fraction of the light and so the resulting amount of light available for tree seedlings varies greatly depending on species and <b>composition</b> of the <b>floor</b> vegetation. Light is successively intercepted and transmitted by the different strata composing the forest stand, i. e. overstorey trees, midstorey trees, shrubs and herbaceous species. The different strata interact, the development of each one being controlled by the others, often through modification of light availability. Foresters have to control this chain of light sharing to steer forest stands towards different objectives.

In terms of interior design, the resort spa spectrum is broad and ill-defined, with a marked lack of research specific to the architectural and interior design of this hospitality segment. The identification and evaluation of replicated design traits in resorts and spas will enable a better understanding and more successful application of these characteristics. In this regard, the influence of past resort and spa design decisions on contemporary design will be comprehensive and strengthen the continuum of hospitality design. The research model includes three approaches. The methodological approach is the development of a typology of published professional designs in resort and spa interiors. The theoretical approach draws from George Kubler?s study, The Shape of Time, which argues that there are reiterative historic design traits that span time and cross cultural boundaries. The critical approach makes contemporary interior design practices about resorts and spas a subject of study. Each research approach was addressed via the collection of photographic evidence, analysis of historical practices, survey of historic and contemporary trade magazines and literature, and site visits to both urban and resort spas. The culmination of this thesis research is the development of a series of Resort and Spa intypes (interior archetypes) for the on-going Intypes (Interior Archetypes) Research and Teaching Project, founded and directed by Professor Jan Jennings. The Intypes Project names contemporary design practices that have not been named and disseminates new knowledge through a web database ? www. intypes. cornell. edu.

40|$|Albedo and {{fraction}} of absorbed {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (FAPAR) determine the shortwave radiation balance and productivity of forests. Currently, the physical link between forest albedo and productivity is poorly understood, yet it is crucial for designing optimal forest management strategies for mitigating climate change. We investigated the relationships between boreal forest structure, albedo and FAPAR using a radiative transfer model called Forest Reflectance and Transmittance model FRT and extensive forest inventory data sets ranging from southern boreal forests to the northern tree line in Finland and Alaska (N  [*]=[*]  1086  plots). The forests in the study areas vary widely in structure, species composition, and human interference, from intensively managed in Finland to natural growth in Alaska. We show that FAPAR of tree canopies (FAPAR CAN) and albedo are tightly linked in boreal coniferous forests, but the relationship is weaker if the forest has broadleaved admixture, or if canopies have low leaf area and the <b>composition</b> of forest <b>floor</b> varies. Furthermore, the functional shape {{of the relationship between}} albedo and FAPAR CAN depends on the angular distribution of incoming solar irradiance. We also show that forest floor can contribute to over 50  % of albedo or total ecosystem FAPAR. Based on our simulations, forest albedos can vary notably across the biome. Because of larger proportions of broadleaved trees, the studied plots in Alaska had higher albedo (0. 141 – 0. 184) than those in Finland (0. 136 – 0. 171) even though the albedo of pure coniferous forests was lower in Alaska. Our results reveal that variation in solar angle will need to be accounted for when evaluating climate effects of forest management in different latitudes. Furthermore, increasing the proportion of broadleaved trees in coniferous forests is the most important means of maximizing albedo without compromising productivity: based on our findings the potential of controlling forest density (i. e., basal area) to increase albedo may be limited compared to the effect of favoring broadleaved species...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The goal of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the preferred <b>composition</b> of the <b>floor</b> on grade in residential buildings in the Belgian context from a life cycle environmental and financial perspective. In addition to the life cycle costs, the required investments were evaluated to take into account budget restrictions. The analysis of current available materials and techniques allows both the designer and building owner to extend their decision criteria from mainly investment cost to life cycle aspects as well. Methods In this study, the potential environmental impact was assessed by considering the environmental external cost of the floors. Several existing methods were combined to enable a full assessment, taking the ExternE methodology (willingness to pay) as the main base. The ecoinvent database was used to gather the inventory data but was adapted to increase the representativeness for Belgium. The financial evaluation included both the investment and life cycle aspects. The latter was analysed through the sum of the present values of all costs occurring during the life span of the floor. Results and discussion The necessary assumptions (e. g. transport, end-of-life treatment, cleaning, life span, economic parameters) and the adaptations to the ecoinvent data are transparently reported. The methodological steps (e. g. monetary valuation, transmission losses, equivalent degree days, Pareto optimisation) are elaborated in detail. This allows the results, which are graphically presented, to be correctly interpreted. The contribution of the life cycle stages and the optimisation potential of the considered impacts are discussed. Conclusions The environmental external cost based on the willingness to pay to reduce environmental impacts proved to be relatively low, representing about 9 % of the financial cost. The cost reduction of current common practice was estimated to be about 20 and 60 % from a financial and environmental perspective, respectively. The insulation level and the floor covering were identified as the most important optimisation parameters. Recommendations Internalisation of environmental external costs might be an important step to achieve more sustainable solutions. However, it is recommended to consider financial and environmental external costs separately too because both contain important information for the decision maker. Because it is hard (if not impossible) to increase the insulation level of the floor on grade later on in the life cycle of the building, a high insulation value should be a priority during construction. The floor covering can more easily be adapted and is thus considered a secondary priority. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Adoption of {{permanent}} cover crops and no-till systems is considered integral to achieving the California state {{air quality standards}} regulating airborne particulate matter, as indicated in Senate Bill 656. Imposition of such management techniques in a vineyard could create competition with vines for limited water resources. We evaluated the effects of cover crops that were either tilled or just mowed on vineyard <b>floor</b> <b>composition,</b> weed populations, vine water relations and growth, and fruit composition over three years within a mature commercial Merlot vineyard subjected to deficit irrigation in Lodi, San Joaquin Valley, California. The vineyard floor in this experiment supported resident vegetation that was tilled (standard grower practice), an oat cover crop, or a legume/oat cover crop. The two planted cover crops were either tilled or mowed (i. e., no-till). Biomass of cover crops, weeds, and legumes varied by year and treatment, but consistent effects among treatments were not observed. Weed species composition and cover segregated with {{the presence or absence}} of tillage rather than cover crop type and the weed species composition of the resident vegetation was distinct from those in the cover crop treatments. Some treatments, like 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill', 'Oats + NoTill', 'Oats/Legumes + Till', and 'Resident Vegetation + Till' reduced soil water content (circle minus(v)) in at least one of the three shallow soil layers spanning 0 to 30 cm, 30 to 60 cm, and 60 to 100 cm in 2008, and 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill' also dried the two upper layers in 2009, but these differences had no consistent influence on plant water status. Distinctions in circle minus(v) between years were attributed partly to the cessation of rainfall two months earlier in 2008 than in 2009, despite similar total annual quantities. Significant reductions in circle minus(v) imposed by the 'Oats/Legumes + NoTill' treatments reduced vine vegetative growth in two of three years, but these effects did not manifest in yield and fruit composition. Values for the Ravaz index for two of the three years indicate that the vineyard was overcropped for all treatments, but maximizing production in this region is a common practice. Weak competitive effects of the cover crops for water were likely associated with the use of a well-established mature vineyard and demonstrated that these management strategies could be employed to improve air quality to meet California air quality regulations with limited effects on vine water status and production.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 We have a poor {{understanding}} of the biotic communities in zero-order basins, drainages extending from ridgelines to the initiation of first-order streams. This study describes baseline plant and amphibian composition in unmanaged zero-order basins in the Oregon Coast Range. Specifically, I studied: i) the spatial distribution and diversity of species, including riparian-associates; and ii) the dominant environmental, spatial and geomorphic gradients in species composition The results of this research have implications for riparian management in steep, forested landscapes in the Pacific Northwest. The composition of tree and shrub layers in zero-order basins was more similar to upland areas than to larger-order riparian areas. Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar had highest basal areas; bigleaf maple had highest hardwood density. Convergent areas (areas collecting surface flow) had significantly lower relative densities than surrounding slopes. I identified 138 forest floor herb, shrub, and seedling tree species in zero-order basins. Gradient analysis and empirical modeling suggested that the <b>composition</b> of forest <b>floor</b> plant assemblages was associated with environmental parameters related to geomorphic position and overstory characteristics, such as distance from basin center, basin aspect and overstory relative density. Vegetation types, developed using classification, followed similar environmental patterns. Vegetation types were useful in clarifying environmental gradients acting on groups of plant species, and in delineating the lateral extent of geomorphic and fluvial influences. Riparian-associated vegetation types were mostly restricted to valley floors and lower slope areas. Geomorphic and lateral surfaces were drivers of environmental gradients in zero-order basins; plant species composition followed these geomorphic gradients. Surfaces close to basin center ("inner gorges"), including valley centers, splash zones, and lower slope areas, supported the highest plant species diversity and most distinct plant assemblages. The spatial distribution patterns of amphibian species and assemblages were characterized along longitudinal and lateral gradients, and relative to three geomorphic surfaces (valleys, headmost areas and slopes), and empirical species-habitat models were developed. I identified eight amphibian species in zero-order basins (865 total captures), and analyzed data for six. Headmost areas supported a distinctive upland amphibian assemblage, while valley floors had the highest riparian amphibian diversity. Captures of three riparian species were higher in valley surfaces, within S m {{of the center of}} zero-order basins, while captures of three upland species were highest in areas 2 - 5 m from center. Upland-associated species were captured two times farther from basin centers than riparian-associated species. The best predictors of amphibian captures in empirical models were geomorphic, stability/ disturbance, moisture and overstory parameters. Ordination and indicator species analysis facilitated characterization of amphibian species assemblages within geomorphic surface zones, and suggested spatial compression of habitats and species in zero-order basins, in comparison to broader spatial extents in larger basins. Plant and amphibian assemblages in unmanaged zero-order basins were most similar to each other in their lateral and geomorphic spatial patterning, including the importance of inner gorge areas for support of diverse communities. Plant species were strongly associated with geomorphic position parameters, while amphibians had stronger ties to discrete microhabitat elements such as moisture levels and large substrate. Amphibians appeared to have a more distinctive assemblage in headmost areas than plant species. Results suggest that assemblages of plants and amphibians in these basins are distinct from both larger-order riparian assemblages and from vegetation in surrounding hillslopes. Riparian management designs could take these spatial patterns and habitat associations into account to maintain the ecological integrity of headwater communities. The longitudinal and lateral extents of landscape areas managed to minimize risk to persistence of zero-order basin plant and amphibian assemblages would need to incorporate both fluvial and hillslope disturbance regimes, and microhabitat features associated with them...|$|R
40|$|The Platreef {{occurs at}} the base of the Northern Limb of the Bushveld Complex and is variably mineralised with PGE, Cu, and Ni. The Platreef varies in {{thickness}} from a few meters to a few hundred meters and rests on progressively older sediments of the Transvaal Supergroup and Archaean granite basement northwards. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of magmatic processes, contamination of the magma by footwall rocks and syn- and post metasomatic fluid activity on the observed mineralisation. Along the Platreef strike, the PGE grade profiles are generally top-loaded from Overysel to Tweefontein North and more variable and bottom loaded from Tweefontein Hill southwards emphasizing the importance of the change in mineralisation style at Tweefontein in relation to the whole Platreef. This study presents the first significant PGM data on the Tweefontein farm, including ten boreholes along strike, providing insight into the distinctly different PGE mineralisation styles observed. Samples were selected based on assay data, varying rock types, stratigraphic position and proximity to geological features. The selected samples were investigated using petrography, geochemistry and the automated SEM techniques of QEMSCAN and MLA. Over 9000 PGM were analysed forming one of the most comprehensive PGM studies on the Platreef to date. The lowermost footwall intersected along the Tweefontein strike is banded ironstone of the Penge Formation. This is overlain by a metasedimentary footwall package, of variable thickness, derived from the shales and dolomites of the Duitschland Formation. Iron-rich, recrystallised, noritic sills occur {{at the base of}} the Platreef and are thought to represent sills which intruded prior to the emplacement of the Platreef. A pre- and possibly syn-Bushveld structural control resulted in irregular floor topography defined by a topographic footwall high in the central Tweefontein area and topographic depressions at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill. The depression areas at Tweefontein are similar to the footwall basins at Turfspruit to the south, in which the Platreef is more lithologically complex compared to the footwall high areas. The footwall basins at Tweefontein and Turfspruit contain basal massive and submassive sulphides, which may not necessarily carry significant PGE grade. The Platreef lithologies at Tweefontein are composed of pyroxenites and norites with minor harzburgitic lithologies and contain numerous cross-cutting granitic veins. Xenoliths/interlayers of metamorphosed Duitschland lithologies occur primarily near the base of the Platreef, but also in the middle and upper Platreef sequence reflecting roof pendants. Unlike the Platreef on the farms adjacent to Tweefontein, the Platreef and footwall lithologies are relatively unaltered, but localised serpentinisation and chloritisation occur within harzburgitic lithologies and metasedimentary interlayers. Based on the stratigraphy and geochemical characteristics, the Platreef at Tweefontein can be subdivided into the upper and lower Platreef. The upper Platreef subdivision occurs in the top 20 - 40 m of the sequence and is defined by higher Mg#, Cr, Cr (ppm) /MgO and Pt/Pd values compared to the lower Platreef. In addition, the majority of the grade and base metal sulphide (BMS) content is enriched in the upper versus the lower Platreef, particularly for the northern and central parts of Tweefontein. The upper and lower Platreef may have been derived from different magma sources based on the “R Factor” concept proposed by Campbell and Naldrett in 1979 whereby the abundance of the PGE relative to the BMS content is linked to the proportion of magma with which the sulphide ore equilibrated (Naldrett, 2005 b). Previous detailed geochemical studies from Tweefontein Hill southwards highlighted compositional breaks in the Platreef sequence thought to represent distinct sill-like intrusions (Hutchinson and Kinnaird, 2005; Kinnaird, 2005; Manyeruke et al., 2005; Nyama et al., 2006). They reported a more primitive sill at the top of the Platreef, which correlates to the upper Platreef at Tweefontein. The lower Platreef is therefore likely to represent a different sill intrusion. A relatively homogenous pyroxenitic package characterises the upper Platreef, although a more heterogeneous package is observed close to and at Tweefontein Hill. At Tweefontein North, the base of the upper Platreef is often marked by a chromitiferous package comprising a pegmatoidal feldspathic pyroxenite unit, up to 6 m thick, capped by a chromitite layer. Due to similar stratigraphy and high PGE grades, this distinct horizon has been compared to the Merensky Reef found elsewhere in the Bushveld Complex. The predominant base metal sulphides (BMS) in the Platreef at Tweefontein are pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite with minor pyrite aligned with that found elsewhere along the Platreef strike. There is an increase in BMS content, primarily pyrrhotite, towards the base of the Platreef with massive and submassive sulphide development near the base and in the footwall, particularly at Tweefontein Hill. Sulphur isotopes and detailed mineralogical studies at Turfspruit have shown that the addition of S, As and Sb into the magma from the Duitschland footwall triggered the development of a PGE-poor sulphide liquid which was then able to mix, modify and dilute the magmatic sulphides (Hutchinson and McDonald, 2008). Due to the similarity in footwall between Turfspruit and Tweefontein, these proposed processes help to explain the increase in BMS towards the base and the development of basal massive and submassive sulphides, which are not necessarily associated with significant PGE grade. At Tweefontein North, the processes dominating the top-loaded PGE mineralisation were primarily magmatic. The PGM assemblage, hosted by base metal sulphides and magmatic silicates, is dominated by Pt-and Pd-bismuthides and -tellurides with minor PGE-sulphides and Pt-arsenides. PGE-sulphides occur in the Platreef where the chromitiferous horizon is developed, which may indicate an environment low in volatile activity and one of the most primary mineralisation styles along the Platreef strike. The footwall high, which separates the depressions at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill may have kept the Platreef at Tweefontein North relatively protected from additional processes affecting Tweefontein Hill. In contrast, assimilation of the Duitschland footwall is thought to play a key role in the development of the variable but predominantly bottom-loaded PGE mineralisation at Tweefontein Hill. The PGM assemblage is Pd-dominant characterised by Sb-, As- and Bi-bearing PGM, reflecting the incorporation of Sb, As and Bi from the Duitschland footwall. The association of the PGE mineralisation with the extensive basal sulphide development implies that the mineralisation at Tweefontein Hill probably occurred due to the gravitational settling of a sulphide liquid containing a mix of sedimentary and PGE-hosting magmatic components. Due to a significant PGM-BMS association in the mineralised footwall and metasedimentary interlayers/xenoliths, a downward migrating sulphide melt is believed to be the main mechanism responsible for the redistribution of PGE, predominantly Pd, into the mineralised metasedimentary lithologies. Finally, the Platreef and footwall lithologies may be locally modified by late-stage felsic and hydrothermal fluids to form bismuthide- and arsenide-dominant PGM assemblages, primarily hosted in quartz and serpentine respectively. This study shows the PGM and sulphide mineralisation at Tweefontein to be multifaceted, involving magmatic processes, assimilation of the Duitchland footwall into the Platreef magma and late-stage hydrothermal and felsic fluid activity. Footwall <b>composition</b> and irregular <b>floor</b> topography, resulting in depression areas at Tweefontein North and Tweefontein Hill, are believed to play a key role in what processes become significant along the Tweefontein strike. This research represents a significant contribution to the understanding of the distinctly different PGE mineralisation styles at Tweefontein and allows for a complete comparison of the Platreef PGE mineralisation from Overysel to Turfspruit...|$|R
