5|$|From {{the point}} of view of genetics, several {{different}} kinds of hybrid <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished.</b>|$|E
5|$|In North America, Phallus impudicus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} very similar P. hadriani by the latter's purplish-tinted volva.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the {{coloration}} {{pattern of}} the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E

5|$|Another {{lookalike}} {{species is}} Suillus subaureus, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (translucent) spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3µm), and an association with Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides).|$|E
5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E
5|$|Coyote tracks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from those}} of dogs by their more elongated, less rounded shape. Unlike dogs, the upper canines of coyotes extends past the mental foramina.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from A.praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between the cells in S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{procedure}} in conservation and restoration of metals is the cleaning process. This process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguish</b> between mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, ultrasonic, plasma and laser cleaning. In principle, it {{is aimed at}} removing dirt and corrosion products {{from the surface of}} a metal object. In many cases archaeology objects only <b>can</b> <b>be</b> cleaned mechanically.|$|R

5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution. L.scabrum is a widely distributed lookalike that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from L.holopus by its larger size and generally darker colors.|$|E
5|$|One {{conservation}} specialist welcomed {{this proposal}} {{as it would}} make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One geneticist was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> genetically.|$|E
5|$|The African species Roridomyces mauritianus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to R.austrororidus, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the brownish cap, and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 7–8 by 3.5–4.0μm), and its shorter (25–40μm), club-shaped basidia.|$|E

5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|The nelicourvi weaver <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from the}} related sakalava weaver, which has {{streaked}} plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet {{as the most}} obvious colour.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|Because of the xenon atom's large, {{flexible}} outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum {{changes in}} response to surrounding conditions {{and can be used}} to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances.
