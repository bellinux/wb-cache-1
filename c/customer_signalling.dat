40|$|Intra-system {{competition}} and {{innovation in the}} international videogame industry SUMMARY This paper analyses the international videogame industry, focusing on the efficiency and effectiveness of different forms of value chain organization chosen by video console manufacturers. <b>Customer</b> <b>signalling</b> necessities and innovation requirements of the product’s system architecture are investigated in this context. To undertake this analysis, {{the historical development of}} the international videogame industry, the competitors in this industry as well as competitive forces within it are first described and evaluated. Indirect network effects characterize competition in the videogame industry. Game developers, publishers and console manufacturers invest in system-specific assets of the product. From a transaction cost perspective it is efficient to minimise the resulting coordination and hold-up problems within a vertically integrated value chain organization. However, from a strategic perspective selecting an inefficient value chain organization can be advantageous, because in certain markets coordination disadvantages are smaller than the strategic competitive advantages achieved. Competition inside a product system can increase innovation activities inside the system and thus increase the attractiveness of the whole system by leading to better components and thus competitive advantage over other product systems...|$|E

40|$|G-networks (or queueingnetworks with {{negative}} <b>customers,</b> <b>signals,</b> triggers, etc.) {{are characterized by}} the following feature: {{in contrast with the}} normal positive customers, negative customers arriving to a non-empty queue remove an amount of work from the queue. In its simplest version, a negative customer deletes an ordinary positive customer according to some strategy. Extensions of the model result when a negative customer removes a random batch of customers, all the work from the queue or indeed a random amount of work that does not necessarily correspond to an integer number of positive customers. Since Gelenbe (E. Gelenbe, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 502 – 510; E. Gelenbe, Journal of Applied Probability 28 (1991) 656 – 663) introduced the notion of negative customers, there has been an increasing interest not only in queueingnetworks but also in the single server node case. Significant progress in the analysis of this versatile class of networks has enriched queueing theory as well as contributed to the development of real applications in fields such as computers, communications and manufacturing.

40|$|In many service systems, {{customers}} are not {{served in the}} order they arrive, {{but according to a}} priority scheme that ranks them with respect to their relative "importance. " However, it may not be an easy task to determine the importance level of customers, especially when decisions need to be made under limited information. A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions. We consider such a service system where {{customers are}} from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider; however, each <b>customer</b> provides a <b>signal,</b> which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each <b>customer's</b> <b>signal</b> equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of "good" signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized cμ rule perform well. priority queues, partially observable customer types, service differentiation, triage...|$|R

Large-scale batch processes {{can lead to}} an unresponsive and wasteful supply chain. This thesis explores supply chain design and operational improvements that can mitigate the effects large-scale batch steps have on the overall performance of the supply chain. Specifically, the thesis investigates: 1. The applicability of using <b>customer</b> demand <b>signals</b> to drive upstream production processes. 2. Methods for mitigating effects of long component lead times. 3. Reducing the disparity between scheduling and manufacturing lead times The thesis also describes various simulations created to explore the above issues. These simulations were key discovery tools in finding creative {{ways to reduce the}} large-scale batch process effects. The results, respectively, are: 1. The decision to use <b>customer</b> demand <b>signals</b> to drive upstream production processes depends on the operational characteristics of the production process. 2. Provided certain conditions exist, a method, the Second Look Process, can improve supply chain responsiveness in the face of long lead-times. 3. An organization must realize its processes can impose inefficiencies in its supply chain operations; it must {{take a look at these}} inefficiencies and balance them with the organizational costs of eliminating them. In light of the constraints large-scale batch processes place on supply chain design and operations, this thesis provides methods and conceptual frameworks within which real bottom-line cost savings can be realized. by James Ryan Horn.

50|$|According {{to study}} by Wirtz (1998), a {{guarantee}} can be introduced for many different operations/quality and marketing objectives. A company with poor quality {{may want to}} focus primarily on causes of existing quality gaps, whereas a firm with high quality standards but limited market presence and quality reputation may want to focus mainly on transforming potential customers into loyal ones.Additionally, the impact of an explicit guarantee on purchase intent was strong for the good quality provider, {{but there was no}} change in the purchase intent for the outstanding provider. There are two plausible reasons for this. First, purchase intent was already high for the outstanding provider; hence it might have been difficult to boost the ratings much further. Second, the outstanding provider might have already captured the high-end of the market, even when it did not offer an explicit guarantee. Thus, the impact of providing an explicit guarantee would be minimal and it would be difficult for, for example, a highly rated hotel to attract new <b>customers</b> by <b>signaling</b> higher quality.|$|R

40|$|Recognising the {{intention}} of others is important in all social interactions, especially in the service domain. Enabling a bartending robot to serve customers is particularly challenging as the system has to recognise the social <b>signals</b> produced by <b>customers</b> and respond appropriately. Detecting whether a customer would like to order {{is essential for the}} service encounter to succeed. This detection is particularly challenging in a noisy environment with multiple customers. Thus, a bartending robot {{has to be able to}} distinguish between customers intending to order, chatting with friends or just passing by. In order to study which <b>signals</b> <b>customers</b> use to initiate a service interaction in a bar, we recorded real-life customer-staff interactions in several German bars. These recordings were used to generate initial hypotheses about the <b>signals</b> <b>customers</b> produce when bidding for the attention of bar staff. Two experiments using snapshots and short video sequences then tested the validity of these hypothesised candidate signals. The results revealed that bar staff responded to a set of two non-verbal signals: first, customers position themselves directly at the bar counter and, secondly, they look at a member of staff. Both signals were necessary and, when occurring together, sufficient. The participants also showed a strong agreement about when these cues occurred in the videos. Finally, a signal detection analysis revealed that ignoring a potential order is deemed worse than erroneously inviting customers to order. We conclude that a) these two easily recognisable actions are sufficient for recognising {{the intention}} of customers to initiate a service interaction, but other actions such as gestures and speech were not necessary, and b) the use of reaction time experiments using natural materials is feasible and provides ecologically valid results...|$|R

The condition is {{highly correlated with}} customer satisfaction {{that needs to be}} managed by service stakeholders. One of the efforts is to evaluate their service quality that can be represented by measuring quality of video that they stream to the <b>customer.</b> Peak <b>Signal</b> to Noise (PSNR) is a dominant method to measure video quality that has been widely used. However, PSNR concept cannot be used for video that streamed over wireless and mobile network. It is due to occurrence of packet loss that is inherent in the network and results to frame loss. To overcome this shortcoming, this research proposes an algorithm called frame alignment algorithm to locate frame loss position and do measurement on pair of corresponding frames between frame in reference video and frame in streamed video. This research also enhances the first algorithm accuracy by inserting adjacent frame to the frame loss position, frame insertion algorithm. Simulation of video stream has been conducted to generate video test material, and the proposed algorithms are used to measure quality of the video test material. Performance of the the proposed algorithms are evaluated by benchmarking the experiment result towards the conventional PSNR and the equivalent method, Modified-PSNR (MPSNR) based on Pearson product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PMCC) value. Based on the result, frame alignment algorithm achieves 0. 85 in terms of PMCC value that overcomes inaccuracy of the conventional PSNR that only results 0. 77. Frame alignment algorithm also has better performance than MPSNR method that only reaches 0. 84. Besides, the investigation on frame insertion algorithm can also enhance accuracy with PMCC value of 0. 86. From this result, the proposed algorithms are potential to be used as an alternative method in measuring streamed video quality that still keeps simplicity of PSNR concept but with better accurac...|$|R

The thesis focuses on the implementation of a lean manufacturing system, modeled after the Toyota Production System, in the Kodak color film business. The goal of the system is to systematically eliminate all forms of waste from the production process in an attempt to reduce costs and inventory. This thesis approaches the problem from two different points of view. On the one hand, it takes a high level view of the entire supply chain and describes how material and information should flow through the supply chain. It highlights where inventory buffers should be located and which operations should be improved {{in order to reduce the}} size of these buffers. Finally, this thesis highlights the importance of leveling the <b>customer</b> demand <b>signal</b> in order to implement a true pull system using Kanbans. On the other hand, this thesis {{describes the}} implementation of lean manufacturing tools such as Kanban systems and Heijunka boards in some Kodak operations. This work includes the use of tools such as visual signals, cellular manufacturing, Kanbans, Heijunka boards, etc. The work performed over the internship sets the foundation for the transformation of the Kodak supply chain into a lean supply chain capable of dealing with uncertain demand.
