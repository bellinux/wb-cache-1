40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the physical structure of flax fibres on the mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) composites. Due to their composite-like structure, flax fibres have relatively weak lateral bonds which are in particular present in flax fibres that are often used in natural fibre mat reinforced thermoplastics (NMT). These weak bonds can be partly removed by combing the fibres. In order to study {{the influence of}} the physical structure of flax fibres on NMT tensile and flexural properties, uncombed and <b>combed</b> <b>flax</b> fibre reinforced PP composites were manufactured via a wet laid process. The influence of improved fibre-matrix adhesion was studied using maleic-anhydride grafted PP. Results indicated that the flax physical structure has a significant effect on flax-PP composite properties and that the flax fibre reinforced PP properties are similar to values predicted with existing micromechanical models. The tensile modulus of flax-PP composites can fairly compete with commercial glass mat reinforced thermoplastic (GMT) modulus, the strength, however, both tensile and flexural, can not. In order to rise the strength of flax fibre reinforced PP composites to the level of GMT strength, the flax fibres have to be further isolated to elementary flax fibres...|$|E

50|$|The term {{originates}} {{from the}} textile trade, where to heckle was to tease or <b>comb</b> out <b>flax</b> or hemp fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in Scotland, and specifically perhaps in {{early nineteenth century}} Dundee, a famously radical town where the hecklers who <b>combed</b> the <b>flax</b> had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, {{to the accompaniment of}} interruptions and furious debate.|$|R

Two kind of flax fiber as reinforcement was employed Latvian variety Vega- 2 and <b>flax</b> <b>combing.</b> The correlation between matrix composition, fiber origin, content and mechanical characteristics, water vapour absorption and biodegradability was established.

50|$|It {{appears that}} this was done in spite of great resistance, because in his legend, {{it is said that}} he was placed in a barrel filled with <b>flax</b> <b>combs</b> and rolled from the top to the bottom of a mountain. Nevertheless, this fact is not ascertained and he died at a great age on March 4, 480, in the arms of Saint Contest, Bishop of Bayeux, who {{happened}} to be in Seez at the time.|$|R
50|$|The shorter fibers {{that remain}} in the {{heckling}} <b>comb</b> after the <b>flax</b> has been <b>combed</b> are called tow. If the heckle is fine enough, the tow can be carded like wool and spun, otherwise it can be spun like the other flax fibers. Tow produces a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. While this yarn is not suitable for fine linens, {{it can be used}} for bagging, rough sheets, cords or ropes.|$|R

The <b>combing</b> manner of <b>flax</b> by two stages has been substantiated by theory. The design procedure of characteristics of construction and of operation mode of device has been developed. The separation manner of bolls from the flax stems by two stages and the device construction have been offered. The optimum characteristics and the operation modes of device under the diverse application conditions have been determined; the prototype of combine with new device has been developed and has been tested in the Mir Collective Farm, Yuriyevets District, Ivanovo RegionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

But Renzolla, who had been spoilt and petted in the fairy's house, and was quite unaware of the change {{that had taken place}} in her appearance, threw the flax out of the window and said: 'What is the king thinking of that he should give me this work to do? If he wants shirts he can buy them. It isn't even as if he had picked me out of the gutter, for he ought to remember that I brought him seven thousand golden guineas as my wedding portion, and that I am his wife and not his slave. He must be mad to treat me like this.' ...|$|R
50|$|The king's castle {{was across}} the way, and his three sons, Cecciariello, Grazuolo, and Tore, flirted with the three daughters. The older two seduced the older two, but Sapia Liccarda gave Tore the slip, and {{increased}} his desire for her. The older two became pregnant. They craved the king's bread, and Sapia Liccarda went to the king's castle to beg it, with a <b>flax</b> <b>comb</b> on her back. She got it, and when Tore tried to seize her, the comb scratched his hand. Then they craved pears, {{and she went to}} the royal garden to get them. Tore saw her and climbed a tree to get her the pears, but when he tried to climb down and seize her, she took away the ladder. Finally, the older sisters were delivered of their sons, and Sapia Liccarda went to the castle for the third time, to leave each baby in his father's bed, and a stone in Tore's. The older two were pleased to have such fine young sons, and Tore was jealous of them.|$|R
