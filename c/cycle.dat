The ovarian <b>cycle</b> consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine <b>cycle</b> consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E

Two-year cumulative birth rates were 58 %, 74 %, 89 %, 97 %, 93 % and 98 % and costs per couple were € 9518, € 7530, € 9711, € 9764, € 7651 and € 7684 for scenarios 1 - 6, respectively.

At {{this point in the}} dynamo <b>cycle,</b> buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities.

According to business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry, a country’s economy behaves differently during economic growth periods as compared to economic recession periods. The results achieved by business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry testing are far from unanimous: some are positive, others are negative. Business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry has major econometric implications: business <b>cycles</b> cannot be modeled using linear models. This paper aims to test business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry in Central and Eastern European Countries, where few business <b>cycles</b> analyses, and especially business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry researches, have been conducted. The industrial production index was considered when testing business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry. We estimated business <b>cycles</b> using the Hodrick-Prescott filter and Mills’ test of asymmetry.

The results of business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry testing are rather divergent: some support business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry while others contradict it. The {{existence of a}} possible business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry has major implications in economic stabilization policies modeling, forecasting and application. There are rather few studies on business <b>cycles</b> stylized facts in Romania and they fai l to tackle business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to test the possible business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry in several Romanian macroeconomic variables. We estimated the business <b>cycles</b> of the variables under survey using the Hodrick– Prescott filter, whereas for the tests conducted on the business <b>cycles</b> asymmetry recorded we preferred Sichel's (1993) methodology.
