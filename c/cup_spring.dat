60|$|The long {{level of}} wind-carved rocks under the cliffs, the ridges of the desert, the miles of slow ascent {{up to the}} rough divide, the gradual descent to the cedars--these {{stretches}} of his journey took the night hours and ended with the brightening gray in the east. Within a mile of Silver <b>Cup</b> <b>Spring</b> Hare dismounted, to tie folded pads of buckskin on Bolly's hoofs. When her feet were muffled, he cautiously advanced on the trail for the matter of a hundred rods or more; then sheered {{off to the right}} into the cedars. He led Bolly slowly, without rattling a stone or snapping a twig, and stopped every few paces to listen. There was no sound other than the wind in the cedars. Presently, with a gasp, he caught the dull gleam of a burned-out camp-fire. Then his movements became as guarded, as noiseless as those of a scouting Indian. The dawn broke over the red wall as he gained the trail beyond the spring.|$|E

After that he entered the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He went off at odds of 11-1 running against Champions such as, Breeders <b>cup</b> <b>Spring</b> winner Runhappy, and Santa Anita Derby winner Dortmund. At the start Tamarkuz was last. Quickly he moved up to seventh and than at {{three quarters of a}} mile Gun Runner took the lead and Tamarkuz was thrid.

40|$|This work {{describes}} deformation {{and crack}} formation in sawn timber of pine and spruce after first drying and subsequent cycles of resoaking {{in water and}} drying. The influence of annual ring orientation and the occurrence of juvenile wood was determined. In addition, the influence of compression wood, annual ring orientation {{at the edges of}} the cross section, the position of the board surface in relation to the pith, and the condition of the board surface i. e. whether wet or dry during resoaking were studied. When timber is exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying, warp, viz spring, bow, twist and cup, increases and is greater after the first cycle. The influence of annual ring orientation on spring, bow and twist depends on the type of deformation and on the kind of wood. Generally, the results indicated that timber with vertical and semi (half) vertical annual rings show less deformation (mean values) than plain sawn timber and timber containing pith. Cup is mainly caused by transverse anisotropy and is strongly influenced by the radius of the annual ring. Therefore, timber with vertical annual rings do not show any <b>cup.</b> <b>Spring,</b> twist and, especially bow are strongly influenced by compression wood. Large amount of compression wood in sawn timber increases such deformation. The distance between sawn timber in the log and the pith with surrounding juvenile wood is of vital significance for cracking. During moisture cycling, the amount of boards that develop cracks increased irrespective of their prior location in the cross section of the stem. Timber sawn from near the pith or distinctly containing pith has a higher relative crack length compared to timber sawn away from and lacking pith. In timber exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying the crack length increases irrespective of its prior location in the stem...|$|E
40|$|About {{half the}} total volume of sawlogs end up as sawn timber. The rest is lostdue to drying {{shrinkage}} or is turned into byproducts like wood chips, sawdustand shavings. As the raw material is a large expense for a sawmill, {{it is important to}} fully utilize the logs. The inherent properties of timber are such that warp, such as bow, <b>cup,</b> <b>spring</b> and twist, is inevitable, and extensive knowledge of whether and to what extent warp will appear is therefore important for managing the production. It is also important to develop strategies to handle warped timber, for example in the planing process. This thesis focuses on how twisted timber is affected by the planing process with regard to twist reduction, cross-sectional shape, planer misses and cutting depth. This was studied in three practical tests on sawn timber with differentapproaches. In one test, sawn pine timber with a large variation of twist withinthe group was planed with standard settings, and five evenly spaced crosssections {{along the length of the}} sawn timber were subjected to more detailed studies. In the second test, the main yield from spruce logs was planed. One sample board from each log was planed with the normal pressure settings of the planing mill, while the second sample was planed with a pressure either higher or lower than the normal settings. In this study, seven cross-sections were studied in more detail, three close to the top end, three close to the butt end, and one in the middle of the sawn timber. In the third test, sawn pine timber with a more moderate twist was planed with standard settings in another similar planer.
