40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{an argument about}} the constitutional transformation of international organizations through the judicial interpretation of their <b>constituent</b> <b>instruments.</b> The organizations at issue are public institutions, established by international agreement and charged with the exercise of transnational governmental power. They are, on one view, essentially treaty-based organizations that derive authority from {{the consent of the}} Parties. At the same time, these organizations must be understood as constitutional bodies, constituted with substantial delegated powers and varying degrees of independence vis-a-vis their constituent Member States. Some have developed the capacity to evolve over time, informally and autonomously. I argue that the judicial organs of certain organizations have transformed their material constitutions by engaging in particularly liberal approaches to the interpretation of their <b>constituent</b> <b>instruments.</b> The analysis focuses on one particular technique of interpretation: the doctrine of interpretation on basis of the subsequent practice of the States Parties. I trace the use of this doctrine by three judicial bodies: the World Trade Organization Appellate Body, the International Court of Justice (ICI), and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The first organ represents a control, implementing a strict approach to subsequent practice. By contrast, I suggest that the ICJ and ECtHR have each adopted radically expansive approaches to subsequent practice, with the effect of transforming the powers and autonomy of the organizations to which they belong...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the so-called "rules of the organization" in the draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIO), adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC) on first reading. While the rules of the organization occupy a central place in the DARIO, the ILC has decided not to take a "clear-cut view" on their legal nature as either international law or internal law of the organization. This paper argues that the ILC’s indecision has left the DARIO with a fluctuating scope of application concerning various provisions such as the attribution of conduct, the breach of an international obligation, the obligation to make reparation, and countermeasures against an international organization. Since the rules of the organization are a term of art that was developed by the ILC in its work on the law of treaties and has rarely been addressed in legal scholarship, Part 1 examines the legal nature of the different components of the rules of the organization: the <b>constituent</b> <b>instruments,</b> the acts, and the established practice of the organization. While the <b>constituent</b> <b>instruments</b> are contracts between States at the moment of the creation of an international organization, they operate as constitutions during the life of the organization, giving it the autonomy to create internal law in force between the subjects of its legal order, including its member States. Part 2 therefore suggests to reconceive the rules of the organization as "internal law" of the organization as long as the organization functions effectively so as to appropriately reflect an international organization’s constitutional autonomy for purposes of international responsibility...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{has recently}} found support from and apparently influenced the International Court of Justice itself. On 20 April 2010 the Court delivered its Judgment in the Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case between Argentina and Uruguay, {{in which it}} appears to follow a recommendation made in the book concerning expert evidence, and several individual Judges draw support from the conclusions of study in their Declarations, Separate and Dissenting Opinions, quoting from the book as well as citing argument and using research in it to shape their opinions. The initiative taken by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law {{to carry out a}} thorough study of the rules of evidence in international courts and tribunals will place international lawyers deeply in their debt. There can be hardly any field of international legal practice presenting no possibility of presentation of a claim, at some stage and in some circumstances, to an international court or tribunal, so that consideration of procedural issues, and in particular what facts must be proved, and how they are to be proved, may come to have almost as great an importance for the practitioner as consideration {{of the state of the}} substantive law. The proliferation of such tribunals in recent years, each with its own nature, its own <b>constituent</b> <b>instrument,</b> and its growing body of practice, also necessitates the focusing of attention on the underlying principles. The study will be an excellent starting-point, in view of the thoroughness with which the relevant material has been assembled, and set against an analytical assessment in relation to those principles. Professor Hugh Thirlway, Former First Legal Secretary of the International Court of JusticeSome recent contentious issues about the use of evidence in cases before the International Court of Justice have highlighted the importance of fact-finding and the use of evidence before this Court. This major study by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law on the issue of evidence before the International Court of Justice has examined all aspects of the Court's relationship with facts in detail, in both contentious and advisory proceedings, from the recently refined procedure for submitting late evidence, to the hearing of live witness testimony in the Peace Palace. Considerations of flexibility and respect for the sovereignty of the State Parties before it have traditionally deterred the Court from constructing concrete rules on matters of evidence, but the increasing numbers of cases in which a thorough consideration of the facts has been essential has highlighted that some detailed procedural guidance is necessary in order to ensure a well-functioning system of adjudication. It is apparent that the Court has paid an incerasing amount of attention to its evidentiary proceedings as a result, often encountering difficulties in the inherent tensions between the common and civil law traditions and thus a divergence of opinions on the Bench. This book examines the history and development of the treatment of evidence since the early days of the PCIJ up to the recent Nicaragua v Honduras judgment, critically analysing the Statute and Rules of the Court, dicta from judgments and separate and dissenting opinions, the newly developed Practice Directions and academic writings on the subject. It aims not only to provide an academic discussion of the subject, but also to act as a guide to practitioners appearing before the Court.

40|$|The ICJ {{proceedings}} in {{the case}} concerning 2 ̆ 7 legality of the use by a state of nuclear weapons in armed conflict 2 ̆ 7 are indicative of the sharp differences of view held by different states as to the proper role and function of international organizations. On the one hand there were some states, which proposed the view that {{organizations such as the}} WHO are established solely to fulfill those tasks which have been expressly spelled out in their <b>constituent</b> <b>instruments,</b> subject to construction of any implied powers which are absolutely necessary for achieving those objectives. In this context, and particularly with respect to the organizations of the United Nations system, reference was largely made to the origins of their creation and to 2 ̆ 7 functionalist theory 2 ̆ 7. This approach stressed the need for an appropriate division of responsibilities between the United Nations organization, on the one hand, and the UN specialized agencies, on the other. It would leave powers of general scope to former and specialized sectoral powers to the latter. This view was supplemented by the belief that questions with strong political flavor should not be dealt with by the specialized agencies at all. The alternative view did not deny the need for an appropriate division of responsibilities among the various international organizations. Rather, it suggested that today 2 ̆ 7 s issues are increasingly complex and will often cut across the institutional competencies envisaged in the 1940 s and 1950 s. According to this approach, international organizations can use different and often more wide-ranging tools and techniques to achieve their general objectives. This implies an expanded view of their roles and activities. The two approaches can be compared. The first takes a 2 ̆ 7 restrictive approach 2 ̆ 7 to recourse to international law as an instrument of policy development. Some states considered that Article 2 of the WHO Constitution does not allow resort to the development of international law as a way to achieve WHO objectives. The International Court endorsed this view. The second approach indicates a more 2 ̆ 7 purposive function 2 ̆ 7 when the organization becomes an actor in its own right, determining for itself the scope of its competence {{and the extent to which}} it may resort to tools, which have not been granted to it in express terms at its inception. In the case in question, in application of the principle of 2 ̆ 7 specialty 2 ̆ 7, the Court declined to accede to the WHO request. Some of the international jurists consider this conclusion to be backward step in the development of the law of international organizations, while others consider that the Court acted correctly. Perhaps the ICJ 2 ̆ 7 s rebuff to the WHO can be best understood in the context of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision to accede to the request from the General Assembly. Since the General Assembly had submitted a similar request, the ICJ could reject the WHO request without losing an opportunity to address the substantive issue of the legality of nuclear weapons. In effect, this two-track request enabled the ICJ to be legally exact and politically pragmatic at the same time...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) is a microanalytical {{technique that}} requires {{only a few}} nanograms of analyte to obtain characteristic information on the structure and molecular weight of the analyte. The technique ionizes molecules and breaks them apart into characteristic fragments (the fragmentation pattern constitutes its “mass spectrum”). The mass spectrometer requires that samples be introduced in the gaseous state. Sample introduction into the mass spectrometer can be by direct air/gas sampling, a direct insertion probe, membrane inlets, effluent from a gas chromatograph (GC), effluent from a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis, and effluent from pyrolysis devices. Several examples of detection equipment utilizing mass spectrometry are discussed below. The Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometer (PY-GC-IMS) combusts, or pyrolyzes, the biological particles. The biological pyrolysis products are then separated using gas chromatography. Once separated, the individual pyrolysis products are introduced into an ion mobility spectrometer for analysis. This technology is still quite new and was developed in a collaborative effort between Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) and the University of Utah. The Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI−TOF−MS) is a variation of mass spectrometry that attempts to use a more gentle method of ionizing the suspect biological agent than pyrolysis to allow identification of the agent rather than just broad characterization.

The effect of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on tracer distributions in the upper half of the stratosphere was seen in a spectacular 'staircase' pattern, predominantly in the winter hemisphere, revealing the latitudinally asymmetric nature of QBO transport due to induced mean meridional circulations and modulation of lateral mixing associated with planetary Rossby waves. The propagation of Rossby waves across the equator in the westerly phase of the QBO was seen in tracer fields and corroborating United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) analyses; a modeling study of the effect of these waves on typical QBO wind profiles was performed.

MAESTRO is the UV-visible-near-infrared dual grating spectrometer component of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) scientific payload, and was launched in Au-gust 2003 on the SciSat satellite to investigate atmospheric processes affecting the strato-spheric ozone distribution. On-orbit measurements of pressure and temperature are de-sirable for accurate retrievals of other atmospheric <b>constituents</b> from the <b>instrument,</b> and as independent data products. The constant mixing ratio of molecular oxygen is ex-ploited in these retrievals to derive atmospheric density profiles from oxygen absorption, and the density profiles are then converted to pressure and temperature using hydrostatic balance and the ideal gas law. A highly accurate fast forward model is developed using a fast-line-by-line approach for modelling the high spectral resolution oxygen absorption lines, and a correlated-k technique is used to calculate analytic weighting functions for the retrieval of density. A global fitting algorithm is developed to simultaneously fit all spectra from one occultation. Retrieval characterization shows a small amount of information is added by the inclusion ii of the weaker B band to a retrieval using the strong A band absorption, and tests with real data show the B band retrievals alone are less sensitive to instrument characterization uncertainties and perform better than A band retrievals at altitudes below 30 km.

40|$|Purpose – Bringing {{together}} diverse {{areas of}} a university means having to work with several different methods and frameworks for measuring and assuring quality and identifying key performance indicators. The Business and Strategic Planning area of Library and Student Support at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) {{has been involved in}} such a case study, and this paper aims to present the findings of this work, which may be of interest to performance measurement practitioners. Design/methodology/approach – This paper applies a case study approach, in that the background of the institution and change management programme will be clearly presented in order that the subsequent overview of the performance management work can be placed into context. The newly‐formed department already had several quality assurance and user satisfaction measurement instruments which were being used within the constituent parts of the service area (i. e. LibQUAL, SCONUL benchmarking exercises, Matrix assessment, enrolment surveys) as well as the results of the annual National Student Survey. The work in question has allowed for an investigation into how to establish a framework for inputting measurement and key performance data from all of these instruments and being able to respond to them as a single department. Having consulted some of the university's external corporate partners (namely Shop Direct and Merseytravel), the resulting framework now incorporates embedding departmental values and behaviours, and identifying particular moments of truth within the student lifecycle, where Library and Student Support has a particular impact on the student experience. By identifying these “moments of truth” the department is better placed to measure its impact and subsequently assure quality. The paper will present the experience of Library and Student Support in their efforts to find a single framework, made up of <b>constituent</b> methods and <b>instruments,</b> by which it can measure and assure quality. Findings – The findings of the paper bring together the method outlined above and allow for the dissemination of the first year's work of the Library and Student Support Quality Assurance Framework. At the time of writing, this is a work in progress, as the first year's data, analysis and resulting quality actions and responses are for the academic year 2010 ‐ 2011.
