The duties owed by and the privileges granted to feudal barons <b>cannot</b> now <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>exactly,</b> but they involved the duty of providing soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and the privilege of attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of parliament.|$|R
50|$|Goods wagons of welded {{construction}} (Güterwagen der geschweißter Bauart) {{were developed}} and {{built by the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn in Germany from 1933 to about 1945. With the introduction of welding technology in 1933 almost all wagon components were joined by welding and no longer by rivetting. This enabled goods wagons to be designed, for example, for higher speeds or for higher payloads {{through the use of}} different types of steel and other engineering changes, but their further development was so heavily influenced by the exigencies of the Second World War that, as early as 1939, the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to temper the design of goods wagons to the new economic circumstances. Because there were overlaps in the change from the Austauschbauart - goods wagons made with interchangeable components - to the new welded classes, the period of the changeover <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>defined.</b> Several standard goods wagons and their classes are covered in other articles. Goods wagons built during the Second World War that were purely intended for military transport use, are covered under the article on Kriegsbauart - wartime classes.|$|E

Intraperitoneal carboplatin and interferon alpha have been separately evaluated in ovarian cancer "with promising results". We report a phase I-II pilot trial of intraperitoneal carboplatin 400 mg/sqm plus interferon alpha 25 x 10 (6) U q 28 d in 16 patients (pts) previously treated with intravenous cisplatin based chemotherapy. All the patients had relapsed (11 pts) or refractory (5 pts) disease; residual tumors were less than 2 cm in 10 pts and greater than 2 cm in 6 pts. Local and general toxicities were moderate, with neither WHO grade 4, nor neurotoxicity and ototoxicity. Myelotoxicity was the most frequent side effect. Among 14 evaluable pts, objective responses were observed in 6 pts (42. 8 %) including 3 pts with pathologically confirmed complete response (21. 4 %); six more pts presented prolonged disease-free survival. Response occurred in both categories of pts with greater than or less than 2 cm residual disease, also in pts refractory to prior intravenous cisplatin.

This definition shows {{that the notion of}} ageing touches all people of all ages, but the signs of ageing are more visible with old people. This chapter also deals with the question when a man becomes old. The beginning of the senior age <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>exactly</b> though there <b>are</b> various theories and classifications. The growth of the senior population appeals to the society and health, social and pastoral work that they should deal with the issue and provide seniors with sufficient care and support. The theology of ageing in the second chapter is based primarily on the Bible, which often refers to ageing. Old people have special privileges as well as tasks here. The chapter also deals with the theology of John Paul II. This theology is based primarily on the Letter to the Elderly, in which the former Pope addresses all older people ecumenically, and encourages {{them to be able to}} go through their old age in association with the God and other people in the spirit of the Gospel. In this mission, it is important that a senior creates the correct idea of the God. The old age is not a disease, but it brings diseases. This information, among others, is [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The English feudal barony, or [...] "barony by tenure", now has {{no legal}} existence. It {{was the highest}} form of feudal land tenure, namely per baroniam (Latin for [...] "by barony") under which the {{land-holder}} owed the now little understood service of [...] "being one of the king's barons". It must be distinguished from the lesser barony, also feudal, which existed within a county palatine, such as the barony of Halton within the Palatinate of Chester. Such barons were merely tenants-in-chief of a prince, whose own overlord was the king. The duties and privileges owed by feudal barons <b>cannot</b> now <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>exactly</b> but the main duty certainly was the provision of soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and a further duty, which involved considerable expense and travel, clearly also a privilege, was the attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of Parliament. The principal benefit clearly was the revenue generated from rents and production within the demesne lands of the barony, and also the personal power and prestige derived from the feudal service of the tenants, {{the highest level of}} whom, lords of their own manors, became knights in the baron's retinue. The estate-in-land held by barony if containing a significant castle as its caput and if especially large, that is to say consisting of more than about 20 knight's fees (each loosely equivalent to a manor), was termed an [...] "honour". Constituent manors of a barony were mostly subinfeudated by the baron to his own knights or followers, with a few retained tenantless as his demesne. Most English Feudal Barons were converted to baronies of writ or peerage according to the Abolition Act of 1660. The baronies not converted became baronies of free socage, a dignity title.|$|R
40|$|Recently, we have {{described}} a monoclonal antibody, named MS- 1, which identifies a novel high-molecular-weight protein expressed by noncontinuous, sinusoidal endothelia and by interstitial dendritic cells in certain normal human organs (S Goerdt, LJ Walsh, GF Murphy, JS Pober, J Cell Biol 1991, 113 : 1425 - 1437; and LJ Walsh, S Goerdt, JS Pober, H Sueki, GF Murphy, Lab Invest 1991, 65 : 732 - 741). In this report, we demonstrate in studying {{a variety of}} skin lesions that MS- 1 antigen can also be expressed by endothelia of continuous origin under certain pathological conditions. Among the skin lesions tested, MS- 1 antigen expression by endothelial cells of continuous origin is frequently observed in wound healing tissue, in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, in psoriasis, and in melanoma metastasis, ie, in 100 %, 80 %, 71 %, and 71 % of cases, respectively. In contrast, endothelial MS- 1 antigen expression rarely occurred in other skin lesions, including vascular tumors, six of which were Kaposi's sarcomas (13 % and 0 % of cases with vascular MS- 1 expression, respectively). The percentage of cases with MS- 1 + vessels is only marginally different in malignant versus benign lesions (55 % versus 31 %); when melanocytic nevi, primary melanomas, and melanoma metastases are compared, however, {{an increase in the}} percentage of cases with MS- 1 + vessels is seen (31 %, 50 %, and 71 %, respectively). Apart from wound healing, the relative number of MS- 1 + vessels in a given lesion amounts to less than 5 % compared with the number of continuous type vessels stained by monoclonal antibody 1 F 10 (S Goerdt, F Steckel, K Schulze-Osthoff, H-H Hagemeier, E Macher, C Sorg, Exp Cell Biol 1989, 57 : 185 - 192). In addition, the occurrence of MS- 1 + vessels is not related to the overall vascularity of a given lesion. Thus, the conditions for MS- 1 antigen expression by endothelia of continuous origin <b>cannot</b> as yet <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>defined.</b> Furthermore, we have noticed that the number of MS- 1 + dendritic cells varies considerably in skin lesions; in the early patch lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma and in juvenile xanthogranuloma MS- 1 + cells even constitute the major cell type. This prompted us to investigate MS- 1 antigen expression and its regulation in cultured human monocytes/macrophages. Expression of MS- 1 antigen by these cells regularly starts at day 3 of culture and reaches its maximal value at day 9, after which it declines. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
