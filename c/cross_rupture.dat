40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{application}} of a simplified analysis procedure as implemented in version 16 of CSiBridgeTM for design of bridges <b>crossing</b> earthquake fault <b>ruptures.</b> The fault-rupture response spectrum analysis (FR-RSA) approximation method has been proved adequate for both straight and curved ordinary bridges, but lacked a comfortable interface to accommodate the method users. Computers and Structure, Inc. has implemented the FR-RSA procedure into CSiBridgeTM, a user-friendly integrated 3 -D bridge design software, as an added seismic design feature. By combining the response of the bridge due to the quasi-static displacement from the fault strike-slip rupture and the pseudo-dynamic displacement from the earthquake response spectrum analysis, a combined seismic demand is approximated using the software. The CSiBridgeTM bridge model creation process and application of FR-RSA as the Caltrans Fault Crossing Seismic Design Request is explained and evaluated in this thesis. In order to validate the implementation of FR-RSA in CSiBridgeTM v. 16, the bridge demands for a three span and a four span curved bridge <b>crossing</b> earthquake fault <b>rupture</b> zones from the analytical models developed in Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) and CSiBridgeTM v. 16 are compared and discussed. It was found that the displacement demands from the abutments and bents were comparable from the two programs, supporting the correct application of the approximation method. This thesis also presents recommendations for improving the analysis function of CSiBridgeTM v. 16 for bridges <b>crossing</b> fault <b>ruptures...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{wide-angle}} seismic surveys {{has been carried}} out in recent years of the entire Nankai seismogenic zone under the working hypothesis, "structure of subducted plate might control segmentation of rupture zones". In this paper we summarize the key results of these surveys. Along a profile <b>crossing</b> the <b>rupture</b> zone of the 1946 Nankaido earthquake we successfully imaged a large-scale subducted seamount, which is 50 km wide and 3 km high. The seamount is interpreted to be one member of the Kinan seamount chain, which is recognized on the incoming plate. Comparing the location of the subducted seamount and a detailed rupture distribution of the 1946 event shows that the rupture starting off Cape Shiono turned around the landward foot of the seamount. Another structure preventing rupture propagation was also found along a profile looking at {{the eastern edge of the}} 1944 Tonankai earthquake. High-resolution wide-angle seismic data clearly imaged two lines of subducted ridges, which are interpreted to be a subducted ridge parallel to the present day ridge system on the incoming plate. One of the subducted ridges is situated immediately outside the rupture zone where GPS data indicate strong coupling at present. We propose, from these results, that a subducted convex, which underlays a back stop structure, played the role of a barrier preventing earthquake rupture propagation...|$|R
30|$|This is {{the first}} report from the JAGUARS (JApanese-German Underground Acoustic Emission Research in South Africa) project, the overall aim {{of which is to}} observe ultra-small {{fracturing}} in a more or less natural environment. We installed a local (∼ 40 -m span) network of eight acoustic emission (AE) sensors, which have the capability to observe up to 200 kHz at a depth of 3.3 km in a South African gold mine. Our specific objective was to monitor a 30 -m thick dyke that remains as a dip pillar against active mining ∼ 90 m above our network. An Mw 1.9 earthquake whose hypocenter was ∼ 30 m above the network occurred in the dyke. Although the mineowned geophone (4.5 Hz) network detected only five earthquakes in the surrounding 200 × 200 × 150 -m 3 volume within the first 150 h following the main shock, our AE network detected more than 20, 000 earthquakes in the same period. More than 13, 000 of these formed a distinct planar cluster (∼ 100 × 80 m 2) on which the main shock hypocenter lay, suggesting that this cluster delineates the main shock rupture plane. Most of the aftershocks were presumably very small, probably as low as M ∼ − 4. The aftershock cluster dipped ∼ 60 °. This is consistent with normal faulting under a nearly vertical compression field, as indicated by nearly horizontal breakouts found in a borehole <b>crossing</b> the <b>rupture</b> plane.|$|R

30|$|Magnetotelluric (MT) {{surveys were}} carried out along some {{profiles}} <b>crossing</b> the fault <b>rupture</b> zone associated with the İzmit earthquake which took place on 17 August 1999 {{in the western part}} of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ). In this paper, we focus on the western part of the fault rupture zone where two different groups of seismicity followed the İzmit earthquake. One group was seen along a narrow belt and corresponds to aftershocks occurring along the fault rupture zone. The other was seen in a circular region and represents a swarm activity, presumably triggered by the occurrence of the İzmit earthquake. Two-dimensional inversion was performed for the MT data acquired along two profiles; one crosses the western end of the fault rupture zone and the other is located in the west of the swarm activity area. In the former case, aftershocks tended to occur in a resistive zone underlain by a moderately conductive zone, as was the case for the hypocenter area. In the latter case, the swarm activity tends to be confined in a conductive zone below a highly resistive zone. This activity is likely to be triggered through pore-pressure changes associated with the İzmit earthquake.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{interpretation}} of coseismic surface deformation measurements through inversion techniques is of major importance {{to understand the}} mechanical behaviour of a seismic fault. Dense geodetic data sets {{in the vicinity of}} the ruptured fault provide unique constraints on detailed fault geometry and slip distribution at depth, making them complementary to seismological data. Bam earthquake (Mw 6. 6, 2003 December 26) induced surface deformation has been precisely mapped by Envisat ASAR interferometry and by subpixel correlation techniques applied to Spot- 5 and ASAR amplitude images. These oblique and horizontal estimations of deformation have been completed with one levelling profile along the main road <b>crossing</b> the <b>rupture</b> from west to east. We process these data (separately and jointly) in a two-step inversion technique, within the elastic half-space theory framework. Our objective is to determine the dislocation model at depth that satisfies simultaneously all the geodetic constraints. Also, we estimate the relative contribution of each geodetic data set to this inversion process. We first use a stochastic direct approach called neighbourhood algorithm in order to estimate the average characteristics of the rupture, and their relative uncertainty. Constraining in this way the geometry of the ruptured fault, we then linearize the inverse problem and compute the slip distribution on the fault using a standard weighted least-square technique, assuming the solution is smooth to some degree. At each step, we discuss the optimal models, their stability as well as the relative influence of each data set on the derived models parameters. Our preferred model reveals a shallow dislocation on a quasi-vertical fault, slightly dipping towards east. The slip vector has a strike-slip component as high as 2 m, while the dip-slip component seems negligible. However, the estimation of the resolution matrices emphasizes the fact that the details of deep fault slip distribution remain out of the scope of this ill-conditioned inverse problem. Yet, our preferred model suggests a main dislocation limited at depth between 1 and 6 km. By contrast, the aftershocks observed in the months following the earthquake are located just beneath the estimated main shock...|$|R
40|$|Observations after {{earthquakes}} where surface fault <b>ruptures</b> <b>crossed</b> engineering facilities {{reveal that}} some structures survived the rupture almost unscathed. In some cases, the rupture path appears to divert, ""avoiding"" the structure. Such observations {{point to an}} interaction between the propagating rupture, the soil, and the foundation. This paper (i) develops a two-step nonlinear finite-element methodology to study rupture propagation and its interaction with strip foundations; (ii) provides validation through successful Class ""A"" predictions of centrifuge model tests; and (iii) conducts a parameter study on the interaction of strip foundations with normal fault ruptures. It is shown that a heavily loaded foundation can substantially divert the rupture path, which may avoid outcropping underneath the foundation. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, often detaching from the soil. Its distress arises mainly from the ensuing loss of support that takes place either at the edges or around its center. The average pressure q on the foundation largely dictates the width of such unsupported spans. Increasing q decreases the unsupported width, reducing foundation distress. The role of q is dual: (1) it compresses the soil, ""flattening"" fault-induced surface ""anomalies"" and (2) it changes the stress field underneath the foundation, facilitating rupture diversion. However, even if the rupture is diverted, the foundation may undergo significant stressing, depending on its position relative to the fault outcrop. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R
40|$|The Mw 7. 1 {{earthquake}} of November 12, 1999 {{severely damaged}} a 2. 5 km long viaduct on a stretch under {{construction of the}} Istanbul-Ankara motorway, 18 km W of Bolu. The fault <b>rupture</b> <b>crossed</b> the viaduct with an observed offset close to 1. 5 m; the viaduct deck suffered large permanent displacements but did not collapse. Seismic hazard at the site appears to be governed by characteristic earthquakes occurring every few hundred years both on the Düzce fault and on the main stretch of North Anatolian fault (NAF). Smaller active faults near the site {{also contribute to the}} hazard. We investigate how a reliable design response spectrum of displacement can be constructed for the viaduct site using both probabilistic and deterministic tools. After checking the applicability of known attenuation relations against recorded data, we illustrate a hazard analysis that incorporates a characteristic earthquake model for the relevant faults, and accounts for statistical directivity effects on the Düzce fault. Constantrisk response spectra up to 3 s are thus obtained for different return periods. Synthetic motions at the site are generated next, using a known source model, in order to explore the features of the displacement response spectrum at vibration periods in the range between 1 s and 6 s, in which the dominant response of the viaduct deck, uncoupled from the piers, occurs.

40|$|Tunnels are {{believed}} to be rather ""insensitive"" to earthquakes. Although a number of case histories seem to favor such an argument, failures and collapses of underground structures in the earthquakes of Kobe (1995), Düzce-Bolu (1999), and Taiwan (1999) have shown that there are exceptions to this ""rule"". Among them: the case of tunnels <b>crossed</b> by fault <b>rupture.</b> This paper presents the analysis and design of two highway cut-and-cover tunnels in Greece against large tectonic dislocation from a normal fault. The analysis, conducted with finite elements, places particular emphasis on realistically modeling the tunnel-soil interface. Soil behavior is modeled thorough an elastoplastic constitutive model with isotropic strain softening, which has been extensively validated through successful predictions of centrifuge model tests. A primary conclusion emerging from the paper is that the design of cut-and-cover structures against large tectonic deformation is quite feasible. It is shown that the rupture path is strongly affected by the presence of the tunnel, leading to development of beneficial stress-relieving phenomena such as diversion, bifurcation, and diffusion. The tunnel may be subjected either to hogging deformation when the rupture emerges close to its hanging-wall edge, or to sagging deformation when the rupture is near its footwall edge. Paradoxically, the maximum stressing is not always attained with the maximum imposed dislocation. Therefore, the design should be performed on the basis of design envelopes of the internal forces, with respect to the location of the fault rupture and the magnitude of dislocation. Although this study was prompted by the needs of a specific project, the method of analysis, the design concepts, and many of the conclusions are sufficiently general to merit wider application. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|International audienceSurveys of offset linear {{cultural}} {{features that}} <b>cross</b> the surface <b>ruptures</b> of the 17 August and 12 November 1999 earthquakes on the North Anatolian fault in Turkey yield slip values {{as large as}} or larger than those recorded by near-field measurements in the same areas immediately after the earthquake. Using long, linear alignments of trees, fence lines, walls, and canals, we demonstrate {{as much as a}} 2 -m increase in observed slip over the initial field measurements. On an average, we observed about 15 % of the total lateral slip as off-fault deformation, with values ranging from 0 % to 40 % of the total slip. Part of this lateral deformation is accommodated by bending or drag in a zone as much as 30 m in width, although usually the zone varies between 5 and 20 m in width. This supports the idea that substantial nonbrittle, off-fault deformation is associated with ruptures in areas of alluvial fill. Alternatively, there may have been substantial afterslip, although none has been recognized on postearthquake repaired structures. Our observations suggest that post-earthquake measurements of fault slip, using tape measures on offset geomorphic features, may underestimate the actual amount of slip in that event, where the non-linearity of the offset feature does not allow recognition of the warping. Surveys of multiple tree lines within groves of poplar trees, planted in straight lines across the fault prior to the earthquake, show surprisingly large lateral variations. In one grove, slip increases by nearly 1. 8 m, or 35 % of the maximum measured value, over a lateral distance of nearly 100 m. This and other observations along the 1999 ruptures suggest that the lateral variability of slip observed from displaced geomorphic features in many earthquakes of the past may represent a combination of (1) actual differences in slip at the surface and (2) the difficulty in recognizing distributed nonbrittle deformation...|$|R
