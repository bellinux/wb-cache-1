50|$|Acebutolol is a <b>cardioselective</b> {{beta blocker}} with ISA (intrinsic {{sympathomimetic}} activity; see article on pindolol). It is therefore more suitable than non <b>cardioselective</b> beta blockers, {{if a patient}} with asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) needs treatment with a beta blocker. (For these reasons, it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies). In doses lower than 800mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10% to 30% of those observed under propranolol treatment, but there is experimental evidence that the <b>cardioselective</b> properties diminish at doses of 800mg/day or more.|$|E

50|$|Beta blocker {{medications}} such as propranolol {{can trigger}} asthma {{in those who}} are susceptible. <b>Cardioselective</b> beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease. Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs.|$|E
50|$|Off-label uses of atenolol, as {{with other}} <b>cardioselective</b> β-blockers, include {{symptomatic}} treatment of psychological issues such as anxiety. β-blockers are effective for some in treating the somatic (physical) effects of anxiety. In these instances, dosing is used as needed instead of regular daily dosing.|$|E
50|$|Beta {{blockers}} {{help patients}} with cardiovascular disease by blocking β receptors, {{while many of}} the side-effects of these medications are caused by their blockade of β2 receptors. For this reason, beta blockers that selectively block β1 adrenergic receptors (termed <b>cardioselective</b> or β1-selective beta blockers) produce fewer adverse effects (for instance, bronchoconstriction) than those drugs that non-selectively block both β1 and β2 receptors.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment conducted on biopsied heart tissue, nebivolol {{proved to be}} the most β1-selective of the β-blockers tested, being approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective than bisoprolol. However, the drug's receptor selectivity in humans is more complex and depends on the drug dose and the genetic profile of the patient taking the medication. The drug is highly <b>cardioselective</b> at 5 mg. In addition, at doses above 10 mg, nebivolol loses its cardioselectivity and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors. (While the recommended starting dose of nebivolol is 5 mg, sufficient control of blood pressure may require doses up to 40 mg). Furthermore, nebivolol is also not <b>cardioselective</b> when taken by patients with a genetic makeup that makes them [...] "poor metabolizers" [...] of nebivolol (and other drugs) or with CYP2D6 inhibitors. As many as 1 in 10 whites and even more blacks are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and therefore might benefit less from nebivolol's cardioselectivity although currently there are no directly comparable studies.|$|E
50|$|In ideal circumstances, {{patients}} with known varices should receive treatment {{to reduce their}} risk of bleeding. The non-selective β-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol or nadolol) and nitrates (e.g., isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) have been evaluated for secondary prophylaxis. Non-selective β-blockers (but not <b>cardioselective</b> β-blockers like atenolol) are preferred because they decrease both cardiac output by β1 blockade and splanchnic blood flow by blocking vasodilating β2 receptors at splanchnic vasculature. The effectiveness of this treatment has been shown {{by a number of}} different studies.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} a lot of studies about the {{toxicity}} of the taxine alkaloids and they have shown that their mechanism of action is interfering with the sodium and calcium channels of the myocardial cells, increasing the cytoplasmic calcium concentrations. Their mechanism is similar to drugs such as verapamil, although taxines are more <b>cardioselective.</b> They also reduce the rate of the depolarization of the action potential in a dose-dependent manner. This produces bradycardia, hypotension, depressed myocardial contractility, conduction delay, arrhythmias… ...|$|E
50|$|AH-1058 {{displays}} {{characteristics of}} Class IV antiarrhythmics (L-type calcium channel blockers). Class I antiarrhythmic (sodium channel blocker) characteristics {{have also been}} seen, but the effect AH-1058 has on sodium channels is variable and unknown. Some proposed uses for AH-1058 include the treatment of angina pectoris, stenosis of the outflow tract from obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment of these conditions (long term and short term) is possible due to the <b>cardioselective</b> nature of AH-1058 {{and the ability of}} AH-1058 to inhibit calcium channels and thus reduce cardiac contractility and energy consumption.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxia provokes {{potassium}} efflux from cardiac muscles cells via {{the activation}} of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Potassium efflux from cardiac cells decreases action potential duration {{and results in}} non-uniform repolerization of the cardiac cells. The heterogeneous repolarization of the cardiac tissue permits reentry of action potentials into conducting pathways, which manifests as malignant arrhythmias in the heart. HMR 1883 is a <b>cardioselective</b> ATP-sensitive potassium channel antagonist that prevents the potassium efflux, hence corrects the non-uniform refractory period in the ischemic tissue. A uniform refractory period corrects the conductance problems in the heart and prevents the re-entry arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|AH-1058 is a <b>cardioselective</b> L-type {{calcium channel}} blocker. AH-1058 binds {{to the same}} sites on the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium {{channels}} as phenylalkylamines (ex. verapamil) and benzothiazepines; {{both of which are}} well known calcium channel blockers. These sites on the alpha-1 subunit differ from the active site of the calcium channel, meaning AH-1058 binds L-type calcium channels allosterically to alter activity. In addition AH-1058 appears to interact with multiple states of L-type calcium channels (i.e. resting and inactive) to suppress calcium currents. A minor effect on sodium channels at higher concentrations has also been seen, but these effects appear to vary between species.|$|E
40|$|AIM: β-Adrenoceptor {{blockers}} {{have been}} used with caution in patients with obstructive lung diseases such as asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), due to the potentially increased airway reactivity and risk of bronchial obstruction. <b>Cardioselective</b> β-adrenoceptor blockers have a more beneficial profile than non-cardioselective β-adrenoceptor blockers and can be safely prescribed to patients with both cardiovascular disease and COPD. We hypothesized that <b>cardioselective</b> β-adrenoceptor blockers also affect pulmonary function. METHODS: This study was performed within the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Effects of <b>cardioselective</b> and non-cardioselective β-adrenoceptor blockers on pulmonary function were analysed using regression techniques with multivariable adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Current use of non-cardioselective β-adrenoceptor blockers was significantly associated with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 [*]s (FEV 1) of - 198 [*]ml (95 % CI - 301, - 96), with a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) of - 223 [*]ml (95 % CI - 367, - 79) and with a decreased FEV 1 [*]:[*]FVC of - 1. 38 % (95 % CI - 2. 74, - 0. 13 %). Current use of <b>cardioselective</b> β-adrenoceptor blockers was significantly associated with a lower FEV 1 of - 118 [*]ml (95 % CI - 157, - 78) and with a lower FVC of - 167 [*]ml (95 % CI - 222, - 111), but did not affect FEV 1 :[*]FVC. After exclusion of patients with COPD, asthma and heart failure the effects of <b>cardioselective</b> β-adrenoceptor blockers remained significant for FEV 1 (- 142 [*]ml [95 % CI - 189, - 96]) and for FVC (- 176 [*]ml [95 % CI - 236, - 117]). CONCLUSION: In our study both non-cardioselective and <b>cardioselective</b> β-adrenoceptor blockers had a clinically relevant effect on both FEV 1 and FVC.

40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>cardioselective</b> and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} drugs, {{with and without}} partial agonist activity, to control increases in blood pressure associated with mental and physical activity was compared in 35 subjects with hypertension. Direct measurements of blood pressure and radioenzymatic determinations of plasma norepinephrine were obtained before, during and after four activities, and were repeated after random allocation to treatment with atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol or propranolol. <b>Cardioselective</b> and nonselective drugs modestly reduced the pressor response to reaction time testing, but not to mental arithmetic or isometric exercise. The increase in systolic blood pressure during bicycling was attenuated significantly by the <b>cardioselective</b> drugs atenolol (by 23 mm Hg, or 38 %) and metoprolol (21 mm Hg, or 41 %), but not by the nonselective agents pindolol (with partial agonist activity) (13 mm Hg, or 20 %) and propranolol (10 mm Hg, or 17 %) (p < 0. 02 <b>cardioselective</b> versus nonselective; p = NS pindolol versus propranolol). Only bicycle exercise increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations (by 80 %). These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs will not attenuate increases in blood pressure during mental or physical activities unless intense sympathoadrenal activation also occurs. Marked elevations in circulating epinephrine, with or without norepinephrine, and peripheral betaz-blockade appear necessary for alpha-mediated vasoconstriction to predominate and for the contrasting effects of <b>cardioselective</b> and nonselective drugs to be appreciated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBeta-blocker {{therapy has}} a {{mortality}} benefit {{in patients with}} hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of <b>cardioselective</b> beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of <b>cardioselective</b> beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta 2 -agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV 1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. <b>Cardioselective</b> beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV 1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (− 2. 05 % [95 % CI, − 6. 05 % to 1. 96 %]) or for longer duration (− 2. 55 % [CI, − 5. 94 % to 0. 84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV 1 treatment response to beta 2 -agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, <b>cardioselective</b> beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, <b>cardioselective</b> beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD...|$|E
40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} a new beta 1 -receptor agonist, 1 -(4 hydroxyphenoxy) 3 -isopropylamino- 2 -propanol, were studied in 25 {{patients}} after acute myocardial infarction using non-invasive methods.

These changes were greater in patients without a history of left heart failure. It is suggested that this <b>cardioselective</b> drug possesses positive inotropic activity but only slight positive chronotropic activity. The substance has been further investigated as a possible antidote to unwanted cardiac side effects of the <b>cardioselective</b> beta-blocker, metoprolol. The changes in the cardiovascular dynamics caused by metoprolol in patients with acute myocardial infarction were promptly reversed by this new beta 1 -agonist.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} whether a reduction in HDL-cholesterol is peculiar to non <b>cardioselective</b> beta blockers or whether it is also produced by <b>cardioselective</b> beta 1 -blockers. 16 patients with primary arterial hypertension on a balanced isocaloric diet were given oxprenolol 120 to 240 mg/day or metoprolol 100 to 200 mg/day in a random cross-over study. No significant change was observed after either treatment in fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. HDL-cholesterol concentration was significantly decreased on metoprolol, from 41 to 36 mg/dl (p less than 0. 05), while oxprenolol did not affect it at all.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{number of}} {{observational}} {{studies have reported}} that, in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), beta blockers (BBs) decrease risk of mortality and COPD exacerbations. To address important methodological concerns of these studies, we compared the effectiveness and safety of <b>cardioselective</b> BBs versus non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in patients with COPD and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) using a propensity score (PS) -matched, active comparator, new user design. We also assessed for potential unmeasured confounding by examining a short-term COPD hospitalisation outcome. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified 22 985 patients with COPD and ACS starting <b>cardioselective</b> BBs or non-DHP CCBs across 5 claims databases from the USA, Italy and Taiwan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Stratified Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs for mortality, cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisations and COPD hospitalisations in each database after variable-ratio PS matching. Results were combined with random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: <b>Cardioselective</b> BBs were not associated with reduced risk of mortality (HR, 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 02) or CV hospitalisations (HR, 1. 06; 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 23), although statistical heterogeneity was observed across databases. In contrast, a consistent, inverse association for COPD hospitalisations was identified across databases (HR, 0. 54; 95 % CI 0. 47 to 0. 61), which persisted even within the first 30 days of follow-up (HR, 0. 55; 95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 82). Results were similar across a variety of sensitivity analyses, including PS trimming, high dimensional-PS matching and restricting to high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: This multinational study found a large inverse association between <b>cardioselective</b> BBs and short-term COPD hospitalisations. The persistence of this bias despite state-of-the-art pharmacoepidemiologic methods calls into question the ability of claims data to address confounding in studies of BBs in patients with COPD...|$|E

A procedure was designed to distinguish between the effects of the drugs themselves while treatment continued, and the development of adaptive changes which would persist when the drugs had been eliminated from the body. Though individual responses to treatment varied in both groups, the mean effect of the <b>cardioselective</b> and non-selective drugs in the control of hypertension was similar. There was no evidence of the development of supersensitivity or "rebound". On the contrary, an adaptive bradycardia (that is a fall of not less than 10 % in heart rate persisting 52 hours after stopping treatment) was observed at rest in 17 / 30 patients, and peak heart rates and blood pressures during exercise were lower in both groups than before treatment. <b>Cardioselective</b> drugs induced a significantly greater bradycardia at rest than non-selective, but on exercise increases in heart rate were reduced more by the non-selective drugs, so that the same peak heart rates were reached on exercise in both groups. Adaptation also affected QT.
