25|$|This was {{followed}} by Abraham Darby, who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709. However, the <b>coke</b> pig <b>iron</b> he made was used mostly {{for the production of}} cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. <b>Coke</b> pig <b>iron</b> was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, <b>coke</b> pig <b>iron</b> was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III.|$|R

50|$|By 1912, 80% of Japan's {{pig iron}} {{production}} was from Yahata. An integrated mill with <b>coke,</b> <b>iron,</b> and steel facilities, Yahata was also responsible {{at this time}} for 80-90% of Japan's steel output. Energy efficiency was greatly improved by the conversion from steam to electricity as a power source, resulting in a drop in consumption of coal per ton of steel produced from four tons in 1920 to 1.58 in 1933.

5000|$|The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE) , {{also known}} as the [...] "Little Giant", was formed on May 11, 1875. Company {{headquarters}} were located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The line connected Pittsburgh in the east with Youngstown, Ohio at nearby Haselton, Ohio in the west and Connellsville, Pennsylvania to the east. It did not reach Lake Erie (at Ashtabula, Ohio) until the formation of Conrail in 1976. The P&LE was known as the [...] "Little Giant" [...] since the tonnage that it moved was out of proportion to its route mileage. While it operated around one tenth of one percent of the nation's railroad miles, it hauled around one percent of its tonnage. This was largely because the P&LE served the steel mills of the greater Pittsburgh area, which consumed and shipped vast amounts of material. It was a specialized railroad deriving much of its revenue from coal, <b>coke,</b> <b>iron</b> ore, limestone, and steel. The eventual closure of the steel mills led {{to the end of the}} P&LE as an independent line in 1992.|$|E

40|$|Modification and {{optimization}} of the {{pyrometallurgical process}} of lead {{recovering from the}} waste lead-acid batteries have been studied in this paper. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop a cleaner production in the field of the secondary lead metallurgy. Lead smelting process with the addition of flux (sodium(I) -carbonate) and reducing agents (<b>coke,</b> <b>iron)</b> has been followed. The modified smelting process with the addition of hazardous waste (activated carbon) as alternative reducing agents has shown positive results {{on the quality of the}} secondary lead, the generated slag and the process gases. Filtration efficiency of the gases, the return of baghouse dust to the process and use of oxygen burners have positive effect on the environment protection and energy efficiency. Optimization of the recycling process has been based on the properties of the slag. Stabilization of slag is proposed in the furnace with addition of waste dust from the recycling of cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. Phosphorus compounds from dust reduce leachability of toxic elements from the generated slag. Reduction the slag amount and its hazardous character through the elimination of migratory heavy metals and valorization of useful components have been proposed in the patented innovative device - cylindrical rotating washer/separator...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on mineral layer formation at the coke-iron boundary during coke dissolution {{has been carried}} out. In previous articles by the authors {{the focus was on}} morphology of layer development and its effects on the kinetics of coke dissolution. In this article the formation of calcium sulphide at the coke-iron boundary is discussed. The compositions and temperatures used in the experimental set up were chosen to represent <b>coke</b> <b>iron</b> mass ratios of the lower zone of an iron blast furnace. SEM images and EDS analysis of the coke-iron interface revealed a mineral layer at the interface. This layer was found to be primarily calcium aluminate based that over time (0 - 120 minutes) became progressively enriched with calcium. The ratios of calcium and aluminium found in the mineral layer indicate that the layer is composed of alumina, CA 6, CA 2 and CA. A sulphide layer was also observed in these experiments after the establishment of a calcium rich calcium aluminate (CA 2 and in particular CA). Thermodynamic analysis of the calcium aluminates formed during coke dissolution was carried out to establish the stability of in the experimental set up. From the results presented and the coke composition studied it can be concluded that formation of calcium rich calcium aluminates are a necessary precursor to formation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{performs}} {{an integrated}} assessment {{of new technology}} adoption in the steel industry. New <b>coke,</b> <b>iron,</b> and steel production technologies are discussed, and their economic and environmental characteristics are compared. Based upon detailed plant level data on cost and physical input-output relations by process, this study develops a simple mathematical optimization model of steel process choice. This model is then expanded to a life cycle context, accounting for environmental emissions generated during the production and transportation of energy and material inputs into steelmaking. This life-cycle optimization model provides a basis for evaluating {{the environmental impacts of}} existing and new iron and steel technologies. Five different plant configurations are examined, from conventional integrated steel production to completely scrap-based operations. Two cost criteria are used to evaluate technology choice: private and social cost, with the latter including the environmental damages associated with emissions. While scrap-based technologies clearly generate lower emissions in mass terms, their emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are significantly higher. Using conventional damage cost estimates reported in the literature suggests that the social costs associated with scrap-based steel production are slightly higher than with integrated steel production. This suggests that adopting a life-cycle viewpoint can substantially affect environmental assessment of new technologies. Finally, this study also examines the impacts of carbon taxes on steel production costs and technology choice...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to assess the wetting behaviour of liquid iron carbon alloys on alumina, CA 6 (CaO · 6 Al 2 O 3), CA 2 (CaO · 2 Al 2 O 3) and CA (CaO · Al 2 O 3). The melt compositions studied were 2 and 5 mass% [C] over a temperature range of 1 450 to 1 550 °C. It was found that the systems studied were in general non-wetting, and that the contact angle dropped from approximately 140 ° to 110 ° as the calcium content of the substrates increased. The data for alumina were in good agreement with the literature. These data have been used to assess whether capillary phenomena {{play a significant role in}} coke dissolution in liquid iron. In previous studies it was found that as coke dissolved, a mineral layer consisting of alumina and calcium aluminates formed at the <b>coke</b> <b>iron</b> interface and that as time passed the mineralogy of the layer changed from CA 6 to CA 2 to CA. The rate of coke dissolution slowed considerably with the occurrence of the CA phase. It was not clear whether this was solely a densification effect, or if a capillary wetting issue was contributing to a reduction of the contact area. The contact angle measurements of iron on alumina, CA 6, CA 2 and CA have been discussed in light of this coke dissolution study, and a simple capillary penetration model used to assess the wetting effects. It was found that the change of wetting associated with the calcium enrichment of the mineral layer did not have a significant effect on the rate of coke dissolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} sulfur {{concentration}} in liquid iron on mineral layer development between <b>coke</b> and <b>iron</b> as <b>coke</b> dissolves in a 2 mass % carbon-iron liquid {{have been investigated}} at 1500 °C. Initial sulfur in iron concentrations used ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 049 mass %. Key findings include that the two stage dissolution behavior exhibited in the carbon transfer from <b>coke</b> to <b>iron</b> as reported in a previous study by the authors, at low initial sulfur in iron contents, was also apparent at the higher values used in this study. This two stage behavior was attributed {{to a change in}} the mineral layer density, as a result of changes in mineral morphology at the interface. In addition to confirming the two stage behavior of the carbon transfer kinetics at the higher sulfur concentration in iron levels, it was also found that after a period of time a solid calcium sulfide layer formed on the mineral layer. The sulfide layer formed after approximately 40 minutes and the proportion of sulfide in the mineral layer increased with increased experimental time and initial sulfur concentration in iron. It was usually found at the iron side of the mineral layer and associated with calcium enriched calcium aluminates.
