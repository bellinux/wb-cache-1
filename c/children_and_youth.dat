The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.

40|$|Summary: This article {{examines}} the development of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> advocacy through {{an analysis of the}} meaning of professionalization and argues that a culture of advocacy is needed to facilitate the development of professional advocacy expertise. • Findings: The fragmented development of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> advocacy in England and Wales has accelerated within the modernizing agenda of New Labour. While <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> advocacy competes with other imperatives in the provision of health and social care services, advocates seek to develop professional status in order to ensure effectively the involvement of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people in decision making. The nature of advocacy practice creates resistance to traditional models of professionalization but a committed practitioner model, recognizing advocacy expertise, enables advocacy to develop {{in a way that does}} not compromise its role. • Applications: Debates about the professionalization of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> advocacy are ongoing, particularly with the publication of advocacy standards in England and Wales. This article contributes to the discussion and suggests a model for developing the theory <b>and</b> practice of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> advocacy.

These variables have had {{a direct impact on}} the training of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> care practitioners. The first variable is the establishment of the National Qualifications Framework, the National Qualification Authority and the focus on lifelong learning possibilities as well as competency-based training. The second variable is the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk (IMC) and the accompanying transformation of the South African <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> care system. The third variable is the transformation of the Interim Council for Social Work with the associated recognition of <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>Youth</b> Care as an independent discipline. The fourth variable is the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by South Africa in 1995 in which certain rights of children are recognised. The fifth variable is the knowledge that South African children have special protection under the South African Constitution. The sixth variable is the Africanisation of the profession in South Africa. These variables have stressed the importance of compiling a competency-based framework for the training of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> care practitioners in South Africa that embraces all these variables. <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>Youth</b> Care is a phenomenon that is quite unfamiliar as an independent discipline in South Africa, and therefore the researcher chose a qualitative paradigm that is exploratory, descriptive, contextual and phenomenological to develop a competency-based framework for the training of <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>Youth</b> Care practitioners in South Africa. The empirical research included phenomenological interviews with <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> care trainers <b>and</b> a focus group interview with <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> care practitioners.
