In the late 1800s, Albert I, Prince of Monaco determined that the Gulf Stream branched into the North Atlantic Drift and the Azores Current. In the 1890s, Scottish scientist T.

Releasing bottles designed to remain a short distance above the sea bed, British marine biologist George Parker Bidder III first proved in the early twentieth century that deep sea currents flowed from east to west in the North Sea and that bottom feeders prefer to move against the current.|$|E

Due to a slight unbalance of the control signals, the inner resistances of the inverters and other uncertainties, <b>circulating</b> <b>currents</b> exist among the parallel units which reduce the reliability of IPT systems. Firstly, the series-parallel resonant tank is employed in the multiple inverters based IPT system to eliminate the DC and harmonic <b>circulating</b> <b>currents.</b> The fundamental <b>circulating</b> <b>currents</b> in the paralleled inverter units are analyzed in detail. Then, for eliminating the fundamental <b>circulating</b> <b>currents,</b> a current decomposition method and a control diagram are proposed to avoid acquiring the phase of the current by detecting zero cross current point which increases {{the accuracy of the}} control algorithm. Finally, a 1 -kW parallel-connected inverter IPT system is provided to verify the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for eliminating the fundamental <b>circulating</b> <b>currents.</b> The maximum efficiency of the system is up to 92. 18 % which is 0. 53 % higher compared to that without the current phasor control (91. 65 %) ...|$|R

Floating objects may ride gyres (large <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> systems) that {{are present in}} each ocean, and may be {{transferred}} from one ocean's gyre to another's. Further, objects may be sidetracked by wind, storms, countercurrents, and ocean current variation. Accordingly, drift bottles have traveled large distances, with drifts of 4,000 to 6,000 miles and more—sometimes traveling 100 miles per day—not uncommon. Bottles have traveled from the Beaufort Sea above northern Alaska and northwestern Canada to northern Europe; from Antarctica to Tasmania; from Mexico to the Philippines; from Canada's Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay to Irish, French, Scottish, and Norwegian beaches; and from the Galapagos Islands to Australia. Based on empirical data collected since 1901, a computer program called OSCURS (Ocean Surface Current Simulator) digitally simulates motion and timing of floating objects in and between ocean gyres.|$|E

40|$|The ac-side {{terminal}} voltages of parallel-connected converters are different if the line reactive drops {{of the individual}} converters are different. This could result either from differences in per-phase inductances or from differences in the line currents of the converters. In such cases, the modulating signals are different for the converters.

Simplistically, the big problem with the differential protocols is that with slightly mismatched capacitance from the hot and cold wires to ground, or slightly mismatched hot and cold voltage swings or edge timing, the currents in the hot and cold wires will be unequal, and also a voltage will be coupled onto the signal screen, which will cause a <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> at signal frequency and its harmonics, extending up to possibly many GHz. The difference in signal current magnitudes between the hot and cold conductors will try to flow from, for example, item A's protective ground conductor back to a common ground in the building, and back along item B's protective ground conductor.

40|$|Abstract: Reduction of <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{considerations}} in inverter fed electrical drives. Diode clamped MLI enables higher output current per phase, thereby rating of the drive gets increased effectively. Various methods of triggering in the inverter legs creates better voltage profile and leads to the enabling of <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> in the drive system. The induced <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> flows through the apparatus neutral (N) and supply ground (G) is caused by the existence of parasitic capacitance. This <b>circulating</b> <b>current</b> may cause potential danger especially when parasitic capacitance poses large. In the past, different modulation techniques and conversion topologies have been introduced to minimize the flow of <b>circulating</b> <b>current.</b> However, these techniques lead to complexity, high cost, low voltage profile and efficiency due to lower modulation parameters.
