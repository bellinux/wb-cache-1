25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free movement of goods, <b>capital,</b> <b>services,</b> technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies and capital. Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology.|$|E
25|$|The Community's initial aim was {{to bring}} about {{economic}} integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. It gained {{a common set of}} institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market, which allowed for the free movement of goods, <b>capital,</b> <b>services,</b> and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association, forming the European Economic Area covering 15 countries.|$|E

2500|$|This {{function}} {{can also}} {{be compared with the}} previous equation, in which [...] capital as variable played two distinctive roles: [...] capital stock as value of production equipment and <b>capital</b> <b>service</b> as a substitute of labour. The only thing which is done is a separation of the two roles of capital: we consider capital stock [...] to be the [...] means of attracting [...] labour [...] and <b>capital</b> <b>service</b> , to the production. It was shown also that <b>capital</b> <b>service</b> , [...] as one of the three factors of production, has a meaning of substitutive work of production equipment [...] (energy delivered to animate production equipment). The theory was considered in one sector an approximation of the production system, including some reference to multi-sector approach.|$|R
500|$|The core {{objective}} of the Single Economic Space {{is the development of}} a single market and achieving the [...] "four freedoms", namely the free movements of goods, <b>capital,</b> <b>services</b> and people within the single market. The four freedoms came into effect on 1 January 2015 (the day the Eurasian Economic Union was officially established). The free movement of people means that citizens can move freely among member states to live, work, study or retire. Citizens of the member states of the union may travel to other member states on an internal passport. Although Russia also admits access to citizens of other CIS states without a passport, it is expected that after 2015 only citizens of the Customs Union will have this privilege.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian Economic Union has an {{integrated}} single market of 183 {{million people and}} a gross domestic product of over 4 trillion U.S. dollars (PPP). The EAEU introduces the free movement of goods, <b>capital,</b> <b>services</b> and people and provides for common policies in macroeconomic sphere, transport, industry and agriculture, energy, foreign trade and investment, customs, technical regulation, competition and antitrust regulation. Provisions for a single currency and greater integration are envisioned in future. The union operates through supranational and intergovernmental institutions. The Supreme Eurasian Economic Council is the [...] "Supreme Body" [...] of the Union, consisting of the Heads of the Member States. The second level of intergovernmental institutions {{is represented by the}} Eurasian Intergovernmental Council (consisting of the Prime Ministers of member states). The day-to-day work of the EAEU is done through the Eurasian Economic Commission (the executive body), which is a supranational body similar to European Commission.

60|$|Your Lordships {{see what}} {{the opinion of the}} Council was of their own constitution. You see for what it was made. You see for what {{purposes}} the great revenue trust was taken from the Council-General, from the supreme government. You see for what purposes the executive power was destroyed. You have it from one of the gentlemen of this commission, at first four in number, and afterwards five, who was the most active, efficient member of it. You see it was made for the purpose of being a tool in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; that integrity, ability, and vigilance could avail nothing; that the whole country might be laid under contribution by this man, and that he could thus practise bribery with impunity. Thus your Lordships see the delegation of all the authority of the country, above and below, is given by Mr. Hastings to this Gunga Govind Sing. The screen, the veil, spread before this transaction, is torn open by the very people themselves who are the tools in it. They confess they can do nothing; they know they are instruments in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; and Mr. Hastings uses his name and authority to make them such {{in the hands of the}} basest, the wickedest, the corruptest, the most audacious and atrocious villain ever heard of. It is to him all the English authority is sacrificed, and four gentlemen are appointed to be his tools and instruments. Tools and instruments for what? They themselves state, that, if he has the inclination, he has the power and ability to lay the whole country under contribution, that he enters into the most minute secrets of every individual in it, gets into the bottom of their family affairs, and has a power totally to subvert and destroy them; and we shall show upon that head, that he well fulfilled the purposes for which he was appointed. Did Mr. Hastings pretend to say that he destroyed the Provincial Councils for their corruptness or insufficiency, when he dissolved them? No: he says he has no objection to their competency, no charge to make against their conduct, but that he has destroyed them for his new arrangement. And what is his new arrangement? Gunga Govind Sing. Forty English gentlemen were removed from their offices by that change. Mr. Hastings did it, however, very economically; for all these gentlemen were instantly put upon pensions, and consequently burdened the establishment with a new charge. Well, but the new Council was formed and constituted upon a very economical principle also. These five gentlemen, you will have it in proof, with the necessary expenses of their office, were a charge of 62,000l. a year upon the establishment. But for great, eminent, <b>capital</b> <b>services,</b> 62,000l., though a much larger sum than what was thought fit to be allowed for the members of the Supreme Council itself, may be admitted. I will pass it. It shall be granted to Mr. Hastings, that these pensions, though they created a new burden on the establishment, were all well disposed, provided the Council did their duty. But you have heard what they say themselves: they are not there put to do any duty; they can do no duty; their abilities, their integrity, avail them nothing; they are tools in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing. Mr. Hastings, then, has loaded the revenue with 62,000l. a year to make Gunga Govind Sing master of the kingdoms of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. What must the thing to be moved be, when the machinery, when the necessary tools, for Gunga Govind Sing have cost 62,000l. a year to the Company? There it is; it is not my representation, not the representation of observant strangers, of good and decent people, that understand the nature of that service, but the opinion of the tools themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In economics, <b>capital</b> <b>services</b> {{refer to}} a {{chain-type}} index of service flows derived from the stock of physical assets and software. These assets are coordination, equipment, software, structures, land, and inventories. <b>Capital</b> <b>services</b> are estimated as a capital-income weighted average of the growth rates of each asset. <b>Capital</b> <b>services</b> differ from capital stocks because short-lived assets such as equipment and software provide more services per unit of stock than long-lived assets such as land.

40|$|Abstract: Aggregation of {{tangible}} {{capital assets}} across vintages and decomposition of value aggregates into quantities and prices are considered. Focus is on both capital stock values and <b>capital</b> <b>service</b> values. If the definitions {{and ways of}} measuring prices and quantities are not conformable, a third component, denoted a quality component, {{may have to be}} included as a buffer. Should it then be suppressed by allocating it to either of the price and quantity components, or should quality be accounted for separately? In discussing these issues, five quantity variables and five price variables are involved. Some of them are observable from market data without large efforts, some are essentially unobservable, and some can be quantified only if certain (often non-testable) assumptions are made. Illustrations based on parametric functions are given. Keywords: Capital measurement, Aggregation, <b>Capital</b> <b>service</b> price, <b>Capital</b> quality, Arbitrage, Neo-classical theor...|$|R
