5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E

5|$|In May 1986, George Graham was {{appointed}} as Arsenal manager. He made an instant impact, guiding {{his team to}} League Cup success, and the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division. Arsenal however slipped to sixth in the league the following season, and lost out to Luton Town in the League Cup final a year later. Graham sought to resolve inconsistencies by freshening up his squad, promoting number of academy graduates while selling ageing players. By the summer of 1988, he achieved a blend of youth and experience, but little was thought of Arsenal's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger {{wanted to}} {{participate}} in the Royal Rumble match, as the winner was scheduled to get a title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania X. The contract he had signed for his title shot at SummerSlam 1993, however, stated that he would not receive a rematch if he failed to win the title. A compromise was reached, allowing Luger to compete. Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji, was allowed to bring in two wrestlers, Genichiro Tenryu and The Great Kabuki to hurt Luger's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2006, quarterback Rhett Bomar and {{offensive}} lineman J.D. Quinn, both sophomores, were dismissed from the team. It {{was reported that}} they violated NCAA regulations regarding receiving extra compensation. It was later determined Bomar received $7,406.88 and Quinn $8,137.17. The loss of these two key players affected the team's placement in many publications' preseason polls {{as well as their}} <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> a national championship. The team turned to starting quarterback Paul Thompson (a converted wide receiver in 2005) and backup Joey Halzle to lead the team.|$|E

5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E

A third season, which was announced on September 16, 2009, debuted on October 12, with some episodes featuring celebrities with a common bond (such as three The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast members or three former child stars) playing for charity. The show's fourth and final season debuted on August 16, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, McCoy {{was again}} in strong {{consideration}} for the Heisman, even with the two previous Heisman winners coming back for their senior seasons. At {{the start of the}} season he and Tebow were considered the favorites. But McCoy's numbers were down a little from 2008, and despite leading his team to the BCS Championship game, his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> disappeared during a close 13-12 Big 12 Title game in which he threw 3 interceptions, no touchdowns and nearly threw the game away at the end. Despite this, he still had an outstanding season and was again named a finalist, this time along with Tim Tebow, Mark Ingram, Jr, Toby Gerhart and Ndamukong Suh. He became only the 2nd Longhorn, along with Ricky Williams, to be a two-time Heisman finalist. He finished third behind Ingram and Gerhart.|$|E

His goal against Derby County on 24 February won him Match of the Days Goal of the Season award. Writing in his autobiography, Paisley named the 1978–79 team as the best championship team he had been associated with during his 40 years with the club. Manchester United again denied them the {{chance to win the}} Double however, as United knocked Liverpool out of the semi-finals of the FA Cup following a replay at Goodison Park.

5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and {{the public about the}} threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b> Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time since}} 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Miller {{generally}} {{played in}} the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman {{even when he was}} unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b> Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184runs at 26.28 and 13wickets at 23.15 from 138.1overs and took eight catches.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's loss to Appalachian State {{effectively}} {{ended their}} <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> a national championship.

In their next game, Michigan lost to Oregon 39–7, the largest margin of defeat for Michigan at Michigan Stadium since 1968. Following the loss to Oregon, Michigan won their next eight games, leading the team to rank as high as No. 13 in the AP Poll. After Michigan lost their final two games, ending the regular season with an 8–4 record, they dropped off the poll entirely. After Michigan's season-ending loss to Ohio State, Carr announced he would retire as the team's coach after their bowl game. The Wolverines received an invitation to the Capital One Bowl, where they defeated Florida 41–35 to finish their season 9–4. Following their win in the Capital One Bowl, Michigan finished at No. 18 in the final AP Poll.|$|E

Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b> He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.|$|E
5|$|Coach Mike Ellis {{departed}} {{the club}} following the 2007–08 season, {{to be replaced}} by Corey Neilson. After a third-place finish in the 2008–09 season, the Panthers mounted a title challenge during 2009–10, remaining in contention for the championship until the final stages of the season. They eventually finished third for a third successive season. The Panthers also won the Challenge Cup {{for the second time in}} three seasons, defeating the Cardiff Devils 8–7 on aggregate in the final. The 2010–11 season started strongly, but the Panthers suffered a poor mid season run which scuppered their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the regular season title and led to players being fined a proportion of their wages. The team were able to rebound from this, first securing a 4–3 aggregate victory over the Belfast Giants to successfully defend the Challenge Cup, then securing their third playoff championship with a 5–4 win over the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers repeated the double in the 2011–12 season first winning a third straight Challenge Cup with a 10–4 aggregate victory over Belfast. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated Braehead and Hull in the playoffs before winning 2–0 against Cardiff in the final. The game was a tight affair, with David-Alexandre Beauregard breaking the deadlock after 53 goalless minutes.|$|E
5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he would be more than happy to accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E
