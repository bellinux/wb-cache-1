Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland {{was one of the few}} socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the Flag of Cuba) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.|$|E

5|$|At metamorphosis, rapid <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body {{take place}} as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of breakdown of clotting factors and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
