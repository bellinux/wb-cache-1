Women who consumed mushrooms and green tea had a 90% lower incidence of breast cancer. A <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study</b> of 362 Korean women also reported an association between mushroom consumption and decreased risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{studies have}} many {{benefits}} over case control studies. The RR {{is a more}} powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study</b> where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, {{and there is a}} greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.|$|E
25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study</b> would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.|$|E

Systematic reviews {{examining}} both randomized <b>controlled</b> and <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>studies</b> found {{a lack of}} high-quality evidence.

25|$|Cohort studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study.</b> However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E
25|$|While folate is most {{well known}} for {{preventing}} neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Both choline and folate (with the help of vitamin B12) can act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can {{then go on to}} form SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary choline deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and choline are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production. Inhibition of choline absorption and use is associated with neural-tube defects in mice, and this may also occur in humans. A retrospective <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study</b> (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily choline intake had a four-fold greater risk of having a child with a neural-tube defect than women in the highest quartile of intake.|$|E

Conclusion: However, although this type of study is subject to possible errors, preventative measures put in place during the planning of <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>studies</b> and even during and after its execution can help guarantee scientific rigor.

2500|$|A 2007 <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>study</b> using {{archived}} {{blood samples}} found that {{breast cancer risk}} was increased 5-fold among women who were born prior to 1931 and who had high serum DDT levels in 1963. Reasoning that DDT use became widespread in 1945 and peaked around 1950, they concluded that the ages of 14–20 were a critical period in which DDT exposure leads to increased risk.

2500|$|If the ECG {{confirms}} changes {{suggestive of}} myocardial infarction (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), thrombolytics may be administered or primary coronary angioplasty may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates fibrinolysis, destroying blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial arteries and {{advanced to the}} heart to identify blockages in the coronaries. When occlusions are found, they can be intervened upon mechanically with angioplasty and usually stent deployment if a lesion, termed the culprit lesion, {{is thought to be}} causing myocardial damage. [...] Data suggest that rapid triage, transfer and treatment is essential. The time frame for door-to-needle thrombolytic administration according to American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines should be within 30 minutes, whereas the door-to-balloon Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) time should be less than 90 minutes.

40|$|Objective: Use {{systematic}} review methods {{to quantify the}} association between prostatitis and prostate cancer, under both fixed and random effects model. Evidence Acquisition: <b>Case</b> <b>control</b> <b>studies</b> of prostate cancer with information on prostatitis history.

In response to this concern, Falk and Rubenstein in 1987, suggested a method for assessing relative risk that uses family based controls, obviating this source of potential error.

50|$|Concerns {{regarding}} whether benzodiazepines {{during pregnancy}} cause major malformations, in particular cleft palate, have been hotly debated in the literature. A meta {{analysis of the}} data from cohort studies found no link but meta analysis of <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>studies</b> did find a significant increase in major malformations. (However, the cohort studies were homogenous and the <b>case</b> <b>control</b> <b>studies</b> were heterogeneous, thus reducing the strength of the <b>case</b> <b>control</b> results). There have also been several reports that suggest that benzodiazepines have the potential to cause a syndrome similar to fetal alcohol syndrome, but this has been disputed by a number of studies. As a result of conflicting findings, use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is controversial. The best available evidence suggests that benzodiazepines are not a major cause of birth defects, i.e. major malformations or cleft lip or cleft palate.|$|R
