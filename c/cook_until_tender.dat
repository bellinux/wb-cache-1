50|$|Sautéed {{reindeer}} (poronkäristys in Finnish, renskav in Swedish, finnbiff in Norwegian, báistebiđus in Sami) {{is perhaps}} the best known traditional meal from Lapland, especially in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. Usually steak or {{the back of the}} reindeer is used. It is sliced thinly (easier if frozen rather than only partially thawed), fried in fat (traditionally in reindeer fat, but butter and oil are more common nowadays), spiced with black pepper and salt, and finally some water, cream, or beer is added and <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>tender.</b> The dish is served with mashed potatoes and lingonberry preserves or, more traditionally, with raw lingonberries mashed with sugar. In Finland it is often served with pickled cucumber, which is not as common in Sweden.|$|R
50|$|Small {{pieces of}} meat (usually pork, {{sometimes}} chicken) and pork liver, are thinly sliced then sauteed with garlic and shallots. It is then <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>tender.</b> Next, salt, finely {{ground black pepper}} and other seasonings are added at this point. Then soup stock is added to prepare the broth. Next the lomi noodle and chopped cabbage is added. While waiting for the noodles to cook, a mixture of cornstarch flour blended {{with a small amount}} of water is added to thicken the soup. Finally, just before the whole mixture is transferred to individual bowls, a beaten egg is added as the cook continuously stirs to complete the basic dish. Toppings include slices of kikiam (que-kiam), fish balls, sliced chives, cooked shrimp, and some meatballs. Sometimes stir-fried ground meat (pork or chicken), as well as coarsely ground garlic roasted to golden brown are also available.|$|R
50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the spices}} are rinsed from the meat, {{which is then}} patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the {{rendered}} fat, and placed in an oven at a low temperature (76 - 135 degrees Celsius/170 - 275 Fahrenheit). The meat is slowly poached at least <b>until</b> <b>cooked,</b> or <b>until</b> meltingly <b>tender,</b> generally four to ten hours.|$|R
50|$|The huesillos, {{or dried}} peaches, are washed and soaked the night prior to {{preparation}} {{in order to}} rehydrate them. Once hydrated, they are cooked for thirty minutes or more in a sugar and water mixture, optionally with some natural cinnamon sticks. To give the drink its honey hue, sugar is heated in a sauce pan in order to caramelize it {{and bring it to}} a rich orange ruby color, which is added to the syrup mixture although this method is not always used. While the huesillos are cooking, the mote, or husked wheat, is <b>cooked</b> in water <b>until</b> <b>tender.</b> Once the mote are cooked, they are drained and added to the sweet huesillos drink, and left to cool. This combination is served chilled, in a tall glass with a tall dessert spoon for easy serving.|$|R
50|$|Arroz con dulce (Puerto Rican) Puerto Rican {{rice pudding}} {{is made with}} pearl rice. The rice is first rinsed until the water is clear {{and most of the}} starch has been removed, then it is left over night in water (this process makes it easier to cook and gives the rice better texture). Coconut milk, cream of coconut, {{evaporated}} milk, cloves, ginger, raisins (soaked in rum), vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg and the option of lemon zest is simmered until the coconut milk is infused with all spices. The rice is then drained and place in a hot pot that has been coated in butter. The infused coconut milk is then poured on the rice and <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> rice is <b>tender</b> and sticky. Coconut milk and cream can be replaced with more milk and cream cheese; pistachios can be substituted for raisins. Puerto Rican rice pudding is also popular in Colombia and Venezuela.|$|R
5000|$|Chicken bog is a pilaf dish made of {{rice and}} chicken. It can include onion, spices, and {{sometimes}} sausage. A whole chicken is boiled <b>until</b> <b>tender</b> (with the sausage, onion, and spices, if included), then the rice is added and <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> it absorbs all the liquid. Cooks often pick the bones and other inedible parts out of the pot and discard them before adding the rice to the meat and other ingredients. However, some cooks leave it all in for the diners to pick out as they eat, similar to many Caribbean meat and rice dishes. It is called Chicken [...] "bog" [...] because the chicken gets bogged down in the rice.|$|R
40|$|Making {{your own}} frozen {{prepared}} foods can be economical. You can cook enough for several meals with little extra effort {{when you have}} the time. For best results, remember that freezing maintains, but does not improve, quality. Use only fresh, high-quality food ingredients. Underripe fruits and vegetables lack flavor, and overripe ones are flat and tough, or soft and mushy after freezing. Meat or poultry that is tender before freezing will stay tender after freezing if it is properly prepared, packaged, frozen, and stored. Cleanliness Observe strict cleanliness in preparing food for the home freezer. Freezer temperatures of 0 degrees F or below do not kill bacteria in food; they simply stop bacteria from multiplying. After the frozen food is thawed, bacteria will grow and multiply again. Strict cleanliness keeps the number of bacteria at a minimum before foods are frozen. Foods to Use and Foods to Avoid You may use many of your own favorite recipes for freezing. Prepare the food in the usual way. Cook thoroughly but do not overcook. There may be further cooking when reheated. Foods That Freeze Well • Cooked chicken or turkey in casseroles. • Stews and goulashes made with beef, lamb, pork, or veal. Most vegetables used in these combination dishes, such as peas, carrots, celery, or small quantities of onion also freeze well. However, potatoes may not be satisfactory. • Baked meat loaf. • Cooked dried beans, such as bean soup and baked beans. Because freezing softens beans somewhat, <b>cook</b> <b>until</b> barely <b>tender</b> for best quality. Limit storage time to two weeks if seasoned with ham or bacon. Foods That Do Not Freeze Well The flavor and texture of some foods become poor during freezing. Avoid using these foods. • Cooked egg white toughens. • Mature potatoes which tend to disintegrate, become watery, or darken. New potatoes are better. • Fried foods tend to lose crispness and become soggy. • Avoid freezing cured meats; salt hastens rancidity. • Fresh salad greens, raw tomatoes, raw apples and grapes become soft, soggy, and mushy...|$|R
