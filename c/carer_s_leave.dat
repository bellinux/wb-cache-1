Plants from Syzygium genus reported as potential antioxidant, however the potency of plants as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has not been properly investigated. The present study was design to investigate the antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of three Syzygium plants, Syzygium cumini, S. aromaticum and <b>S.</b> polyanthum. <b>Leaves</b> of <b>S.</b> cumini, S. aromaticum, S. polyanthum and bud of S. aromaticum extracted with gradient polarity solvent consist of n -hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was measured with modified Ellman method at 412 nm and physostigmine was used as positive control, meanwhile antioxidant activity measured based on 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazil free radical scavenging test. The methanol extract of <b>S.</b> aromaticum <b>leaves,</b> <b>S.</b> aromaticum bud, <b>S.</b> polyanthum <b>leaves</b> and the ethyl acetate extract of <b>S.</b> polyanthum <b>leaves</b> were potential as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

40|$|Abstract Objective: Antioxidants {{are known}} to offer {{resistance}} against oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and by other mechanisms. They therefore help in preventing the free radicals induced diseases. Solanum macrocarpon is an important medicinal plant with rich source of nutritional and medicinal constituents. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the ability of <b>S.</b> macrocarpon <b>leaves</b> to protect tissues against iron (Fe 2 +) -induced lipid peroxidation in rat’s liver and brain. Methods: The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of the aqueous extract of <b>S.</b> macrocarpon <b>leaves,</b> as well as its antioxidant potential, free radical scavenging activity, reducing power and protective action on tissues against lipid peroxidation were carried out. Results: <b>S.</b> macrocarpon <b>leaves</b> revealed high phenolic and flavonoid content. Incubating the liver and brain of rats with <b>S.</b> macrocarpon <b>leave</b> extract exhibited high percentage inhibition of lipid peroxidation induced by iron(II) sulphate. Moreover, DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity and reducing power of the extract increased as the concentration increases. Conclusion: The aqueous extract of Solanum macrocarpon leaves possess a powerful antioxidant activity and can offer good protection against oxidative damage to body cells, especially liver and brain...|$|R
