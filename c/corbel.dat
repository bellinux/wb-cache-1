5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities {{took advantage of the}} hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified <b>corbel</b> vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than <b>corbel</b> vaulting. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.|$|E
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} <b>corbel</b> brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E
5|$|Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may {{be found}} in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the <b>corbel</b> of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} damaged reinforced concrete <b>corbels,</b> where the <b>corbels</b> are strengthened by bonding carbon fibre fabrics. The contribution of strengthening by gluing carbon fibre fabrics on the behaviour of reinforced short concrete <b>corbels</b> is very significant and interesting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Corbelling,</b> where rows of <b>corbels</b> {{gradually}} build a wall {{out from}} the vertical, has long {{been used as a}} simple kind of vaulting, for example in many Neolithic chambered cairns, where walls are gradually <b>corbelled</b> in until the opening can be spanned by a slab.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, results of testing eleven ultra-high {{performance}} steel fibers concrete (UHPSFC) <b>corbels</b> with concrete compressive strength 150  MPa and under vertical loading are reported. The main test variables were shear span-to depth ratio, main tension reinforcement ratio {{and the provision}} of secondary reinforcement (closed stirrups). In all <b>corbels,</b> except one, the main steel bars yielded before failure and <b>corbels</b> failed in a consistent manner. Whereas the validity from provision the secondary reinforcement in the UHPSFC <b>corbels</b> represents by {{a significant increase in the}} <b>corbels</b> stiffness with taking into consideration the <b>corbels</b> failure modes. The test results in terms of load versus deflection curves, stiffness, ductility and crack patterns show the effectiveness of using ultra high performance steel fibers concrete to ensure a superior strength and deformation capacity in reinforced concrete <b>corbels.</b> Experimental results have been compared with diverse prediction methods. The truss model can provide accurate strength predictions in comparison with the ACI 318 - 14 cod’s procedure...|$|R
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy <b>corbel</b> tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis is {{the largest}} {{architectural}} complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned. The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes. The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of <b>corbel</b> arches, but none are still standing.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, {{coated with a}} thick layer of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of <b>corbel</b> vaulting has been found and very {{little in the way of}} stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{represents}} a historical review, state-of-the-art review, on the experimental researches {{carried out on}} <b>corbels</b> in general and strengthening of <b>corbels</b> in particular. The <b>corbels</b> discussed are made of normal, high-strength and self-compacting concrete and subjected to two types of loading, monotonic and repeated loadings. Moreover, a review on the techniques of strengthening used to enhance the load carrying capacities of reinforced concrete <b>corbels</b> is presented too. Finally, directions for future work are proposed and a comprehensive list of references is provided...|$|R
50|$|A <b>corbelled</b> tomb is {{a generic}} term given to burial {{structures}} with <b>corbelled</b> roofs rather than simple slabs which generally denote an earlier type of construction.|$|R
50|$|The chapel {{also has}} barrel-vaulted undercroft and a roof from 1520 of 4 heavily mouldedarch braces rising from stone <b>corbels.</b> The <b>corbels</b> are {{decorated}} with Catherine wheels.|$|R
5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on <b>corbel</b> brackets, and above it a Madonna and Child in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|The upper storeys have {{ornamental}} panels featuring {{several different}} decorative motifs, including roundels and diagonal ogee braces. The eaves have <b>corbel</b> brackets with carvings including human faces and animals. These include a lion, ape and devil, {{as well as}} a salamander, supposed to give protection against fire. Gilded carvings of Richard and Margerye Churche are located above the main entrance, on either side. The timbers bear carpenters' marks with both Roman and Arabic numerals, some being unusually long. The highly decorated style is typical of the timber-framed buildings of the Elizabethan period.|$|E
5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a <b>corbel</b> vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E
50|$|The roof's cornice {{line has}} brick <b>corbeling.</b> Below the <b>corbeling</b> is {{a row of}} bricks {{extended}} slightly from the facade with bricks in a diamond design intermittently interrupting the row pattern.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{particularly}} notable for {{the discovery of}} a <b>corbelled</b> arch, an innovation generally attributed the Maya. Whether the <b>corbelled</b> arch was independently developed in Guerrero or was imported from the Maya regions is still unsettled.|$|R
50|$|Squinches may {{be formed}} by masonry built {{out from the}} angle in <b>corbelled</b> courses, by filling the corner with a vise placed diagonally, or by {{building}} an arch or a number of <b>corbelled</b> arches diagonally across the corner.|$|R
5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive <b>corbel</b> vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies {{deep in the heart of}} the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{exemplar of}} Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their <b>corbel</b> arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E
5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the 1st century AD, in the Late Preclassic, and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive <b>corbel</b> vault. It was the first royal burial that characterised the shift in ceremonial focus from the Mundo Perdido complex to the North Acropolis. The tomb was centrally located upon the north-south axis of the North Acropolis, under what would later become Temple 26, and contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies {{deep in the heart of}} the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king.

40|$|Design {{procedures}} for <b>corbels</b> {{are given in}} various Codes of Practice e. g. ACI 318 - 89 [1]. These codes give equations based on research on <b>corbels</b> made with normal strength concrete. Consequently, they tend to limit the value of concrete strength {{to be used in}} these equations. This will result in an underestimation of the load carrying capacity of <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete (HSC) as will be shown later. In the present paper, a semi-empirical equation for the design of <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete is derived. In the derivation, an empirical factor K is used, the value of which was determined from experimental data based on thirty tests made by Foster et al. [2]. This factor is assumed to be dependent on the shear span/effective depth ratio a/d. The expression found for K was then used to calculate the theoretical load carrying capacity of <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete. Twelve more tests were carried out, in-house, on <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete and the experimental results were compared with the theoretical values based on K as obtained from the empirical expression. It was found that the expression for K resulted in good correlation between theoretical and experimental values for the load carrying capacity of <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete. Comparison of the ACI Code values was made with both experimental and theoretical data and it was found the Code greatly underestimates the load capacity of <b>corbels</b> made with high strength concrete...|$|R

30|$|Strut-and-tie models (STM) {{have been}} {{generally}} {{recognized as an}} acceptable rational design approach for D-region members including deep beams and <b>corbels</b> (Schlaich et al. 1987). In addition, most current design codes [ACI Committee 318; Australian code AS 3600 (2009); Canadian code (CSA A 23.3 - 04); Eurocode 2 (2004) and New Zealand code (NZS 3101 - 1)] have recommended the STM approach as a design tool for RC <b>corbels.</b> However, shear capacity of <b>corbels</b> evaluated from STMs and available formulae and computing procedures showed substantial scatter when compared to experimental results (Hwang et al. 2000 b; Ali and White 2001; Russo et al. 2006). A rational design procedure to produce safe and economic <b>corbels</b> is therefore required.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{is faced}} with red sandstone, and has lead, asphalt and tile roofs. It is mainly in three storeys with a five-storey tower. The {{buildings}} are arranged around a ward with the principal accommodation on the north side. It {{is surrounded by a}} dry moat which is bridged at the gatehouse. To the west of the inner ward are the stables, the coach house, a rectangular bell tower and the kitchens and service area. To the north is the great hall range which consists of 18bays. Behind the entrance to the hall is the circular main tower. At the east end of the gallery wing is the octagonal library tower. The outer walls of the castle have full-height slender turrets at the changes in direction. <b>Corbel</b> tables support part of the battlements. The walls contain arrow slots, and in the gatehouse is a garderobe. The flat roof has a crenellated parapet.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of <b>corbel</b> brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
25|$|Another {{particular}} {{feature of}} Romanesque buildings are <b>corbel</b> tables, a projecting moulded string course {{supported by a}} range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule <b>corbel</b> tables carries the gutter, but the arcaded <b>corbel</b> table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.|$|E
50|$|Ugarit {{also has}} <b>corbelled</b> constructions.|$|R
50|$|The Tudor roof is {{supported}} by ten <b>corbels</b> and was restored in 1956. The size of the <b>corbels</b> shows that they would once have supported the beams of the first Norman roof. Two <b>corbels</b> are carved into heads in a style that is much earlier than Tudor. When the church was redecorated in 1976, the bosses, the work of local craftsmen, were gilded. About {{the centre of the}} nave’s north wall is an exquisitely carved small angel with a book, dating from 1300.|$|R
50|$|Some notable stone <b>corbels</b> can {{be found}} on the walls of the church. Above the nave the <b>corbels</b> bear a {{portcullis}} (the Beaufort heraldic badge) and St. George's cross (at the time of reconstruction the church belonged to the Church of England). On the outside of the organ chamber are five decorative <b>corbels</b> depicting an owl, a daffodil, a hawk, a flower and a nest of small birds being fed by their mother. On the south wall is an otter with a fish.|$|R
25|$|The {{church is}} {{rendered}} throughout, with mid-19th-century plain wooden roofs supported by simple arch-braces, finished at their spring by carved stone <b>corbel</b> angels.|$|E
25|$|A {{caricature}} of Angell by Ulysses Ricci's firm Ricci and Zari {{can be found}} carved on a <b>corbel</b> at the University of Michigan's Law Quadrangle.|$|E
25|$|The kokoshnik {{gave its}} name to the {{decorative}} <b>corbel</b> arch that became a distinctive element of traditional Russian architecture from 16th century onwards (see kokoshnik in architecture).|$|E
5000|$|The {{main block}} {{of the castle}} lies east to west, with the wing {{providing}} cover over two faces by jutting out southward. In the main block there are <b>corbelled</b> two-storey turrets on the north front, the upper floors having oval windows. [...] A heavily <b>corbelled</b> semi-circular stair turret, <b>corbelled</b> out to square, rises in the west re-entrant; it provides access to a watch-room in the wing. The castle has crow-stepped gables. [...] It is harled, and has a slated roof.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corbels</b> {{sometimes}} {{end with}} a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In the later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on <b>corbels</b> resemble those used in the capitals of columns.|$|R
50|$|The {{main section}} of the {{building}} is topped by battlements over a series of <b>corbels.</b> The clock tower above also features such an arrangement with battlements and <b>corbels.</b> The overall design {{is similar to the}} Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, but on a much smaller scale.|$|R
