5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to <b>C</b> <b>minor.</b> The soloist does not play any part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of <b>C</b> <b>minor.</b> The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.|$|E
5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

50|$|The second movement, in A major, the {{subdominant}} key of <b>C</b> <b>minor's</b> relative key (E major), is a lyrical work {{in double}} variation form, {{which means that}} two themes are presented and varied in alternation. Following the variations {{there is a long}} coda.|$|R
5|$|Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, {{the eighth}} barcarolle opens {{in with a}} cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in <b>C</b> <b>minor,</b> marked cantabile, is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a fortissimo chord.|$|E
5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is punctuated by a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat. This leads into the second fugato episode in the key of <b>C</b> <b>minor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement. Bach based the work on a composition in <b>C</b> <b>minor,</b> as mistakes in the copying process show.|$|E
50|$|In this opus {{there are}} four pairs of {{parallel}} keys (E, F, A and B, major/minor) and three pairs of relative keys (B major/G-sharp <b>minor,</b> <b>C</b> major/A <b>minor,</b> B flat minor/D flat Major).|$|R

5|$|Several of Schubert's last songs (the Schwanengesang collection), {{composed}} {{during the}} period of the sketching of the last sonatas, also portray a deep sense of alienation, and bear important similarities with specific moments in the sonatas. These include the songs Der Atlas (recalls the opening of the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Sonata), Ihr Bild (the B-flat major/G-flat major conflict {{at the opening of the}} B-flat Sonata), Am Meer, and Der Doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|The Symphony No. 1 in <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> for {{full-scale}} orchestra {{was written}} in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. This work is experimental, showing the influences of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber. Mendelssohn conducted this symphony on {{his first visit to}} London in 1829, with the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form the piece was a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} modification is {{expansion of the}} original material. The expansions frequently repeat preceding measures or consist of rests or left-hand figurations without the melody, providing a pause in the motion. This is especially noticeable in the Adagio, minuet and finale of the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Sonata, the middle section of the Andantino in the A major Sonata, and the first movement of the B-flat Sonata.|$|E

5|$|The short {{second section}} in common {{time is a}} 12 bar {{bridging}} interlude linking {{the first and third}} sections. The key modulates from D minor to <b>C</b> <b>minor,</b> so that the surrounding first and third sections can modulate from their starting key to its dominant and thus the whole movement can return to its original key at the close.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714. When he performed {{it again in}} Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 (8 August) {{it was the first}} solo cantata and the most operatic work which he had presented to the congregation up to that point. He made revisions for that performance, such as transposing it from <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo. In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|The Piano Concerto No. 24 in <b>C</b> <b>minor,</b> K. 491, is a concerto {{composed}} by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for keyboard (usually a piano or fortepiano) and orchestra. Mozart composed the concerto {{in the winter}} of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after the completion of the Piano Concerto in A major. As Mozart intended to perform the work himself, the soloist's part was not fully written down. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Chronologically the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of <b>C</b> <b>minor.</b> The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is one of}} {{only two}} minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos {{features}} a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who {{introduced him to the}} music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played a <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les Cloches de Corneville. Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to <b>C</b> <b>minor,</b> subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the <b>C</b> <b>minor</b> sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
