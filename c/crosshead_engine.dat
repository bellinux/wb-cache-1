25|$|Because the {{cylinder}} was placed above the crankshaft {{in this type}} of engine, it had a high center of gravity and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service, so that its use was largely confined to vessels plying inland waterways. As marine engines grew steadily larger and heavier through the course of the century, the high center of gravity of square <b>crosshead</b> <b>engines</b> became increasingly impractical, leading to their abandonment by the 1840s in favor of the walking beam engine.|$|R
50|$|High- and medium-speed {{engines are}} {{predominantly}} four-stroke engines, {{except for the}} Detroit Diesel two-stroke range. Medium-speed engines are physically larger than high-speed engines and can burn lower-grade (slower-burning) fuel than high-speed engines. Slow-speed engines are predominantly large two-stroke <b>crosshead</b> <b>engines,</b> hence very different from high- and medium-speed engines. Due to the lower rotational speed of slow- and medium-speed engines, there is more time for combustion during the power stroke of the cycle, allowing the use of slower-burning fuels than high-speed engines.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, when large diesel engines were first being used, the engines took a form similar to the {{compound}} steam engines common at the time, with the piston being connected to the connecting rod by a crosshead bearing. Following steam engine practice some manufacturers made double-acting two-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines to increase power output, with combustion taking place on both sides of the piston, with two sets of valve gear and fuel injection. While it produced large amounts of power, the double-acting diesel engine's main problem was producing a good seal where the piston rod passed through the bottom of the lower combustion chamber to the crosshead bearing, and no more were built. By the 1930s turbochargers were fitted to some <b>engines.</b> <b>Crosshead</b> bearings are still used to reduce the wear on the cylinders in large long-stroke main marine engines.|$|R
