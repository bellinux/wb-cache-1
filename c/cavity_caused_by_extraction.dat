Simple pleural effusions occur in up to 40% of bacterial pneumonias. They are usually small and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

The most common types of pathological diseases in the mouth are periodontal diseases and dental caries [2].

The semi-analytic model is applicable to a uniform and layer-cake stratigraphy, with visco-elastic parameters changing per layer, and an arbitrary depletion pattern. By its capabilities to handle a multi-layered visco-elastic subsurface, the semi-analytic model fills the gap between the analytic single-layered elastic models available to date and the more elaborate numerical, e. g. finite element, models. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
