40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} level of {{consensus}} amongst an international panel of public health nutrition leaders regarding the essential competencies required for effective public health nutrition practice. Design: A modified Delphi study involving three rounds of questionnaires. Subjects: A panel of 20 public health nutrition experts from seven countries in the European Union, the USA and Australia. Results: Expert panellists completed three rounds of the study relating to competencies. A literature review conducted {{as a prelude to}} the expert panel survey identified common <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> from the fields of public health, health promotion, nutrition and dietetics, and health education. These were categorised into seven competency areas including analytical, socio-cultural and political, public health service, communication, management and leadership, nutrition science and professional competency categories. There was strong initial agreement ($ 90 % of panellists at Round 1) that developing internationally recognised competencies for public health nutrition specialists was a priority. Twenty-six of an initial listing of 52 <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> were rated as essential competencies by $ 80 % of the panellists after Round 1. Iteration rounds resulted in the addition of five extra <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> suggested by panellists after Round 1 and an increase by 13 in the number of competencies rated as essential to consensus levels. From a total of 57 <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> rated after the final survey round, 41 <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> were rated as essential competencies by $ 80 % of the panellists (consensus), with 21 of these unanimously rated as essential competencies.

Design: A modified Delphi study involving three rounds of questionnaires. Setting: European Union. Subjects: Public health nutrition workforce development stakeholders, including academics, practitioners and employers, from twenty European countries. Results: A total of fifty-two expert panellists (84 % of an initial panel of sixty-two Delphi participants) completed all three rounds of the Delphi study. The panellists rated the importance of fifty-seven <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> possibly required of a public health nutritionist to effectively practice (Essential competencies). Twenty-nine of the fifty-seven <b>competency</b> <b>units</b> (51 %) met the consensus criteria (≥ 66 · 7 % agreement) at {{the second round of the}} Delphi survey, with the highest agreement for competencies clustered within the Nutrition science, Professional, Analytical and Public health services competency domains. Ratings of the level of competencies required for different levels in the workforce indicated that for a public health nutrition specialist, advanced-level competency was required across almost all the twenty-nine competencies rated as essential. There were limited differences in rating responses between academics and employer panellists throughout the Delphi study.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to design, implement and evaluate a Service-learning in Pharmacy (SLIP) intervention which is intended to serve as a generic model which can be used in tertiary hospital pharmacies. The SLIP intervention aimed to promote student learning by providing opportunities for students to engage in structured activities, while simultaneously alleviating pharmacy workload. Methods: The study was directed to UWC final year pharmacy students and pharmacists employed at a hospital pharmacy. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in evaluating this pre- and post-intervention enquiry. Qualitative evaluation methods included pre- and post- focus group discussions with students to assess student knowledge and expectations of SLIP. Covert observation of pharmacists was used to assess current views and receptivity toward student activities during the SLIP course. Quantitative evaluation methods included pre- and post-intervention student competency assessments in areas of hospital pharmacy practice (compounding, dispensing and clinic/ward pharmacy), and pre- and post-intervention questionnaires which assessed pharmacists’ views and receptivity toward SLIP. Results Students (n= 16) and pharmacists (n= 9) who were involved in the intervention comprised the study cohort. Qualitative: Pre-intervention, students indicated a lack of confidence and apprehension toward SLIP. Pharmacy managers were anxious about lack of time and space and the additional burden of training students. Post- intervention, students experienced a sense of professionalism and could connect with varied theoretical knowledge. They were both enthusiastic about this style of learning (“saw the pharmacy profession with new eyes”) and realized the need for more skills development in clinical pharmacy. Pharmacists’ receptivity to SLIP increased once student contribution to service delivery became evident. Quantitative: Student competency in areas of hospital pharmacy practice increased as a result of their participation in the Tygerberg SLIP model. Students also made a valuable contribution to service delivery at Tygerberg hospital pharmacy. This was quantified as the total number of services in compounding (n= 807), dispensing (n= 2090) and clinic/ward services (n= 37). Conclusion:The SLIP intervention resulted in improved perceptions and receptivity of pharmacists to service learning initiatives. Students’ level of competency increased in hospital pharmacy practice and they contributed to service delivery at Tygerberg hospital pharmacy.

40|$|Despite {{more than}} a decade of policy {{initiatives}} and encouragement to embrace Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) there has been an apparent reluctance, born out in national statistics, to take up RPL. In 1992 the National Training Board issued the National competency standards wherein policy and guidelines identified RPL as an important element in Competency Based Training. Supporting this stance in 1993 the Federal and State Ministers of Education declared the National Framework for the Recognition of Training (NFROT), committing educational institutions, at all levels, to provide recognition for the existing skills and knowledge of students regardless of how, when or where they were acquired. Fourteen years on the continuing reform agenda maintains the principles of RPL and a concern about its uptake. Recent responses to this concern include the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreement to fund RTO’s to establish or improve recognition services and processes, and the Australian Quality Training Framework 2007 that positions RPL as an essential element of quality training and assessment. Through an interpretive research process 100 teachers and educational leaders shared dialogue expressing their views on the practice of RPL and impediments to its broader embedding in practice. The findings suggest that for many practitioners there are poor understandings across a range of issues and not limited to the prevalent view that tools and frameworks are the critical element, but also about <b>competency</b> <b>units,</b> the nature of evidence and its collection for assessment and a fear of making invalid professional judgements.

40|$|Since its {{emergence}} at {{the beginning}} of the 1990 s, numerous companies have adopted the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). This paper tackles two research questions: (1) whether the BSC adds value to companies and (2) if so, how does it contribute to organisational performance. In contrast to previous literature that does not separate these two questions, we rely on an established methodology (Foster and Swenson, 1997) to separate and quantify both the BSC contribution to performance and the way that the contribution is achieved, by applying a unique cause-and-effect scheme to the BSC. Our empirical results are based on survey data collected from 76 business units. They indicate first that the Balanced Scorecard has a positive impact on organisational performance. More specifically, the BSC improves the integration of the management processes and empowers people. Using the Strategy-Focused-Organisation (SFO) model (Kaplan and Norton, 2001), we empirically find that the sources of performance derived from the BSC are primarily of three types: (1) a better translation of the strategy into operational terms, (2) the fact that strategising becomes a continuous process, and (3) the greater alignment of various processes, services, <b>competencies</b> and <b>units</b> of an organisation. ...|$|R

Similar to Belgium, these non-territorial units might hold exclusive competencies for educational, linguistic, cultural, and religious matters, and enable more political representation of minority individuals. The author concludes by proposing that analysts should more carefully examine actual examples from states with similarly divided populations in order to advocate working models for Bosnia...|$|R

Yet, the training content in training organizations for draftsmen, which include Industrial Vocational High Schools, Junior Colleges and Vocational Training Centers etc., {{does not fit}} the industrial factories needs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the essential competency items and their sequence. To achieve this purpose, both theoretical and empirical methods were used, such as document analysis, meetings of experts, and DACUM (Developing A Curriculum). The participants in this study included technicians, content specialists, and professors in the engineering drawing and design field. It was concluded that a total of 68 competency items could be grouped into 15 units. The 15 units are arranged in a sequence. The Geometry Drawing unit is first; it covers basic techniques. The second unit is orthographic Projection Drawing, which covers basic concepts. The CAD system is the third unit. When the learner has learned the basic techniques and basic concepts, he can learn the CAD system and then apply the CAD system skills to learn the other techniques and knowledge. Units 4 to 9 are working drawing units. Units 10 to 15 are professional drawing units. Currently, some of the draftsman in factories still use 2. 5 D CAD software, so the <b>competency</b> items include <b>unit</b> 10. In the future, when all of them use 3 -D software, they can skip unit 10. The results of this study provide a basis not only for curriculum development for engineering drawing education and worker training, but also for improvement in engineering drawing education...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the competencies needed by nursing intern students as identified by their preceptors and nurse educators, who choose to work as registered nurses in intensive care units in Saudi Arabia. The research questions this study investigated were 1) what do nurse preceptors and nurse educators believe are the competencies for new graduates to allow them to work safely in an intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia, 2) what are the competencies they should possess at the end of their internships. 3) Is there a difference between nurse educators and preceptors in the perception of required or expected competencies of the nursing role in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ? Through the Interpretive Description methodology, data were collected through interviews, the guide for which was developed based on the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses standards for critical care nursing practice. The data were analyzed to identify common themes. Themes for intensive care <b>unit</b> <b>competencies</b> included: 1) needed skill competencies; 2) development of knowledge application competencies; and 3) strategies for quality improvement. A notable aspect of this study was the finding that Saudi Arabia, there was agreement among participants that nursing intern students were not prepared to work in ICU immediately after their internship year. Building on participants’ responses, nursing intern students may acquire satisfactory preparation during their internship through continuous evaluation, consistent guidance, extended time period, and orientation. Consequently, it represents a significant contribution to enriching the nursing intern students’ internship outcomes as well as the literature in the context of Saudi Arabia and in advancing the nursing workforce in Intensive Care Units in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the use of {{financial}} sources from structural funds of European Union and with the focus on the operation programme of Entrepreneurship and Innovation {{in the context of the}} regional development support in the troubled regions. The intensity of the absorption of the ent- repreneurial support is analysed according to the criteria set by the government and according to the troubled areas given by the individual regions of the Czech Republic. Whereas the regions sup- ported by the government are given centrally within the Strategy of the regional development of the Czech Republic. The regional level of the troubled areas is set ad hoc. Thus one of the crucial issu- es of this paper is to find potential preferences of the local authorities when deciding about the applications for the entrepreneur subsidies, loans and guaranties. The detailed analysis focuses on subsidies as the only non-profit form of the support. Further question is whether the regions with the intense government support get enough subsidies from entrepreneurial bodies in comparison with other (non-troubled) areas in the Czech Republic. The key documents for the research were the lists of recipients of subsidies in the first half of programme term 2007 – 2013 published by the CzechInvest agency. In total there are more than three thousand approved projects. The analysis covered only those businesses which received the subsidies. This research sample comprised of almost fifteen hundred subjects. Given the fact that the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry publishes the location exclusively on the regional level it was necessary to add the information about the municipality or the place of the business which received the subsidy, to the list of recipients of the subsidies. It was necessary to define the con- cerned areas on the district level or territorial areas of municipalities with extended <b>competencies</b> or territorial <b>units</b> of municipalities chartered by town halls. The data about municipalities was found in the trade register for each subsidised project separately. The relevant data concerning the rese- arch were found in the researcher’s database...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{cross-sectional}} correlational {{study was to examine}} the effects of patient and nursing unit characteristics on nursing-sensitive patient outcomes. The conceptual framework for this study is generated from the Quality Health Outcomes Model. The patient characteristics were patient age, gender, education, duration of illness, severity of illness, and illness representation. The nursing unit characteristics were nurse experience, nurse staffing, nursing <b>unit</b> <b>competency,</b> and group cohesion. Nursing-sensitive patient outcomes were patient’s confidence in self-care and patient’s perception of being well-cared for. Stratified sampling was employed to recruit a sample of 130 hospitalized chronically ill patients in 8 medical care units of 4 hospitals in Thailand. A face-to-face questionnaire interview was used to collect data from patients. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 90. Nurse staffing data were obtained from nursing administrative data for each unit. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships, test a mediator, and analyze the contextual effect of the study variables. Severity of illness (β = -. 315, p <. 01) and illness representation (β = -. 234, p <. 05) were significant predictors of patient’s confidence in self-care, when controlling for nursing unit characteristics. Illness representation partially mediated the relationship between severity of illness and patient’s confidence in self-care. Nursing unit characteristics were not significant predictors of patient’s confidence in self-care, when controlling for patient characteristics. There was a significant individual effect on patient’s confidence in self-care. Severity of illness (r = -. 199, p <. 05) and group cohesion (r = -. 195, p <. 05) were correlated with patient’s perception of being well-cared for. The findings of this study reinforce the need for acute care nurses to be aware of how chronically ill patients perceive health threats since illness representation directly affects patient’s confidence in self-care. Through understanding the role of illness representation as a mediator between severity of illness and confidence in self-care, it is suggested that nurses can improve patient’s confidence in self-care in severely ill patients by providing nursing interventions that promote positive illness representation...|$|R
