40|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{have been used}} to treat {{asphyxia}} in new-born calves and the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of commonly-used stimulant drugs on ventilation, arterial blood gas and acid base variables. A group (n = 18) of new-born (3 – 15 h old) calves were treated in a randomised sequence with doxapram (40 mg, IV), lobeline (5 mg, IV) or prethcamide (5 mL, consisting of 375 mg crotethamide and 375 mg <b>cropropamide,</b> buccally). Blood and spirometric measurements, using an ultrasonic spirometer, were collected prior to and 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 min after administration of each drug. Doxapram caused {{a significant increase in the}} respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow and minute volume (Vmin) during the 90 -min post-treatment study period, although maximum values occurred 1 min after treatment. The Vmin increased from 13. 8 ± 5. 0 L to 28. 5 ± 12. 3 L. Prethcamide, but not lobeline, also caused significant increases in inspiratory and expiratory volumes. The effects of doxapram on ventilation were accompanied by an increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (77. 7 ± 18. 8 mm Hg to 93. 2 ± 23. 7 mm Hg), a decrease in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) (42. 6 ± 4. 9 mm Hg to 33. 1 ± 6. 6 mm Hg), a significant increase in pH and a decrease in bicarbonate concentration and base excess 1 min after treatment. Prethcamide caused a gradual increase in PaO 2 and decrease in PaCO 2 over 90 min, whereas lobeline had no measurable effect on the investigated variables. Of the three treatments, only doxapram had a distinct stimulatory effect on respiration in healthy neonatal calves and may therefore be useful in the treatment of calf asphyxia...|$|E
