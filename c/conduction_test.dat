40|$|Abstract Background Numerous nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} for the electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS), {{with a wide range}} of sensitivity and specificity reported for each test in clinical studies. The tests have not been assessed in population-based studies. Such information would be important when using electrodiagnosis in epidemiologic research. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of various nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> in population-based CTS and determine the properties of the most accurate test. Methods In a population-based study a questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 3, 000 persons. Of 2, 466 responders, 262 symptomatic (numbness/tingling in the radial fingers) and 125 randomly selected asymptomatic responders underwent clinical and electrophysiologic examinations. A standardized hand diagram was administered to the symptomatic persons. At the clinical examination, the examining surgeon identified 94 symptomatic persons as having clinically certain CTS. Nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> were then performed on the symptomatic and the asymptomatic persons by blinded examiners. Analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> in distinguishing the persons with clinically certain CTS from the asymptomatic persons. Results No difference was shown in the diagnostic accuracy of median nerve distal motor latency, digit-wrist sensory latency, wrist-palm sensory conduction velocity, and wrist-palm/forearm sensory conduction velocity ratio (area under curve, 0. 75 – 0. 76). Median-ulnar digit-wrist sensory latency difference had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (area under curve, 0. 80). Using the optimal cutoff value of 0. 8 ms for abnormal sensory latency difference shown on the ROC curve the sensitivity was 70 %, specificity 82 %, positive predictive value 19 % and negative predictive value 98 %. Based on the clinical diagnosis among the symptomatic persons, the hand diagram (classified as classic/probable or possible/unlikely CTS) had high sensitivity but poor specificity. Conclusions Using the clinical diagnosis of CTS as the criterion standard, nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> had moderate sensitivity and specificity and a low positive predictive value in population-based CTS. Measurement of median-ulnar sensory latency difference had the highest diagnostic accuracy. The performance of nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>tests</b> in population-based CTS does not necessarily apply to their performance in clinical settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the point prevalence of neurophysiologically defined median nerve compression and associated carpal tunnel syndrome in a random sample of the general population. The design was a two-stage screening study: (i) a cross-sectional survey to estimate the point prevalence of current hand symptoms; (ii) nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>testing</b> of the median nerve in weighted samples of the survey respondents. The target study population was a random sample of 1000 adults aged between 18 and 75 yr registered with a family practice in the UK. A mailed questionnaire enquired about hand symptoms on the day and included various demographic questions. Weighted random samples were taken based on the hand symptoms reported, and the subjects were invited to attend for motor and sensory median nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>testing.</b> A neurophysiological diagnosis of median nerve compression was made based on a number of diVerent cut-oVs using published criteria. Of those receiving a questionnaire, 79 % responded. A total of 250 responders were invited to attend for nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>testing,</b> of whom 155 (62 %) attended. Non-response to the questionnaire and non-attendance for nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>testing</b> may have biased the prevalence estimates. After adjustment for such biases, a prevalence estimate of between 7 and 16 % was obtained, varying with the diVerent cut-oVs used to define delayed median nerve conduction. Subjects over 54 yr of age had a higher prevalence than younger participants. There was no diVerence in prevalence estimates between men and women.

30|$|Baseline {{pure tone}} audiograms between 250 and 16, 000  Hz will be {{performed}} for all the patients using a KUDU wave audiometer (Geoaxon, Pretoria, South Africa). This is a portable device run by an eMoyo algorithm on a laptop and it obviates {{the need for a}} sound proof booth (Swanepoel et al. 2010). The audiometer uses external audio cups to attenuate environmental noise and intra-aural probe and fore head vibrator to deliver the pure tones. It also monitors ambient sound via an inbuilt microphone and the test is stopped once the environmental sound becomes loud enough to interfere with the examination. A user friendly game pad is also attached to the laptop and user is instructed to press the keys after perceiving the pure tones. This enables the software to plot the user responses directly on an audiogram. The software also prompts the examiner to position the forehead vibrator after completion of the air conduction tests; at the end of both the bone and air <b>conduction</b> <b>test</b> the pure tone average is automatically calculated and a printer friendly audiogram is generated.|$|E
