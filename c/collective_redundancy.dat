Findings: Some headway is made in explaining why {{only a limited number}} of occupations took place against redundancy and restructuring. Practical implications: The method of occupation was not shown to be as effective as might have been thought in opposing redundancies.

40|$|The recent {{litigation}} on <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> rights {{raised a}} number of important issues, all of which centred on whether the national practices in the UK and in Spain were compliant with the relevant EU legislation. The importance of ensuring that the <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> regime operates appropriately has once again reared its head following the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed, and may do again following a vote for Brexit. Inevitably the Court of Justice of the European Union played a pivotal role in interpreting the scope of the legislation, with three distinct and separate challenges to the respective national application of the <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> rights in USDAW, Lyttle and Cañas. This paper will give consideration to the issues raised across these three cases. To this end the primary focus of this paper is on the interpretation of the term ‘establishment’, which is central to the working of the Collective Redundancies Directive. This paper identifies the approach adopted by the CJEU in interpreting this concept, before questioning whether an alternative approach may have been more desirable. The second part of this paper considers questions concerning vertical direct effect of the Directive, and horizontal direct effect of rights that are contained within the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Whilst this paper will be led by the UK position and the decision of the European Court in the USDAW litigation, reference will also be made to the decisions in Lyttle and Cañas where appropriate, given the close nexus between these cases...|$|E

Both sets of provisions dealing with these topics are embodied in the Czech Labour Code and are harmonised with the EU directives pertaining to these fields, specifically Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses (originally, Council Directive 77 / 187 /EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses) and Council Directive 98 / 59 /EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies. The two directives mentioned above were already transposed to the Czech Labour Code in 2001 by means of an amendment adopted under No. 155 / 2001 Coll. As regards the rules governing collective redundancies, it can be stated, in substance, that the original regulation of 2001 remained unchanged and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the {{duration}} of the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU), non-implementation and incorrect transposition of Directives has been commonplace. Coupled with the Court of Justice of the European Union’s refusal to extend the direct effect of Directives to horizontal relationships, and historic difficulties in holding States liable in damages, it has often fallen to the national courts to give effect to EU laws through purposive statutory interpretation. Recent cases involving the <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> of workers in the UK (currently awaiting a ruling from the Court of Justice through the preliminary reference procedure), and the High Court’s assessment of State Liability in the insurance sector, raise questions as to the efficacy of the current system of enforcement of EU law domestically. Despite the problems of access to EU rights experienced by workers in the UK, there appears to be hope that the judiciary is becoming more attuned to the relationship between EU and domestic laws, and are willing to take control of granting access to remedies without necessarily waiting for EU institutions to provide express permission or instruction. 2014 was a particularly important year in this regard. However, a systematic review of the UK’s transposition of EU law and the impact on individuals of the current suite of enforcement mechanisms is required if private enforcement of EU law is to provide the protection workers need and to which they are entitled...|$|E

50|$|The present 2009 Directive updated the Works Council Directive 94/45/EC, {{which in}} the same pattern as now, applied to every firm with over 1000 {{employees}}, and at least 150 employees in a different member state. It stipulated that employees must be informed and consulted on matters closely affecting employment of workers over at least two member states, such as the ‘prospective trend of employment, any substantial change in firms’ organization and production processes and <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> or sales of undertakings.’ In 2005, the EU Commission issued a draft proposal to update the 1995 Directive, noting particularly that while 820 European Works Councils existed, that represented merely 36% of the enterprises falling {{within the scope of}} the directive and around 60% of employees. It also took the position that works councils as they stood were not ‘up to the task of playing their full role in anticipating and managing change and building up a genuine transnational dialogue between management and labour’.

40|$|Video games {{industry}} has recently bonded California and Finland {{in a new}} way and where the employers are recruiting they also {{need to be aware of}} the provisions and procedures related to terminations. In general, collective dismissals are on a relatively high level both in Finland and in California. In California, <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> are regulated under the WARN law. The WARN obligates employers with 75 or more employees to give a 60 -day notice prior to a mass lay off and some other similar events. Employers with less than 75 employees are free to administer the terminations without the WARN notice period. Generally, the California at-will presumption allows employment relationship to be terminated any day with or without reason and without notice period if conditions of collective agreements or employment contract do not limit this right. Termination cannot anyhow be in violation of the anti-discrimination law. In Finland the termination related provisions are part of the Employment Contracts Act and the Act on Co-operation within Undertakings. <b>Collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> are allowed under financial and production related grounds. Small employers with less than 20 employees follow the termination provisions of the Employment Contracts Act and are obligated to inform the employee to be terminated on the details of the termination itself and also the services of the Employment and Economic Development Office. Employers with 20 or more employees are to initiate co-operation procedure under the Act on Co-operation within Undertakings when reducing personnel. The co- operation negotiations are to inform employees on the employer’s plans and financial situation as well as to involve them in the decision making regarding the terminations. The employer’s duty to inform the employees of the services of Employment and Economic Development Office needs to be fulfilled also in terminations under the co-operation procedure. Discrimination is prohibited in Finland in terminations of employment. As an alternative for terminations, employees can for example be transferred to another position or be temporarily laid off. Employer’s duties related to search of alternatives for layoff are broader in Finland than in California. The recent development of the labor laws in Finland and in California suggests that the labor law is not static in either one of these environments but changes can be expected as the needs of the business life so require...|$|R

40|$|The {{competition}} control {{exercised by}} the European Commission {{is defined by}} regulations that are immediately imposed on individuals.

The European Works Council comes into play when multinational groups decide to undertake industrial restructuring. It therefore constitutes a new instrument allowing employee representatives to bring proceedings against any company management that attempts to keep the new representative body out of consultation procedures. The mobilizing of the European Works Council of Renault {{in the face of}} the plan to close the Renault plant in Vilvorde shows how the initiation of legal proceedings relayed and supported the social struggle that lasted several months in 1997.
