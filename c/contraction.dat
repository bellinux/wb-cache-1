5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide <b>contraction.</b> The effect of the lanthanide <b>contraction</b> is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block <b>contraction,</b> which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide <b>contraction</b> but arises from a similar cause.|$|E
5|$|There is much {{interest}} in the coordination chemistry of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide <b>contraction</b> (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide <b>contraction).</b>|$|E

40|$|Involvement of endogeneous {{noradrenaline}} in elevated-K-induced <b>contractions</b> of guinea-pig {{vas deferens}} was investigated. 1) Elevation of K+-concentration to 20 to 30 mM caused spontaneous <b>contractions.</b> These <b>contractions</b> {{were associated with}} a slight depolarization of the membrane and spontaneous spike discharges. 2) Phentolamine blocked the spontaneous <b>contractions</b> whereas guanethidine potentiated them. Tetrodotoxin {{had no effect on}} the spontaneous <b>contractions.</b> 3) Denervated preparations and preparations which had been treated with reserpin also showed spontaneous <b>contractions</b> in response to elevated-K+. However, both phentolamine and guanethidine had no effect on these preparations. 4) Continuous electrical stimulation with alternative current showed <b>contractions</b> which were blocked by tetrodotoxin and phentolamine.

50|$|In an 1982 study, pelvic <b>contractions</b> of 11 {{women who}} {{manually}} self-stimulated to orgasm were monitored using an anal probe and a vaginal probe simultaneously.

Three of the women's orgasms consistently included only a series of regular contractions; for six other women, orgasms consistently continued beyond the regular series with additional irregular <b>contractions.</b> Two women had no regular <b>contractions</b> during reported orgasms.

5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the <b>contraction</b> doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the <b>contraction,</b> but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E

5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a <b>contraction</b> of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and <b>contraction</b> of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and <b>contraction</b> as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. <b>Contraction</b> of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while <b>contraction</b> of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each <b>contraction</b> of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of <b>contraction</b> is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E

Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide <b>contraction.</b> Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle <b>contraction</b> and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle <b>contraction.</b>|$|E
