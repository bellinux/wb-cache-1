25|$|A GSM {{transmission}} is organised as sequences of bursts. In a typical channel {{and in one}} direction, one burst is sent every 4.615 milliseconds and contains 114 bits available for information. A5/1 is used to produce for each burst a 114 bit sequence of keystream which is XORed with the 114 bits prior to modulation. A5/1 is initialised using a 64-bit key together with a publicly known 22-bit frame number. Older fielded GSM implementations using Comp128v1 for key generation, had 10 of the key bits fixed at zero, resulting in an effective key length of 54 bits. This weakness was rectified {{with the introduction of}} Comp128v2 which yields proper 64 bits keys. When operating in GPRS / EDGE mode, higher bandwidth radio modulation allows for larger 348 bits frames, and A5/3 is then used in a stream <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> to maintain confidentiality.|$|E

5000|$|Besides the AES cipher, SRTP {{allows the}} ability to disable {{encryption}} outright, using the so-called [...] "NULL cipher", which can be assumed as the second supported cipher (or the third supported <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> in sum). In fact, the NULL cipher does not perform any encryption (i.e. the encryption algorithm functions as the identity function, and copies the input stream to the output stream without any changes). It is mandatory for this <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> to be implemented in any SRTP-compatible system. As such, {{it can be used}} when the confidentiality guarantees ensured by SRTP are not required, while other SRTP features (such as authentication and message integrity) may be used.|$|E
50|$|Ciphertext {{stealing}} for ECB mode {{requires the}} plaintext to be longer than one block. A possible workaround {{is to use}} a stream cipher-like block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of operation when the plaintext length is one block or less, such as the CTR, CFB or OFB modes.|$|E
50|$|In cryptography, {{ciphertext}} stealing (CTS) is {{a general}} method of using a block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of operation that allows for processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, {{at the cost of}} slightly increased complexity.|$|E
50|$|Ciphering is a radio {{resource}} function and managed with messages in the {{radio resource}} sublayer of L3, but ciphering is tied to authentication because the ciphering key Kc is generated in that process. Ciphering is initiated with the RR <b>Ciphering</b> <b>Mode</b> Command message, which indicates the A5 variant to be used. The MS starts ciphering and responds with the RR <b>Ciphering</b> <b>Mode</b> Complete message in ciphertext.|$|R
50|$|The block <b>cipher</b> <b>modes</b> ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, and XTS provide confidentiality, {{but they}} do not protect against {{accidental}} modification or malicious tampering. Modification or tampering can be detected with a separate message authentication code such as CBC-MAC, or a digital signature. The cryptographic community recognized the need for dedicated integrity assurances and NIST responded with HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC. HMAC was approved in 2002 as FIPS 198, The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), CMAC was released in 2005 under SP800-38B, Recommendation for Block <b>Cipher</b> <b>Modes</b> of Operation: The CMAC Mode for Authentication, and GMAC was formalized in 2007 under SP800-38D, Recommendation for Block <b>Cipher</b> <b>Modes</b> of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{results of}} fast {{implementations}} of all five AES nal candidates using Virtex Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Arrays are presented and analyzed. Performance of several alternative hardware architectures is discussed and compared. One architecture optimum {{from the point}} of view of the throughput to area ratio is selected for each of the two major types of block <b>cipher</b> <b>modes.</b> For feedback <b>cipher</b> <b>modes,</b> all AES c ndidates have been implemented using the basic iterative architecture, and achieved speeds ranging from 61 Mbit/s for Mars to 431 Mbit/s for Serpent. For non-feedback <b>cipher</b> <b>modes,</b> four AES candidates have been implemented using a high-throughput architecture with pipelining inside and outside of cipher rounds, and achieved speeds ranging from 12. 2 Gbit/s for Rijndael to 16. 8 Gbit/s for Serpent. A new methodology for a fair comparison of the hardware performance of secret-key block ciphers has been developed and contrasted with methodology used by the NSA team. 1...|$|R
50|$|In {{principle}} any block-oriented block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> {{of operation}} can be used, but stream-cipher-like modes can already {{be applied to}} messages of arbitrary length without padding, so they do not benefit from this technique. The common modes of operation that are coupled with ciphertext stealing are Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} of hidden encrypted data may be revealed by {{flaws in the}} implementation. It may also be revealed by a so-called 'watermarking attack' if an inappropriate <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> is used.The {{existence of}} the data may be revealed by it 'leaking' into non-encrypted disk space [...] {{where it can be}} detected by forensic tools.|$|E
5000|$|The MSC/VLR {{forwards}} the Kc for the MS to the BSS. The Kc is NOT sent {{across the}} Air Interface to the MS. The BSS stores the Kc and forwards the Set <b>Cipher</b> <b>Mode</b> command to the MS. The CIPH_MOD_CMD only tells the MS which encryption to use (A5/X), no other information is included.|$|E

Its security model is extensible to support new security mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|Block ciphers take {{a number}} of bits and encrypt them as a single unit, padding the {{plaintext}} {{so that it is}} a multiple of the block size. Blocks of 64 bits were commonly used. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm approved by NIST in December 2001, and the GCM block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of operation use 128-bit blocks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{optimized}} cipher feedback mode (OCFB), {{the statistical}} self-synchronization mode, and the [...] "one-bit CFB mode" [...] also expand small bit-slip errors into a longer burst of errors, but eventually recover and produce the correct decrypted plaintext.A bit-slip error when using any other block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of operation generally results in complete {{corruption of the}} rest of the message.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{modes of}} operation, ECB, CBC, OFB, and CFB (see below for all), {{date back to}} 1981 and were specified in FIPS 81, DES Modes of Operation. In 2001, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including AES as a block cipher and adding CTR mode in SP800-38A, Recommendation for Block <b>Cipher</b> <b>Modes</b> of Operation. Finally, in January, 2010, NIST added XTS-AES in SP800-38E, Recommendation for Block <b>Cipher</b> <b>Modes</b> of Operation: The XTS-AES Mode for Confidentiality on Storage Devices. Other confidentiality modes exist which have not been approved by NIST. For example, CTS is ciphertext stealing mode and available in many popular cryptographic libraries.|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, CWC Mode (Carter-Wegman + CTR mode) is an AEAD block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of {{operation}} that provides both encryption and built-in message integrity, similar to CCM and OCB modes.

In both cases, since the Air Interface is now in <b>cipher</b> <b>mode,</b> the TMSI is not compromised.|$|E
50|$|In cryptography, a block <b>cipher</b> <b>mode</b> of {{operation}} is an algorithm {{that uses a}} block cipher to provide an information service such as confidentiality or authenticity.A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block.
