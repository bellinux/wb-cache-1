40|$|The side <b>crushing</b> <b>test</b> is {{commonly}} used to characterize the mechanical strength of catalyst supports.

A better analysis of the <b>crushing</b> <b>test,</b> altogether with {{a comparison of the}} results obtained with the three-Point Bending test (3 PB) and an analysis of the defects present within the supports, provide a better interpretation of their crushing strength data.

40|$|Bayes’s Theorem. Bayes’s theorem is {{elementary}} probability; {{its application}} to the world involves a conceptual struggle of the first magnitude. Several hypotheses compete to explain the available experimental evidence. The data are accumulated; the evidence is at hand. Which hypothesis is indicated? The decision can be quite serious. Here is an artificial but illuminating example. Two kinds of structural material are made. The good one is reasonably strong; the bad one fails considerably more often. A sample of material is delivered, but its composition is unknown. Thus there are two hypotheses: G that it is good, or B that it is bad. It is vital to know which hypothesis is true. William G. Faris is professor of mathematics at the University of Arizona, Tucson. His email address is faris@ math. arizona. edu. The probability that the good material survives a <b>crush</b> <b>test</b> {{is known to be}} P(S | G) = 5 / 6. The probability that the bad material survives the same <b>crush</b> <b>test</b> is only P(S | B) = 1 / 3. The experimental fact is at hand: the sample passed the <b>crush</b> <b>test.</b> What can we say about the material? To get some mathematics out of the way, here is Bayes’s theorem in its most elementary form. (A more general version comes later in this review.) There are hypotheses θ with “prior ” probabilities P H (θ). For each hypothesis θ there is a conditional probability P(x | θ) for each data point x. The unconditional probabilities for the data points are then (1) P(x) = ∑ P(x | θ) P H (θ). θ Bayes’s theorem states that the “posterior ” conditional probability of hypothesis θ given the observed data point x is (2) P H (θ | x) = P(x | θ) P H (θ) P(x) It is little more than the definition of conditional probability. The theorem can also be written in terms of the normalized likelihood function ˆ f (x, θ) defined by (3) P(x | θ) = ˆ f (x, θ) P(x). The Bayes result is then that (4) P H (θ | x) = ˆ f (x, θ) P H (θ) ...|$|E

Today transit buses are an {{integral}} part of the national transportation system. According to National Transportation Statistics from 1990 to 2002, the number of transit motor buses in the U. S. has increased 30 percent. Although buses are one of the safest means of transportation, occupant injuries and fatalities in bus crashes do occur. Rollover strength has become an important issue for bus and coach manufacturers. Today European regulation “ECE-R 66 ” is in force to prevent catastrophic rollover accidents. The Standard Bus Procurement Guidelines (SBPG) of the American Public Transit Association (APTA) also mentions the roof <b>crush</b> <b>test</b> for the assessment of bus superstructure and roof. This thesis discusses the development of a finite element (FE) model of a bus, and the analysis of its roof crush and rollover in LS-DYNA. The FE model was validated for the roof <b>crush</b> <b>test</b> carried according to the standard bus procurement guidelines (SBPG). ADAMS-View software was used to simulate the rollover of the bus. Bus accelerations, velocities, and its angle with the ground just before impact were measured in ADAMS and then used as input for the LSDYNA analysis. According to the ECE-R 66 regulation, a passenger’s survival space is defined in the bus model to check whether there is any intrusion into the survival space during or after the rollover. This ensures that the bus structure has sufficient strength to avoid intrusions into the survival space. The effect of passengers’ weight on energy absorbed by the bus structures during rollover is also discussed. Development of the MADYMO bus model and its rollover simulations were also included in this research. Dummy kinematics and injuries sustained during rollover for various seated and standing positions were studied as well...|$|E
