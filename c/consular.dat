5|$|Cicero, upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately {{moved to}} strike a deal with his <b>consular</b> colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich <b>consular</b> province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|The Senate, {{alarmed by}} the size of the revolt and the defeat of the praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, {{dispatched}} a pair of <b>consular</b> legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Initially, the <b>consular</b> armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly <b>consular</b> legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two <b>consular</b> legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch <b>consular</b> service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the <b>consular</b> and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeated}} <b>consular</b> armies {{fell back}} to Rome to regroup while Spartacus' followers moved northward. The consuls again engaged Spartacus {{somewhere in the}} Picenum region, and once again were defeated.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his <b>consular</b> duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for <b>Consular</b> Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the <b>consular</b> representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E
5|$|Browne and Arnett {{were called}} in for five hours of {{questioning}} on the following day. Arnett {{was accompanied by a}} British embassy official who, reflecting Arnett's New Zealand citizenship, provided <b>consular</b> assistance on behalf of Wellington. In the end, Diem agreed to have the charges against Browne and Arnett dropped after hours of heated argument with US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, who had returned from his vacation.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{scientist}} and diplomat Prince Aleksey Borisovich Lobanov-Rostovsky was appointed as the Empire's representative in Vienna. In 1891 he bought several houses on Reisnerstraße from Adolphe I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, the former Duke of Nassau, which still houses the embassy and <b>consular</b> section in Vienna, {{and he also}} began construction of the Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In 446BC, quaestors, administrators {{with wide}} terms of reference, were first elected; {{and the office}} of censor was created to {{administer}} the census in 443BC. However, the creation of the censors also was concurrent with the practice of electing military tribunes with <b>consular</b> authority, which, while open to the plebs, stalled efforts to reform the consulate itself.|$|E
5|$|In 608, general Heraclius the Elder, Exarch of Africa, revolted, urged on by Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and {{son-in-law}} of Phocas. Heraclius proclaimed {{himself and}} his son {{of the same name}} as consulsthereby implicitly claiming the imperial titleand minted coins with the two wearing the <b>consular</b> robes.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the <b>consular</b> position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his <b>consular</b> imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was {{the final}} war between Rome and Macedon and began when Andriscus usurped the Macedonian throne. The Romans raised a <b>consular</b> army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, who swiftly {{defeated}} Andriscus at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over <b>consular</b> decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The last {{king of the}} Roman Kingdom, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, {{was overthrown}} in 509 BC {{by a group of}} noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus. Tarquin made a number of {{attempts}} to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives. The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic involved a new form of chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term. Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. <b>Consular</b> political powers, when exercised conjointly with a <b>consular</b> colleague, were no {{different from those of the}} old king.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{instructions}} from the Ministry of Justice (Dirección General de Registros y Notariado), Spanish Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the <b>Consular</b> demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as {{at least one of the}} partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|According to this {{traditional}} account, Rome had been {{ruled by a}} succession of kings. The Romans believed that this era, that of the Roman kingdom, began in 753 BC and ended in 510 BC. After {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy and the establishment of the Republic, the people of Rome began electing two consuls each year. According to the <b>consular</b> fasti, a list of the consuls going back to the foundation of the Republic, the first consuls were chosen in 509 BC.|$|E
5|$|After {{law school}} {{he passed the}} bar and began {{practicing}} law in Portland, Oregon in 1939. He {{found it hard to}} find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several <b>Consular</b> attachés at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with <b>consular</b> power.|$|E
5|$|As {{the host}} of the United Nations, the borough is home to the world's largest {{international}} <b>consular</b> corps, comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates. It is also the home of New York City Hall, the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor of New York City and the New York City Council. The mayor's staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, completed in 1914, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.|$|E
5|$|Carney {{began his}} Foreign Service Officer career in Vietnam in 1967 as a {{rotation}} officer based in Saigon for biographic and youth affairs and for commercial matters. He was then stationed in Lesotho as {{second of two}} officers in charge of <b>consular,</b> political and economic affairs until 1971. In 1972, he was appointed Second Secretary at the U.S. Mission in Phnom Penh, {{before returning to the}} United States to study at Cornell University in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, <b>consular</b> ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his <b>consular</b> colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E
5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US <b>consular</b> official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Rice {{was criticized}} in attack ads for his support, {{as mayor of}} Glendale, {{of the use of}} Mexican-issued matricula <b>consular</b> cards as legal forms of {{identification}} for use by immigrants. In his campaign, Rice outlined his top legislative priorities as public safety, economic security, and quality of life. Rice was regarded by both conservative and liberal observers as a moderate Democrat, {{and is a member of}} the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his <b>consular</b> curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E
5|$|In 179 BC Philip died. His {{talented and}} ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed {{interest}} in conquering Greece. With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second <b>consular</b> army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to stand for the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with <b>consular</b> authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to sit in a curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|In 498, as the Empire's nominal vice-regent in Italy, Theoderic {{had been}} granted the right to {{nominate}} the Western candidate for each year's <b>consular</b> pair. He was however bounded by a restriction: to select only a Roman citizen for the position. To advance Eutharic's standing in the world Theoderic wished him to be made consul for the year 519. To get around the restriction imposed on his nominations, and as a favour to Theoderic, Justin himself nominated Eutharic.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with <b>consular</b> appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{began to}} make common cause with the Optimates, the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony {{in a series of}} speeches portraying him {{as a threat to the}} Republican order. With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of <b>consular</b> power nearing its end, Antony {{attempted}} to pass laws that would lend him control over Cisalpine Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January AD 13, Tiberius held {{a triumph}} for their {{victory over the}} Pannonians and Dalmatians, that he had {{postponed}} {{on account of the}} defeat of Varus at Teutoburg Forest. He was accompanied by Germanicus among his other generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia, and Germanicus took a distinguished part in the celebration. He was given the opportunity to display his <b>consular</b> insignia and his triumphal ornaments whereas his brother Drusus received no special honors except being the son of a triumphator.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{held off}} Hannibal in three battles, but then Hannibal smashed a {{succession}} of Roman <b>consular</b> armies. By this time Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively on the Metaurus River. Unable to defeat Hannibal on Italian soil, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa under Scipio Africanus to threaten the Carthaginian capital. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, and defeated at the Battle of Zama.|$|E
