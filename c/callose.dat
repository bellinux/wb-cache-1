5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a <b>callose</b> ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple <b>callose</b> (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are {{produced}} from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or meiocyte), after meiotic division. After {{the formation of the}} four microspores, which are contained by <b>callose</b> walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The <b>callose</b> wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to cytokinesis, whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.|$|E

Protophloem itself appears in the mid-vein extending into the cotyledonary node, which constitutes the first appearance of a leaf in angiosperms, where it forms continuous strands. The hormone auxin, transported by the protein PIN1 is responsible for the growth of those protophloem strands, signaling the final identity of those tissues. SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165/166 also participate in that process, while <b>Callose</b> Synthase 3(CALS3), inhibits the locations where SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165 can go.|$|E

2500|$|Sieve {{elements}} are {{the type of}} cell {{that are responsible for}} transporting sugars throughout the plant. [...] At maturity they lack a nucleus and have very few organelles, so they rely on companion cells or albuminous cells for most of their metabolic needs. Sieve tube cells do contain vacuoles and other organelles, such as ribosomes, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which {{can be found at the}} plasma membrane, often nearby the plasmodesmata that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells. All sieve cells have groups of pores at their ends that grow from modified and enlarged plasmodesmata, called sieve areas. The pores are reinforced by platelets of a polysaccharide called <b>callose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Callose</b> is a plant polysaccharide. It is {{composed}} of glucose residues linked together through β-1,3-linkages, and is termed a &beta;-glucan. It {{is thought to be}} manufactured at the cell wall by <b>callose</b> synthases and is degraded by β-1,3-glucanases. It is laid down at plasmodesmata, at the cell plate during cytokinesis and during pollen development. It is produced in response to wounding, infection by pathogens., aluminium and abscisic acid. Deposits often appear on the sieve plates {{at the end of the}} growing season. [...] <b>Callose</b> also forms immediately around the developing meiocytes and tetrads of sexually reproducing angiosperms but is not found in related apomictic taxa. <b>Callose</b> deposition at the cell wall has been suggested as an early marker for direct somatic embryogenesis from cortical and epidermal cells of Cichorium hybrids.|$|E

[...] The next component to be added is <b>callose,</b> which is polymerized directly at the cell plate by <b>callose</b> synthases. As the cell plate continues to mature and fuses with the parental plasma membrane, the <b>callose</b> is slowly replaced with cellulose, the primary component of a mature cell wall 6.

50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{may have}} {{between one and}} thirteen flowers.

The tepal-tube may vary from obsolete to being {{more than half the}} length of the perigone. When a paraperigone is present it consists of basal appendages that are diminutive, membranous, bristle-like, and forming a fimbriate-lacerate or <b>callose</b> ring, partly adnate to the throat of the perigone, surrounding the fascicle of the stamen.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} {{pathogenesis}} to occur, a viable pathogen, susceptible host, and conducive environment must simultaneously be present. The germ tube of P. macularis {{plays an important}} role in determining the pathogen’s viability, because it can penetrate its host in approximately 15 hours. The germ tube begins branching, leading to as many as three potentially conidia-forming germ tubes. As the pathogen invades host tissue, it establishes a haustorium to facilitate the collection of nutrients from the host cells. Despite this invasion, only certain hosts are susceptible, because there are seven R genes in hop varieties that can be activated in response to infection. Many of them operate by either causing the initial haustorium to lyse, or by preventing the pathogen from spreading. The spread is stopped by a hypersensitive response, which is often associated with the establishment of large <b>callose</b> and lignin deposits surrounding infected cells. Although susceptible plants can increase <b>callose</b> and lignin deposits in response to infection, the hypersensitive response is only found in resistant varieties. Finally, although powdery mildew can grow in a relatively hot and dry environment compared to downy mildew, conidia production peaks at temperatures of approximately 20oC. Conidia can be produced at temperatures above 25oC, but their infectivity is often reduced.|$|E
50|$|Phloem is {{an equally}} {{important}} plant tissue as {{it also is}} part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In {{spite of the fact that}} their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called <b>callose,</b> a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. <b>Callose</b> stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.|$|E

5000|$|Haplomitrium has {{a number}} of unique {{characters}} that distinguish it from other liverworts, such as lacking rhizoids. The vegetative stems possess a central water-conducting strand with large perforations derived from plasmodesmata. [...] This central strand is surrounded by a cylinder of cells that conduct food throughout the plant. Such an arrangement is evocative of the xylem and phloem found in vascular plants. Although some thalloid liverwort species in the Pallaviciniaceae also possess a central conducting strand, Haplomitrium differs in having a food-conducting layer and in producing no <b>callose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cellulose and chitin are {{examples}} of structural polysaccharides. Cellulose {{is used in the}} cell walls of plants and other organisms, and {{is said to be the}} most abundant organic molecule on Earth. It has many uses such as a significant role in the paper and textile industries, and is used as a feedstock for the production of rayon (via the viscose process), cellulose acetate, celluloid, and nitrocellulose. Chitin has a similar structure, but has nitrogen-containing side branches, increasing its strength. It is found in arthropod exoskeletons and in the cell walls of some fungi. It also has multiple uses, including surgical threads. Polysaccharides also include <b>callose</b> or laminarin, chrysolaminarin, xylan, arabinoxylan, mannan, fucoidan and galactomannan.|$|E

50|$|The cytoplasmic sleeve is a fluid-filled space {{enclosed}} by the plasmalemma {{and is a}} continuous extension of the cytosol. Trafficking of molecules and ions through plasmodesmata occurs through this space. Smaller molecules (e.g. sugars and amino acids) and ions can easily pass through plasmodesmata by diffusion {{without the need for}} additional chemical energy. Larger molecules, including proteins (for example green fluorescent protein) and RNA, can also pass through the cytoplasmic sleeve diffusively. Plasmodesmatal transport of some larger molecules is facilitated by mechanisms that are currently unknown. One mechanism of regulation of the permeability of plasmodesmata is the accumulation of the polysaccharide <b>callose</b> around the neck region to form a collar, thereby reducing the diameter of the pore available for transport of substances.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{presence}} of a cell wall, cytokinesis in plant cells is significantly different from that in animal cells, Rather than forming a contractile ring, plant cells construct a cell plate {{in the middle of the}} cell. The stages of cell plate formation include (1) creation of the phragmoplast, an array of microtubules that guides and supports the formation of the cell plate; (2) trafficking of vesicles to the division plane and their fusion to generate a tubular-vesicular network; (3) continued fusion of membrane tubules and their transformation into membrane sheets upon the deposition of <b>callose,</b> followed by deposition of cellulose and other cell wall components; (4) recycling of excess membrane and other material from the cell plate; and (5) fusion with the parental cell wall ...|$|E
5000|$|Invasion of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides" [...] in wheat initiates with {{release of}} enzyme for {{breaking}} the plant cell wall. A specific sequence of enzymes is employed; without these enzymes the fungus {{would not be able}} to invade the plant cell.

Then Pectin, cellulase, hemicellulase and protease enzymes are released to enable invasion into the host cell. Now the fungus is present in the plant stem, it causes disease by affecting nutrient and water supply to upper parts of the plant, weakening the plant stem.In some cases beta, 1-3 glycan synthase is also released to penetrate the <b>callose</b> matrix.|$|E
50|$|Grapevine yellows (GY) are {{diseases}} {{associated to}} phytoplasmas {{that occur in}} many grape growing areas worldwide and are of still increasing significance. Almost identical symptoms of the GY syndrome are caused by different phytoplasmas and appear on leaves, shoots and clusters of grapevine. Typical symptoms include discoloration and necrosis of leaf veins and leaf blades, downward curling of leaves, lack or incomplete lignification of shoots, stunting and necrosis of shoots, abortion of inflorescences and shrivelling of berries. Those symptoms are related to <b>callose</b> deposition at the sieve plates and subsequent degeneration of the phloem. Although no resistant cultivars of Vitis vinifera or rootstocks are known so far, the various grape varieties differ considerably as far as symptom severity is concerned. It ranges from fast decline and death in highly susceptible cultivars to tolerant rootstocks as symptomless carriers of the pathogen.|$|E

50|$|In {{phase one}} of the HR, the {{activation}} of R genes triggers an ion flux, involving an efflux of hydroxide and potassium outside the cells, and an influx of calcium and hydrogen ions into the cell. In phase two, the cells involved in the HR generate an oxidative burst by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and nitrous oxide. These compounds affect cellular membrane function, in part by inducing lipid peroxidation and by causing lipid damage. The alteration of ion components in the cell, and the breakdown of cellular components {{in the presence of}} ROS, results in the death of affected cells and the formation of local lesions. Reactive oxygen species also trigger the deposition of lignin and <b>callose,</b> as well as the cross-linking of pre-formed hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins such as P33 to the wall matrix via the tyrosine in the PPPPY motif.
