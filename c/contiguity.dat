5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's <b>contiguity</b> with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's <b>contiguity</b> with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, {{mountains}} and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all-time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a twelve-year absence, {{and have}} since {{expanded}} into southern Norway. As of 2005, {{the total number}} of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven breeding pairs. The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland's <b>contiguity</b> with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population of wolves. Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply. Since 2011, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries. In 2016, a female wolf tracked 550 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 2012 {{for the first time in}} 200 years. Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 130 years.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its <b>contiguity</b> with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E

25|$|In particular, {{associative}} learning, {{which is}} another type of episodic memory, is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} aging, and this has been demonstrated across various study paradigms. This has been explained by the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (ADH), which states that aging is associated with a deficiency in creating and retrieving links between single units of information. This can include knowledge about context, events or items. The ability to bind pieces of information together with their episodic context in a coherent whole has been reduced in the elderly population. Furthermore, the older adults’ performances in free recall involved temporal <b>contiguity</b> to a lesser extent than for younger people, indicating that associations regarding <b>contiguity</b> become weaker with age.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} of the 9th century marked a {{significant}} increase in papal influence in the Southeastern Europe. Pope John VIII complained to Domagoj about the obstinacy of Patriarch Ignatius who denied his jurisdiction over Bulgaria and appointed a new Archbishop. The Pope also requested from Dukes Zdeslav and Branimir assistance and protection for his legates who were crossing Croatia on their way to Bulgaria.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} have cast {{doubts about the}} original pertinence of the latter to the necropolis, in that the only evidence in favour of this fact would be the spatial <b>contiguity</b> between the statues and the mortuary complex itself. This led others to hypothesize that the statues had been conceived as telamons to adorn a temple, close to the necropolis but dedicated to the Sardus Pater. According to this theory, the temple with statues would have been erected to commemorate nuragic victories against the Carthaginian invaders, during the sardo-punic wars. In this case the statues would have portrayed the retinue or the bodyguards of the god himself.|$|E
40|$|Development {{of pattern}} vision in {{neonatal}} mammals requires prolonged exposure to certain <b>contiguities</b> of stimulation according to Riesen (1958) and Hebb (1949). Consistent with this viewpoint are many studies reviewed by these authors demonstrating that certain mammals deprived of patterned visual stimulation {{early in life}} show deficiencies in visualspatial performance when compared with normally reared animals. However, Riesen (1958) and Riesen and Aarons (1959) have demonstrated similar deficits in a chimpanzee and in kittens reared with visual stimulation from nearby objects but deprived of the opportunity for gross bodily movement in 'their presence.

Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published {{in some of the}} leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, Jewish <b>Contiguities</b> and the Soundtrack of Israeli History, appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. Jewish <b>Contiguities</b> has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award.|$|R

25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area.

Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E

25|$|One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors {{has been}} to {{establish}} a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precedes by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) {{has changed over the}} centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. The temporal <b>contiguity</b> of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids was considered a quasi-experimental support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and geomagnetic activity. The hypothesis was recently criticized by a prominent blogger. Persinger has estimated that the total biomass of the planet was equivalent to the accumulated solar energy (solar constant) on the Earth’s surface. The shared photon origin was considered one source for “entanglement” between living systems.|$|E

500|$|While Section 2 and Section 5 {{prohibit}} jurisdictions from drawing electoral {{districts that}} dilute {{the votes of}} protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the justiciability of affirmative [...] "racial gerrymandering" [...] claims in Shaw v. Reno (1993). In Miller v. Johnson (1995), the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the [...] "predominant factor" [...] in determining how to draw district lines. For race to [...] "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include [...] "compactness, <b>contiguity,</b> [...] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests." [...] If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated, then the redistricting plan is considered [...] "racially gerrymandered" [...] and must be subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning that the redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional {{only if it is}} narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. In Bush v.
