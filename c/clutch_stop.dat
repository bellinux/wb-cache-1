5000|$|... "A nice {{smooth running}} little car". During {{acceleration}} {{there is a}} low periodic noise as of escaping steam which disappears once under way and the car runs silently. Smooth running requires a very particular adjustment of the ignition and throttle controls. Rover maintains its prejudice against foot operated accelerators. The engine will pick up from standstill on top gear if the clutch is made to slip a little. There {{is a very powerful}} <b>clutch</b> <b>stop</b> which requires a gear change to be made in one rapid movement. If the change is missed {{it will be necessary to}} stop the car to engage any gear. If Rover fitted an accelerator pedal it would satisfy all opinions.|$|E
5000|$|Lap 80: The <b>clutch</b> <b>stopped</b> {{functioning}} on Sam Sommers' vehicle ...|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} {{is located in}} the clutch cover. Here a band {{tensions}} around the <b>Clutch</b> drum <b>stopping</b> the chain within milliseconds. The chain brake is released by the upper handle with the hand or wrist. The brake is intended to be used in kick-back moments.|$|R
5000|$|Dark Parables: The Final Cinderella is {{the fifth}} {{installment}} in the Dark Parables franchise, and was released on May 23, 2013. Set in the Matese mountains of southern Italy. For decades, a mysterious witch, known as [...] "Godmother", has been hunting maidens, {{in search of the}} legendary [...] "Cinderella"; a pure-hearted maiden. Play as the fabled detective, venture into the mirror world to rescue this Final Cinderella alongside Pinocchio, from the evil Godmother's <b>clutches,</b> and <b>stop</b> her evil plans to steal the girl's pure soul! ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{symptom of}} the fan <b>clutch</b> failing to <b>stop</b> in cold weather is that the fan sounds excessively noisy and fuel consumption increases. You may find that the car heater blows lukewarm air but never delivers sufficient hot air but as this is also controlled by the cooling system thermostat it's not the best indicator.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its double surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth and its boat hull made from either fibreglass or carbon fibre and Kevlar. Its [...] span Hazard wing has struts and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame weight-shift control bar. The powerplant is a twin cylinder, liquid-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition [...] Rotax 582 engine or a four-cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four-stroke, dual-ignition [...] Rotax 912UL engine or a [...] converted Smart Car four stroke turbocharged engine. All engines are fitted with a <b>clutch</b> that <b>stops</b> the propeller from turning when the engine is at idle to permit water handling. The boat hull features a water rudder.|$|R
50|$|The ways {{in which}} a car can stall is usually down to the driver, {{especially}} on manual transmission. For instance if a driver engages the clutch too quickly while stationary then the engine will stall; engaging the <b>clutch</b> slowly will <b>stop</b> this from happening. Stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress the clutch and/or change to neutral while coming to a stop. Stalling can be dangerous, especially in heavy traffic.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The <b>clutch</b> brake <b>stops</b> the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R
50|$|Ron Gillard, in a Cooper S, and Bob Morris, in a Corolla, battled {{during the}} early phases of the race before the Corolla's <b>clutch</b> failed. Morris <b>stopped</b> {{at the top of}} the circuit, {{planning}} to coast down to the finish on the final lap. However, the car stopped fifty yards short of the finish line and Morris had to push it to the finish. With Jane's retirement, Geoghegan took the lead in the points standings while Hamilton moved up to second place.|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} starts, the car pauses for 11 s - if {{equipped}} with a manual gearbox, 6 s in neutral (with clutch engaged) and 5 s in the 1st gear (with clutch disengaged) - then slowly accelerates to 15 km/h in 4 s, cruises at constant speed for 8 s, brakes to a full stop in 5 s (manual: last 3 s with <b>clutch</b> disengaged), then <b>stops</b> for 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, then 5 s in the 1st gear).|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the <b>clutch</b> plate <b>stop</b> receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, Suzuki {{launched}} Suzuki Ertiga Diesel ZDi Hybrid in Indonesia {{with mild}} hybrid technology. Different with full hybrid technology which uses Lithium batterry, Suzuki uses mild hybrid technology and is called as Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki (SHVS) with only uses bigger regular cheap accumulator 70 AH, combines with Integrated Starter Generator which can restart the engine after the car stop (and also stop the engine) with just press the <b>clutch</b> pedal (start <b>stop</b> system). The system is also can give more accelaration when needed.|$|R
60|$|On this memorable day I had {{scarcely}} trolled {{half a mile}} {{out into}} the Stream before I felt that inexplicable rap at my bait which swordfish and sailfish make with their bills. I jumped up and got ready. I saw a long bronze shape back of my bait. Then I saw and felt him take hold. He certainly did not encounter the slightest resistance in running out my line. He swam off slowly. I never had Sam throw out the <b>clutch</b> and <b>stop</b> the boat until after I had hooked the fish. I wanted the boat to keep moving, so if I did {{get a chance to}} strike at a fish it would be with a tight line. These sailfish are wary and this procedure is difficult. If the fish had run off swiftly I would have struck sooner. Everything depends on how he takes the bait. This fellow took fifty feet of line before I hooked him.|$|R
5|$|The second {{match was}} a Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match started {{back and forth}} until Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the casket. 'Taker applied the {{triangle}} choke until Gene Snitsky interfered and attacked 'Taker. Snitsky and Heidenreich attacked The Undertaker and called for the casket to be opened but Kane was revealed to be inside the casket. He attacked Snitsky and Heidenreich and fought Snitsky throughout the arena. Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the steel steps and pushed the casket into him. Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket after applying the cobra <b>clutch</b> but 'Taker <b>stopped</b> the lid from closing with his arm. Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket again but 'Taker countered. 'Taker executed a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver and put Heidenreich in the casket to win the match.|$|R
50|$|Volkswagen {{began using}} {{start-stop}} systems with the Polo Formel E with SSA around 1983. Later the LUPO 3L, {{and after that}} in the Polo, Golf and Passat BlueMotion, which also include weight and aerodynamic improvements. The system is now commonplace in the Volkswagen range, fitted to all vehicles with the Bluemotion Technology package, though certain other models have the technology too. For the Lupo 3L, with an automated manual gearbox and <b>clutch,</b> the engine <b>stops</b> four seconds after the car becomes stationary with the driver's foot on the brake pedal. No other action is necessary. Removing the foot from the brake pedal initiates engine start and the car can be driven away. The gear lever remains in the drive D position throughout. The same applies to the Audi A2 1.2TDi, which is almost identical mechanically.|$|R
