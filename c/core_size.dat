25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in <b>core</b> <b>size</b> and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large <b>core</b> <b>size</b> is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The <b>core</b> <b>size</b> consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E

40|$|Lauric acid coated {{iron oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} (LAIONPs) is very promising in biomedical applications. Understanding the influences from synthesis processes on physiochemical properties of LAIONPs {{is very important}} for their implementations in in vivo and in vitro studies. Here, the superparamagnetic spherical-shaped LAIONPs samples have been prepared based on coprecipitation method (CP-LAIONPs) and through thermal decomposition using FeO(OH) as iron precursor (TD-LAIONPs), respectively. The effects of different stirring speeds in coprecipitation reaction and different heating profiles in thermal decomposition route on the products properties (including size, mass ratio of surfactants, and saturation magnetization) were revealed. For nanoparticles with similar <b>cores</b> <b>sizes</b> (∼ 11 nm) obtained from two different synthesis methods, the TD-LAIONPs showed more spherical morphologies, narrower size distributions in both <b>core</b> <b>sizes</b> and hydrodynamic sizes, and stronger magnetic properties than the CP-LAIONPs.
