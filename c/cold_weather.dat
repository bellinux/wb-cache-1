5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> at Cape Canaveral.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway's {{passenger}} coaches, {{dating from}} 1870 and designed for underground use within London, were not fitted with heating until 1895.

5|$|The summit {{station of}} Mount Washington has an alpine climate or tundra climate (Köppen ET), {{although}} it receives an extremely high amount of precipitation, atypical for most regions with such <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> Lower elevations have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc).|$|E

5|$|Tiku's {{military}} actions {{were based on}} the experience he had gained fighting the other lords. The Dutch and their mixed native forces, on the other hand, underestimated Tiku's forces and were unable to cope with the <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> of the high altitudes.|$|E

When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> and malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

The need for soldiers in real operations and training meant that, in the end, a lot of the preparation never occurred.|$|E
