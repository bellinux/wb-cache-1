30|$|The {{cellobiose}} lipid of Cryptococcus humicola, 16 -(tetra-O-acetyl-β-cellobiosyloxy)- 2 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, is {{a natural}} fungicide. Sensitivity of the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the fungicide depends on a carbon source. Cellobiose lipid concentrations inducing the leakage of potassium ions and ATP were similar for the cells grown in the medium with glucose and ethanol. However, the cells grown on glucose and ethanol died at 0.05 mg ml- 1 and 0.2 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid, respectively. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) synthesis was 65 % of the control with 0.05 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. PolyP synthesis was not observed during the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> glucose at the same cellobiose lipid concentration. The content of longer-chain polyP was higher during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. We speculate the long-chained polyP participate in the viability restoring of ethanol-grown cells after treatment with the cellobiose lipid.|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{effects of}} {{complete}} deep-soil <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> forest growth and yield were evaluated {{in an experiment}} initiated in 1988 on six different sites in Sweden. Complete deep-soil cultivation was compared with less intensive site preparation. Ten years after the start. growth. stand structure. damage and survival were evaluated. Conifer seedling growth and survival on sandy sites, frost-prone sites or both. generally increased following deep-soil cultivation compared to patch scarification. Silty sites exposed to summer frost mere also positively affected by deep-soil cultivation. although the risk of frost-heaving increased. For deciduous seedlings the result varied. but survival in birch was improved by deep-soil <b>cultivation.</b> <b>On</b> former farmland. deep cultivation may effectively control competing vegetation. Deep-soil cultivation in strips over half the area appeared to be as efficient as complete treatment. This has financial and environmental implications. Deep cultivation reduced variability in tree size, since it provided a more uniform environment during stand establishment. When long-term effects of complete deep-soil <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> forest growth and yield are evaluated. the significant differences in stand establishment demonstrated in the study must be considered.

40|$|Yeast {{production}} on hydrolysate is a likely process solution in large-scale ethanol production from lignocellulose. The hydrolysate {{will be available}} on site, and the yeast has furthermore been shown to acquire an increased inhibitor tolerance when cultivated on hydrolysate. However, due to over-flow metabolism and inhibition, efficient yeast {{production on}} hydrolysate can only be achieved by well-controlled substrate addition. In the present work, a method was developed for controlled addition of hydrolysate to PDU (process development unit) -scale aerobic fed-batch cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TMB 3000. A feed rate control strategy, which maintains the ethanol concentration at a low constant level, was adapted to process-like conditions. The ethanol concentration was obtained from on-line measurements of the ethanol mole fraction in the exhaust gas. A computer model of the system was developed to optimize control performance. Productivities, biomass yields, and byproduct formation were evaluated. The feed rate control worked satisfactorily and maintained the ethanol concentration close to the setpoint during the cultivations. Biomass yields of 0. 45 g/g were obtained on added hexoses during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> hydrolysate and of 0. 49 g/g during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> a synthetic medium with glucose as the carbon source.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of contract farming of potatoes in Northern Thailand for the agrobusiness company Frito Lay, a subsidiary to Pepsi International, in three villages. The dissertation is based on primarily qualitative empirical data, collected during three months of fieldwork conducted in spring 2003. The presentation {{and analysis of the}} empirical data is structured according to an analytical framework based on three theoretical approaches; livelihood analysis combined with a positive as well as a critical approach to the phenomenon of contract farming. The focus of the analysis is how the farmers experience the effect of the <b>contract</b> <b>on</b> the following livelihood indicators: the household economy (increased income as well as stability), workload, knowledge, detrimental environmental effects of intensification and well being. The farmers’ viewpoints, which are analysed on the household level, are supplemented with an examination of the contract as a social relation. As such, the contract is a partnership of two unequal partners in terms of power, which might result in a process of control and exploitation with possibly negative consequences for the farmers’ livelihoods. It is concluded that contract farming in the three villages in relation to the character of the contract as well as to impacts, represents different case stories depending on the socioeconomic and physical context. The <b>cultivation</b> of potatoes <b>on</b> <b>contract</b> is mostly contributing positively to the farmers livelihoods. In none of the villages is contract farming directly resulting in negative consequences. With a point of departure in {{an analysis of}} the context it can be recommended that contract farming contribute to the farmes livelihood strategies rather than being the only farming activity. The market of the contracted crop should be characterised by a large demand as it reduces the company’s ability to exploit the unequal power relation. Finally it is recommended that contract farmers are organized in order to strengthen their bargaining position vis-à-vis the company...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} funded under the EPA ERTDI Research Programme (Grant 2006 -B-MS- 46). To help {{understand}} and counteract future agronomic challenges to farmland biodiversity, {{it is essential}} to know how present farming practices have affected biodiversity on Irish farms. We present an overview of existing research data and conclusions, describing the impact of crop <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> biodiversity on Irish arable farms. An extensive literature review clearly indicates that peer-reviewed publications on research conducted in Ireland on this topic are quite scarce: just 21 papers investigating the effect of conventional crop <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> Irish biodiversity have been published within the past 30 years. Principally, these studies have concluded that conventional crop cultivation has had an adverse impact on biodiversity on Irish farms, with 15 of the 21 studies demonstrating negative trends for the taxa investigated. Compared to other EU states, the relative dearth of baseline data and absence of monitoring programmes designed to assess the specific impacts of crop <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> Irish biodiversity highlight the need to develop long-term research studies. With many new challenges facing Irish agriculture, a research programme must be initiated to measure current levels of biodiversity on arable land and to assess the main farming ‘pressures’ causing significant biodiversity loss or gains in these systems...|$|R
