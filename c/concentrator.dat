40|$|AbstractSolar <b>concentrators</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to replace the expensive PV cells with cheaper optical elements without affecting the overall output of the solar panel. Small scale <b>concentrators</b> with low concentration ratios offer the advantage of light weight, small size and easy to install without the need of tracking. Such <b>concentrators</b> use either reflective or refractive optical devices to focus the solar light onto a photovoltaic surface and increase its power output. Using advanced ray tracing techniques, this work investigates the optical performance of low concentration ratio reflective and refractive <b>concentrators.</b> Three different geometries of reflective <b>concentrators</b> and two geometries of refractive <b>concentrators</b> were investigated under the same range of concentration ratios. Results showed that both types of <b>concentrators</b> have similar optical efficiency for concentration ratios up to 10. For concentration ratios above 10, the performance of reflective <b>concentrators</b> has deteriorated significantly while the refractive <b>concentrators</b> have retained their high optical efficiency highlighting the potential of refractive <b>concentrators...</b>|$|R

In this field, many different techniques have been used to produce optical devices, including the use of reflective and refractive components or inverse engineering techniques.

5|$|<b>Concentrator</b> {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E

50|$|Industrial oxygen <b>concentrators</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as oxygen generators within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical oxygen <b>concentrators.</b> The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial oxygen <b>concentrators</b> are not medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical <b>concentrators.</b> However, applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, oxygen generator, is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not generated as it is with a chemical oxygen generator, but rather it is concentrated from the air.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1989, Peko Mines, then a {{division}} of North Broken Hill Peko Limited, also engaged Jameson to undertake test work in its Warrego <b>concentrator</b> near Tennant Creek in Australia's Northern Territory.

40|$|As {{the need}} for {{achieving}} super high temperatures (2000 K and above) in solar heat receivers has developed so has {{the need for}} secondary <b>concentrators.</b> These <b>concentrators</b> refocus the already highly concentrated solar energy provided by a primary solar collector, thereby significantly reducing the light entrance aperture of the heat receiver and the resulting infrared radiation heat loss from the receiver cavity. Although {{a significant amount of}} research and development has been done on nonimaging hollow reflective <b>concentrators,</b> there has been no other research or development to date on solid, single crystal, refractive <b>concentrators</b> that can operate at temperatures above 2000 K. The NASA Lewis Research Center recently initiated the development of single-crystal, optically clear, refractive secondary <b>concentrators</b> that, combined with a flux extractor, offer a number of significant advantages over the more conventional, hollow, reflective <b>concentrators</b> at elevated temperatures. Such <b>concentrators</b> could potentially provide higher throughput (efficiency), require no special cooling device, block heat receiver material boiloff from the receiver cavity, provide for flux tailoring in the cavity via the extractor, and potentially reduce infrared heat loss via an infrared block coating. The many technical challenges of designing and fabricating high-temperature refractive secondary <b>concentrators</b> and flux extractors include identifying optical materials that can survive the environment (high-temperature, vacuum and/or hydrogen atmosphere), developing coatings for enhanced optical and thermal performance, and developing crystal joining techniques and hardware that can survive launch loads...|$|R

25|$|The most {{efficient}} type of solar cell {{to date is}} a multi-junction <b>concentrator</b> solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0% produced by Fraunhofer ISE in December 2014.

30|$|According to the literature, {{based on}} the {{achieved}} course credits in CTE during high school, students can be classified as coursetakers, investors, and <b>concentrators</b> (Levesque & Hudson, 2003). For example, coursetakers are students who achieved more than 0.0 credits in any CTE areas; investors are students who earned more than 3.0 credits regardless of CTE areas; and <b>concentrators</b> are students who earned more than 3.0 credits in a single CTE area. Using the data of the public high school graduates between 1982 and 1998, Levesque & Hudson, (2003) found that 96.5 % of students took at least more than 0.0 credits (coursetakers), followed by 61.5 % investors, while 25.0 % were <b>concentrators</b> in CTE. With softened criteria for <b>concentrators</b> (who earned 2.0 or more credits in a single CTE area), Levesque et al.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Conventional solar <b>concentrators</b> {{are only}} {{sensitive}} for the beam radiation and they function poorly in overcast sky conditions. Even under a clear sky condition, trackers are always needed for conventional solar <b>concentrators.</b> Static <b>concentrators</b> always {{come with a}} poor concentration rate without a tracker and the light concentrated by normal Luminescent Solar <b>Concentrators</b> (LSC) could not be transported by optical fibers to a remote place since the light produced by LSCs is not a pointolite. Approach: Through a critical literature review and discussion, this article retrospects the merits and demerits of recent conventional solar <b>concentrators</b> and Luminescent Solar <b>Concentrators</b> (LSC). Results: Results summarized the limitations in current day lighting related solar concentration devices. As an approach for energy saving, daylight has a disadvantage {{of not being able}} to reach many areas of a building such as store rooms, basements and corridors and it also brings heat gain with the light. Light pipes were designed to transport daylight to unreached areas, but light pipes have their difficulties for wiring, so that optical fibers are considered as the best approach for the daylight transportation so far. However, the optical fiber needs a pointolite for the light transportation. Various solar <b>concentrators</b> that were designed using optical approaches such as using mirrors or lens for the solar energy concentration. Since they are only sensitive for th...|$|R
50|$|The above {{description}} {{covers a}} wider class of <b>concentrators</b> (for example simple optical <b>concentrators)</b> than just luminescent solar <b>concentrators.</b> The essential attribute of LSCs {{is that they}} incorporate luminescent materials that absorb incoming light with a wide frequency range, and re-emit the {{energy in the form}} of light in a narrow frequency range. The narrower the frequency range, (i.e. the higher the saturation) the simpler a photovoltaic cell can be designed to convert it to electricity.|$|R
