The initial focus is on identifying irony in sentences containing positive predicates since these sentences are more exposed to irony, making their true po-larity harder to recognize. We show {{that it is possible to}} find ironic sentences with relatively high precision (from 45 % to 85 %) by exploring certain oral or gestural clues in user comments, such as emoticons, onomatopoeic expressions for laughter, heavy punctuation marks, quotation marks and positive interjections. We also demonstrate that clues based on deeper linguistic information are relatively inefficient in capturing irony in user-generated content, which points to the need for exploring additional types of oral clues...|$|R

The approach taken by Berulava and Horsthemke is to quantify allelic-specific transcript levels in cells that are heterozygous for a given indicator variant in the mRNA of the gene of interest (in this case, rs 3929 in the 3 untrans-lated region of RBL 2). They measure the ratio of allele-specific transcripts for RBL 2 in three FTO SNP (rs 8050136) heterozygotous individuals (AC) and two homozygous individuals (AA) and report that skewing of RBL 2 allelic expression was detected but not significant.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research was to develop and utilize a method for determining and examining the attitudes of U. S. Naval officers toward civil service managerial and technical personnel. The six subject areas covered in the research were competence and motivation, personal relationships, professional relationships, pay, personnel rotation, and civilian personnel regulations. The major hypothesis was that the general attitude of the average Naval officer toward his civilian counterpart is negative. A questionnaire containing 27 questions was developed and distributed to 371 Naval officers who were students at the Naval Postgraduate School. Responses were received from 197 officers which formed the total response population. From that population, the responses of those officers who had directly supervised, been supervised by, or worked closely with civilians were extracted, analyzed separately, and compared with the responses of the total population. Narrative <b>comments</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> the respondents were also analyzed. The research led {{to the conclusion that the}} major hypothesis was generally erroneous.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the process {{under way in}} Iceland to align national law with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focusing on the Convention’s call for the active involvement of disabled people and their representative organizations in policy and decision making on matters that affect them.

Furthermore, it draws on interviews with leaders of representative organizations of disabled people that solicited their views on the issue. The findings indicate that there is a reluctance on behalf of Icelandic authorities to make changes to the established process, which limits the active participation of disabled people and their representative organizations. The draft legislation has neither been revised to include provisions for expanding the participation of DPOs in policy and decision making, nor to ensure that disabled people themselves participate in the process...|$|R
