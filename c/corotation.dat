40|$|Abridged] The torque {{exerted by}} an {{external}} potential on a two-dimensional gaseous disk at non-co-orbital <b>corotation</b> resonances is studied {{by means of}} numerical simulations.

We find that these properties hardly differ from the case of an isolated <b>corotation</b> resonance. In particular, although the torque of two neighboring <b>corotation</b> resonances may differ from the sum of the torques of the corresponding resonances considered as isolated, it never exceeds the sum of the fully unsaturated isolated <b>corotation</b> resonances, and it saturates in a fashion similar to an isolated resonance. Similarly, the presence of an underlying Lindblad resonance hardly affects the <b>corotation</b> torque, even if that resonance implies a torque strong enough to significantly redistribute the azimuthally averaged surface density profile, in which case the <b>corotation</b> torque scales with the resulting vortensity gradient. This set of numerical experiments thus essentially validates previous analytic studies.

40|$|The <b>corotation</b> {{resonance}} {{plays an}} important role in the evolution of the disks of spiral galaxies, and in particular, of our Galaxy. Its effect on the chemical abundance gradients is even a tool to estimate the age of the present spiral arm structure, which we find to be long-lived, contrary to a recent common belief. The metallicity gradients usually decrease in the inner regions and become flat or rising at larger radii. In several galaxies, including the Milky Way, one observes not only a change in the slope of the abundance gradient, but also an abrupt step in metallicity at <b>corotation.</b> This step is because the <b>corotation</b> resonance separates the disk of a galaxy in two regions (inside <b>corotation</b> and outside <b>corotation)</b> which are isolated one from the other, so that the two sides evolve in an independent way. The barrier between the two regions is the result of the flow of gas in opposite directions on the two sides and by the ring-shaped void of gas observed at <b>corotation.</b> We investigated a sample of galaxies, which have a known <b>corotation</b> radius, and for which there are measurements of abundance gradients of Oxygen available in the literature. A very good correlation is found between <b>corotation</b> radii and the radii at which there is a break in the slope of the gradients. Besides this, an independent effect of <b>corotation</b> is a mini minimum of star formation associated with the minimum velocity at which the interstellar gas feeds the spiral arms (seen as potential wells and star-formation machines). Still another effect is the scattering of stars by the resonance, which causes their migration to different galactic radii.

40|$|Ion {{data from}} the Voyager 1 and 2 {{low-energy}} charged particle (LECP) experiment are fit to a second-order harmonic expansion to determine anisotropies within the Saturnian magnetosphere. Anisotropies from the low-energy channels (28 - 130 keV) are often consistent with those expected from <b>corotation</b> (generally with a small radial component on the dayside) but are at times distinctly different from <b>corotation.</b> On the dayside, near the noon meridian, first-order anisotropies often depart significantly from the <b>corotation</b> direction. On the nightside, amplitudes are consistent with full <b>corotation</b> but begin to drop below <b>corotation</b> values at a dipole L of approximately 27 Saturn radii (corresponding to a velocity of approximately 265 km/s). Second-order anisotropies are significant, even dominant at times, on the dayside where a relatively broad range of pitch angles is sampled by the instrument. In all cases there is a departure of approximately 180 deg from the first-order anisotropies expected due to <b>corotation</b> beginning outside the Rhea L shell and continuing through at least the orbit of Dione. This is the region where the cold and hot plasma tori have been observed.

Although this expression requires the solution of the hydrodynamic equations, it provides some insight into the dynamics of the <b>corotation</b> region.

A linear eigenmode having a <b>corotation</b> radius, at which azimuthal pattern speed of the mode coincides with the stellar angular velocity, is categorized to either a complex (growing or damping) mode or a purely real mode belonging to a continuous spectrum of frequency.

At the exception of those stars trapped at the <b>corotation,</b> we find that stars that are far from their initial guiding radius are more likely so due to blurring rather than churning effects. We compare the simulation to orbits integration with a fixed gravitational potential rotating at a constant speed. In the latter case, stars trapped at <b>corotation</b> are churned periodically outside and inside the <b>corotation</b> radius, with a zero net average. However, as the bar speed of the simulated galaxy decreases and its <b>corotation</b> radius increases, stars trapped at <b>corotation</b> for several Gyrs can be churned outwards on average.

40|$|Motivated by models {{suggesting}} that the inner planet forming regions of protoplanetary discs are predominantly lacking in viscosity-inducing turbulence, and are possibly threaded by Hall-effect generated large-scale horizontal magnetic fields, we examine {{the dynamics of the}} <b>corotation</b> region of a low-mass planet in such an environment. The <b>corotation</b> torque in an inviscid, isothermal, dead zone ought to saturate, with the libration region becoming both symmetrical and of a uniform vortensity, leading to fast inward migration driven by the Lindblad torques alone. However, in such a low viscosity situation, the material on librating streamlines essentially preserves its vortensity. If there is relative radial motion between the disc gas and the planet, the librating streamlines will no longer be symmetrical. Hence, if the gas is torqued by a large scale magnetic field so that it undergoes a net inflow or outflow past the planet, driving evolution of the vortensity and inducing asymmetry of the <b>corotation</b> region, the <b>corotation</b> torque can grow, leading to a positive torque. In this paper we treat this effect by applying a symmetry argument to the previously studied case of a migrating planet in an inviscid disc. Our results show that the <b>corotation</b> torque due to a laminar Hall-induced magnetic field in a dead zone behaves quite differently from that studied previously for a viscous disc. Furthermore, the magnetic field induced <b>corotation</b> torque and the dynamical <b>corotation</b> torque in a low viscosity disc can be regarded as one unified effect.

This process is very efficient and forms plateaus of several kiloparsec in size around <b>corotation</b> after two revolution periods of a galaxy.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} interactions between a giant planet and the disk from which it forms promote eccentricity growth. These interactions are concentrated at discrete Lindblad and <b>corotation</b> resonances. Interactions at principal Lindblad resonances cause the planet's orbit to migrate and open {{a gap in the}} disk if the planet is sufficiently massive. Those at first order Lindblad and <b>corotation</b> resonances change the planet's orbital eccentricity. Eccentricity is excited by interactions at external Lindblad resonances which are located {{on the opposite side of}} <b>corotation</b> from the planet, and damped by co-orbital Lindblad resonances which overlap the planet's orbit. If the planet clears a gap in the disk, the rate of eccentricity damping by co-orbital Lindblad resonances is reduced. Density gradients associated with the gap activate eccentricity damping by <b>corotation</b> resonances at a rate which initially marginally exceeds that of eccentricity excitation by external Lindblad resonances. But the <b>corotation</b> torque drives a mass flux which reduces the density gradient near the resonance. Sufficient partial saturation of <b>corotation</b> resonances can tip the balance in favor of eccentricity excitation. A minimal initial eccentricity of a few percent is required to overcome viscous diffusion which acts to unsaturate <b>corotation</b> resonances by reestablishing the large scale density gradient. Thus eccentricity growth is a finite amplitude instability. Formally, interactions at the apsidal resonance, which is a special kind of co-orbital Lindblad resonance, appears to damp eccentricity faster than external Lindblad resonances can excite it. However, apsidal waves have such long wavelengths that they do not propagate in protoplanetary disks. This reduces eccentricity damping by the apsidal resonance to a modest level.

Such secular processes actually allow steady spiral waves to promote radial migration across <b>corotation.</b> We propose some observational evidences for the minimum stellar density in the Galactic disk, such as its direct relation to the minimum in the observed rotation curve of the Galaxy at the radius R ~ 9 kpc (for R_ 0 = 7. 5 kpc), as well as its association with a minimum in the distribution of Galactic radii of a sample of open clusters older than 1 Gyr. The closeness of the solar orbit radius to the <b>corotation</b> resonance implies that the solar orbit lies inside a ring of minimum surface density (stellar + gas).

The Cheng and Krimigis (1989) model is extended to suggest that <b>corotation</b> lag occurs principally within the magnetodisk proper, which extends out to about 60 - 70 Rj. It is predicted that outside this radius, in the premidnight sector, spin-up to near <b>corotation</b> may occur owing to a local reduction in the outward mass transport rate. The mass loss may occur mainly in the dawn sector, to the magnetospheric wind and the dawn magnetosheath...|$|E
