5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor {{resembles the}} European species E.queletii, but the <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> the latter species fades to an ochre colour, {{and it has}} a white fibrillose stipe. Microscopically, its gill edges have well-differentiated cheilocystidia.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. Unlike that of M.fonticola, the <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|E
5|$|The conical hill of {{clay and}} Blue Lias {{rises from the}} Somerset Levels. It was formed when {{surrounding}} softer deposits were eroded, leaving the hard <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> sandstone exposed. The slopes of the hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the Iron Age to Roman eras.|$|E
40|$|The {{independent}} B lymphocyte {{surface membrane}} receptors IgM and Fc IgG receptors were evaluated for interactions using immunoflourescence. Ligand [F(ab') 2 anti-mu]-induced <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> surface IgM resulted in <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> Fc IgG receptors {{only if the}} latter were occupied during the capping process by: (a) soluble antigen-antibody complexes that themselves provided insufficient cross-linking to result in capping; or (b) monomeric IgG at physiologic concentrations (or less) either purified or as normal serum. Ligand-induced <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> Fc IgG receptors {{did not result in}} <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> surface IgM occupied by monomeric F(ab') anti-mu. Control experiments showed that ligand binding to or <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> only one of these two receptors has no effect on the other, and that there were no cross-reactions. The interaction appears specific in that ligand-induced <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> surface IgM did not induce <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> ligand- occupied surface IgD or I-A antigens. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} specific interaction between ligand-bound surface IgM and ligand-bound Fc IgG receptors on the B lymphocyte surface. The results also indicate that binding of monomeric IgG produces a reversible alteration in the Fc IgG receptor leading to association with ligand-bound surface IgM. Because Fc IgG receptors are continuously exposed to monomeric IgG in vivo, these results suggest that whenever surface IgM is involved in a B lymphocyte response to an immunologic stimulus, the Fc IgG receptor is also involved...|$|R

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more similar}} {{is the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is {{commonly}} known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> the fruit bodies, although this vernacular name is also used for Discina perlata. Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe. In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
5|$|Male sovereigns {{up to and}} {{including}} George VI have traditionally worn a crimson <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during {{the first part of the}} service. Female sovereigns wear the George IV State Diadem, also worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown.|$|E
5|$|Similar solar-heating-driven jets of gaseous {{carbon dioxide}} are {{believed}} to erupt from the south polar <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> Mars each spring. Although these eruptions {{have not yet been}} directly observed, they leave evidence in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the dry ice, representing sand and dust carried aloft by the eruptions, and a spider-like pattern of grooves created below the ice by the out-rushing gas.|$|E

40|$|Mercaptothiadiazole ligands {{functionalized}} with thiol (2, 5 -dimercapto- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole (DMT)) and methyl (5 -methyl- 2 -mercapto- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole (MMT)) groups capped onto citrate capped gold nanoparticles (C-AuNPs) by ligand exchange {{reaction was}} investigated by UV–vis spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) techniques. The surface plasmon resonance band at 522 nm for C-AuNPs was shifted to 530 nm after capping with DMT whereas an additional band was observed at 630 nm due to aggregation {{in addition to a}} shift in the band at 522 nm after <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> MMT onto C-AuNPs. Thus, <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> DMT onto C-AuNPs leads to the formation of stable AuNPs while <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> MMT leads to the formation of unstable AuNPs. FT-IR studies show that the citrate ions were completely replaced by both DMT and MMT ligands from the AuNPs. TEM images indicate that {{the size and shape of}} the AuNPs remain same after <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> these ligands...|$|R
5|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{comprises}} bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> clay-with-flints on the western edge {{of the town}} around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow ribbons of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes reddish within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the discolouration of the milk. The milk of L.deterrimus stays orange or becomes reddish within 30minutes. Also, the milk of the latter tastes mild, while the milk of the first distinctly bitter. The <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> L.deterrimus changes its colour in old age or if injured distinctly greenish and is common only under spruces, while L.deterrimus is native under pines.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} less-common species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be {{confused}} due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics {{to distinguish between}} them. For example, Marasmius capillaris has a pale tan cap with a white center, and grows on oak leaves without forming clusters. Furthermore, its cap is evenly rounded, unlike the pleated and furrowed <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> M.rotula, and its stem is somewhat thinner (usually less than 0.3mm) and slightly darker in color.|$|E

5|$|After Link restores the Four Sword, Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle—the final dungeon in the game. Link fights Vaati {{just before}} he can drain Zelda {{of all of the}} Light Force hidden within her. Link defeats Vaati after {{engaging}} in a fight that consists of Vaati changing forms. When Link and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle, they meet Vaati as he again changes form for the final battle of the game. After the battle, Ezlo returns to his original form. He finds the <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> wishes he created and gives it to Zelda, granting her a wish. The people cursed by Vaati are cured and the castle is turned back to normal. The hat overflows with the power of life and disappears. Ezlo gives Link a new hat and tells him that he enjoyed traveling with him, then leaves just as the door to the Minish world closes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a <b>cap,</b> <b>of</b> this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary <b>cap</b> <b>of</b> US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
