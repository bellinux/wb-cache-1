40|$|Whereas {{most studies}} to date have viewed {{cross-border}} regionalization and cooperation from ‘top-down’ regional and institutional perspectives, and {{within the context of}} urban regions, I am concerned with the implementation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiatives</b> in the rural Finnish – Swedish border area. The focus is firstly on the implementation of cross-border projects in the European Union’s INTERREG III A North programme (2000  –  06), and secondly on grassroots cooperation and local actors’ experiences of <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiatives.</b> The findings indicate that cooperation is not a straightforward process of ‘ignoring’ state borders and creating new regional spaces across borders. The INTERREG programme documents emphasize the development of a functional, harmonious cross-border region. When the examination is moved to the local level and everyday institutional practices are considered, cooperation and the implementation of initiatives appear in a rather different light. Practices of cooperation are intertwined with different governmental and nongovernmental structures across multiple scales, but it is the state border which determines the norms and spatial organization of this cooperation and cross-border networks are still sparse compared with their national counterparts. What this paper suggests is that we should include the national as a significant scalar dimension more profoundly in our analysis of cross-border regionalization and cooperation. ...|$|R

40|$|The border {{regions are}} major {{experimental}} {{areas where the}} contradictions between the different healthcare funds become apparent. At the same time, however, they give rise to innovative projects. The partnerships established are undoubtedly the main driving force behind a more European approach to healthcare. These projects also encounter various obstacles such as national regulatory statutes unsuited to a European context {{and a lack of}} consistency between the various <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiatives</b> which could certainly be optimized by a policy at the European level. The border regions {{give us an idea of}} the possibilities which exist for <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Two types of approaches are apparently emerging: one relating to contractual practices while the other, to intentional cross-border mobility for citizens. In practice, both of these approaches will always require derogation from the principle of the territorial nature of the services rendered based on the existing limits regarding healthcare delivery in the border regions. However, do we have to consider the number of cross-border projects as a threat to national health policies? The answer is «no», since curbing these initiatives solely for the purpose of maintaining the existing national health systems for as long as possible would be near-sighted; it would mean ignoring the existing needs of individuals living in the border regions; it would mean neglecting opportunities for improved planning of health care delivery; and finally, it would mean spoiling the opportunities for elaborating a European healthcare-delivery policy based on concrete, «hands-on» experiences...|$|R

We focus on the case of the INTERREG <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiative</b> in France and Spain between 2000 and 2003, and whether INTERREG succeeded in empowering regional governments and local authorities as it initially claimed to. Our analysis puts to the fore that this programme has not evolved from being ‘a policy for the regions to a policy by the regions’ as many expected, but that its implementation rather reveals a wide range of configurations. Indeed, the execution of INTERREG facilitated the transition from a state-centric scheme to a regionalised one only in those territories where a previous decentralisation policy had been realised at the domestic level and where a consistent regional leadership had emerged during earlier versions of INTERREG. ...|$|E

50|$|A {{third way}} of {{distinguishing}} cross-border regions considers {{the nature of}} the participating authorities. Most of the small-scale initiatives involve local authorities as the driving protagonists whereas large-scale CBC is almost exclusively driven by regional authorities. There is variance in this respect, depending on the territorial organization of different European countries. For instance, in Germany, local administration comprises two levels, the municipalities and the Kreise, with the latter being self-governed groupings of municipalities. In most cases, the Kreise are the driving force behind <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiatives.</b> By contrast, in Italy, it is meso-level authorities, the 'province' (provinces), that are usually involved in <b>cross-border</b> cooperation <b>initiatives</b> while the municipalities play a minor role because of their relative fragmentation compared to the German Kreise. In Scandinavia, as for instance in the Øresund region, both counties and large urban municipalities (Greater Copenhagen) participate in the cooperation arrangement. In general, in countries with a strong role for inter-municipal associations, cross-border co-operation is often pursued by local actors. By contrast, in countries with a two-tier regional administration and a minor role for inter-local action (such as Italy or France), cross-border regions are a domain pursued by regional authorities.|$|R
40|$|A unique {{event in}} nursing and midwifery {{on the island}} of Ireland took place in Dublin Castle on the 5 th April 2006, namely the launch of the All-Ireland Practice and Quality Development Database. This <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiative</b> came about as a result of {{co-operation}} between the Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for Nursing and Midwifery (NIPEC) and the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.

The database itself was established by NIPEC and we in the National Council are very pleased to be associated with its further development and launch. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney sponsored the event and the Secretary General at the Department of Health and Children, Mr Michael Scanlan, officiated at the launch. The database will provide a focal point for gathering and disseminating good practice, recognising innovation and personal achievement, and raising awareness of practice and quality initiatives throughout the island of Ireland.

The paper concludes that: i) South-South regional RIAs should further reduce their external trade barriers; ii) the trade component of the Cotonou Agreement is likely to harm the ACP countries, and these should liberalize their trade regime in order to reduce the size of transfers from the ACP countries to the EU; iii) small states should sign FTAs with the rest of the OECD and pursue multilateral liberalization; iv) small states and other developing countries should intensify SouthSouth regional cooperation in the area of regional public goods; and v) the EU and other OECD countries should provide country-specific technical assistance for behind the border reforms in small statessomething specified in the Cotonou Agreement for ACP countries [...] as well as assistance in implementing their WTO commitments.

40|$|Almost a {{year after}} the end of the Kosovo conflict, South Eastern Europe remains a volatile, {{insecure}} and economically depressed region. Post-conflict reconstruction has not spurred growth, unemployment has risen and security tensions in Kosovo and Montenegro persist. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains an aid-dependent country, Albania has yet to establish effective statehood, while Bulgaria, Romania, FYR Macedonia and Croatia continue to make efforts to spur indigenous and sustainable economic growth. There are clearly differences in the situations of the individual countries, yet the region as a whole is viewed as an unstable and insecure place to do business and invest in. The EU-sponsored Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is a potentially far-reaching initiative but has yet to deliver practical results that will boost morale and economic development on the ground. EU integration, although offered as prospect, remains distant. Intra-regional co-operation, so necessary for creating a common, larger market, is hampered by the lack of a shared regional vision of the future of South Eastern Europe. The EastWest Institute launched in 1999 an Action Network for South Eastern Europe (ANSEE) to address some of the above problems. ANSEE is a <b>cross-border</b> <b>initiative</b> consisting of a cluster of related projects, which aims at encouraging regional approaches to economic and civic development in South Eastern Europe. Projects address issues concerning private sector development, strengthening democracy and civil societies, building a regional security framework, and promoting transfrontier co-operation. ANSEE endeavours to facilitate close co-operation among the governments of the region and create new channels of communication among policy-makers, regional and non-governmental players. The most important objective of the initiative is to help prepare the countries in the region for integration into larger European structures. This report looks at the current economic challenges facing South Eastern Europe and analyses their deeper causes. It argues that the fundamental problem the region faces is generating sustainable development in the circumstances of transition and, in some cases, overcoming state failure. This requires policies that address the main aspects of under-development, while preserving and nurturing the human capital in the region. The report offers some broad and some concrete policy recommendations on how to overcome the obstacles to economic development, lower the barriers to trade and investment in the region, and speed up integration with the EU. It is far from prescribing a cure-all medicine. The analysis tries instead to put the right diagnosis on the problem and stimulate the thinking and action of domestic and international policymakers on how to revitalize the human potential and the economic promise that the region holds. ...|$|E
