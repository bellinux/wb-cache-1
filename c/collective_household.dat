40|$|Abstract. Using data on {{individual}} consumption expenditures from {{a sample of}} farm households in the Philippines, we construct a direct test of the risk-sharing implications of the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model. We are able to contrast the efficient outcomes predicted by the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model with the outcomes we might expect in environments in which food consumption delivers not only utils, but also nutrients which affect future productivity. Finally, {{we are able to}} contrast each of these two models with a third, involving a hidden action problem within the household; in this case, the efficient provision of incentives implies that the consumption of each household member depends on their (stochastic) productivity. The efficiency conditions which characterize the within-household allocation of food under the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model are violated, as consumption shares respond to earnings shocks. If future productivity depends on current nutrition, then this can explain some but not all of the response, as it appears that the quality of current consumption depends on past earnings. This suggests that actions taken by household members may be private, giving rise to a moral hazard problem within the household. 1...|$|E

This implies that policies that target the mother as the recipient of welfare benefits, if they manage to affect the distribution of power within the household, may affect her children's work with different impacts for boys and girls. This result also suggests that the distribution of bargaining power within the household is a relevant factor that should be considered when analyzing household's decisions.

The Federal planning bureau estimates the increase of population by one million inhabitants by 2030, which represent 600. 000 additional family requiring accesses to new housing facilities. Population ageing (mainly due to increasing life expectancy) combined with a constant growing rate of individuals living in <b>collective</b> <b>households,</b> leads to a substantial increase of demand of <b>collective</b> <b>households</b> (Vandresse & Bureau, 2013). This highlights a substantial challenge underlined mainly in the need to live in cities, which as consequence will increase the demand for smaller housing with or without integrated services or equipment in common. Furthermore, the stringent European performance environmental regulations for the building sector require that by 2020, all new construction are zero or nearly zero energy, (equivalent to 15 kWh/m 2 /year), with 60 % efficient on-site coverage by renewable energy. The shortage of vacant land and the increasing energy performance requirements is pushing the idea of urban densification and zero energy construction households. During the recent 6 years, {{there has been a}} trend to use timber frame constructions as a sustainable solution facing the economic and environmental crisis in Belgium. However, there is lack of knowledge on the design, construction and operation of zero energy lightweight constructions for urban densification. The goal of this research is to provide an overview and recommendation on urban densification potential in Liège Province. The focused aim is to demonstrate validated design prototypes and products of different zero energy, timber frame construction systems and composite components.

We propose two algorithms for testing the collective consumption model on large data sets.
