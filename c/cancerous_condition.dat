RESULTS: Men had a higher risk as assessed by skin type, ultraviolet exposure, family history, number of moles and sunburns during childhood. Changes in moles were reported significantly more often by people with: (1). a positive family history (p < 0. 0001); (2). multiple moles (p < 0. 0001), and (3). sunburns during childhood (p < 0. 0001).

The {{present study was}} undertaken to investigate the correlation between overexpression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and various grades of oral cancer, and to ascertain the inhibitory effect of propolis in the human oral carcinoma cell line. For ex vivo studies, 45 patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSF; n= 15), oral leukoplakia (OLP; n= 18) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC; n= 18) were recruited, and a biopsy was done to determine COX- 2 protein expression by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). For the in vitro study, COX- 2 levels were measured in human oral epidermal carcinoma cell line by immune blotting and IHC. The results of ex vivo studies by Western blotting revealed that COX- 2 protein levels were highly upregulated in OSCC tissue, followed by OLP and OSF. The levels of COX- 2 expression also showed a positive correlation with the grade (severity) of each oral precancerous and <b>cancerous</b> <b>condition.</b> Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the presence of intense COX- 2 staining in the cells of OSCC tissue, equivalent to the OLP and OSF specimens.

It has been demonstrated {{in recent years that}} perlecan is distributed in the stromal space of various pathophysiological conditions. The complex pleiotropy of perlecan suggests that this gene product is involved in several developmental processes, at both early and late stages of embryogenesis, as well as in cancer and diabetes. In the oral cavity, perlecan expression is reported to basal cells in normal mucosa and its expression increases in precancer and <b>cancerous</b> <b>conditions.</b> It is also expressed in various odontogenic tumors such as ameloblastoma, keratocyst odontogenic tumor, and also salivary gland tumors such as adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, etc...|$|R
