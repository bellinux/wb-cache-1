40|$|Polycentrism is {{becoming}} one of the dominant structures in contemporary metropolises. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>decentralization</b> and the integration of formerly independent cities by the reduction of travel time are behind of such a process. In this paper, the spatial structure of the seven biggest metro areas in Spain is depicted. By analysing employment density and travel-to-work data the polycentric structure of them is detected {{at the time that the}} functional borders are delimited. Results suggest a very heterogeneous image where Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao emerge as the most polycentric areas at the time that Madrid, Seville and Zaragoza have a structure more orientated towards monocentrism, Málaga is an exception since having few subcentres, their share in employment concentration is important. Clearly a correlation between polycentrism and complexity of the relations among subcentre emerges. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes on}} {{metropolitan}} areas {{characterized by the}} dispersion and <b>concentrated</b> <b>decentralization</b> of both employment and population has lead to a specialized research line addressed to analyze polycentrism. In this line there are two families of subcentre identification: the first based on the analysis of density, and other based on the analysis of mobility flows. Huge efforts have been paid, in the first family, to get robust models in statistical terms. Nevertheless, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the very object of analysis: employment density. In this paper a different approach to density calculus is proposed, it allows for prioritize, as subcentres, those municipalities that have features close to the urban paradigm of central cities in Southern Europe: have residents, are attractive in labor terms because retain resident employed population, and at the same time, attract commuters; and impact on the overall density function and have functional relations with other municipalities. The efficacy of the proposed density is tested in the metropolitan areas of Barcelona and Madrid. The analysis suggest that the municipalities prioritized as subcentres using this “compound density” excels in modifying both the employment and demographic metropolitan density functions, and are more diverse, concentrate more central activities, and strengthen functional relations with other municipalities in comparison to the results of standard density.

40|$|Regional- and {{settlement}} marketing (in the following: RSM) {{is a relatively}} young but dynamically developing branch of the science and practice of marketing. On {{the basis of the}} experience of the international as well as national regions and cities producing successful and impressive development it {{is often referred to as}} "wonder weapon" in the field of rural development. The task of RSM - to cut it short - is nothing else but the exploring of the competitiveness, comparative advantages and attraction of the region, the settlement, as well as the supporting of their realization and communication in the interest of the multifold aims concerning development, economics and lifestyle. In Hungary, RSM has been established by the increase of the self-governing independence in parallel with the multiplication of the relevant functions and tasks, the great extent of development differences among the various parts of the country, the resulting economic difficulties as well as by the new economic forms aiming at the exploitation of the new opportunities arising from the market economic development.
