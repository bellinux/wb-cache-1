50|$|The split of cost {{helps to}} {{identify}} cost drivers, if achieved. Direct labour and materials are {{relatively easy to}} trace directly to products, {{but it is more}} difficult to directly allocate indirect costs to products. Where products use common resources differently, some sort of weighting is needed in the <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>process.</b> The cost driver is a factor that creates or drives the cost of the activity. For example, the cost of the activity of bank tellers can be ascribed to each product by measuring how long each product's transactions (cost driver) takes at the counter and then by measuring the number of each type of transaction. For the activity of running machinery, the driver is likely to be machine operating hours. That is, machine operating hours drive labor, maintenance, and power cost during the running machinery activity.|$|E

This research develops and presents new type of MFCA analysis by incorporating value and non-value added activities into the MFCA <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>process.</b> According to the simulation-based measurement of the process efficiency, integrated cost allocation based on activity types results in higher proportion of negative product cost in comparison to that computed from conventional MFCA cost allocation.

The Multiple Objective Problem The {{relationship}} among varying social objectives is {{of paramount importance}} with regard to evaluation and <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>processes</b> in water resource use, development, and management projects. This study examines the philosophical and ethical base underlying proposed procedures for dealing with the multiple objective problem. The specific objectives of the study were (1) to account for the evolution of the multiple objective function, (2) to identify the relationships among objectives in water resource development, and (3) to identify the effect of relationships among objectives on the ultimate value of the trade-off ratio as well as the calculation process. Several legislative documents relating to public intervention in water resource development were reviewed in an attempt at accounting for the evolution of the multiple objective function, and at identifying the relationships among objectives. It was concluded that the multiple objective function was prevalent even in early legislation. Only the elements of the function have changed over time. The relationships among objectives, however, have not been made explicit. A tentative framework is presented which provides insight into the effects of various types of relationships on the ultimate value of the trade-off ratio and the trade-off calculation process. Decision rules and techniques involving trade-offs will have to be quite sophisticated, given interdependent relationships among objectives...|$|R

40|$|Cost {{allocation}} is an inescapable {{problem in}} nearly every organization and {{in nearly every}} facet of accounting. Within large corporations there are several different types of units, like profit-making business units and non-profit service units. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} business units and to fund the operations of service units, the expenses of service production need to be allocated to the business units benefiting from the services. The objective of this thesis was to find good and fair allocating factors for the costs of corporate wide IT services.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} performance levels and the levels of cross-subsidy attained by local exchange carriers in the United States telecommunications industry. These cross-subsidies have been obtained by firms via their engagement in a separations mechanism, based on a <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>process,</b> which telecommunications sector regulatory authorities use. Non-market strategies have assumed primacy {{in the activities of}} several sectors world-wide. Thus, understanding non-market strategic choices is important in the analysis of firms' behavior and performance. Active engagement in the separations process is an important non-market strategy in the telecommunications industry, as a firm relatively successful in this activity can gain large cross-subsidies. The analysis establishes that less profitable firms obtain greater cross-subsidies. Once the profitability variable is decomposed into its two main components, which are productivity and price recovery, the impact of the profitability variable reduces. Firms which are relatively unproductive, as well as those unable to recover higher output prices, obtain relatively greater cross-subsidies. These results are inconsistent with the postulates of the strategic cost-allocation and behavior literatures but are consistent with x-inefficiency and rent-seeking perspectives of firms' strategic actions.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} {{that there should be}} a separate reactive power market to manage the provision of reactive power in a deregulated power system. Owing to the importance of such a reactive power service for system reliability and its complexity, a significant degree of obligation and centralised control are needed in this market. A centrally-managed reactive power market model is adopted in which the system operator, taking into account the technical feasibility and economic efficiency, procures the required reactive service from the competitive reactive power suppliers and the incurred cost is fully allocated to all users. A reactive power optimum power flow is used as a tool for the procurement and dispatching of reactive power services. As the reactive power can be consumed directly or consumed indirectly, accompanied by the transportation of real power, difficulties arise in the <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>process,</b> especially in a pool-bilateral coexisting real power energy market.

40|$|The {{debate on}} <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> in the {{management}} accounting literature {{has been dominated by}} a largely rationalistic perspective primarily informed by economic theories.

The core of our argument hinges on the observation that most <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> generate some degree of ambiguity. We argue that the implementation of various <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques (in terms of their coupling to operating control) reflects differences in management of such ambiguity, but that this is conditioned by the patterns in which <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques diffuse across organizations. We also address some pertinent criticisms of the NIS literature by discussing how certain intra-organizational factors and aspects of the organization's technical environment might interact with external institutional pressures in the implementation of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques. We advance six research propositions reflecting how such external institutional pressures and interaction effects influence the coupling of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices to operating control. ...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method to {{allocate}} the transmission fixed costs among the network {{participants in a}} pool-based electricity market. The <b>allocation</b> <b>process</b> relies on the circuit laws, utilizes the modified impedance matrix and is performed in two individual steps for the generators and loads. To determine the partial branch power flows due to the participants, the equal sharing principle is used and validated by the Shapley and Aumann-Shapley values as two preferred game-theoretic solutions. The proposed approach is also applied to determine the generators’ contributions into the loads, and a new concept, named circuit-theory-based equivalent bilateral exchange (EBE), is introduced. Using the proposed method, fairly stable tariffs are provided for the participants. Cross-subsidies are reduced and a fair competition is made by the proposed method due to the counter-flows being alleviated compared with the well-known Z-bus method. Numerical results are reported and discussed to validate the proposed <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> method. Comparative analysis reveals that the method satisfies all conditions desired in a fair and efficient <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> method. Finally, the developed technique has been implemented successfully on the 2383 -bus Polish power system {{to emphasize that the}} method is applicable to very large systems.|$|R
