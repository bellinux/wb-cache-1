40|$|Abstract: In the Semi-Solid Processing of {{indirect}} squeeze <b>casting,</b> <b>runners</b> were needed for each part cavity. In our experiment, {{it was found}} that some of the runners were blocked, and some parts were not filling in full mold. Numerical simulation was applied to analyze this phenomenon, and the results show that it was the shell which emerged on the chamber surface that blocked the runner. Experimental results also confirmed our interpretation. Some measures have been used to correct it, such as runner design, two-layer coating, and process improvement which eliminated blocking of the runner. 1...|$|R

50|$|Degating is {{the removal}} of the heads, runners, gates, and risers from the <b>casting.</b> <b>Runners,</b> gates, and risers may be removed using cutting torches, bandsaws, or ceramic cutoff blades. For some metal types, and with some gating system designs, the sprue, runners, and gates can be removed by {{breaking}} them away from the casting with a sledge hammer or specially designed knockout machinery. Risers must usually be removed using a cutting method (see above) but some newer methods of riser removal use knockoff machinery with special designs incorporated into the riser neck geometry that allow the riser to break off at the right place.|$|R
25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die <b>cast</b> <b>runners.</b> The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with the}} parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|R
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die <b>cast</b> <b>runners.</b> The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|R

5000|$|ASLEF's Rules stated [...] "The General Secretary {{shall be}} {{elected by the}} votes of the {{majority}} of the whole of the members of the Society". However, only 4,369 of ASLEF's 10,502 members (41.6%) had voted and Fox won only 42.6% of the votes that had been <b>cast.</b> The <b>runner</b> up was an EC member and former Organising Secretary, Harry Parfitt, with 1,536 votes. After the votes were counted on 8 December an EC member proposed a run-off election between Fox and Parfitt but the EC voted to take legal advice. On 9 December the EC voted to declare Fox elected as General Secretary and the Assistant General Secretary, Henry Shuttleworth, quickly issued a circular to all branches to that effect. Parfitt challenged the decision and issued his own circular to branches asserting the members' right to demand a run-off ballot, but none was held and Fox took office without further challenge.|$|R
40|$|Specific {{steps in}} the {{investment}} casting process were analyzed in a designed experiment. The casting`s sensitivity to changes in these process steps was experimentally determined Dimensional and radiographic inspection were used to judge {{the sensitivity of the}} casting. Thirty-six castings of different pedigrees were poured and measured. Some of the dimensional inspection was conducted during the processing. It was confirmed that wax fixturing, number of gates, gate location, pour and mold temperature, pour speed, and cooling profile all affected the radiographic quality of the <b>casting.</b> Gate and <b>runner</b> assembly techniques, number of gates, and mold temperature affect the dimensional quality of the casting...|$|R
50|$|The Pelton {{turbines}} are horizontal units {{operating at}} 750rpm. The runner buckets {{are made with}} integrally cast stainless <b>cast</b> steel. The <b>runner</b> is directly coupled to the generator shaft. Other equipment associated with the turbine are inlet valve, distributor, power nozzles and needles and the governor and hydraulic systems. Rated voltage of the generators is 6.3kV. The bearings of generators are oil lubricated sleeve type and separate oil lubrication unit is used. Two 6MVA transformers are used to step up the generator voltage to 33KV. These transformers are the outdoor type. A 50kVA transformer operating at 400V is used for station supply.|$|R

He played Drax the Destroyer in the 2014 Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy, {{which was a}} critical and commercial success. He played Mr. Hinx in the James Bond film, Spectre (2015), and starred as the villain Tong Po in the reboot of the 1989 martial arts film Kickboxer, opposite Georges St-Pierre. Bautista joined the <b>cast</b> of Blade <b>Runner</b> 2049 as Sapper Morton, which was released on October 6, 2017. He reprised his role as Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, released in May 2017.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic turbine band {{castings}} {{are susceptible}} to deformation in heat treatment process if their cooling is not well controlled. The coupled analysis of forced air flow and heat transfer in normalizing process of a heavy turbine band <b>runner</b> <b>casting</b> with outer diameter of 8000 mm {{was carried out by}} using ANSYS software. The band undergoes significant deformation because of uneven cooling resulted by uneven air flow around it during normalizing. The forced air flow pattern is a key factor which influences the cooling uniformity and efficiency. It is optimized by adjusting the cooling fans 2 ̆ 7 orientation relative to the casting to form cyclone around it. Consequently, cooling uniformity is improved to avoid deformation...|$|R
40|$|Gating {{system design}} in casting process {{is one of}} the crucial factors to produce good quality of casting product. This study is aimed to {{determine}} the effects of runner gating design on mechanical strength of thin section Al-Si 7 -Mg alloy castings which are cast using sand <b>casting</b> process. The <b>runner</b> design used in this study is Radius bend shaped and L shape design. Flow behavior of filling process is identified by using the ADSTEFAN simulation software. 3 -point bending test was applied to measure the flexure strength and its scatter is quantified by Weibull statistics. Simulation results found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. It is observed that radius bend shaped design leads to the improvement of average flexure strength and reduction of porosity defects compared with L shape design...|$|R

During casting, fake names, occupations, and scenes were temporarily assigned {{to limit the}} leaking of spoilers. Corey Hawkins joins the <b>cast</b> as supply <b>runner</b> Heath, a prominent and long-running comic book character who is a loyal friend of Glenn Rhee. During the casting call, Heath {{was referred to as}} [...] "Delvin", a [...] "cynic who is left so dumbfounded by displays of stupidity that it’s nearly impossible for him to admit that he thinks, down deep, people are - or at least can be - decent. Even if they’re idiots." [...] Ethan Embry also joins the cast as the original character, Carter, whose character during the casting call was called [...] "Tucker", a [...] "hard-working man" [...] who [...] "values fairness" [...] and is an [...] "amalgamation" [...] of several characters from the comic. Kenric Green, whose wife Sonequa Martin-Green plays Sasha Williams on the show, also joins the series as the comic character Scott, Heath's supply run partner and friend.|$|R
