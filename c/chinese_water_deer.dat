40|$|The <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> (Hydropotes inermis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{primitive}} extant deer of the family Cervidae. Unlike <b>Chinese</b> waterdeer, Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> have rarely been studied, even though they have relatively well remained in Korea. In particular,the home range of the Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> has not yet been studied. Here we estimated the home range of the Koreanwater deer using two different methods (GPS and radio tracking) and analyzed the home range according to sex, time,and season. The mean home range size of four individuals was 2. 77 km 2 and 0. 34 km 2 under the 95 % minimum convexpolygon (MCP) and the 50 % kernel (K) method, respectively. There seemed to be a difference in home range size betweenmales (3. 30 km 2) and females (2. 25 km 2) under the 95 % MCP method. We also found a difference in home range size betweenday (1. 90 km 2) and night (2. 43 km 2) by 95 % MCP method. In addition, a home range size difference was observedbetween summer (4. 65 km 2) and spring (0. 48 km 2) or fall (0. 85 km 2) using the 95 % MCP method. <b>Water</b> <b>deer</b> seemed tohave a larger home range in night than in day, and males also have a larger home range.

40|$|Lactation {{provides}} the singular source of nourishment to {{the offspring of}} mammals. This nutrition source also contains a diverse microbiota affecting the development and health of the newborn. Here, we examined the milk microbiota in <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> (Hydropotes inermis, the most primitive {{member of the family}} Cervidae), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, the oldest semi-domesticated cervid), and the dairy goat (Capra aegagrus, member of the family Bovidae), to determine if common milk microbiota species were present across all three ruminant species. The results showed that <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> had the highest bacterial diversity, followed by reindeer, and then goat. Unifrac distance and correspondence analyses revealed that <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> harbored an increased abundance of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., while milk from reindeer and goat was dominated by unclassified bacteria from the family Hyphomicrobiaceae and Bacillus spp., respectively. These data indicate significant differences in the composition of milk-based bacterial communities. The presence of Halomonas spp. in three distinct co-occurrence networks of bacterial interactions revealed both common and unique features in milk niches. These results suggest that the milk of <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> and reindeer harbor unique bacterial communities compared with the goat, which might reflect host microbial adaptation caused by evolution...|$|R

50|$|There are six {{types of}} deer living wild in Great Britain: the Scottish red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, sika deer, Reeves's muntjac, and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>deer.</b> Of those, Scottish red and roe deer are native and {{have lived in}} the isles {{throughout}} the Holocene. Fallow deer have been reintroduced twice, by the Romans and the Normans, after it died out in the last ice age. The other three are escaped or released alien species.|$|E
50|$|Deer (singular and plural) are the {{ruminant}} mammals {{forming the}} family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the fallow deer and the chital, and the Capreolinae, including the elk, reindeer (caribou), the Western roe deer, and the Eurasian elk (moose).

40|$|Tick infestations {{in animals}} are of {{increasing}} concern, main-ly because the epidemiology and geographical distribution of these infestations are constantly changing due to climate change, abundance of wildlife animals as hosts, and decrease in environmental biodiversity [1]. As a result, {{the incidence of}} tick-borne diseases (TBDs) has increased [2]. Anaplasmosis and theileriosis, {{considered to be the}} most important TBDs, have resulted in animal health problems and extensive eco-nomic losses causing management-related problems in the livestock industry [3, 4]. However, there have been relatively few studies on tick-borne pathogens from wild ungulates in Korea [5 - 7], and therefore, little information is available on how infections caused by these pathogens might affect the population. Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) are one of the most widely distributed wild ungulates in Korea, and are known to be important natural reservoir hosts of TBDs [5, 6]. The Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> has been classified as a vulnerable spe-cies and included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List, due to a serious de-cline in their population as a result of poaching and habitat destruction [8]. Recently, however, wild Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> populations have been growing in Korea [9], and because of their close proximity to domestic animals, they may act as a disease transmission of tick-borne pathogens to these animals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the pathogens of TBDs in Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> and to evaluate their roles as potential reservoirs for TBDs circulating in Korea. The capture of wild Korean <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> and sample collec-tion were performed with permission from the Wildlife Rescue Center located in the Jeonbuk Province, Korea.

50|$|The {{majority}} of the current population of <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>deer</b> in Britain derives from escapees, with the remainder being descended {{from a number of}} deliberate releases. Most of these animals still reside close to Woburn Abbey. It appears that the deer’s strong preference for a particular habitat - tall reed and grass areas in rich alluvial deltas - has restricted its potential to colonize further afield. The main area of distribution is from Woburn, east into Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and North Essex, and south towards Whipsnade. There have been small colonies reported in other areas.|$|E
50|$|All male deer possess antlers, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>deer,</b> in which males have long tusk-like canines that reach below the lower jaw. Females generally lack antlers, though female reindeer bear antlers smaller and less branched than those of the males. Occasionally females in other species may develop antlers, especially in telemetacarpal deer such as European roe deer, red deer, white-tailed deer and mule deer and less often in plesiometacarpal deer. A study of antlered female white-tailed deer noted that antlers tend to be small and malformed, and are shed frequently around the time of parturition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>deer</b> {{are capable}} of {{emitting}} a number of sounds. The main call is a bark, and this has more of a growl tone {{when compared with the}} sharper yap of a muntjac.

It is uncertain how this unique sound is generated, although it is possibly by using its molar teeth. During the rut a buck following a doe will make a weak whistle or squeak. The does emit a soft pheep to call to their fawns, whilst an injured deer will emit a screaming wail.|$|R

The <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>deer,</b> tufted deer, and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks, while other species often lack upper canines altogether. The cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel, which enable them to grind {{a wide variety of}} vegetation. The teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation, and like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors, instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw.|$|E
