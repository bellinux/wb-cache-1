5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> much slower than maximum speed, {{turbines}} were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines. This was {{particularly important for}} navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event of}} war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds.</b> A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds,</b> hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a coupled {{longitudinal}} and lateral control strategy for an autonomous automotive vehicle is proposed. The proposed control scheme {{consists of a}} lateral guidance module based on a NonLinear Model-based Predictive Controller (NLMPC) and a <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> generation and regulation module. A cruise speed-profile generator allows the calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> which preserves the lateral stability of the vehicle during lateral maneuvers. The calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile is done considering road geometry as well as lateral dynamics criteria. The handling of both longitudinal and lateral dynamics {{in addition to the}} calculation of the limit <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile by considering lateral stability criteria illustrate the interest of the proposed approach. The developed control architecture is tested through simulation and shows good performance for guidance at high <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

5|$|The M {{class was}} {{intended}} {{for use as a}} scout for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned under Plan Z. The ships design process started in 1936; the ships were intended for long-range commerce raiding. They were an improvement over previous designs, which suffered from insufficient range to be effective commerce raiders. However, the requirements placed on the designhigh maximum and <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds,</b> long range, heavy armament, and armor sufficient to withstand 15cm shells, all on a displacement no more than 8,000metric tonswere deemed impossible by the design staff. In July 1937, the Oberbefehlshaber der Marine (commander in chief of the navy) requested proposals from both the naval design staff as well as private dockyards. None of the designs by the dockyards were practical, and so the official design, which only met some of the requirements, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E

25|$|The {{panspermia}} vehicles {{would be}} aimed at moving targets whose locations {{at the time of}} arrival must be predicted.

25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the {{lift-to-drag}} ratio can exceed that of aircraft (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds,</b> aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their {{lift-to-drag ratio}} disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E

25|$|Modern pirates favor {{small boats}} and taking {{advantage}} of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels. They also use large vessels to supply the smaller attack/boarding vessels. Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping. Major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats. Other active areas include the South China Sea and the Niger Delta. As usage increases, many of these ships have to lower <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> to allow for navigation and traffic control, making them prime targets for piracy.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds.</b> Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which can look like a doughnut from a spotter plane. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.|$|E

25|$|Porpoising, {{also known}} as running, is a high speed surface {{behaviour}} of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, {{as well as other}} marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to stay close to the surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> below 4.6m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their blowholes along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.|$|E
