40|$|At Dome F, one of {{the summits}} of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, a very deep ice-coring {{operation}} is {{to be carried out}} by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition from 1995. Since it will take two years to complete the <b>coring</b> <b>up</b> to about 3000 m depth, the borehole should be filled with proper drilling fluid to prevent borehole closure during the operation. This paper is a report on our investigations for searching for the proper drilling fluid which can be used in the very cold environment at Dome F. Although the investigations are still in progress, three kinds of fluid were chosen as drilling fluid candidates. They are : 1) n-butyl acetate, 2) "IP-solvent" with densifier and 3) Silicone Oil. Their properties were investigated and compared in terms of density and viscosity, which are essential requirements for a drilling fluid. As a result, it was shown that n-butyl acetate and IP-solvent with densifier can be used as the drilling fluid. However, the use of n-butyl acetate is impossible without sufficient ventilation at the coring site or other action to dispose of its vapor. When the use of IP-solvent with densifier is considered, the choice of proper densifier is also a problem...|$|E
40|$|Organic-rich {{subsurface}} marine sediments {{were taken}} by gravity <b>coring</b> <b>up</b> {{to a depth of}} 10 [*]m below seafloor at six stations from the anoxic Black Sea and the Benguela upwelling system off Namibia during the research cruises Meteor 72 - 5 and 76 - 1, respectively. The quantitative microbial community composition at various sediment depths was analyzed using total cell counting, catalyzed reporter deposition – fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD–FISH) and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). Total cell counts decreased with depths from 109 to 1010 [*]cells/mL at the sediment surface to 107 – 109 [*]cells/mL below one meter depth. Based on CARD–FISH and Q-PCR analyses overall similar proportions of Bacteria and Archaea were found. The down-core distribution of prokaryotic and eukaryotic small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (16 S and 18 S rRNA) as well as functional genes involved in different biogeochemical processes was quantified using Q-PCR. Crenarchaeota and the bacterial candidate division JS- 1 as well as the classes Anaerolineae and Caldilineae of the phylum Chloroflexi were highly abundant. Less abundant but detectable in most of the samples were Eukarya as well as the metal and sulfate-reducing Geobacteraceae (only in the Benguela upwelling influenced sediments). The functional genes cbbL, encoding for the large subunit of RuBisCO, the genes dsrA and aprA, indicative of sulfate-reducers as well as the mcrA gene of methanogens were detected in the Benguela upwelling and Black Sea sediments. Overall, the high organic carbon content of the sediments goes along with high cell counts and high gene copy numbers, as well as an equal abundance of Bacteria and Archaea...|$|E
40|$|Chickpea, {{the second}} most {{important}} legume crop, suffers major yield losses by terminal drought stress (DS). Stronger root system is known to enhance drought yields but this understanding remains controversial. To understand precisely the root traits contribution towards yield, 12 chickpea genotypes with well-known drought response were field evaluated under drought and optimal irrigation. Root traits, such as root length density (RLD), total root dry weight (RDW), deep root dry weight (deep RDW) and root:shoot ratio (RSR), were measured periodically by soil <b>coring</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 2 m soil depth across drought treatments. Large variations were observed for RLD, RDW, deep RDW and RSR in both the drought treatments. DS increased RLD below 30 cm soil depth, deep RDW, RSR but decreased the root diameter. DS increased the genetic variation in RDW more at the penultimate soil depths. Genetic variation under drought was the widest for RLD ∼ 50 DAS, for deep RDW ∼ 50 – 75 DAS and for RSR at 35 DAS. Genotypes ICC 4958, ICC 8261, Annigeri, ICC 14799, ICC 283 and ICC 867 at vegetative stage and genotypes ICC 14778, ICCV 10, ICC 3325, ICC 14799 and ICC 1882 at the reproductive phase produced greater RLD. Path- and correlation coefficients revealed strong positive contributions of RLD after 45 DAS, deep RDW at vicinity of maturity and RSR at early podfill stages to yield under drought. Breeding for the best combination of profuse RLD at surface soil depths, and RDW at deeper soil layers, was proposed to be the best selection strategy, for an efficient water use and an enhanced terminal drought tolerance in chickpea...|$|E

40|$|The {{study area}} {{is located on}} the south bank of the mighty river Brahmaputra in the districts of Tinsukia and Dibrugarh of Assam within the interfluves between the rivers Noa Dihing and Burhi Dihing. Thick {{deposits}} of Recent alluvial sediments comprising Older Alluvium, High level Terraces and New Alluvium along with active flood plain deposits are well exposed in natural cut bank sections of the Burhi-Dihing and Noa-Dihing rivers and their tributaries. The alluvium had been drilled for <b>coring</b> <b>up</b> to about 50 m at four sites, viz. Dhola, Dum Duma, ChotaTingrai and Naharkatiya, which are almost equally placed in a north-south direction from the river Brahmaputra towards south close {{to the foot of the}} Naga Hills. Grain size distribution of the sediments reveals that the samples are invariably sand with minor amount of clay and silts. Most of the sediments show bimodal size distribution. Cummulative curves indicate combination of different modes of transport and deposition and represent mostly two line segments and a few three line segments. Mean size of the sediments varies from very fine sand to medium sand. Majority of the sediments are moderately sorted and fine skewed. The frequency of leptokurtic and extremely leptokurtic sediments are maximum. Bivariate plots of standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis vs mean size show wide scatter of the valuessuggesting fluctuating energy conditions [...] The bivariate plots and the CM plot suggest the fluvial nature of the sediments deposited chiefly in channel sub environment under medium to high energy condition. Ultra stable and unstable heavy mineral assemblage in the sediments points to their derivation mainly from source areas consisting mainly of high grade metamorphic and acid igneous rocks...|$|E
40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) have {{developed}} a number of coring and drilling systems for use in science projects in the UK and internationally. These include 3 m and 6 m vibrocoring systems; a 5 m combined rockdrill and vibrocorer system; an oriented drill designed specifically to recover samples for use in palaeomagnetic studies; and a 55 m rockdrill (RockDrill 2). Recently, BGS {{have developed}} an autonomous, battery-operated vibrocoring system compatible with both the 3 m and 6 m vibrocorers, {{which can be used}} in water depths up to 6000 m. Use of a battery system negates the use of an umbilical power cable to operate the vibrocorer, which instead can be deployed using the vessels A-frame and winch. The autonomous battery system comprises six 48 V 19 Ah batteries connected in series to give a 288 V power source, a microprocessor and real-time clock. Data from the sensors are recorded with a time-stamp, giving diagnostic information that can be downloaded once the system is returned to the deck. The vibrocorer is operated via a pre-set program which is set up before deployment. The new system not only allows vibrocoring in greater water depths, but can also be used on smaller vessels where deck space is limited as a separate winch and umbilical is not required. The autonomous system was used {{for the first time in}} June 2014 on-board the R Belgica to acquire samples from 20 sites in the Dangeard and Explorer canyon heads, off the southwest of England in 430 m water depth. Another development is the BGS 55 m rockdrill (RockDrill 2), a remotely operated sampling system capable of <b>coring</b> <b>up</b> to 55 m below sea floor in water depths up to 4000 m. The rockdrill can be operated via its own launch and recovery system and can be outfitted with additional sensors such as gas flow meters, which have been designed by the BGS for assessing volume of gas hydrate, and down-hole logging tools. The 55 m rockdrill has recently been used to sample hydrate-entrained sediments in the Sea of Japan. The maximum coring depth achieved was 32 m below sea floor and the system can operate for more than 50 hours on a single deployment. The BGS system will be used in conjunction with the Bremen University (MARUM) MeBo sea-floor rockdrill on future International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions. ...|$|E
