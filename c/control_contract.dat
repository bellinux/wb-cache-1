Using a large-scale survey of Danish firms, we explore different drivers {{of the success of}} offshore outsourcing activities, as perceived by managers. We find that an integrated product development program in which the partner is used actively increases the likelihood of experiencing a successful offshore outsourcing project. Long-term contracting appears to have little effect on success, while combining the two entails a negative effect which renders the positive effect of the product development strategy insignificant. We attribute this to misalignment of the type of safeguard with the type activity. Keywords: Offshore outsourcing, product development, quality <b>control,</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|E

40|$|Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) {{has become}} a {{standard}} in the industry, using SystemC. With SystemC/TLM, {{it is possible to}} develop an executable vir-tual prototype of a hardware platform, so that software developers can start writing code long before the actual chip is available. A hardware model in SystemC/TLM is very abstract, com-pared to the detailed RTL model. It is clearly component-based, with guidelines defining how components should be designed for use in any TLM context. However, these guidelines are quite informal for the moment. In this paper, we establish a structural correspondence between SystemC/TLM and a formal component-model for embedded systems called 42, for which we have defined a notion of <b>control</b> <b>contract,</b> and an execution mode for systems made of com-ponents ’ contracts. This is a way of formalizating SystemC/TLM principles. Moreover, it allows the combined use of SystemC/TLM components with 42 components.

Prior {{research suggests that the}} management aspect of inter-partner relationships is limited. There is also limits in research regarding the factors impacting how to manage inter-partner relationship and how it relates to IJV performance. The theory used for this study is an integrated framework of social exchange theory (SET) and transaction cost economics (TCE). These theories acquire two sets of mechanisms on how to manage inter-partner relationship and its impact on IJV performance: (1) social mechanisms of trust, communication, and cultural adaptation, and (2) structural mechanisms of ownership <b>control,</b> <b>contract,</b> balanced asset specificity and resource complementarity. The framework is tested empirically using interviews as data collection from five Swedish companies involved in an IJV with partners headquartered in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

The most influencing factors on inter-partner management and IJV performance are trust, communication, contract and resource complementarity. We also identified interesting results regarding the interaction between the social and structural mechanisms in relation to management and IJV performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Blends of {{chitosan}} {{and synthetic}} aliphatic polyesters (polybutylene succinate, polybutylene succinate adipate, polycaprolactone, and polybutylene terepthalate adipate) were compounded {{with and without}} hydroxyapatite, a bioactive mineral filler known to enhance osteoconduction. The blends and composites were compression molded with two different granulometric salt sizes (63 – 125 lm and 250 – 500 lm) having different levels of salt content (60, 70, and 80 %) by weight. By leaching the salt particles, {{it was possible to}} produce porous scaffolds with distinct morphologies. The relationship between scaffold morphology and mechanical properties was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, microcomputed tomography, compression testing, differential scanning calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The produced scaffolds are characterized by having different morphologies depending on the average particle size and the amount of NaCl used. Specimens with higher porosity level have a less organized pore structure but increased interconnectivity of the pores. The stress–strain curve under compression displayed a linear elasticity followed by a plateau whose characteristics depend on the scaffold polymer composition. A decrease in the salt particle size used to create the porosity caused in general a decrease in the mechanical properties of the foams. Composites with hydroxyapatite had a sharp reduction in yield stress, modulus, and strain at break. The melting temperature decreased with increased chitosan content. SAXS results indicate no preferential crystalline orientation in the scaffolds. Cytotoxicity evaluation were carried out using standard tests (accordingly to ISO/ EN 10993 part 5 guidelines), namely MTS test with a 24 -h extraction period, revealing that L 929 cells had comparable metabolic activities to that obtained for the negative <b>control.</b> <b>Contract</b> grant sponsor: Fundacao Luso-Americana para Desenvolvimento (FLAD...|$|E
40|$|Never {{before has}} more been asked of State Education Agencies (SEAs), {{commonly}} known as state departments of education. In recent years, policymakers {{at the state and}} federal level have viewed the SEA as the default entity for implementing new and sweeping K [...] 12 initiatives [...] everything from Race to the Top grants and ESEA waivers to teacher evaluation reform and digital learning. But SEAs were designed [...] and evolved over decades [...] to address a relatively narrow set of tasks: distributing state and federal dollars, monitoring the use of these funds, and overseeing the implementation of federal and state education programs. They were not created [...] nor have they developed the core competencies [...] to drive crucial reforms. Accordingly, we argue that despite the best efforts of talented, energetic leaders, SEAs {{will never be able to}} deliver the reform results we need. But there is an alternative.

In short, Osborne and Gaebler call for state agencies to "steer" more and "row" less.

We offer the " 4 Cs" model (<b>control,</b> <b>contract,</b> cleave, and create) for rethinking state-level K [...] 12 reform work. In practice, this means pursuing activities on two parallel tracks.
