40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are available for}} constraint satisfaction problems. Most of them lack real time capability and distributed computational properties. Configuration of complex systems has today become a competitive edge, e. g. within e-business. The {{other side of the}} same coin can be used for diagnosis and simulation of safe critical applications. This paper gives a scientific background and comparison of methods for constraint satisfaction problems implemented in real time environment. Especially, the technique and its features of the array-based logic will be illustrated by three examples. The examples are: 1. Modelling and simulation of system wide protection applications of power systems 2. Modelling, simulation and implementation of safe critical switching in power systems 3. Modelling, simulation and implementation of safe critical systems of automatic train control Array-based logic is a novel technology, which is founded on a geometrical representation of logic in terms of nested data arrays. In this representation, logical inferences are executed on finite domain systems by a few standardised array operations. In computational practice, array-based logic makes it possible to solve large-scale constraint problems with combinations very efficiently. The major advantages of the technology are completeness, compactness, and speed of simulation (real-time capability), all of which derive from intrinsic properties of the underlying geometrical model. A system in array-based logic is considered analogously to electrical networks and is thus described by the constraints of the isolated elements as well as the constraints of the interconnected elements (the system topology). All system constraints are eliminated in accordance with the methods known from electrical network theory and other engineering disciplines rooted in classical physics. The configuration space is represented explicitly in terms of nested data arrays and the system can therefore be simulated in real-time by <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> on these arrays. This data driven approach makes it suitable for parallel processing, which is an important quality for distributed systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a novel 1 -Dimensional representation of DNA, {{which is based}} on graphical representations of the 64 triplets of nucleic acids {{on the periphery of the}} unit circle. By using the polar coordinate of 64 codons (expressed in radians) four letter DNA sequence is transformed into a numerical sequence with no more than 64 different entries. By depicting the 1 -Dim representation (plotted on z-coordinate) and using the x <b>co-ordinate</b> as running <b>index</b> one obtains “spectrum-like ” graphical representation of DNA. The novel representation of DNA has some advantages over other spectrum-like 1 - dimensional and 2 -dimensional representations in using the same coordinates for the same codons thus avoiding computations of coordinates, which is characteristic of the Jeffrey’s algorithm and graphical representations of DNA based on its modification. Key words: graphical representation of DNA, β-globin gene, table of codons, hilbert fracta...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{distributed}} algorithm for mutual exclusion based on path reversal. The algorithm does not use logical clocks to serialize the concurrent events, and all the variables are bounded. When a process invokes a critical section, it sends a request to {{the tail of a}} queue. A dynamical rooted tree gives the path to this tail. The algorithm requires only O(Log (n)) messages on average, where n is the number of processes in the network. The performances analysis of the algorithm is based on generating formal power series.

40|$|As part of {{a series}} of {{comparisons}} of the structures of the three oxidation states of flavodoxin from Clostridium MP, phases for the semiquinono form were determined to 2. 0 A resolution by isomorphous replacement (m > = 0. 725). Subsequently, the structure was refined at 1. 8 A resolution by a combination of difference Fourier, real space and reciprocal space methods. After refining to an R of 0. 194, we explored the conformation of the FMN binding site by real space refinement versus maps with Fourier coefficients of the form (2 |Fo|- |Fc|) exp (i[alpha]c). To minimize bias in the fitting, groups of atoms were systematically omitted from the structure factors used in computation of the (2 |Fo - |Fc|) maps. One-electron reduction of oxidized flavodoxin is accompanied by several changes at the FMN binding site: the conformation of residues in the reverse bend formed by Met 56 -Gly 57 -Asp 58 -Glu 59 differs in the crystal structures of the oxidized and semiquinone species; further, backbone atoms in residues 55 and 89 shift by more than 0. 5 A and the indole ring of Trp 90 undergoes a significant displacement. The orientation of the peptide unit connecting Gly 57 and Asp 58 is consistent with the presence of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 57 and the flavin N(5) in flavodoxin semiquinone. No equivalent bond is found in oxidized flavodoxin. In both the oxidized and semiquinone species of clostridial flavodoxin, the isoalloxazine ring is essentially planar : the bending angles about N(5) [...] -N(10) are ~ 2. 5 [deg] for the semiquinone structure and ~ 0 [deg] in oxidized flavodoxin. The intensity changes resulting from the oxidized agsemiquinone conversion (RI = 0. 33) arise in part from changes in molecular packing. Intermolecular contacts, including neighbors of the prosthetic group, are altered in the repacking. Maps or models of the two oxidation states can be brought into approximate coincidence by a rigid body motion. The required transformation, determined for the isomorphous replacement maps by the method of Cox (1967), is equivalent to a screw motion with a rotation of 1. 18 [deg] and a translation of - 0. 34 A. The molecular structures of oxidized and semiquinone flavodoxins have been compared after superposition of models with idealized <b>co-ordinates</b> and discrepancy <b>indices</b> Rox = 0. 213 and Rsq = 0. 200. The root-mean-square distance between 523 backbone atoms (excluding sequences 56 to 59 and 89 to 91) is 0. 308 A...|$|R
