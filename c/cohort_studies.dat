5|$|The {{results of}} {{prospective}} <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> {{on the relationship}} between abortion and breast cancer have been consistently negative. Such studies are considered more reliable than retrospective studies and case-control studies. The positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk observed in case-control studies is accounted for by recall bias.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than <b>cohort</b> <b>studies,</b> but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should {{be representative of the}} distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.|$|E
25|$|These {{claims are}} not {{supported}} by epidemiologic data. The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979â90, with the greatest increase in 2000â02, yet AIDS cases and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s. Duesberg's claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, {{was the cause of}} AIDS has been specifically examined and found to be false. <b>Cohort</b> <b>studies</b> have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop opportunistic infections; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cohort</b> <b>studies</b> select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2Ã2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{consumption}} of black tea (but not green tea) {{has been associated}} with a significant reduction in death from all cancers. There is limited evidence to suggest that green tea consumption may be associated with a slightly lower risk of esophageal cancer in the Chinese population, a lower risk of lung cancer in women, and a lower risk of oral cancer in Asian people. A 2015 meta-analysis of nine prospective <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> concluded that a high amount of green tea consumption may be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in Asian women. This association was not seen in Asian men or when one cup of green tea was consumed daily. Similarly, another analysis of observational data conducted in 2012 suggested that green tea consumption may have a favorable effect on lung cancer risk. The observed effect was strongest in those who consumed more than seven cups of green tea daily. A 2011 meta-analysis of epidemiological studies found limited evidence that green tea consumption may be associated with a moderately reduced risk of liver cancer in Chinese and Japanese people. Limited evidence suggests that green tea consumption is not associated with the risk of developing pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer. The link between green tea consumption and stomach cancer risk is unclear due to inconsistent evidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} {{involving}} statistics {{on abortion and}} breast cancer was a broad study in 1957 examining common cancers in Japan. The researchers were cautious about drawing any conclusions from their unreliable methodologies. During the 1960s several studies by Brian MacMahon et al. in Europe and Asia touched on a correlation between abortion and breast cancer.
