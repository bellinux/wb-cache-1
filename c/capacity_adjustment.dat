50|$|The {{overall system}} {{involves}} two state variables: price and capacity. Using the temporary equilibrium method, {{it can be}} reduced to a system involving only state variable. This is possible because each short-run equilibrium price will be a function of the prevailing capacity, and the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing price. Hence the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing capacity. The method works if the price adjusts fast and <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment</b> is comparatively slow.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{desirable}} to maintain consistent dynamic behavior of WIP regulation in work systems with multiple modes of <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment</b> (floaters, overtime, etc.) and different adjustment periods, delays and limits {{in the various}} modes.

In this paper, a control-theoretic model of WIP regulation is presented first that accommodates multiple <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment</b> modes with different adjustment periods (per shift, per day, per week, etc.) and different delays in implementing adjustments. Then an algorithm is presented for adapting WIP adjustment parameters in the presence of <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment</b> limits and mode priorities so that a specified dynamic performance goal continues to be met. Results of simulations driven by industrial data are used to illustrate the effect of limits and performance goals on dynamic behavior, and conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of adaptive regulation of WIP by coordinating multiple modes of <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustment...</b>|$|E

We find that when {{there is only a}} small cost of adjustment, a firm has more incentive to deviate at a larger capacity. We also derive conditions under which deviation in the high-demand state (regardless of present capacity) is more profitable.

In terms of a matrix inequality, a sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is presented using an appropriate Lyapunov function, which depends {{on the size of the}} delay and is solved by existing convex optimization techniques.

40|$|The {{planning}} of production capacity {{for a company}} has been extensively discussed in literature. Seasonal demand of products or seasonal availability of input materials can make the problem even more challenging, as due to a constant need for <b>capacity</b> <b>adjustments.</b> For example, in contrast to conventional chemical processes, the use of biomass has several distinct characteristics like a time dependent availability of raw materials.

Thus the use of the pinch analysis approach for production planning when facing a seasonal demand is analyzed first as a new heuristic approach.

The freight rate data are monthly averages from January 1989 to December 1998 in the Very Large Crude oil Carrier (VLCC) market. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} drift is non-linear with strong mean reversion only for high freight rates, and that the volatility is increasing progressively in the freight rate level. Moreover, the market price of freight rate risk is close to zero for low and medium freight rates and increasing in the freight rate level.
