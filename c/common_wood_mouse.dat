I mention numbers, arrivals and departures of the Long-eared Owl during the years 2013 - 2015 and the influence of abiotic factors on these results. I also deal with ringing and recoveries of these owls in the territory of Kladno. I verify the hypothesis of the influence of warm weather, rainfall and snow cover on the representation of small mammals and birds species in the diet of the Long-eared Owl in this thesis. In addition, my thesis is devoted to the analysis of methodology and species identification in food of the Long-eared Owl by skulls and pelvic bones. In my thesis, when determining the type of small mammals I deal with sexing of Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and <b>Wood</b> <b>Mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus) of the pelvic bones.

Some of their many projects have included the fund raising and construction of a Multi Use Games Area (MUGA) on the Twentyman's Playing Fields. They have also planted 1200 trees in a community wood called the Jubilee Wood which was planted to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Recently they formed a partnership with Vinci Construction and Jaguar Land Rover for a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project which included the installation of a wheelchair access gate, seating benches and information boards in the wood. They host local businesses for volunteer days carrying out maintenance and improvement works in the wood. In an annual project with Bilbrook Codsall Scouts they construct bird nesting boxes, bat roosting boxes and insect hotels. The wood is now brimming with wildlife including: bank vole, field vole, <b>common</b> shrew, <b>wood</b> <b>mouse,</b> grass snake, barn owl, tawny owl, kestrel, kingfisher, noctule bat, soprano and common pipistrelle bat. Bordering the Jubilee Wood to the North East is the Moat Brook.

40|$|There is {{currently}} little {{knowledge of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus) population on the Isle of Rum (Inner Hebrides, Scotland). Informal monitoring suggests that the mice on the island are larger than their mainland conspecifics, and also that <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> on Rum are found living at higher altitudes than on the mainland. In 2009, SNH staff on Rum invited the Department of Life Sciences at Anglia Ruskin University {{to carry out a}} pilot survey of the <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> on Rum, using live trapping to determine distribution and abundance. An important objective of this survey was to provide information about the likely consequences for the Rum <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> population of proposed rat control measures on the island. The main findings of this survey were as follows: <b>Wood</b> <b>mice</b> were found at all sites (n= 8) surveyed on Rum, from just above sea level to above 450 m in the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) nesting colonies. <b>Wood</b> <b>mice</b> were most abundant in areas of mature mixed woodland, but were also found in other habitats such as coniferous woodland and Molinia-dominated wet grasslands, and in areas where there has been no permanent human habitation for several decades. Trap damage sustained during this survey indicates possible brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) predation of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> on Rum. The implications of this finding, in relation to proposed future rat control on Rum, are discussed. Morphological data obtained during this study show that the <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> on Rum are particularly large (a number of adult mice captured, of both sexes, had body weights of > 30 g). There was a significant difference in size between mice found around human habitation at low altitudes, and the (larger) mice living at high altitudes on Rum in the shearwater colonies.

The fact that M. musculus {{is not a}} host in the wild prompted us to reassess MHV- 68 infection in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus), a natural host. Here, we report significant differences in MHV- 68 infection in the two species: (i) following intranasal inoculation, MHV- 68 replicated in the lungs of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to levels approximately 3 log units lower than in BALB/c mice; (ii) in BALB/c mice, virus replication in alveolar epithelial cells {{was accompanied by a}} diffuse, T-cell-dominated interstitial pneumonitis, whereas in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> it was restricted to focal granulomatous infiltrations; (iii) within <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> latently infected lymphocytes were abundant in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue that was not apparent in BALB/c mice; (iv) splenic latency was established in both species, but well-delineated secondary follicles with germinal centers were present in <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> while only poorly delineated follicles were seen in BALB/c mice; and, perhaps as a consequence, (v) production of neutralizing antibody was significantly higher in <b>wood</b> <b>mice.</b> These differences highlight the value of this animal model in the study of MHV- 68 pathogenesis...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>mice</b> are {{primarily}} seed eaters, particularly seeds of trees such as oak, beech, ash, lime, hawthorn, and sycamore. If seeds are plentiful on the ground, they carry {{them back to}} their nests/burrows for storage. They may eat small invertebrates such as snails and insects, particularly in late spring and early summer when seeds are least available. They also consume berries, fruits, and roots. During the colder months, <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> do not hibernate; however, during severe winter seasons they fall into a sort of torpor, a decrease in physiological activity. They are mainly active during the dark, and are very good climbers. While foraging, <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> pick up and distribute visually conspicuous objects, such as leaves and twigs, which they then use as landmarks during exploration. If a <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> is caught by its tail, it can quickly shed the end of it, which may never regrow. Despite its name, it prefers hedgerows to woodland. To prevent predation, <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> tend to forage in covered microsites.|$|R
40|$|Aim Size {{and shape}} of the {{mandible}} are investigated across the latitudinal range of the European <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus), in order to address the relative importance of genetic structure, insularity, and geographical gradient in patterning morphological variation. Results are compared with those on two Asiatic species of <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> A. argenteus and A. speciosus. Location The European <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> is sampled by a set of trapping localities including both, islands and mainland populations, as well as the four genetic groups identified in previous studies. The localities cover a latitudinal gradient from 55 degreesN to 36 degreesN. Methods Different Fourier methods are applied to the outlines of mandibles and their results compared in the case of A. sylvaticus. All provide similar results and allow a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of the European <b>wood</b> <b>mouse.</b> Using the method allowing for the best reduction of the informative data set, a comparison of the European <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> with the two Asiatic species was performed. Results Within the European <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> A. sylvaticus, a strong latitudinal gradient in mandible shape overrides the influence of insularity and genetic structure. Yet, random morphological divergence in insular conditions can be identified as a secondary process of shape differentiation. Size displays no obvious pattern of variation, neither with insularity or latitude. A comparison with two other species of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> suggests that a similar latitudinal gradient in mandible shape exists in different species, mandibles being flatter in the north and wider in the south. Main conclusion The latitudinal gradient in mandible shape observed in the three species of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> is interpreted as an intraspecific adaptive response to gradual changes in feeding behaviour.

50|$|In natural {{infection}}s, H. polygyrus {{is found}} almost ubiquitously within populations of wild <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus). In {{one study of}} <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> populations in Oxfordshire, England, 70% of all mice sampled carried an infection with H. polygyrus, with an average infection burden of about 12 worms per mouse. Natural infection intensity displays high variability in <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> ranging from 0 - 244 adult worms per mouse. Both male and female mice show equal parasitic burdens. Parasite occurrence appears to positively correlate with weight and age of the mouse, showing an increase in prevalence in older, heavier mice.

Remote photography showed the same propor-tions of captures than live-trapping in the two habitats studied (G = 0. 07; p = 0. 79; d. f. = 1). Temporal activity patterns of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> were biphasic during winter in shrublands, with lower values of activity near sunset and sunrise, and maximum four hours after sunset anf five hours before sunrise.

40|$|LiDAR {{technology}} has firmly contributed {{to strengthen the}} knowledge of habitat structure-wildlife relationships, though there is an evident bias towards flying vertebrates. To bridge this gap, we investigated and compared the performance of LiDAR and field data to model habitat preferences of <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus) in a Mediterranean high mountain pine forest (Pinus sylvestris). We recorded nine field and 13 LiDAR variables that were summarized by means of Principal Component Analyses (PCA). We then analyzed <b>wood</b> <b>mouse's</b> habitat preferences using three different models based on: (i) field PCs predictors, (ii) LiDAR PCs predictors; and (iii) both set of predictors in a combined model, including a variance partitioning analysis. Elevation was also included as a predictor in the three models. Our results indicate that LiDAR derived variables were better predictors than field-based variables. The model combining both data sets slightly improved the predictive power of the model. Field derived variables indicated that <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> was positively influenced by the gradient of increasing shrub cover and negatively affected by elevation. Regarding LiDAR data, two LiDAR PCs, i. e. gradients in canopy openness and complexity in forest vertical structure positively influenced <b>wood</b> <b>mouse,</b> although elevation interacted negatively with the complexity in vertical structure, indicating <b>wood</b> <b>mouse's</b> preferences for plots with lower elevations but with complex forest vertical structure. The combined model {{was similar to the}} LiDAR-based model and included the gradient of shrub cover measured in the field. Variance partitioning showed that LiDAR-based variables, together with elevation, were the most important predictors and that part of the variation explained by shrub cover was shared. LiDAR derived variables were good surrogates of environmental characteristics explaining habitat preferences by the <b>wood</b> <b>mouse.</b> Our LiDAR metrics represented structural features of the forest patch, such as the presence and cover of shrubs, as well as other characteristics likely including time since perturbation, food availability and predation risk. Our results suggest that LiDAR is a promising technology for further exploring habitat preferences by small mammal communities...|$|R

40|$|Many {{questions}} are still unanswered about the biogeography and {{the origin of}} the <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> in the Mediterranean area, namely on the islands where some giant forms are described. In order to characterize the genetic structure of these insular populations and their level of morphological differentiation, 232 animals originating from 30 localities situated on several western Mediterranean islands and on the continent, either along the sea coast or more inland, were trapped. Their skulls were measured and their mtDNA purified and analysed by RFLP techniques. The <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> living on small islands are generally bigger than their relatives living on the continent whereas the size of those living on larger islands is quite the same. This kind of insular gigantism ought to be more an adaptive response to peculiar insular environmental conditions (particularly a lower predation pressure) than a consequence of a founder effect. The mtDNA of the <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> from north-eastern Spain belongs to the previously identified northwestern group (Michaux et al., 1996).

(2005) {{that the presence}} of the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus predisposes <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to carrying other species of helminths. In Portugal, mice carrying H. polygyrus showed a higher prevalence of other helminths but the magnitude of the effect was seasonal. In Egham, mice with H. polygyrus showed a higher prevalence of other helminth species, not confounded by other factors. In Malham Tarn, mice carrying H. polygyrus {{were more likely to be}} infected with other species, but only among older mice. Allowing for other factors, heavy residual H. polygyrus infections carried more species of other helminths in both the Portugal and Egham data; species richness in Malham was too low to conduct a similar analysis, but as H. polygyrus worm burdens increased, so the prevalence of other helminths also increased. Our results support those of Behnke et al. (2005), providing firm evidence that at the level of species richness a highly predictable element of co-infections in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> has now been defined: infection with H. polygyrus has detectable consequences for the susceptibility of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to other intestinal helminth species...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve our}} {{knowledge}} concerning {{the hypothesis of}} northern refugia during the last glaciation for European species, we have focused our study on the evolutionary history of the <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus) throughout its Palearctic distribution. In addition, we also studied the <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> populations from Orkney Islands and Iceland {{in order to understand}} their ways of colonization in the Atlantic islands. We used different molecular markers (cytb mitochondrial gene and a mitochondrial pseudogene). A geometric morphometric analysis using a morphological marker (mandible) was also used. This work highlights the potential existence of new <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> lineages in Western Europe.

Morphological differences also exist between the <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> lineages. However, the study did not bring any evidence concerning the existence of Nordic refugia for this species. Concerning the insular populations, our results seem to show that populations from Orkney Islands and Iceland are genetically close to the Great Britain populations.

Additional sampling in Western Europe and in the Atlantic islands will clarify the origins of these populations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of biological invasions to threaten native ecosystems is well recognized. Here we describe how an introduced species impacts on native host-parasite dynamics by acting {{as an alternative}} host. By sampling sites across an invasion front in Ireland, we quantified {{the influence of the}} introduced bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) on the epidemiology of infections caused by flea-transmitted haemoparasites of the genus Bartonella in native <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus). Bartonella infections were detected {{on either side of the}} front but occurred exclusively in <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> despite being highly prevalent in both rodent species elsewhere in Europe. Bank vole introduction has, however, affected the wood mouse-Bartonella interaction, with the infection prevalence of both Bartonella birtlesii and Bartonella taylorii declining signifi-cantly with increasing bank vole density. Whilst flea prevalence in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> increases with <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> density in areas without bank voles, no such relationship is detected in invaded areas. The results are consistent with the dilution effect hypothesis. This predicts that for vector-transmitted parasites, the presence of less competent host species may reduce infection prevalence in the principal host. In addition we found a negative relationship between B. birtlesii and B. taylorii prevalences, indicating that these two microparasites may compete within hosts.
