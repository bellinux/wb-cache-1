5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the <b>Contract</b> <b>Clause</b> of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the <b>Contract</b> <b>Clause</b> of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E

Cartels use three main approaches to raise profits: Price, market allocation, and specialization. These appear to be substitutes. Choosing one has implications for how cartels deal with instability. Simplifying, we find that cartels economize on <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> cartels in homogenous goods industries allocate markets, and small cartels avoid competition through specialization...|$|R

By 1879, the State of Louisiana had adopted a new {{constitution}} prohibiting the state's ability to grant slaughterhouse monopolies, devolving regulation of cattle slaughter to parishes and municipalities, and banning the subordinate governmental units from granting monopoly rights over such activities. Having essentially lost its monopoly protection, the Crescent City Co. sued. That case ended in Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co.

The strike occurred over management's demand that the union give up a <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> which limited management's ability to change the number of workers assigned to a task or to introduce new work rules or machinery which would result in reduced hours or numbers of employees. The strike's effects persuaded President Dwight D. Eisenhower to invoke the back-to-work provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act.

40|$|Abstract. Distribution of {{multimedia}} copyrighted material {{is a hot}} topic for the music and entertainment industry. Piracy, peer to peer networks and portable devices make multimedia content easily transferable without respecting the associated rights and protection mechanisms. Standard and industry-led initiatives try to prevent this unauthorised usage by means of electronic protection and governance mechanisms. On the other hand, different organisations have been handling related legal issues by means of paper contracts. Now, the question is: How can we relate electronic protection measures with the paper contracts behind them? This paper presents an analysis of current <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> and an approach to generate, from them, standardised rights expressions, or licenses, in an as automatic as possible way. A mapping between those <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> and MPEG- 21 REL (Rights Expression Language), the most promising rights expressions standard, is also proposed, including an initial relational model database structure. An ontology-based approach for the problem is also pointed out. If <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> could be expressed {{as part of an}} ontology, this would facilitate the automatic licenses generation. Generic contracts ontologies and specific intellectual property rights ontologies would be the starting point, together with the presented analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} form of contract plays {{a significant role}} in a construction project as it communicates the procedures to be adopted in executing the project including the determination of the rights and obligations of contracting parties. Hence, an acceptable degree of commonality in interpretation of this document by different contracting parties is a prerequisite for the smooth functioning of a construction project. The aim of this research is to ascertain whether there is a relationship between readability of <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> and their interpretation. Readability is concerned with the complexity of words and sentences of text and it is commonly assessed by readability formulas. The survey undertaken for this research measured the ability of construction <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> having different readability values to convey a common understanding to all categories of respondents in terms {{of the degree to which}} risk was apportioned between the client and the contractor. The study reveals that there is a relationship between readability and contract interpretation. When the readability of the contract document is high, there found to be a high degree of commonality in interpretation of the document by different readers.

500|$|The major {{political}} issue in Kentucky during Helm's legal training was the Old Court-New Court controversy. Reeling from the [...] panic of 1819, Kentuckians had demanded debt relief.

The angered legislature attempted to impeach the justices on the Court of Appeals, but lacked the necessary two-thirds majority.

500|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, H.M.S. Pinafore, {{opened in}} May 1878.

After Carte made promotional efforts and Sullivan included some of the Pinafore music in several promenade concerts that he conducted at Covent Garden, Pinafore became a hit. [...] The Opera Comique was required to close at Christmas 1878 for repairs to drainage and sewage under the Public Health Act of 1875. [...] Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a <b>contract</b> <b>clause</b> reverting the rights of Pinafore and Sorcerer to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of H.M.S. Pinafore. [...] Carte then took a six-month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879.

40|$|The Commission Proposal for a "Regulation on a Common European Sales Law (CESL) " {{does not}} provide an {{exhaustive}} individuation and description of the possible grounds of invalidity or ineffectiveness of sales contracts and contract terms. As a matter of fact, an almost complete set of rules may be found solely {{with respect to the}} avoidability of <b>contracts</b> (or <b>contracts</b> <b>clauses)</b> vitiated by mistake, fraud, threats or unfair exploitation. The paper analyses some of the most widely discussed issues relating to the invalidity of <b>contracts</b> and <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> as may result from the breach of the limits imposed by the CESL on the freedom of the parties to determine the contents of <b>contract</b> <b>clauses.</b> The paper contains a systematic analysis {{of some of the most}} complex and discussed items of the invalidity of <b>contracts</b> and <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> with a particular consideration of: “not binding” terms, clauses that exclude the application of mandatory rules or derogate from or vary their effects, conditions of validity of the <b>clauses</b> of sales <b>contracts</b> concerning the characteristics, qualities and performance capabilities of the goods, and terms in commercial transactions relating to the time or period of payment of the price and to the consequences of the late payment of the price. Against the backdrop of the principle of systemic coherence, the paper suggests that a better coordination should be ensured between the current contents of the proposal and, inter alia, Directives 93 / 13 /EEC, 2005 / 29 /EC and 2011 / 7 /EU. The case is equally made for the CESL to incorporate and “codify” the solutions adopted by the European Court of Justice regarding the preceding topics, as a means to build up a fully coherent regulation of the European Sales Law...|$|R

It is also one of the least safe industries, with a high frequency of accidents resulting in financial losses, injuries, disabilities and deaths. Decent working conditions and resulting improved worker satisfaction are key to sustainable productivity in the industry. International standards safeguarding construction workers are abundant and ratified by most low-income countries. Are these standards adequately reflected in contracts for construction works? If not, how can <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> be improved and operationalised? Design/methodology/approach: Based on research undertaken in Ghana, India and Zambia from 2000 to 2003, this paper explores the aforementioned questions. The paper comprises of analysis of <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> from the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) and developing country contracts, along with cases study findings. Findings: This paper finds that more legislation is not the urgent issue; incorporating existing legislation into construction <b>contracts</b> and making <b>clauses</b> operational is a priority. This paper identifies practical and cost-effective procedures for bringing stakeholders together to implement and monitor labour standards, with the aim of contributing to the overall goal of providing “decent work” for all workers in the construction industry. Original/value of the paper: This paper explores issues around implementing labour standards in construction of minor infrastructure works in low income countries and concludes with suggestions on how best to operationalise <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> through a process approach...|$|R
