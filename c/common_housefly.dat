In Europe, insect {{producers}} and pig breeders have {{to comply with}} rather complex rules and legal requirements, mainly related to the feed (or “substrate) fed to the insects. Annex III of Regulation (EC) 767 / 2009 lists a number of materials that are prohibited as substrate for insects, such as feces and “household waste”. Substrates have to comply also with EU regulations on animal proteins (Regulation 1069 / 2009 and the implementing 142 / 2011) : according to these regulations, some (animal protein) sources such as manure, gut content, dead-in-shell poultry, and fallen stock are prohibited as substrate for insects. Insects {{are expected to be}} increasingly used in Europe as protein replacers in animal nutrition, and the potential species for use in pig diets are Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), larvae of Musca domestica (<b>common</b> <b>housefly),</b> and Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm).

In order to isolate eggs and cysts/oocysts of enteric parasites in adults of M. domestica, this study used the “jug-trap” method from October 2008 to October 2009.   In the ecological analysis was used the Concentration of Relative Dominance (CRD) as well the Bodenheimer’s Constancy.

40|$|In Musca domestica, the <b>common</b> <b>housefly,</b> female {{development}} {{requires the}} continuous {{activity of the}} sex-determining gene F from early embryogenesis until metamorphosis. To activate F in embryogenesis, two conditions must be met: There must be no male-determining M factor in the zygotic genome, and the egg must be preconditioned by F activity in the maternal germ line. This maternal activity can be suppressed by introducing an M factor into the maternal germ line, which causes all offspring, including {{those that do not}} carry M, to develop as males. By transplantation of pole cells (germline progenitor cells) we have constructed such females with a genetically male germ line and, simultaneously, males with a genetically female germ line carrying a constitutive allele of F [F(Dominant) (F(D)) ]. Crosses between these animals yielded offspring that, despite the presence of M in the maternal germ line, were of female sex, solely due to zygotic F(D) brought in via the sperm.

40|$|Through {{the decades}} of {{relentless}} and dedicated studies in Drosophila melanogaster, the pathway that governs sexual development has been elucidated in great detail {{and has become a}} paradigm in understanding fundamental cell-fate decisions. However, recent phylogenetic studies show that the molecular strategy used in Drosophila deviates in some important aspects from those found in other dipteran flies and suggest that the Drosophila pathway {{is likely to be a}} derivative of a simpler and more common principle. In this essay, I will discuss the evolutionary plasticity of the sex-determining pathway based on studies in the <b>common</b> <b>housefly,</b> Musca domestica. Diversification appears to primarily arise from subtle differences in the regulation of the key switch gene transformer at the top of the pathway. On the basis of these findings I propose a new idea on how the Drosophila pathway may have evolved from a more archetypal system such as in M. domestica. In essence, the arrival of an X counting mechanism mediated by Sex-lethal to compensate for X linked gene dose differences set the stage for an intimate coupling of the two pathways. Its precedent recruitment to the dosage compensation pathway allowed for an intervention in the regulation of transformer where it gradually and eventually' completely substituted for a need of transformer autoregulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>common</b> <b>housefly,</b> Musca domestica and the green-bottle fly Lucilia {{species are}} Diptera {{belonging}} to the Suborder Cyclorrapha. The former species is associated with mechanical transmission of certain diarrhoeal diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera, which afflict man. Other important diseases include, anthrax, eye infections and bovine mastitis. It is {{the manner in which}} M. domestica exudes a “vomit-drop ” to sugar, dried blood, pus, excreta, sputum and other substances that makes it an efficient vector of human diseases. Bacteria may also adhere to the hairy body of the fly and to the hairy puvilli on the feet. Lucilia sp. is mostly associated with diseases of livestock such as sheep and fowls. This species causes myiasis of sheep called “strike”, which results in larval development in the skin. Usually, environmental sanitation involving elimination of fly breeding sites by proper disposal of refuse, manure, compost, human excreta and other waste is the fundamental measure for fly control. However, there are instances where control has to be supplemented with insecticides. Among the most commonly used insecticidal methods of control is the use of baits. These are placed or applied to surfaces where adult flies congregate to feed. This control measure takes advantage of the fly’s mechanism of feeding. This paper discusses findings of an experiment designed to test attractiveness and bio-efficacy of an organophosphate-based bait against M. domestica and Lucilia species...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>common</b> <b>housefly,</b> the {{presence}} or absence of a male-determining factor, M, is responsible for sex determination. In different strains, M has been found on the Y, on the X, or on any of the five autosomes. By analyzing a Y-autosomal translocation and a ring-shaped, truncated Y chromosome, we could show that M on the Y consists of at least two regions with M activity: One of them can be assigned to the short arm of the Y chromosome (MYS), which is largely C-banding negative, the other region lies on the C-banding positive long arm of the Y, including the centromeric part (MYL). Each region alone behaves as a hypomorphic M factor, causing many carriers to develop as intersexes of the mosaic type instead of as males. When introduced into the female germ line by transplantation of progenitor germ cells (pole cells), the MYS shows an almost complete maternal effect that predetermines 96 % of the genotypic female (NoM) animals to develop as males. In contrast, the MYL has largely lost its maternal effect, and most of the NoM animals develop as females. Increasing the amount of product made by either of the two hypomorphic M factors (by combining the MYS and MYL or two MYS) leads to complete male development in almost every case. We thus assume that the Y chromosome carries at least two copies of M, and that these are functionally equivalent...|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{genes of}} the sex-determination {{hierarchy}} orchestrate {{the development and}} differentiation of sex-specific tissues, establishing sex-specific physiology and neural circuitry. One of these sex-determination genes, fruitless (fru), {{plays a key role}} in the formation of neural circuits underlying Drosophila male courtship behavior. Conservation of fru gene structure and sex-specific expression has been found in several insect orders, though it is still to be determined whether a male courtship role for the gene is employed in these species due to the lack of mutants and homologous experimental evidence. We have isolated the fru ortholog (Md-fru) from the <b>common</b> <b>housefly,</b> Musca domestica, and show the gene's conserved genomic structure. We demonstrate that male-specific Md-fru transcripts arise by conserved mechanisms of sex-specific splicing. Here we show that Md-fru, is similarly involved in controlling male courtship behavior. A male courtship behavioral function for Md-fru was revealed by the behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses of a hypomorphic allele, Md-tra(man), which specifically disrupted the expression of Md-fru in males, leading to severely impaired male courtship behavior. In line with a role in nervous system development, we found that expression of Md-fru was confined to neural tissues in the brain, most prominently in optic neuropil and in peripheral sensory organs. We propose that, like in Drosophila, overt sexual differentiation of the housefly depends on a sex-determining pathway that bifurcates downstream of the Md-tra gene to coordinate dimorphic development of non-neuronal tissues mediated by Md-dsx with that of neuronal tissues largely mediated by Md-fru. ...|$|E

Use of housefly larvae to biodegrade manure presents an opportunity to reduce waste disposal while the rapidly assimilated insect biomass {{can also be used}} as a protein rich animal feed. In this study, we examine the biodegradation of dairy cattle manure using housefly larvae, and the nutritional value of the resulting larva meal as a feed ingredient. Our results demonstrated that dairy cattle manure presents a balanced substrate for larval growth, and the spent manure showed reductions in concentration of total nitrogen (24. 9 %) and phosphorus (6. 2 %) with an overall reduction in mass. Larva yield at an optimum density was approximately 2 % of manure weight. Nutritional analysis of M. domestica larva meal showed values comparable to most high protein feed ingredients. Larva meal was 60 % protein with a well-balanced amino acid profile, and 20 % fat with 57 % monounsaturated fatty acids, and 39 % saturated fatty acids. Larva meal lacked any significant amount of omega- 3 fatty acids. Evaluation of micronutrients in larva meal suggested that it is a good source of calcium and phosphorus (0. 5 % and 1. 1 % respectively). The nutritional value of larva meal closely matches that of fishmeal, making it a potentially attractive alternative for use as a protein-rich feed ingredient for livestock and aquaculture operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{livestock}} {{sector is}} in {{urgent need for}} more sustainable feed sources, because of the increased demand for animal-source food and the already high environmental costs associated with it. Recent developments indicate environmental benefits of rearing insects for livestock feed, suggesting that insect-based feed might become an important alternative feed source in the coming years. So far, however, this potential environmental benefit of waste-fed insects is unknown. This study, therefore, explores {{the environmental impact of}} using larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>housefly</b> grown on poultry manure and food waste as livestock feed. Data were provided by a laboratory plant in the Netherlands aiming to design an industrial plant for rearing housefly larvae. Production of 1 ton dry matter of larvae meal directly resulted in a global warming potential of 770 kg CO 2 equivalents, an energy use of 9329 MJ and a land use of 32 m 2, caused by use of water, electricity, and feed for flies, eggs and larvae. Production of larvae meal, however, also has indirect environmental consequences. Food waste, for example, was originally used for production of bio-energy. Accounting for these indirect consequences implies, e. g., including the environmental impact of production of energy needed to replace the original bio-energy function of food waste. Assuming, furthermore, that 1 ton of larvae meal replaced 0. 5 ton of fishmeal and 0. 5 ton of soybean meal, the production of 1 ton larvae meal reduced land use (1713 m 2), but increased energy use (21, 342 MJ) and consequently global warming potential (1959 kg CO 2 -eq). Results of this study will enhance a transparent societal and political debate about future options and limitations of larvae meal as livestock feed. Results of the indirect environmental impact, however, are situation specific, e. g. in this study food waste was used for anaerobic digestion. In case food waste would have been used for, e. g., composting, the energy use and related emission of greenhouse gases might decrease. Furthermore, the industrial process to acquire housefly larvae meal is still advancing, which also offers potential to reduce energy use and related emissions. Eventually, land scarcity will increase further, whereas opportunities exist to reduce energy use by, e. g., technical innovations or an increased use of solar or wind energy. Larvae meal production, therefore, has potential to reduce the environmental impact of the livestock sector...|$|E

Substituting these for expensive imported materials offers farmers the opportunity to cut their production costs. Maize is the main imported energy-providing feed. Other potential substitutes which are being looked at by the Philippines Council On Agricultural Research and Development (PCARRD) include cassava, sweet potato, arrowroot, gabi (Colocasia esculenta), pongapong (Amorphopallus), coconut residues and damaged rice. Damaged rice can completely replace maize in rations but performance is better if it is used to replace only half of the maize. Cassava, too, makes a food replacement for about half the maize in a ration. To replace imported soybean meal, which is the main protein material used, there is a wider choice. The giant toad (Bufo marinus) can be cooked, dried and ground to produce a meal with 54 % crude protein, and this is comparable to fish meal. The maggot of the <b>common</b> <b>housefly</b> can be grown on poultry manure to produce a meal with 60 % crude protein but, if processed with the residue of the poultry manure, the true protein value drops to 27 %. Earthworm meal has a crude protein content of 60 % and gives better results than soybean meal and fishmeal. Rations containing roots and leaves of water hyacinth at levels of about 15 %. increased the weight-gain of broiler birds. Dried and ground azolla meal has the potential to produce a meal with about 20 % crude protein, although at inclusion levels of more than 20, it becomes unpalatable. If azolla meal is fed at levels up to about 7 % more and bigger eggs are produced. Fresh azolla mixed with snails and rough rice makes a good ration for ducks. Leaves from some trees like Anaboing (Trema orientalis) and Sesbania grandiflora can be used to replace other protein materials, up to about 20 % of the ration.
