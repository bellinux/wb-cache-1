Before 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third. After 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl has steadily increased its payouts in order {{to keep pace with the}} trend across college football. In the 2009 game, the ACC and SEC split a payout of $6.02 million, with the ACC receiving more because it offered an earlier selection.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, land {{appears to}} have been held in common with an {{individual}} unable to sell it without the consent of the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community. Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India's west coast such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, landlords never sold land without the consent of other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non-interference by the government {{in the internal affairs of}} the villages.|$|E
5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC.

The first virtue trait slot is available at level 7, for example. Virtue, class and racial traits offer a maximum of five slots, and legendary traits offer three slots. Traits can be easily changed by visiting a bard found in most towns, and equipping traits costs a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
25|$|A minor alternative, {{especially}} for information goods, {{is for the}} producer to refuse to release a good to the public until payment to cover costs is met. Author Stephen King, for instance, authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating {{that he would not}} release subsequent chapters unless a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was raised. Sometimes dubbed holding for ransom, this method of public goods production is a modern application of the street performer protocol for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.|$|E

It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that [...] "It's the same with any band.

50|$|In {{the view}} of Maimonides, there were certain {{conditions}} similar to interest which were permitted; for example, Maimonides states that a person can offer money to a second person attaching a requirement for the second person to give a <b>certain</b> larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to a third person, or a requirement for the second person to persuade a third person to lend a <b>certain</b> larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the first person. When a non-Jew was involved, Maimonides argues that interest could be charged; indeed, Maimonides argues that it was compulsory to charge interest on loans to non-Jews, but he also suggests that such loans should be restricted to being within narrow limits, to avoid the lender becoming so keen on usury that they practice it against other Jews.|$|R

In 1973, the minimum statutory retirement age was reduced from 65 to 63, while “flexible” retirement was provided for those {{between the ages of}} 63 and 67.

2500|$|The NFL allows {{each team}} a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from its salary cap to sign its drafted rookies {{for their first}} season. That amount {{is based on an}} {{undisclosed}} formula that assigns a certain value to each pick in the draft; thus, having more picks, or earlier picks, will increase the allotment. In 2008 the highest allotment was about $8.22 million for the Kansas City Chiefs, who had 12 picks, including two first-rounders, while the lowest was the $1.79 million for the Cleveland Browns who had only five picks, and none in the first three rounds. The exact mechanism for the rookie salary cap is set out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA).

Students who meet their quotas are also given a day off in January while anyone who did not meet their quota must still attend school and complete a project. If the entire school manages to raise 100% or more of their goal, they receive an extra day off on Thanksgiving break. Also, the winning homeroom class is treated with a pizza party and additional money toward class funds (for dances, etc.). The positive reinforcement of these prizes creates friendly competition between the classes and a strong motivation to raise money for a good purpose.|$|R

2500|$|Main game contestants {{are asked}} {{increasingly}} difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Questions are multiple choice: four possible answers are given (labelled A, B, C and D), and the contestant must choose the correct one. The 'D' answer {{on the first}} question (except in the Shuffle format like in the US version) is always incorrect and humorous. Upon answering a question correctly, the contestant wins a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> In most versions, {{there is no time}} limit to answer a question; a contestant may (and often does) take as long as they need to ponder an answer. After the first few questions, the host will ask the contestant if that is their [...] "final answer". When a contestant says [...] "final" [...] in conjunction with one of the answers, it is official, and cannot be changed. The first five questions usually omit this rule, because the questions are generally so easy that requiring a final answer would significantly slow the game down; thus, there are five chances for the contestant to leave with no money if they were to provide a wrong answer before obtaining the first guaranteed amount; going for 1,000 units of currency after winning 500 units is the last point in the game at which a contestant can still leave empty-handed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elections}} were marred by fraudulent voting, ballot-box stuffing, and false returns, [...] {{the administration of}} the offices by fraud and robbery. In Mahanoy township, $60,000 was appropriated for the schools and eleven-twelfths of it stolen. Exorbitant road taxes were a fruitful means by which township officials robbed the taxpayers and put the money in their own pockets. In August 1875 an ex-county commissioner, a Molly; and two commissioners then in office, not actually belonging to the order but in sympathy with it, had been convicted of stealing the county funds and each had been sentenced by a full bench September 6 to two years' imprisonment. At the fall election for governor in this year (1875) the Molly Maguires, who were naturally Democrats, foresaw Republican success and sold their vote in Schuylkill and Luzerne counties to the Republicans for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in hand and an implied agreement that these convicted commissioners and other criminals who were called by a leading Molly [...] "our men" [...] should be pardoned. [...] It is hardly to be supposed that the Republican politicians who made this bargain were aware of the thoroughly criminal nature of the Molly Maguires, for they had astutely covered themselves with a virtuous cloak, securing from the Legislature in 1871 a charter for the Ancient Order of Hibernians whose motto was [...] "Friendship, Unity and Christian Charity." [...] On October 10, 1875, {{in a letter to the}} Shenandoah Herald Jack Kehoe denied with indignation that the Molly Maguires were synonymous with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which latter was [...] "composed of men who are law abiding and seek the elevation of their members." [...] (2) Kehoe was crafty enough to see the advantage of throwing dust in the eyes of the public and, when the outside world was bargained with, the A.O.H. was put forward; but, as matter of fact, it was the old story of ravening wolves in sheep's clothing.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Bankruptcy Act 1542 a key {{principle}} of insolvency {{law has been}} that losses are shared among creditors proportionately. Creditors who fall into the same class will share proportionally in the losses (e.g. each creditor gets 50 pence for each £1 she is owed). However, this pari passu principle only operates among creditors within the strict categories of priority set by the law. First, the law permits creditors making contracts with a company before insolvency to take a security interest over a company's property. If the security is refers to some specific asset, the holder of this [...] "fixed charge" [...] may take the asset away free from anybody else's interest {{in order to satisfy}} the debt. If two charges are created over the same property, the charge holder with the first will have the first access. Second, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 176ZA gives special priority to all the fees and expenses of the insolvency practitioner, who carries out an administration or winding up. The practitioner's expenses will include the wages due on any employment contract that the practitioner chooses to adopt. But controversially, the Court of Appeal in Krasner v McMath held this would not include the statutory requirement to pay compensation for a management's failure to consult upon collective redundancies. Third, even if they are not retained, employees' wages up to £800 and sums due into employees' pensions, are to be paid under section 175. Fourth, a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> must be set aside as a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for all creditors without security under section 176A. This is set by statutory instrument as a maximum of £600,000, or 20 per cent of the remaining value, or 50 per cent of the value of anything under £10,000. All these preferential categories (for insolvency practitioners, employees, and a limited amount for unsecured creditors) come in priority to the holder of a floating charge.|$|E
