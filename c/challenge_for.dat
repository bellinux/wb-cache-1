5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact}} that Dyer had been a {{resident}} in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E
