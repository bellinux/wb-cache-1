It is in a near polar orbit (inclination = 93°) which is almost perfectly <b>circular,</b> <b>moving</b> from being over the south pole to being over the north pole in just under an hour. The altitude was chosen to make the orbit Sun-synchronous, so that all images that were taken by the spacecraft of the same surface features on different dates were taken under identical lighting conditions. After each orbit, the spacecraft viewed the planet 28.62° to the west because Mars had rotated underneath it. In effect, it was always 14:00 for Mars Global Surveyor as it moved from one time zone to the next exactly {{as fast as the}} Sun.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of microengines {{is a function}} of the design of the mechanical linkage used to connect the electrostatic actuator to the drive. The authors have completed a series of reliability stress tests on surface micromachined microengines driving an inertial load. In these experiments, the authors used microengines that had pin mechanisms with guides connecting the drive arms to the electrostatic actuators. Comparing this data to previous results using flexure linkages revealed that the pin linkage design was less reliable. The devices were stressed to failure at eight frequencies, both above and below the measured resonance frequency of the microengine. Significant amounts of wear debris were observed both around the hub and pin joint of the drive gear. Additionally, wear tracks were observed in the area where the <b>moving</b> <b>shuttle</b> rubbed against the guides of the pin linkage. At each frequency, they analyzed the statistical data yielding a lifetime (t{sub 50 }) for median cycles to failure and {sigma}, the shape parameter of the distribution. A model was developed to describe the failure data based on fundamental wear mechanisms and forces exhibited in mechanical resonant systems. The comparison to the model will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Lateral comb {{resonators}} (LCRs) theoretically {{possess a}} symmetric structure; therefore, the electrostatic force is effective only along {{the axis of}} displacement and is neutralized elsewhere. This force is not {{a function of the}} distance between the stationary and the <b>moving</b> (<b>shuttle)</b> plates {{in the direction of the}} movement. However, manufacturing imperfections and fault conditions make the device operate asymmetrically and cause rotation of the shuttle structure in a lateral gap-closing direction, putting the device in an unstable region of operation (pull-in voltage limit). In this re-gion, the rotated structure experiences an extra force which pulls the device into the region of instability beyond the pull-in voltage limits. This paper illustrates the application of variable structure controllers to correct such behavior and to compensate for the un-certainties that exist in the microsystem parameters. The controller is equipped with a self-tuning parameter estimation block and is designed to control the LCRs under both normal and fault con-ditions. The controller utilizes through-wafer optical monitoring to provide the position feedback signal. The controller is imple-mented in a real-time control board and is experimentally verified to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method under dif-ferent operating conditions.

40|$|Individuals {{engaged in}} farming have higher risks of injury and death from trauma {{than many other}} workers. Fatalities most often involve tractor-related {{incident}} such as roll-overs. Although it is also recognized that farm machinery may result in serious injuries and death, little has been reported on problems associated with hay baling, transport and storage. Case 1 : A 43 -year-old man trying to dislodge jammed hay in a hay baler had either been pulled, or had fallen, into the baler, {{where he had been}} crushed, rotated and then cocooned within a hay bale. The body showed extensive blunt trauma to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and limbs, with burning from a fire that subsequently started within the overheated machine. Case 2 : A 58 -year-old man was crushed between the moving arms of a hay shuttle and a safety fence. Death was attributed to blunt chest and abdominal trauma with crush asphyxia. Case 3 : A 56 -year-old man fell some distance from the top of stacked hay bales fracturing his neck and causing virtual transection of his cervical spinal cord. These cases demonstrate rare forms of farm deaths that may be associated with the creation (baling), <b>moving</b> (<b>shuttling)</b> and storage of hay bales. All forms of farm machinery should be treated circumspectly, given the possibility that serious injury or death may result from inattention or inappropriate handling.

40|$|A smooth <b>circular</b> <b>moving</b> liquid sheet {{is formed}} by the head-on {{impingement}} of two equal laminar water jets. We subject such a liquid sheet to uniform laminar air flow from one side such that the direction of air velocity is perpendicular to the liquid sheet. The pressure of the moving air deforms the liquid sheet giving rise to an open water bell. The water bell is symmetric suggesting that the gas flow around the bell is also symmetric and that the gravitational force is negligible. We have captured {{the shape of the}} water bells for varying air flow rates and for varying Weber numbers, and compared the measurements with theoretical predictions obtained from a force balance involving liquid inertia, surface tension, and pressure difference across the sheet. The pressure exerted by the gas phase on the front and the rear surface of the deformed liquid sheet is obtained from known results of flow past flat circular discs. The predicted steady state shapes match well with the measurements at low Weber numbers but differences are observed at high Weber numbers, where the sheet flaps and is no longer smooth. Interestingly, the shape predicted by assuming a constant pressure difference equal to the stagnation pressure over the whole of the front face of the sheet and free stream value over the whole of the rear face yields nearly identical results suggesting that an open water bell is similar to a closed water bell in that, to a good approximation, the pressure on either sides of the water bell is homogeneous.

40|$|Many visual {{processes}} integrate information over protracted periods, {{a process}} known as temporal integration. One consequence of this is that objects that cast images that move across the retinal surfaces can generate blurred form signals, similar to the motion blur that can be captured in photographs taken with slow shutter speeds. Subjectively, retinal motion blur signals are suppressed from awareness, such that moving objects seem sharply defined. One suggestion has been that this subjective impression is due to humans not being able to distinguish between focussed and blurred moving objects. Contrary to this suggestion, here we report a novel illusion, and consequent experiments, that implicate a suppressive mechanism. We find that the apparent shape of <b>circular</b> <b>moving</b> objects can be distorted when their rear edges lag leading edges by 60. ms. Moreover, we find that sensitivity for detecting blur, and for discriminating between blur intensities, is uniformly worse for physical blurs added behind moving objects, as opposed to in-front. Also, it was easier to differentiate between slight and slightly greater physical blurs than it was to differentiate between slight blur and the absence of blur, both behind and in-front of moving edges. These 2 ̆ 7 dipper 2 ̆ 7 functions suggest that blur signals must reach a threshold intensity before they can be detected, and that the relevant threshold is effectively elevated for blur signals trailing behind moving contours.
