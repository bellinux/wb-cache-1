2500|$|In {{opposition}} David Cameron asked Andrew Murrison MP {{to establish}} the Military Covenant Commission. [...] Chaired by the author and ex-RAF pilot Frederick Forsyth CBE and with experts including the Falklands veteran Simon Weston OBE its report heavily influenced the current government's thinking. On 25 June 2010, The Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to enshrine the Military <b>Covenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> – such a development would allow British servicemen and servicewomen to sue the State for breaches of the Military Covenant. In February 2011 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government decided {{that there was no}} need to make the Covenant law, proposing instead to cover it in an annual report to parliament – a Labour attempt in an opposition day debate to reverse this was defeated by 86 votes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative <b>covenant).</b> <b>In</b> real property <b>law,</b> the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real <b>covenant</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|R

And whatsoever is not unjust is just.|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{does not}} include any express {{protection}} {{of the right to}} health. The Canadian government has frequently argued in court that social and economic rights - including the right to health - are merely ‘policy objectives’ that are not subject to judicial intervention. The ICESCR Committee has voiced concern over Canada’s lack of compliance to these international obligations. It argues that such submissions are incompatible with Canada’s obligations to provide remedies to violations of <b>Covenant</b> rights <b>in</b> domestic <b>law.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{civil and}} {{political}} rights as protected under the Covenant from the core of human rights protection on the international plane. This paper seeks to demonstrate how this goal may be archieved. The genesis of the Covenant will be discussed {{in the context of the}} evolution of human rights law. Starting from the normative framework and its development after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the scope of the Covenant rights as well as the duties of the State parties will be discussed. The monitoring role of th Human Rights Committee as major element in the implementation process will be closely examined. The paper will be focused on the status of the State parties and the Status of the <b>Covenant</b> <b>in</b> domestic <b>law.</b> Also will specifically focus on the State reporting system and the individual complaint procedure be carefully selected case studies. In conclusion, will be discussed the legal consequences of violations of rights protected by the Covenant...|$|R
5000|$|The Zohar Chadash {{describes}} the priesthood {{as one of}} five <b>covenants</b> listed <b>in</b> the <b>Law</b> (Zohar Chadash 4b), in the Aramaic Compendium on the Book of Exodus it is also listed as one of six unique blessings that God is destined {{to return to the}} nation of Israel. According to Sifra it is likewise listed as one of five items that God calls [...] "to me" [...] (Hebrew לי) a term that connotes an eternal choice as God himself is eternal (Sifri 167a). Sifra teaches that following the coming of the Messiah, Aaron and his sons will not require holy anointing oil to serve as the anointing done by Moses in the Tabernacle will be considered as being in effect (Sifra 1.343).|$|R
50|$|Covenant {{marriage}} is a legally distinct kind of marriage in three states (Arizona, Arkansas, and Louisiana) of the United States, in which the marrying spouses agree to obtain pre-marital counseling and accept more limited grounds for later seeking divorce (the least strict of which being that the couple lives apart from each other for only one year). Both proponents and critics of covenant marriage have described it as government inviting religion into the public square. Louisiana became {{the first state to}} pass a <b>covenant</b> marriage <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 1997; shortly afterwards, Arkansas and Arizona followed suit. Since its inception, very few couples in those states have married under covenant marriage law.|$|R

40|$|Part I of this Article {{discusses}} {{two questions}} central {{to a general}} account {{of the problem of}} meaning <b>in</b> the <b>law</b> of subdivision covenants. First, whose meaning ought to count? The answer to this question is developed principally by contrasting the meaning problem <b>in</b> <b>covenants</b> <b>law</b> with the related problem in other legal realms such as contractual and statutory interpretation. Second, what should be the role <b>in</b> contemporary <b>covenants</b> <b>law</b> of the traditional rule requiring that ambiguity <b>in</b> <b>covenant</b> language be resolved in favor of the free use of land. Here the Article explores the nature of ambiguity and critiques the rationale typically given for the ambiguity/free-use rule. The meaning problem is the centerpiece of a series of recent covenants cases of considerable societal significance. Subdivision residents have invoked covenants restricting lots to single family use in an effort to block establishment in subdivisions of group homes for the mentally retarded or other dependent individuals. Thus, the courts have had to decide whether such group homes count as families within the meaning of single-family-use covenants. Apart from their social importance, the group homes cases are worthy of attention because they show how the subtle interplay of public policy and rights considerations can affect a court 2 ̆ 7 s approach to the meaning problem. Part II of this Article is devoted to the group homes cases...|$|R

There are several <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> the Bible, and in each case they exhibit {{at least some of}} the elements found in real-life treaties of the ancient Middle East: a preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, deposition and reading, list of witnesses, blessings and curses, and ratification by animal sacrifice.

40|$|Do bank debtholders {{discipline}} excessive risk taking? I {{investigate this}} question by examining how a bank's incentives to take risks affect offering yield spreads and restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> their debt contracts. Results suggest that bank charter values, which determine a bank's risk taking incentives, significantly affect the likelihood of restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> bank debt contracts. This effect is most pronounced during the 1980 s, when greater competition and relatively less stringent regulation increased the severity of moral hazard problems in the U. S. banking industry. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} an important channel for market investors to discipline bank risk taking is through writing restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> bank debt...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} factors that influence financial <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> private debt agreements of listed French companies. We test whether borrower characteristic influence the presence of financial <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> debt contract. Using a sample of large listed French firms over the period of 2003 - 2009, we find that profitable firms with growth options are likely to include financial covenants on their syndicated private debt. We also test whether debt characteristic influence the financial <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> private debt. We find that type of debt and security dummy influence significantly financial covenants. Our results are consistent with prior studies in general...|$|R
