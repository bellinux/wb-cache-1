5|$|After Dumouriez's {{victory at}} Jemappes in November 1792, the French armies rapidly overran {{most of the}} Austrian Netherlands. Rather than driving the Austrians {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, Dumouriez and the French {{government}} became preoccupied with a war with the Dutch Republic. During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of <b>Coburg</b> and struck back. After a French covering force was routed by <b>Coburg</b> at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E
5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in <b>Coburg.</b> One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his <b>Coburg</b> properties.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} two years living under {{strained}} conditions in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany. In Munich they were reunited with Victoria's mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919. With the death of Victoria's mother, she inherited her villa, Chateau Fabron in Nice and her residence in <b>Coburg,</b> the Edinburg Palais. In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{were shot}} at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was {{detained}} and condemned to death, {{although he was}} later reprieved. Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart {{for the first time}} since their marriage when he returned to <b>Coburg</b> on the death of his father.|$|E

5|$|By 1927, {{the year}} of her 90th {{birthday}}, Cosima's health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, and was only lucid at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to <b>Coburg</b> and cremated.|$|E

She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of <b>Coburg.</b> The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E

5|$|Issues arose over {{authority}} {{to control the}} upbringing of his heir-presumptive. As head of the <b>Coburg</b> family, Ernest would normally {{have been able to}} arrange Alfred's education and general upbringing unchallenged. This however was not the case. Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance. This was partly because Alfred was second-in-line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1864. One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak. Although he grew up learning German, his native language was decided to be English. In addition, a naval career was chosen for Alfred, a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a German prince. Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in <b>Coburg,</b> but his brother refused. Albert's refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred's moral development. Thus despite Ernest's protests, he went unheeded in Albert's lifetime. In 1863, Ernest told Victoria {{that it was time for}} Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university. By March of the following year, it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future, as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England. The matter was eventually resolved; Alfred came to accept his inheritance, and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir-presumptive, with a strong German element added to his education and (carefully chaperoned) visits to <b>Coburg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Poised at {{the edge}} of Hollands Diep, Dumouriez planned to cross and march through Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague and Leiden to seize Amsterdam. After {{capturing}} Maastricht, Miranda would join him by advancing through Nijmegen and Utrecht. Preoccupied with the Dutch Republic, the French commander had given the Austrians too much time to recover. Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld massed an Austrian army on {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. He was assisted by a promising staff officer named Karl Mack von Leiberich. On 1 March, <b>Coburg</b> swept aside René Joseph de Lanoue's covering army at the Battle of Aldenhoven. The French abandoned the siege of Maastricht on 3 March. <b>Coburg</b> pursued slowly and the French forces regrouped at Leuven on the 9th. Dumouriez was slow to give up his Dutch project but the French government insisted that he take charge in Belgium. Leaving Louis-Charles de Flers in command of the Army of Holland, Dumouriez arrived at Leuven on 11 March.|$|E
5|$|Victoria came to {{the throne}} aged {{eighteen}} on 20 June 1837. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert's education for the role {{he would have to}} play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the <b>Coburg</b> family's confidential adviser, Baron Stockmar.|$|E

5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the Nazi Party, which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in <b>Coburg</b> in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} <b>Coburg</b> {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coburg</b> {{took up a}} {{defensive}} position at Neerwinden and awaited the confident Dumouriez's attack. The Coalition army was outnumbered in infantry but possessed a two-to-one superiority in cavalry. After intense fighting, Coburg's troops repulsed the attacks of the French center and right wing. When Dumouriez found that his left wing was driven off the battlefield, he began retreating. The defeat led to mass desertions from the discouraged French volunteers. In {{the face of the}} military collapse, Dumouriez negotiated a free withdrawal of French troops in return for the surrender of Belgium and Dutch territory. Soon, Dumouriez was plotting against his own government and when his plans failed, he defected to the Austrians, leaving the French army in chaos.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{believed}} that <b>Coburg</b> would put his main strength {{on the right}} wing to protect the Austrian line of communications. Therefore, he planned to throw his heaviest blow against Coburg's left wing. Clerfayt's line stretched from Neerwinden, across Mittelwinden hill to Oberwinden village on the left. Dumouriez directed Valence to outflank Oberwinden with one column, attack Oberwinden frontally with the second and seize the Mittelwinden hill with the third. On Valence's left, Chartres was ordered to attack Neerwinden with his columns. At 7:00 AM, the French swarmed across the Little Gete but Valence was unable to capture the Mittelwinden hill until noon. The French seized Racour, Oberwinden and finally Neerwinden.|$|E
5|$|Ernest II (German: Ernst August Karl Johann Leopold Alexander Eduard; 21 June 1818 – 22 August 1893) was the {{sovereign}} duke of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, reigning from 1844 to his death. Ernest {{was born in}} <b>Coburg</b> as the elder child of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his wife, Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Fourteen months later, his younger brother Prince Albert was born, who became consort of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Ernest's father became Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1826 through an exchange of territories.|$|E
5|$|Ernest, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{was born}} at Ehrenburg Palace in <b>Coburg</b> on 21 June 1818.

He was soon joined by a brother, Prince Albert, who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria. Though Duke Ernest fathered {{numerous}} children in various affairs, the two boys would have no other legitimate siblings. In 1826, their father succeeded as Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories {{after the death of}} the duke's uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the winter}} both sides re-organised. Reinforcements were transported from Britain {{in order to}} shore up the Coalition line. In the Austrian army <b>Coburg's</b> Chief of Staff Prince Hohenlohe was {{replaced}} by Karl Mack von Leiberich. At the beginning of 1794 the allied field army numbered somewhat over one hundred thousand, the bulk of the army in positions between Tournai and Bettignies, with both flanks further extended with small outposts and cordons to the Meuse on the left and the Channel coast on the right. Facing them the Armée du Nord was now under the command of Jean-Charles Pichegru, and had been greatly reinforced by conscripts {{as the result of the}} Levée en masse, giving the combined strength of the Armies of the North and Ardennes (excluding garrisons) as 200,000, nearly two to one of <b>Coburg's</b> force.|$|R
