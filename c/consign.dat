5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to <b>consign</b> the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

Unless the goods are <b>consigned</b> to a third party like the issuing bank, the importer can obtain the goods from the carrier at destination without paying the issuing bank or the consignor. Therefore, unless a cash payment has been received by the exporter or the buyer's integrity is unquestionable, <b>consigning</b> goods directly to the importer is risky.|$|R
25|$|McGuinness' former {{assistant}} Rory Gallagher took {{over for the}} 2015 campaign, and the year began brightly with Donegal reaching the National League semi-final, losing out to Cork. Starting in the premliminary round of the Ulster Championship, Donegal defeated Tyrone, Armagh and Derry {{to set up a}} third successive Ulster final with now bitter rivals Monaghan. After winning tough games against Tyrone and Derry, Donegal were seen as slight favourites going into the game. However, Monaghan prevailed by a single point to <b>consign</b> Donegal to the qualifiers. Galway awaited them there but Donegal won by a scoreline of 3-12 to 0-11 in an improved performance. Mayo were the opponents in the quarter-finals and Donegal went in as underdogs. So it proved as Mayo won by a comfortable seven-point margin to end Donegal's hopes for another year.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} was mixed. Todd Brown, writing for Twitch Film, characterized {{the film as}} [...] "long, slow, fairly pedestrian in its visual style, confusing for the newbies, [...] over-familiar for the existing fan". Anime News Network's Bamboo Dong praised its visuals but noted that the film could be confusing for viewers who are unfamiliar with the manga series and that Ginko [...] "looks more like a cosplayer". Tony Sullivan of Eye for Film said it is [...] "beautifully acted, shot and scored" [...] but cited the [...] "lack of oomph" [...] as a reason why [...] "the movie is rather dull". Mark Schilling from The Japan Times praised Odagiri but criticized the film for being [...] "a text too tangled and murky for the uninitiated to easily penetrate or parse". The cast performance was praised by Variety reviewer Derek Elley who declared its [...] "longueurs and narrative obscurities <b>consign</b> this 'Bug' to highly specialized outings". Sullivan, Schilling, and Elley criticized its soundtrack, especially the use of didgeridoos.|$|E
500|$|The {{bite force}} of a 2-m-long silky shark has been {{measured}} at [...] A well-established association exists between this species and tuna: off Ghana, almost every tuna school has silky sharks trailing behind, and in the eastern Pacific, these sharks inflict such damage to tuna fishing gear and catches that fishery workers have given them the moniker [...] "net-eating sharks". Silky sharks and bottlenose dolphins compete when both species target the same school of fish; the amount eaten by the dolphins decreases relative {{to the number of}} sharks present. If a large number of sharks is present, they tend to remain inside the prey school, while the dolphins <b>consign</b> themselves to the periphery, possibly to avoid incidental injury from the sharks' slashing attacks. Conversely, if a large enough group of dolphins gathers, they become able to chase the sharks away from the prey school. Regardless of which one dominates, the two predators do not engage in any overtly aggressive behavior against each other.|$|E
500|$|On 17 March 1912, the {{foundation}} {{stone of the}} orphanage was laid and blessed by Bishop Gallagher of Goulburn. However, the orphanage was not opened officially until December 1913, when the opening ceremony was held on a Sunday afternoon, and the building was opened and blessed by Bishop Gallagher. The ceremony attracted a large audience, {{many of whom were}} not members of the Catholic Church. By 3:30p.m., the Australian Light Horse Band began marching towards the orphanage from a cathedral on Verner Street. The priests and the bishop brought up the rear walking behind several Catholic acolytes. While many attendees remained at the orphanage, hundreds walked along with the procession. Children who had marched with the procession were divided and formed a guard of honour. The bishop, who was accompanied by Father Cahill, entered the building and preceded to bless it; a crucifix was subsequently placed in the main dormitory of the building. After the blessing, the bishop addressed the attending crowd from the front verandah, and discussed the use of the building. In addition, the Bishop {{went on to say that}} Pagan civilisations <b>consign</b> orphans to death or slavery: ...|$|E

500|$|Norwich {{started their}} match against Aston Villa {{with a goal}} after three minutes by Wes Hoolahan, who nearly joined them in the January {{transfer}} window. [...] Hoolahan's goal was a high point of the match after four goals were scored by the home side in sixteen minutes to <b>consign</b> Norwich to another away defeat. Norwich {{took the lead in}} the second half of their next match at home to Stoke City thanks to a goal from Bradley Johnson. [...] Jonathan Walters equalised for Stoke City but shortly afterwards was sent off for a foul on Alex Tettey. [...] Norwich failed to make use of the extra man and the game finished as a draw. The following week saw Norwich travel to Southampton where they conceded after five minutes. [...] By eighty minutes Norwich looked out of the game when the score had increased to 3–0 to the home side. [...] Two quick goals from Norwich raised hopes of an unlikely point but the result was put beyond doubt when Southampton scored in time added on to make the final score 4–2. The following game, at home to Sunderland, was another game that was billed as [...] "must win" [...] in the media. [...] Goals from Robert Snodgrass and Alex Tettey saw Norwich cruise past Sunderland in the end and lifted them to thirteenth in the table and seven points clear of the bottom three. The trip to Swansea saw Norwich concede three goals and meant that Norwich had lost six away games in a row.|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to <b>consign</b> others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

40|$|Bankruptcy {{law allows}} {{third-party}} creditors of a consignee to attach <b>consigned</b> {{property in the}} consignee 2 ̆ 7 s possession when the consignee declares bankruptcy unless a consignor has acted to perfect a security interest in the <b>consigned</b> goods by complying with commercial law requirements. The drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provided for attachment {{because they wanted to}} protect third-party creditors from the unwelcome surprise of hidden liens dominating claims to a consignee 2 ̆ 7 s property in bankruptcy. Applying this attachment policy overly broadly in the art consignment context creates problems, though, because opportunistic creditors can use the attachment procedure despite having full knowledge of the widespread practice of consignment in the art industry. In 2001, the drafters revised the UCC with the desire to clarify consignment issues as part of the revision. Courts continue to struggle, however, with analyzing issues of consignment in bankruptcy. This Note argues that because art consignment stands apart from other types of consignment, the law should not require art consignor-collectors to follow UCC filing requirements to protect their artwork from attachment by third-party creditors, who are acutely aware of the risk that a consignee art dealership is substantially dealing in <b>consigned</b> artwork. Further, it suggests that courts should presume that art dealerships are generally known to be substantially selling in <b>consigned</b> work. Once consignors show that an art dealership is generally known to be substantially selling in <b>consigned</b> work, courts should exempt <b>consigned</b> artwork from the bankruptcy estate. This Note also proposes extending the statutory protection afforded to consignor-artists to consignor-collectors...|$|R
