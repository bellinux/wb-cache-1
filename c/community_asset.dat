25|$|The San Elizario Salt War, {{also known}} as the Salinero Revolt or the El Paso Salt War, was an {{extended}} and complex political, social and military range war over ownership and control of immense salt lakes {{at the base of the}} Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas. What began in 1866 as a political and legal struggle among Anglo Texan politicians and capitalists gave rise to an armed struggle waged in 1877 by the ethnic Mexican inhabitants living in the communities on both sides of the Rio Grande near El Paso, Texas against a leading politician, supported by the Texas Rangers. The struggle climaxed with the siege and surrender of 20 Texas Rangers to a popular army of perhaps 500 men in the town of San Elizario, Texas. The arrival of the African-American 9th Cavalry and a sheriff's posse of New Mexico mercenaries caused hundreds of Tejanos to flee to Mexico, some in permanent exile. The right of individuals to own the salt lakes previously held as a <b>community</b> <b>asset</b> was established by force of arms.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare rural health care {{providers}} and consumers related to perceived <b>community</b> health <b>assets</b> and deficits. Background: Historically, studies of population health have focused primarily on deficits, identifying needs and problems of the health delivery system. Recent research has also focused on identifying <b>community</b> health <b>assets,</b> including resources for joint problem solving and health promotion. Limited research, particularly from the assets perspective, has addressed rural areas and few studies have compared provider verses consumer perceptions of <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and deficits. Method: A descriptive comparative design was used. A convenience sample of 123 residents, including 17 providers and 106 consumers, in three rural Idaho communities were interviewed regarding <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and deficits related to health. Responses were classified using the Typology of <b>Community</b> <b>Assets</b> for Health Promotion (Stokols, Grzywacz, McMahan, 2 ̆ 6 Phillips, 2003) which includes material resources (economic, natural, human-made environmental, and technological capital) and human resources (social, moral, and human capital). Frequency of responses by category were compared between consumers and providers. Results: In relation to <b>community</b> <b>assets,</b> the most frequent response category among providers was human capital (33. 3...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyThe goal of {{this study}} was to explore the <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and {{strengths}} identified by African American youth that can contribute to positive youth development, taking into consideration the lived experiences and meanings for youth and their cultural characteristics. This study used a semi-participatory approach and a mixed methods design that included survey, focus groups and photovoice. The data obtained through each method was analyzed separately and collectively, in order to contrast and compare the different data sets. The findings suggest that some individual and <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and strengths identified by African American youth were similar to other assets and strengths that other models of positive youth development and African American youth development have identified. The findings also suggest the dynamic function of some assets. The discussion focused on that dynamic function that some <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> have in moderating and/or mediating the presence and effect of other individual and <b>community</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R
500|$|Valve {{adopted the}} word [...] "Dota", {{derived from the}} {{original}} mod's acronym, as the name for its newly acquired franchise. Johnson argued that the word referred to a concept, and was not an acronym. Shortly after the announcement of Dota 2, Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already-identifiable brand. Holding the Dota name to be a <b>community</b> <b>asset,</b> Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for [...] "DOTA" [...] on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010. Rob Pardo, the {{executive vice president of}} Blizzard Entertainment at the time, similarly stated that the DotA name belonged to the mod's community. Blizzard acquired DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper claims to the franchise. The dispute was settled in May 2012, with Valve retaining commercial franchising rights to the [...] "Dota" [...] intellectual property, while allowing non-commercial use of the name by third-parties. In 2017, Valve's ownership of it was again challenged, after a 2004 internet forum post from Eul was brought to light by a studio known as uCool, which stated that the [...] "Dota" [...] brand was an open source project. uCool, who was previously involved in a lawsuit with Blizzard in 2015 due to a mobile game they released that involved the use of characters and lore from the Dota universe, argued that the forum post invalidated any ownership claims of the intellectual property. Judge Charles R. Breyer denied uCool's motion for summary dismissal, but allowed the case to be moved forward to a jury.|$|E

40|$|The {{transfer}} of ownership of <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> from local authority to community control has increased in recent years. Such transfers raise key questions {{in relation to the}} impact on local communities and how such transitions can be best managed. This research was commissioned by Tewkesbury Borough Council to better understand <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and their management in light of transfers of ownership from local authority to community control. In particular, it focuses on two key case studies of transferred assets in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire: Brockworth Community Centre, and GL 3 Community hub in Churchdown. The first part of the project maps the local physical <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> for each parish using GIS mapping technology. These data are now part of a spatial database or GIS allowing interactive exploration of the locations of the assets and the production of a range of maps. This database is available for transfer to Tewkesbury Borough Council and to the local communities. The second part of the project analyses a range of interviews conducted with key-stakeholders from the two transferred assets. This produces seven key findings that are important considerations in the process of asset transfer and their ongoing management: Key finding 1 : <b>Community</b> <b>assets</b> are broadly defined by community stakeholders as buildings, open spaces or amenities that can be accessed and are valued by the whole community. Key finding 2 : The pace of asset transfer can be challenging for community groups, particularly around Legal issues. Key finding 3 : Communities require enough individuals with the capacity, capability and leadership to make the management of <b>assets</b> in the <b>community</b> effective. Key finding 4 : Insecure and short term funding threatens the success of <b>community</b> <b>assets</b> and the search for funding often uses up limited resources. Key finding 5 : Asset transfers are likely to raise important questions about what agencies should be responsible for maintaining <b>community</b> <b>assets,</b> and these debates may be a source of resistance. Key finding 6 : Assets transferred to the community provide the potential for more responsive use of local assets. Key finding 7 : Transferring <b>assets</b> to <b>communities</b> can increase their use and the sense of local ownership...|$|R
