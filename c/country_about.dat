25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the state since the Mexican Revolution has led to steady {{population}} growth. However, this population growth has been concentrated on the arid coastline due to the dominant agriculture and fishing industries.

Another area where there have been gains are municipalities with industry, such as in Hermosillo and along the United States border. However, those municipalities with none of these economic advantages do not see population growth and some see population decreases. Despite population growth, Sonora {{is still one of}} the least densely populated states in the <b>country.</b> <b>About</b> 90% of the state’s population is Catholic, with about 5% belonging to Evangelical or Protestant groups and over 7% professing some other faith.|$|E
25|$|Since Lê Văn Hưu highly treasured the {{independence}} of Vietnam, he often had negative comments on historical figures who was considered by Lê Văn Hưu being more or less responsible {{for the loss of}} the country's autonomy to its northern neighbour such as the chancellor Lữ Gia of Nam Việt or Lý Nam Đế. While the contemporary opinion praised Lý Nam Đế as a national hero of Vietnam for his revolt against the Liang dynasty, Lê Văn Hưu criticized Lý Nam Đế's ability because he was ultimately defeated and hence Vietnam lost its independence one more time. However, Lê Văn Hưu saved his best praise for the Trưng Sisters who led the resistance movement against the Han dynasty and were finally put down by the army of Ma Yuan in 42. In Lê Văn Hưu's words, the men of Vietnam had to feel ashamed of their surrender to the northerners while the Trưng Sisters, who were women, fiercely fought for the <b>country.</b> <b>About</b> Chinese rulers of Vietnam, Lê Văn Hưu gave favorable remarks for ones who contributed to the stability of the country, the historian respectfully called the prefect Sĩ Nhiếp as Sĩ Vương (King Sĩ) who kept the autonomous status of Vietnam from the direct administration of the Eastern Wu for a long period.|$|E
