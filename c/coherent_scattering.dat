5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product.

This structural coloration {{is the result of}} <b>coherent</b> <b>scattering</b> of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see.

For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E

Because Bragg angles in the diffraction of high energy electrons are very small (~ degrees for 300 keV), Kikuchi bands are quite narrow in reciprocal space. This also means that in real space images, lattice planes edge-on are decorated not by diffuse scattering features but by contrast associated with <b>coherent</b> <b>scattering.</b> These <b>coherent</b> <b>scattering</b> features include added diffraction (responsible for bend contours in curved foils), more electron penetration (which gives rise to electron channeling patterns in scanning electron images of crystal surfaces), and lattice fringe contrast (which results in a dependence of lattice fringe intensity on beam orientation which is linked to specimen thickness).

40|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars are {{extensively}} {{employed in}} the study of important geophysical processes in the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere. The science relies on the ability of <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars to detect plasma irregularities in the Earth's ionosphere and relate their properties to the geophysical process under consideration. This thesis is concerned with the physical characteristics of the plasma irregularities deduced from <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar observations. Data from three <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar systems, PACE, SABRE and COSCAT, each sensitive to a different irregularity wavelength, are analysed. Statistics for the backscatter power, phase speed and spectral width at each wavelength are calculated and compared. Furthermore, the functional dependence of the irregularity parameters on each other has been investigated. Strong relationships between the spectral width and irregularity phase speed and the spectral width and backscatter power are identified. The spectral widths tend to exhibit a minimum at phase speeds close to the ion-acoustic speed. There is a decrease in the average backscatter power as the spectral width increases. A new measurement of the dependence of the spectral width on the irregularity wave number is deduced. These results have important significance for the general interpretation of <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurements. Special experimental campaigns with SABRE and COSCAT in conjunction with EISCAT have been undertaken to enable the irregularity phase speed and the plasma drift speed to be compared. This is a very important relationship since the plasma drift speed is routinely estimated from the irregularity phase speed. The analysis confirms the non-linear behaviour of the relationship between these two parameters. Similar results are obtained for COSCAT and SABRE. Differences {{can be attributed to the}} expected variations with wave number and to variations in the height of the observed irregularities, consistent with the kinetic theory of Robinson and Honary (1990) ...|$|R

40|$|Classical radar theory only {{considers}} incoherent backscatter from precipitation. Can precipitation generate <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> as well? Until now, {{the accepted}} answer has been no, because hydrometeors are distributed sparsely in space (relative to radar wavelength) {{so that the}} continuum assumption used to explain <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> in clear air and clouds does not hold. In this work, a theory for a different mechanism is presented. The apparent existence of the proposed mechanism is then illustrated in both rain and snow. A new power spectrum Z (f), the Fourier transform of the time series of the radar backscattered reflectivities, reveals statistically significant frequencies f of periodic components that cannot be ascribed to incoherent scatter. It is shown that removing those significant fs fromZ (f) at lower frequencies greatly reduces the temporal coherency. These lower frequencies, then, {{are associated with the}} increased temporal coherency. It is also shown that these fs are also directly linked to the Doppler spectral peaks through integer multiples of one-half the radar wavelength, characteristic of Bragg scatter. Thus, the enhanced temporal coherency {{is directly related to the}} presence of <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> in agreement with theory. Moreover, the normalized backscattered power spectrum Z (f) permits the estimation of the fractional coherent power contribution to the total power, even for an incoherent radar. Analyses of approximately 26 000 one-secondZ (f) in both rain and snow reveal that the <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> is pervasive in these data. These findings present a challenge to the usual assumption that the scatter of radar waves from precipitation is always incoherent and to interpretations of backscattered power based on this assumption. 1...|$|R

40|$|Ionospheric {{irregularities}} are small-scale {{structures in}} plasma density {{aligned with the}} magnetic field that are formed by plasma instability processes and occur frequently in the auroral region of the ionosphere. <b>Coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar echoes from these irregularities convey information about the fine-scale structure of the auroral ionosphere during periods of geomagnetic activity. This subject has been studied extensively, however, {{the relationship between the}} <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> spectral measurements and the ionospheric state parameters is not fully understood. Models of plasma waves, instability mechanisms, irregularities, and coherent echoes are required to further develop this understanding. This thesis presents three studies of the auroral E region ionosphere that use radar measurements and computational models to understand the significance of radar backscatter from field aligned irregularities observed by a 30 MHz <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar in Homer, Alaska. The first study models the Farley Buneman instability by combining the global, 2 -D ionospheric model, SAMI 2, with a local, heuristic model developed by Milikh and Dimant [2002]. The model estimates profiles of wave phase speed, magnetic aspect width, wave heating rates, and ionospheric state variables. This model shows promising agreement with incoherent scatter radar measurements from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurements from the Homer radar. The second study uses an empirical model to invert measured <b>coherent</b> <b>scatter</b> spectra into estimates of convection velocity and then fits for the overall convection pattern. This model is informed by the simulations of Oppenheim et al. [2008]; Oppenheim and Dimant [2013] and formulas calculated by Nielsen and Schlegel [1985]. Comprehensive agreement between the convection velocity estimates and the convection pattern indicates an incompressible flow and validates the inversion. The third study examines E region ionospheric modification experiments that cause plasma instabilities and artificial irregularities. The study analyzes the threshold power needed to generate artificial irregularities due to the thermal parametric instability. SAMI 2 was modified to simulate the propagation of the HF pump waves and their heating effects. The model revealed that active suppression of the artificial irregularities occurs entirely due to D region absorption.

50|$|Detection in the {{microwave}} region has numerous advantages over optical detection. Using homodyne or heterodyne technology, the electric field rather than the power can be detected, so much better noise rejection can be achieved. In contrast to optical heterodyne techniques, no alignment or mode matching of the reference is necessary. The long wavelength of {{the microwave}}s leads to effective point <b>coherent</b> <b>scattering</b> from the plasma in the laser focal volume, so phase matching is unimportant and scattering in the backward direction is strong. Many microwave photons can be scattered from a single electron, so the amplitude of the scattering can be increased by increasing {{the power of the}} microwave transmitter. The low energy of the microwave photons corresponds to thousands of more photons per unit energy than in the visible region, so shot noise is drastically reduced.
