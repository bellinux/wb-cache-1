40|$|STS- 107 Commander Rick Husband is seen {{during this}} {{preflight}} interview, where {{he gives a}} quick overview of the mission before answering questions about his inspiration to become an astronaut and his career path. Husband outlines what his role in the mission will be, what training the crew received, what <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> <b>responsibilities</b> will be, particularly during launch and reentry, what day to day life will be like on an extended duration mission, and what science experiments are going to be conducted onboard. He discusses the following science experiments and instruments in detail: MEIDEX (Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment), SOLSE (Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment, FREESTAR (Fast Reaction Enabling Science Technology and Research) and various student projects. Husband also touches on the importance of space research, the value of international cooperation, the reason for dual crew shifts on the mission and the role of <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> as research subjects...|$|R
50|$|The {{jet nozzles}} were {{originally}} designed to swivel downwards for shorter takeoffs and landings. This feature was included on prototype aircraft, but {{was removed from the}} design during flight testing. The cockpit used an unusual double pane windscreen and side-by-side seating arrangement in which the pilot sat in the left seat, while the bombardier/navigator sat to the right and slightly below. The incorporation of a 2nd <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> with separate <b>responsibilities,</b> along with a unique cathode ray tube (CRT) display that provided a synthetic display of terrain ahead, enabled low-level attack in all weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|As of Tuesday 1 December 2009, {{remains of}} nine <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> had been {{retrieved}} and arrived in Sana'a.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of more {{powerful}} airline computers and <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> with mobile devices, the conventional PBS process can be made interactive, affording the possibility that more <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> get a schedule that fulfills their wishes. In this scheme, bidding is a continuous process lasting several days or weeks, where <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> can see the status of other <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> bids reflected as they bid. A <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> can change preferences {{in the midst of}} the process after seeing how others are bidding.|$|R

5000|$|In the bid lines approach, pairings {{are placed}} within {{pre-built}} lines by line optimizer, {{a computer program}} that puts the pairings into [...] "legal" [...] lines, and {{does not take into}} account the individual crew members' preferences, nor the constraints imposed by <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> The generic set of lines are then published for bidding. A <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> is free to choose any line and it will be awarded as long as no other senior <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> who also wants this same line. Unless the most senior in the bid package, <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> needs to submit multiple preferred lines in order to guarantee a preferred line; otherwise, a leftover line will be awarded. By the bidding process, the preferred line may not be awarded completely, because the line was created without reference to specific <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> constraints, it may conflict with crew members' predetermined activities. The conflicting pairings must then be reassigned to other <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> resulting in a wide range of inefficiencies. Clearly this post-award reallocation is costly to the airlines. These inefficiencies also force airlines to hire more <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> However, bid line does offer a transparent and easy process to bid and to award, and in many cases the conflict itself actually benefits the <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> that being paid without the work according to the contracts. Though management is eager to streamline operations, <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> may still prefer the bid lines.|$|R

50|$|Preferential bidding system, or PBS, is a {{computer}} program for crew scheduling, a method of solving airlines workforce schedules consisting of specific flights and certain qualified <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> while allowing those <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> to request periodic work schedules using weighted preferences. The solution must be as efficient as possible while respecting <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> preferences, honoring seniority, conforming regulations, and operation coverage requirements.|$|R

50|$|The Gemini Method usually {{consisted}} of the victim entering the apartment {{in back of the}} Lounge, dubbed 'The Clubhouse' by <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> At this point, a <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> (almost always Roy DeMeo according to <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> turned government witness Frederick DiNome) would approach him with a silenced pistol and shoot them in the head, then wrapping a towel around the victim's head wound like a turban in order to prevent blood from pouring out of the wound. Immediately after, another <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> would stab the victim in the heart in order to prevent any more blood from pumping out of the gunshot wound.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{practical}} aspects of remaining in space longer will be the requirement to maintain <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> health and performance. During STS-50, <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> conducted biological tests {{as part of the}} EDO Medical Project. <b>Crew</b> <b>members</b> monitored their blood pressure and heart rate and took samples of the cabin atmosphere during the flight. They also evaluated the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) device as a countermeasure to the normal reduction of body fluids that takes place in space. If the beneficial effects of the LBNP could last for 24 hours, it would improve <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> performance on reentry and landing.|$|R
50|$|Weaknesses to the Mk F3 design {{included}} {{a lack of}} nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew. It also could accommodate {{only two of the}} eight <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> needed to operate the weapons system. The remaining six <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> and 25 rounds of ammunition travel in support vehicles, normally AMX-VCIs. If necessary, the additional <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> can travel on the upper deck of the vehicle, but those <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> must remain outside the vehicle and thus exposed to fragmentationen effects and small arms fire.The onboard ammunitions storage was much smaller than in self-propelled guns following the M109 pattern.|$|R
5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} watch system, two, or even three people {{may end up}} sharing the same bunk. The term comes from the {{military}} slang {{use of the term}} [...] "rack" [...] for a bed or bunk. With more than one <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> assigned to a rack, it is possible that a <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> returning from a duty shift will lie down on a rack immediately after it is vacated by another <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> about to start a shift. The rack is therefore said to be [...] "hot", that is, still warm from the vacating <b>crew</b> <b>member's</b> body heat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{requesting}} a certain schedule is called [...] "bidding". Generally {{this is done}} on a monthly basis. The monthly schedule called [...] "line" [...] which a <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> gets will consist {{of a series of}} [...] "pairings". Each month the airlines crew planning sets the new pairings due to new locations being added or removed, new times, or changes in aircraft. These new pairings are then made available for assignment or bidding. In the United States, <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> are often working under a union's collective bargaining agreement, and sometimes including non-union workplaces, seniority is used to give senior <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> the right to override junior <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> requests. A line itself must also satisfy legal and contractual constraints. Ideally it should also satisfy the <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> choices and preferences.|$|R
