40|$|This paper explores {{proximity}} to mother for 1984 - 1996 among adult children (age 23 - 35 in 1984). Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics, preliminary {{findings in this}} paper suggest that lower economic status is associated with <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> between adult children and their mothers. Non-white, lower education, fewer siblings, and mother’s residence in non-rural area are significantly associated with <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> to mother. And, controlling after time-invariant factors, adult children’s higher education, marriage and working are significantly associated with further spatial location from mother while mother’s health problem relates <b>closer</b> <b>proximity.</b> To understand the full mechanism of how adult children’s {{proximity to}} parents is determined and how such proximity facilitates informal transfers, it might be necessary to incorporate further information on individual geographic mobility. ...|$|R

5|$|If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, the {{electron}} lone pairs on the carbenic carbon {{would be forced}} into <b>close</b> <b>proximity.</b> Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a significant}} destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{often ask}} {{if they need to}} have special safety {{precautions}} around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy.

5|$|Because of its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> to {{the higher}} Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike {{receives}} fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes {{on their way to}} Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> to the United States {{resulted}} in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though a frontal zone aided in bringing precipitation {{as far north}} as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E
5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox.
