5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E

The FCC reported that an inmate call from GTL could cost as much as US$17.30 for a 15 minute call, The company claimed that these high costs were required in order to securely monitor these calls.|$|E
25|$|Before the Water Framework Law was adopted, {{there was}} no {{regulatory}} framework {{that could have been}} applied in decentralizing processes such as the developments in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortés. Thus, local regulatory agencies were created for the <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> to secure a sustained process. For instance, in Puerto Cortés a regulatory agency was created at the municipal level including selected representatives of civil society, such as doctors, engineers and lawyers.|$|E

25|$|The <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> {{included}} contractual {{targets to}} increase the volume of water sold. Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still {{not as much as}} foreseen in the contracts. In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Spain is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality, while tariffs {{are among the}} lowest in the EU. Almost half of the population is served by private or mixed private-public water companies, which operate under <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> with municipalities. The largest of the private water companies, with a market share of about 50% of the private concessions, is Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar). However, the large cities are all served by public companies except Barcelona and Valencia. The largest public company is Canal de Isabel II, which serves the metropolitan area of Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Water losses {{have been}} reduced, but much slower than {{foreseen}} in the <b>concession</b> <b>contracts.</b> In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. According to Palyja, in its western {{half of the}} concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. Water losses include illegal connections, {{some of which are}} used by the poor to serve their basic needs.|$|E

25|$|The <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> fixed a 22 {{percent annual}} rate of return for the private operators. The net profit of Palyja varied between Rupiahs 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. Palyja’s {{financial}} statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rupiahs 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rupiahs 142 billion (USD 16 million). However, these profits {{are based on the}} assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies.|$|E
25|$|Large {{public service}} rate increases, added to weak {{regulatory}} frameworks and constant renegotiation of <b>concession</b> <b>contracts,</b> brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% {{of which were}} earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose {{in line with the}} U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of earnings for the newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies to pocket US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or to make all the investments stipulated by the contracts. The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced by associated firms, contracting heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{for water}} supply and {{sewerage}} service provision in Latin American countries is vested either in municipalities, or in regional or national companies. Municipalities are in charge of water and sanitation service provision in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. In some countries, such as in Colombia and Mexico, municipalities took over this responsibility from national service providers during the decentralization of the 1980s. Subsequently, especially the larger municipalities have often created specialized municipal (and sometimes inter-municipal) public utilities, whose finances are kept separate from the city's finances. While in most cases the companies are public, in a few notable cases they are mixed or private companies operating under concession, lease or management contracts. Chile and Venezuela are examples of countries that have created regional water companies; however, in the case of Venezuela, the United Nations reports that Venezuela remains one of the poorest in water service provision in this region. State-level regional water companies also exist in all 26 states of Brazil, where they provide services on behalf of some (but not all) municipalities in each state. National public water and sewer companies, which have for the most part been created in the 1960s and 1970s, still exist in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay. About 90% of urban water and sanitation services in Latin America are provided by public entities. Many private <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> signed during the 1990s in Latin America have been either renegotiated or cancelled. The most notable cancellations include the concession for Aguas Argentinas in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the concessions for Cochabamba and La Paz, Bolivia. Private and mixed companies, however, continue to provide services in many cities of Colombia, in most of Chile, some Brazilian cities, and in Guayaquil, Ecuador.|$|E

This article provides models of <b>concession</b> <b>contract</b> auctions with and without the right of first refusal. The optimal bidding strategies and expected level of service are found.

2500|$|Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide {{piped water}} supply in the western and eastern half of Jakarta {{respectively}} under 25-year <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. 80% of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River [...] southeast of the city. Water supply had been privatised by government of then President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both foreign companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the 7 {{first years of the}} concessions had been lower than before, despite substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005 tariffs were frozen, leading the private water companies to cut down on investments.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>concession</b> <b>contracts</b> {{included}} specific {{targets for}} service coverage, water production, water sales and non-revenue water. The contracts also foresaw {{that by the}} 2008, the tenth contract year, drinking water quality standards had to be met and that water supply had to be continuous at a pressure of 7.5 meters water column. Until 2004 both private operators succeeded to increase {{the share of the}} population with access to water and reduced water losses in line with the renegotiated contractual targets. After 2004 they further increased access and reduced water losses, but did not reach the targets any more. Overall, from 1998 to 2008 access to water increased from 46 to 64 [...] percent (revised target: 68 [...] percent) and water losses were reduced from 61 [...] percent to 50 [...] percent (revised target: 42 [...] percent). After targets were reduced to more realistic levels in 2008, the operators were able to reach most of their new targets.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1997 the two 25-year water {{concessions}} were awarded, becoming {{effective in}} February 1998. The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), {{was awarded the}} concession for {{the western part of}} the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called [...] Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of non-revenue water to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone. This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million. In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the <b>concession</b> <b>contracts.</b> British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years.|$|E

50|$|Water {{privatization}} in Brazil {{has been}} relatively limited compared to other infrastructure sectors (power, transport, telecommunications).

As under all <b>concession</b> <b>contracts,</b> the infrastructure itself remains public, but is being operated by the private sector. Likewise, water resources themselves remain publicly owned.
