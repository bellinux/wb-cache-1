40|$|Seat-level {{positioning}} of a smartphone {{in a vehicle}} can provide a fine-grained context for many interesting in-vehicle applications, including driver distraction prevention, driving behavior estimation, in-vehicle services customization, etc. However, most of the existing work on in-vehicle positioning relies on special infrastructures, such as the stereo, <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> <b>adapter</b> or OBD (on-board diagnostic) adapter. In this work, we propose iLoc, an infrastructure-free, in-vehicle, cooperative positioning system via smartphones. iLoc does not require any extra devices and uses only embedded sensors in smartphones to determine the phones' seat-level locations in a car. In iLoc, in-vehicle smartphones automatically collect data during certain kinds of events and cooperatively determine the relative left/right and front/back locations. In addition, iLoc is tolerant to noisy data and possible sensor errors. We evaluate the performance of iLoc using experiments conducted in real driving scenarios. Results show that the positioning accuracy can reach 90 % {{in the majority of}} cases and around 70 % even in the worst-cases. Department of Computin...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this study}} is in general described, an {{electrically}} operated car jack. A scissor type, automatically operated by switch buttons consists of a base, a load engaging head, gearing system and stabilizer base. The prototype includes motor powered from the <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> <b>adapter.</b> The motor with gearing system will be the lifting mechanism. When the car needed to be lifted, just press the button and release the button at a desired height level. The common problem faced by the current available car jacks in the market is it is manually operated and needed physical effort to lift the vehicle. All the analysis and results such as the torque needed and gearing ratio is important in this project before needed to be developed. The developed automatic car jacker is base on the result and analysis part to lift a kancil car (682 kg). The stress and Von Mises stress are additional analysis on the gearing parts to know how much stress applied on the system to avoid failure. The developed automatic car jacker is a success which it able to lift a kancil’s car according to the set scopes...|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (<b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The engine cranking motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> outlet. Many vehicles turn off the <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> outlet to the battery.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> {{receptacle}} (also {{called a}} cigar lighter receptacle or cigar lighter socket) {{in an automobile}} was initially designed to power an electrically heated <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter,</b> but became a de facto standard DC connector to supply electrical power for portable accessories used in or near an automobile. While the <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> receptacle is a common feature of automobiles and trucks, as a DC power connector it has the disadvantages of bulkiness, relatively low current rating, and poor contact reliability.|$|R

Usually, only one 12 V receptacle near the driver will be able to accommodate an actual <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter,</b> with other receptacles designated as [...] "12 V auxiliary power outlets" [...] which are not physically able to power a lighter.|$|R

50|$|The use of <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> {{receptacles}} {{to supply}} 12 volt DC {{power is a}} classic example of backward compatibility to a de facto standard. The connector falls far short of ideal, being physically large and awkward to use, while being less reliable than alternatives such as the Anderson Powerpole connector (which is often used by amateur radio enthusiasts in mobile operations). Nevertheless, <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> receptacles are in widespread use, and all but the lowest-cost cars, trucks, RVs, and even boats can be expected to have at least one such receptacle. Portable <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> receptacles attached to cables and alligator clips for connection directly to car batteries are available for temporary use. In newer vehicles, one or more USB connectors may also be provided, as a source of modest amounts of 5 volt DC power, but even in these situations a <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> receptacle is provided for 12 volt DC power, and for applications that require higher amperage.|$|R

5000|$|Since the <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter</b> socket was {{originally}} designed only to heat a <b>cigarette</b> <b>lighter,</b> repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors {{can lead to}} many problems.

Also, {{there have been reports}} of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance. [...] Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.|$|R
