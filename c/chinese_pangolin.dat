40|$|Abstract <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pangolins</b> {{are least}} studied {{burrowing}} mammals. There is great role {{of this species}} in nature to maintain ecological balance. Due to illegal trade and habitat destruction, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pangolins</b> are in great risk of extinction although being protected by national as well as international laws. This research was carried out {{to find out the}} distribution, habitat utilization, social belief and conservation status of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pangolins</b> in Nangkholyang VDC of Taplejung district, Eastern Nepal. This study was done with direct field observation followed by direct observation along the tracks and random search, group discussion, key informant survey and questionnaire survey. This study showed the presence of indirect signs of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pangolins</b> such as 211 burrows (including 16 new and 195 old), scats, foot prints and trace of tail in Nangkholyang VDC, Taplejung. The distribution of Pangolins was found in all wards (political unit of village) with highest number of burrows in southwest aspect and least in north. The burrows were found in the elevation from 1126 m to 2406 m. The habitat utilized by <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pangolins</b> was found to be forest and agricultural land. In the forest, the maximum numbers of burrows were located at the crown cover of 0 - 25 %. Pangolins were taken as the sign of bad luck but due to profit motive people were hunting this mammal. The Conservation status of Pangolins in the study area was found to be worse. Hunting for illegal trad...|$|R

Their hard scales work as a {{protective}} cover from predators, and when they feel threatened, they curl themselves into balls. For further defense, they can climb trees, although this is uncommon.|$|R

25|$|Tai Lam Country Park sits in {{the western}} New Territories with an area of 54km². Tai Lam has a small area of {{porphyry}} in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly erodible decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the water catchment area. In spite of the poor soil conditions and the setbacks of fire damage over the years, mature stands of Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii and Eucalyptus species now cover most of the area. In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, <b>pangolins,</b> <b>Chinese</b> leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.|$|R
