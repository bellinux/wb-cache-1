It analyzes the legal nature of frivolous claims compared with de minimis claims, outlining the negative and destructive impact on international economic relations of the former. The author analyzes various approaches to handling frivolous claims in some international jurisdictions, including the ICJ as a well-known international dispute settlement body. Special attention is given to ICSID practice, which has many examples of dismissing frivolous claims.

30|$|With {{regard to}} local participation, Pahl-Wostl [51] {{suggests}} that citizen participation {{is essential in}} order to reach higher level of learning and eventually lead to a change of paradigm. Participation is broadly defined as the “involvement in decision-making with the purpose of influencing the choice(s) being made” [52]. Arnstein (1969, as cited by Booth and Richardson [25]) defines seven levels of participation, with different levels of participation referring to different levels of knowledge and power attributed to the different stakeholders. Ridder and Pahl-Wostl [53] distinguish three levels of participation in local planning: information, consultation and involvement. In the lower level of participation (information), planners simply supply information to citizens and stakeholders. At the <b>consultation</b> <b>level,</b> the planners gather information from the citizens and stakeholders. Both at the information and consultation levels, exchange and dialogue are limited, and the decision-making process stays within the hands of the planners. The third level of participation is the involvement of the stakeholders and citizens, which directly engage the public in decision-making. As shown in Fig. 1, the involvement, understood here as a reinforcing loop between the planners and citizens, is central to the learning process. Citizen involvement contributes to progressing through each of the learning loops.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the weak}} {{implementation}} of the change of pharmaceutical profession focus from the product to the patient, a new concept of services, based on pharmaceutical consultations should be developed and implemented. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce a new organizational model for pharmaceutical care services provision in the community pharmacy to answer differentiated patient’s health needs. According to the model, pharmacist activities are structured in three interconnected levels, depending on patient´s health needs and expectations. Level 1 is the basic level of services provided by all the pharmacy professionals and addressed to customers asking for a comfort product or a medicinal product in the absence of non-controlled health problem. Level 2 is the pharmaceutical generalist service provided by a resident pharmacist and addressed to patients with common non-controlled health problems or asking for a specific and personalized counseling. It could be provided over-the-counter or in the office, configured as pharmaceutical <b>consultation.</b> <b>Level</b> 3 is the pharmaceutical specialized service, the Pharmacotherapeutic Follow-up consultation, provided by a specialized pharmacist, external to the pharmacy and is addressed to patients with recurrent non-controlled health problems or complex situations. The provision of pharmaceutical care services through differentiated pharmacist intervention levels, based on the pharmacy customer´s health needs, seem to be a suitable model for its routine implementation in the community pharmacy. Most of the previously identified barriers for real implementation of clinical services in the pharmacy can be pulled down by the new strategy here proposed...|$|E

40|$|Background: There is an {{increasing}} recognition that many consultations in general practice involve several problems covering multiple disease domains. However there is a paucity of reliable tools and techniques to understand and quantify this phenomenon. The objective {{was to develop a}} tool {{that can be used to}} measure the number and type of problems discussed in primary care consultations. Methods: Thirteen consultations between general practitioners and patients were initially videoed and reviewed to identify the problems and issues discussed. An iterative process involving a panel of clinicians and researchers and repeated cycles of testing and development was used to develop a measurement proforma and coding manual for assessment of video recorded consultations. The inter-rater reliability of this tool was assessed in 60 consultations. Results: The problems requiring action were usually readily identified. However the different dimensions of the problem and how they were addressed required the identification and definition of ‘issues’. A coding proforma was developed that allowed quantification of the numbers and types of health problems and issues discussed. Ten categories of issues were identified and defined. At the <b>consultation</b> <b>level,</b> inter-rater agreements for the number of problems discussed (within ± 1), types of problems and issues were 98. 3 %, 96. 5 % and 90 % respectively. The tool has subsequently been used to analyse 229 consultations. Conclusion: The iterative approach to development of the tool reflected the complexity of doctor-patient interactions. A reliable tool has been developed that can be used to analyse the number and range of problems managed in primary care consultations...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: In {{the past}} 50 years, {{individual}} patient involvement at the clinical <b>consultation</b> <b>level</b> has received considerable attention. More recently, patients {{and the public}} have increasingly been involved in collective decisions concerning the improvement {{of health care and}} policymaking. However, rigorous evaluation guiding {{the development and implementation of}} effective public involvement interventions is lacking. This article describes those key ingredients likely to affect public members' ability to deliberate productively with professionals and influence collective health care choices. METHOD: We conducted a trial process evaluation of public involvement in setting priorities for health care improvement. In all, 172 participants (including 83 patients and public members and 89 professionals) from 6 Health and Social Services Centers in Canada participated in the trial. We videorecorded 14 one-day meetings, and 2 nonparticipant observers took structured notes. Using qualitative analysis, we show how public members influenced health care improvement priorities. FINDINGS: Legitimacy, credibility, and power explain the variations in the public members' influence. Their credibility was supported by their personal experience as patients and caregivers, the provision of a structured preparation meeting, and access to population-based data from their community. Legitimacy was fostered by the recruitment of a balanced group of participants and by the public members' opportunities to draw from one another's experience. The combination of small-group deliberations, wider public consultation, and a moderation style focused on effective group process helped level out the power differences between professionals and the public. The engagement of key stakeholders in the intervention design and implementation helped build policy support for public involvement. CONCLUSIONS: A number of interacting active ingredients structure and foster the public's legitimacy, credibility, and power. By paying greater attention to them, policymakers could develop and implement more effective public involvement interventions...|$|E

To what extent is less studied. Routinely collected healthcare registers is a potential resource for epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal disorders. Skåne region, as opposed to nationally in Sweden, has healthcare registers, covering all care including primary care. he overall aim of this thesis was to incorporate healthcare registers in the epidemiological research of consultation prevalence, healthcare consultation and sick leave patterns in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. he thesis comprises four studies in which the Skåne Healthcare Register was linked with national registers on sick leave, prescribed drugs, and socioeconomic status. Additionally, the thesis include a comparative study between data from the Skåne Healthcare Register with that of an United Kingdom (UK) consultation database. he main variables under study are in Paper I–III disease, consultations, and sick leave and in Paper IV education, income, and work status. he consultation prevalence of low back pain was estimated to 3 – 4 % in the Skåne region while the figure was larger in the UK.

The quality of the process was largely influenced by the goals defined by the local planners. According to the local planners, the main objectives of the participatory process were the identification of transportation issues based on the experience of local citizens and the public acceptance of the LTP.

To {{study the}} {{associations}} between active choice {{of primary care}} provider and healthcare utilization, multimorbidity, age, and sex, comparing data from primary care and all healthcare in a Swedish population. Design. Descriptive cross-sectional study using descriptive analyses including t-test, correlations, and logistic regression modelling in four separate models. Setting and subjects. The population (151 731) and all healthcare in Blekinge in 2007. Main outcome measure. Actively or passively listed in primary care, registered on 31 December 2007. Results. Number of consultations (OR 1. 31, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 1. 32), multimorbidity level (OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 67 - 1. 70), age (OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 03), and sex (OR for men 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 68) were all associated with registered active listing in primary care. Active listing was more strongly associated with number of <b>consultations</b> and multimorbidity <b>level</b> using primary care data (OR 2. 11, 95 % CI 2. 08 - 2. 15 and OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 2. 11 - 2. 17, respectively) than using data from all healthcare.

The consultation type and reason for the visit were the most important in explaining the variation in assessment practices, however these factors along with patient and provider variables accounted for less than 20 % of the variance. In contrast, multi-level models showed that provider factors were most important in explaining the variance in intervention practices, in particular, the location of the team in which providers worked (urban or rural) and provider perceptions of their effectiveness and accessibility of support services. After controlling for provider variables, patients' socio-economic status, the reason for the visit and providers' perceptions of the 'appropriateness' of addressing risk factors in the consultation were all significantly associated with providing optimal intervention. Together, measured patient consultation and provider variables accounted for most (80 %) of the variation in intervention practices between providers. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of provider factors such as beliefs and attitudes, team location and work context in understanding variations in the provision of lifestyle intervention in PHC. Further studies of this type are required to identify variables that improve the proportion of variance explained in assessment practices. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Pennsylvania/MidAtlantic AIDS Education and Training Center (PA/MA AETC) {{is among}} the largest {{professional}} training providers for HIV treatment education in the world. The program seeks to improve HIV-related and primary care for underserved populations by strengthening the capacity of clinician and other providers to understand and treat these populations. Training is organized into three basic levels: didactic(Level I), skills building(Level II), clinical hands on training(Level III), a recipient-driven clinical <b>consultation</b> (<b>Level</b> IV) and technical assistance (Level V). During the 2002 - 2003 grant cycle(study year 1), the AETC provided a total of 847 structured training events (Levels I through III), as well as 429 clinical consultations and 628 responses to requests for technical assistance. For the grant cycle 2003 - 2004 (study year 2), the AETC provided a total of 877 structured training events (Levels I through III), as well as 912 clinical consultations and 842 responses to requests for technical assistance. Data collected by the PA/MA AETC was obtained separately for each year and data analysis was performed using Minitab and Access. Pie and vertical bar charts were created in SigmaPlot to summarize activities over the two years. The evaluation demonstrates {{the nature and extent}} of AETC training and the ways it may contribute to enhancing the knowledge and skills of the participants. The two core evaluation questions for 2002 - 2004 are the following 1) do the programs reach the primary care provider audiences with a focus on Ryan White, community/migrant health centers (CMHCs), minority providers, and those serving medically-underserved and the poor and 2) do the regional programs address key content areas that address Ryan White CARE Act (the largest source of federal funding for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States) requirements. A review of the data shows that a large percentage of AETC training participants are minorities or treat minorities and are serving a heavy minority client/patient caseload. More than half of the participants are physicians and nurses. Employees of CARE Act-funded agencies form a large proportion of the total trainees enabling them to acquire the latest HIV treatment knowledge and skills. The AETC strengthens their HIV knowledge and skills by providing training in advanced clinical management topics as well as topics relevant to understanding and working with the special populations served by many of the trainees. Collectively, these training activities contribute to enhancing both the quality and the continuity of HIV-related care provided to underserved and vulnerable populations across the Pennsylvania/MidAtlantic region by clinicians and other health care providers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} {{contribute}} {{for the real}} implementation of cognitive pharmaceutical services in Portugal, a three levels model of pharmacist clinical intervention in the community pharmacy, based on the differentiated patient´s health needs, was proposed by the authors («Three Levels Model for Differentiated Pharmacist Clinical Activities in the Community Pharmacy – The Proposal», accompanying paper). Objective: To test the practical application of the proposed three levels model for differentiated pharmacist clinical activities in the community pharmacy. Methods: The three levels model was implemented in several community pharmacies. The philosophy of the model, to change the focus of community pharmacies from the product to the patient, was introduced {{under the supervision of}} a specialized pharmacist, responsible for the pharmacotherapeutic follow-up program. All the pharmacy professionals were instructed to ask the customer about the control of his health problem, whenever applicable. When no non-controlled health problem was detected, dispensing the product fulfils the customer needs and is considered the level 1 service. If a non-controlled health problem was detected, the pharmacist considers the clinical situation and delivers the appropriate counseling, either immediately or delayed for a pharmaceutical <b>consultation,</b> configuring the <b>level</b> 2 service. When, at level 2, emerges the perception that simple and immediate actions would not control the health problem, the patient was invited to integrate the pharmacotherapeutic follow-up program, corresponding to the level 3 service. Results: The implementation of pharmacotherapeutic follow-up <b>consultations</b> (<b>level</b> 3) started in 2008 and {{paved the way for the}} development of this model. Until September 2013, one specialized pharmacist followed 430 patients with recurrent non-controlled health problems, performing around 3200 pharmaceutical consultations in 20 community pharmacies. The results available for one pharmacy (46 patients) show mean reductions of 26. 4 ± 7. 68 mg/dL on total cholesterol (n= 28; p= 2. 510 x 10 - 3), 1. 9 ± 0. 73...|$|R

Methods: Key components of medication-related consultations were identified through a literature review and compiled to form an initial consultation skills framework. This was iteratively refined through consultation with experts (n = 21) to form the Medication-Related Consultation Framework (MRCF). Psychometric testing was undertaken by analyzing pharmacists’ (n = 10) assessment of fifteen pre-recorded simulated consultations. Results: The MRCF consisted of 46 consultation behaviors, grouped into five sections. Performance was rated at individual behavior, framework section and global <b>consultation</b> <b>levels.</b> The MRCF discriminated between good, satisfactory and poor consultations at the global rating level (p < 0. 01) with good test– retest reliability (rho = 0. 59 – 0. 95) and moderate inter-assessor reliability (Kendall’s W = 0. 67). There was also good internal consistency for the five sections (Cronbach’s alphas = 0. 58 – 0. 97). Conclusions: The MRCF demonstrated good psychometric properties at the global and section rating levels. Some inconsistencies in assessors’ ratings of individual consultation behaviors were indentified, which may represent a future training need.
