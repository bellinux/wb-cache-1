40|$|Viruses that {{generate}} <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> lacking 2 'O methylation {{on the first}} ribose are severely affected by the antiviral activity of Type I interferons. We used proteome-wide affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to identify human and mouse proteins specifically binding to <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> with different methylation states. This analysis, complemented with functional validation experiments, revealed that IFIT 1 is the sole interferon-induced protein displaying higher affinity for unmethylated than for methylated <b>capped</b> <b>RNA.</b> IFIT 1 tethers a species-specific protein complex consisting of other IFITs to RNA. Pulsed stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry {{as well as in}} vitro competition assays indicate that IFIT 1 sequesters 2 'O-unmethylated <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> and thereby impairs binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factors to 2 'O-unmethylated RNA template, which results in inhibition of translation.

In particular, mutations of basic amino acids K 669, R 670, and R 672 inhibited primer-dependent viral mRNA synthesis. In contrast, primer-independent cRNA and vRNA syntheses were only marginally affected. Additionally, recombinant viruses containing the K 669 A or R 672 A mutations expressed reduced amounts of mRNA compared to cRNA during infection and were attenuated in cell culture. Further in vitro analysis showed that these mutations inhibited {{the ability of the}} polymerase to initiate mRNA synthesis by causing a reduction in binding to the vRNA promoter and <b>capped</b> <b>RNA.</b> These results suggest that this region plays a critical role in the regulation of viral mRNA transcription...|$|E

40|$|The nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) stimulates {{processing}} {{reactions of}} <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs,</b> including their splicing, 3 ′-end formation, degradation, and transport. CBC effects are particular for individual RNA families, but how such selectivity is achieved remains elusive. Here, we analyze three main CBC partners known to impact different RNA species. ARS 2 stimulates 3 ′-end formation/transcription termination of several transcript types, ZC 3 H 18 stimulates degradation of a diverse set of RNAs, and PHAX functions in pre-small nuclear RNA/small nucleolar RNA (pre-snRNA/snoRNA) transport. Surprisingly, these proteins all bind <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs</b> without strong preferences for given transcripts, and their steady-state binding correlates poorly with their function. Despite this, PHAX and ZC 3 H 18 compete for CBC binding and we demonstrate that this competitive binding is functionally relevant.

40|$|In vitro {{transcripts}} of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were either 5 ′-terminally labeled by incorporation of [β- 32 P]GTP or were selected on Hg-agarose after incorporation of γ-thio-GTP. Capped RNAs ranged {{in size from}} 23 nucleotides, the shortest <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> detected, to full-length message size. The 5 ′-terminal sequences corresponded to those of N message and to {{a small amount of}} NS message. Approximately 14 % of the capped N gene transcripts were terminated at positions 86 to 90 of the VSV genome, giving rise to specific, 36 to 40 -nucleotide-long, <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> species. The GTP-initiated RNAs were short with a predominant 28 -nucleotide-long RNA species. A minor portion was as large as mRNAs. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the short RNA revealed that it was specifically initiated at positon 91 of the VSV genome, 41 nucleotides within the N cistron. This corresponds exactly to the site where transcription of the 40 -nucleotide-long, <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> terminated. Initiation with GTP at position 91 occurred at approximately the same frequency as termination of the <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> at position 90, suggesting that intracistronic initiation at position 91 may depend upon termination of transcription of the 5 ′-proximal region and therefore may be sequential. This unique RNA represents the first transcript of VSV which was initiated at an intracistronic site with GTP, and may also represent the first example of a transcript derived from a stop/start mechanism of VSV transcription in vitro. Although initiation occurred frequently {{at the beginning of the}} N cistron yielding 11 to 14 -nucleotide-long, [β- 32 P]ATP-labeled transcripts (D. F. Pinney and S. U. Emerson, J. Virol. 42 : 889 - 896, 1982), capping of these short RNAs was not detected.

However, recent studies of the human transcriptome indicate pervasive transcription in previously unannotated regions of the genome and that many RNA transcripts have short or lack 3 ' poly(A) ends. We hypothesized that using ENCODE tiling arrays (1 % of the genome) in combination with affinity purifying Pol II RNAs by their unique 5 ' m⁷GpppN cap would identify previously undescribed annotated and unannotated genes that are differentially expressed in liver during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Both 5 '-capped and poly(A) + populations of RNA were analyzed using ENCODE tiling arrays. Sixty-four annotated genes were significantly increased in HCV cirrhotic as compared to control liver; twenty-seven (42 %) of these genes were identified only by analyzing 5 ' <b>capped</b> <b>RNA.</b> Thirty-one annotated genes were significantly decreased; sixteen (50 %) of these were identified only by analyzing 5 ' <b>capped</b> <b>RNA.</b> Bioinformatic analysis showed that <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> produced more consistent results, provided a more extensive expression profile of intronic regions and identified upregulated Pol II transcriptionally active regions in unannotated areas of the genome in HCV cirrhotic liver. Two of these regions were verified by PCR and RACE analysis. qPCR analysis of liver biopsy specimens demonstrated that these unannotated transcripts, as well as IRF 1, TRIM 22 and MET, were also upregulated in hepatitis C with mild inflammation and no fibrosis. The analysis of 5 ' <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> in combination with ENCODE tiling arrays provides additional gene expression information and identifies novel upregulated Pol II transcripts not previously described in HCV infected liver. This approach, particularly when combined with new RNA sequencing technologies, should also be useful in further defining Pol II transcripts differentially regulated in specific disease states and in studying RNAs regulated by changes in pre-mRNA splicing or 3 ' polyadenylation status...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that the vaccinia virus D 10 protein, which is conserved in all sequenced poxviruses, participates in the rapid turnover of host and viral mRNAs. D 10 contains a motif present in the family of Nudix/MutT enzymes, a subset {{of which has been}} shown to enhance mRNA turnover in eukaryotic cells through cleavage of the 5 ′ cap (m 7 GpppNm-). Here, we demonstrate that a purified recombinant D 10 fusion protein possesses an intrinsic activity that liberates m 7 GDP from <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> substrates. Furthermore, point mutations in the Nudix/MutT motif abolished decapping activity. D 10 has a strong affinity for <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> substrates (Km ≈ 3 nm). RNAs of 24 – 309 nt were decapped to comparable extents, whereas the cap of a 12 -nt RNA was uncleaved. At large molar ratios relative to <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> substrate, competitor m 7 GpppG, m 7 GTP, or m 7 GDP inhibited decapping, whereas even higher concentrations of unmethylated analogs did not. High concentrations of uncapped RNA were also inhibitory, suggesting that D 10 recognizes its substrate through interaction with both cap and RNA moieties. Thus far, poxviruses represent the only virus family shown to encode a Nudix hydrolase-decapping enzyme. Although it may seem self-destructive for a virus to encode a decapping and a capping enzyme, accelerated mRNA turnover helps eliminate competing host mRNAs and allows stage-specific synthesis of viral proteins...|$|E

Capped and uncapped transcripts of different sizes (37 - 317 nt) were incubated with fractionated nuclear extracts, and in all cases the <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs</b> were stable while their uncapped counterparts were completely degraded. No changes in activity were detected when cap analogs were included in reaction mixtures, suggesting that the stability of <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs</b> was not due to a cap binding protein. The exoribonuclease was shown to be specific for RNA, and to function processively with either substrates containing 5 '-hydroxyl or 5 '-phosphorylated ends. The products were predominantly 5 '-mononucleotides, and no detectable intermediates were observed at any reaction time points. Sedimentation analysis suggests that the native size of the nuclease is 7. 4 S or approximately 150 kDa. Interestingly, a nucleoside triphosphate was found to be necessary for specific and complete degradation of the uncapped RNAs. Finally, micrococcal nuclease (MN) pretreatment of the partially purified enzyme inhibited its activity. As several controls indicated that this was not due to non-specific effects of MN, this finding suggests that the exoribonuclease contains an essential RNA component...|$|R

A study of the rate of hybridization of CAP DNA to cell DNA at various driver to probe ratios showed that its rate of hybridization {{is similar to that}} of tumour cell DNA reassociation. Further, in reassociation studies accelerated by using the phenol emulsion reassociation technique (PERT), CAP DNA originally isolated as single-stranded DNA was shown to reanneal (7 O~o), to protect 125 I-cell DNA to the same extent (67 ~o) and to do so with kinetics of reassociation equi-valent o that of mouse DNA. Although CAP DNA isolates were slightly enriched for MMTV specific sequences when compared to total cellular DNA, we conclude that the majority of ss CAP-associated DNA is equivalent to a random sample of total turnout cell DNA...|$|R
40|$|Hantaviruses, {{members of}} the Bunyaviridae family, are {{emerging}} category A pathogens that carry three negative stranded RNA molecules as their genome. Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) is encoded by the smallest S segment genomic RNA (viral RNA). N specifically binds mRNA caps and requires four nucleotides adjacent to the cap for high affinity binding. We show that the N peptide has distinct cap- and RNA-binding sites that independently interact with mRNA cap and viral genomic RNA, respectively. In addition, N can simultaneously bind with both mRNA cap and vRNA. N undergoes distinct conformational changes after binding with either mRNA cap or vRNA or both mRNA cap and vRNA simultaneously. Hantavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) uses a <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primer for transcription initiation. The <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primer is generated from host cell mRNA by the cap-snatching mechanism and is supposed to anneal with the 3 ′ terminus of vRNA template during transcription initiation by single G-C base pairing. We show that the <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primer binds at the cap-binding site and induces a conformational change in N. The conformationally altered N with a capped primer loaded at the cap-binding site specifically binds the conserved 3 ′ nine nucleotides of vRNA and assists the bound primer to anneal at the 3 ′ terminus. We suggest that the cap-binding site of N, in conjunction with RdRp, {{plays a key role}} during the transcription and replication initiation of vRNA genome...|$|E

We have expressed and purified two constructs of Meaban virus (MV; genus Flavivirus) NS 5 protein MTase domain (residues 1 – 265 and 1 – 293, respectively). We report here the three-dimensional structure of the shorter MTase construct in complex with the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine, at 2. 9 Å resolution. Inspection of the refined crystal structure, which highlights structural conservation of specific active site residues, together with sequence analysis and structural comparison with Dengue virus 2 ′OMTase, suggests that the crystallized enzyme belongs to the 2 ′OMTase subgroup. Enzymatic assays show that the short MV MTase construct is inactive, but the longer construct expressed can transfer a methyl group to the ribose 2 ′O atom of a short GpppAC 5 substrate.

The objective {{of this study was}} to construct and characterize an infectious cDNA clone of avian HEV for future studies of HEV replication and pathogenesis. Three full-length cDNA clones of avian HEV, pT 7 -aHEV- 5, pT 7 G-aHEV- 10 and pT 7 G-aHEV- 6, were constructed and their infectivity was tested by in vitro transfection of leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) chicken liver cells and by direct intrahepatic inoculation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> transcripts from the three clones.

40|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primers {{required}} for the initiation of influenza virus mRNA synthesis are produced by the viral polymerase itself, which consists of three proteins PB 1, PB 2 and PA. Production of primers is activated only when the 5 '- and 3 '-terminal sequences of virion RNA (vRNA) bind sequentially to the polymerase, indicating that vRNA molecules function not only as templates for mRNA synthesis but also as essential cofactors which activate catalytic functions. Using thio U-substituted RNA and UV crosslinking, we demonstrate that the 5 ' and 3 ' sequences of vRNA bind to different amino acid sequences in the same protein subunit, the PB 1 protein. Mutagenesis experiments proved that these two amino acid sequences constitute the functional RNA-binding sites. The 5 ' sequence of vRNA binds to an amino acid sequence centered around two arginine residues at positions 571 and 572, causing an allosteric alteration which activates two new functions of the polymerase complex. In addition to the PB 2 protein subunit acquiring the ability to bind 5 '-capped ends of RNAs, the PB 1 protein itself acquires the ability to bind the 3 ' sequence of vRNA, via a ribonucleoprotein 1 (RNP 1) -like motif, amino acids 249 - 256, which contains two phenylalanine residues {{required for}} binding. Binding to this site induces a second allosteric alteration which results in the activation of the endonuclease that produces the <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primers needed for mRNA synthesis.

When this <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> was introduced by microinjection into Xenopus oocytes, production of 2 – 5 A synthetase was clearly observed in the cytoplasm and 10 – 30 % of the enzyme accumulated with time in the nucleoplasm. Analysis of cytoplasmic homogenates of these oocytes on a glycerol gradient revealed that the enzyme is fully active in the monomeric form...|$|E
50|$|Four {{transcription}} factor-like proteins {{have been}} found in PBSV-1, including TFIIB (A107L), TFIID (A552R), TFIIS (A125L), and a VLTF-2 type transcription factor (A482R). In addition, PBCV-1 also encodes two enzymes involved in forming a mRNA <b>cap</b> structure, an <b>RNA</b> triphosphatase and a mRNA guanylyltransferase. The PBCV-1 enzymes are more closely related to yeast enzymes than to poxvirus multifunctional <b>RNA</b> <b>capping</b> enzymes according to its size, amino-acid sequence, and biochemical properties. PBCV-1 also encodes RNase III, which is involved in virus mRNAs processing.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear RNA {{metabolism}} {{is influenced}} by protein complexes connecting to both RNA-productive and -destructive pathways. The ZC 3 H 18 protein binds the cap-binding complex (CBC), universally present on <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs,</b> while also associating with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, linking to RNA decay. To dissect ZC 3 H 18 function, we conducted interaction screening and mutagenesis of the protein, which revealed a phosphorylation-dependent isoform. Surprisingly, the modified region of ZC 3 H 18 associates with core histone proteins. Further examination of ZC 3 H 18 function, by genome-wide analyses, demonstrated its impact on transcription of a subset of protein-coding genes. This activity requires the CBC-interacting domain of the protein, with some genes being also dependent on the NEXT- and/or histone-interacting domains. Our data {{shed light on the}} domain requirements of a protein positioned centrally in nuclear RNA metabolism, and they suggest that post-translational modification may modulate its function...|$|R
40|$|In Class I CAP-dependent promoters, the DNA {{site for}} CAP is located {{upstream}} of the DNA site for RNA polymerase. In Class II CAP-dependent promoters, the DNA site for CAP overlaps the DNA site for RNA polymerase, replacing the - 35 site. We have used an 'oriented heterodimers' approach {{to identify the}} functional subunit of CAP at two Class I promoters having different distances between the DNA sites for <b>CAP</b> and <b>RNA</b> polymerase [CC(- 61. 5) and CC(- 72. 5) ] and at one Class II promoter [CC(- 41. 5) ]. Our results indicate that transcription activation at Class I promoters, irrespective of {{the distance between the}} DNA sites for <b>CAP</b> and <b>RNA</b> polymerase, requires the activating region of the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP. In striking contrast, our results indicate that transcription activation at Class II promoters requires the activating region of the promoter-distal subunit of CAP...|$|R
40|$|Influenza viruses {{replicate}} and transcribe their segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome in {{the nucleus}} of the infected host cell. All RNA synthesising activities associated with influenza virus are performed by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that consists of three subunits, PA, PB 1 and PB 2. However, viral transcription is critically dependent on on-going cellular transcription, in particular, on activities associated with the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Thus, the viral RdRp uses short 5 ' <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> fragments, derived from cellular Pol II transcripts, as primers for viral mRNA synthesis. These <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> primers are generated by cleavage of host Pol II transcripts by an endonuclease activity associated with the viral RdRp. Moreover, some viral transcripts require splicing and since influenza virus does not encode splicing machinery, it is dependent on host splicing, an activity also related to Pol II transcription. Despite these functional links between viral and host Pol II transcription, there has been no evidence that a physical association existed between the two transcriptional machineries. However, recently it was reported that there is a physical interaction between the trimeric viral RdRp and cellular Pol II. The viral RdRp was found to interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of initiating Pol II, at a stage in the transcription cycle when capping takes place. It was therefore proposed that this interaction may be required for the viral RNA (vRNA) polymerase to gain access to <b>capped</b> <b>RNA</b> substrates for endonucleolytic cleavage. The virus not only relies on cellular factors to support its own RNA synthesis, but also subverts cellular pathways in order to generate an environment optimised for viral multiplication. In this respect, the interaction of the viral NS 1 protein with factors involved in cellular pre-mRNA processing is of particular relevance. The virus also alters the distribution of Pol II on cellular genes, leading to a reduction in elongating Pol II thereby contributing to the phenomenon known as host shut-off...|$|E

Depending {{on the length of}} the desired <b>capped</b> <b>RNA,</b> chemical or enzymatic preparation – or a combination of both – can be advantageous. We review state-of-the art methods and give directions for choosing the appropriate approach. We also discuss the preparation and properties of mRNAs with non-natural caps providing novel features such as improved stability or enhanced translational efficiency...|$|E

40|$|A small plastid-encoded RNA (spRNA, 218 nt) {{has been}} {{detected}} in tobacco. The corresponding locus (sprA) {{does not contain}} any open reading frame and is actively transcribed from its own promoter, as shown by ribonuclease protection assays using in vitro <b>capped</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Gel-shift and UV-crosslinking experiments showed {{the formation of a}} specific complex between spRNA and chloroplast polypeptides. The mobility of the complex was further shifted when a transcript bearing part of the 16 S rRNA leader sequence was added to the incubation mixture. Glycerol gradient fractionation of a chloroplast lysate indicated a preferential sedimentation of spRNA at 15 - 20 S and 70 S. These observations, and the potential base-pairing with the leader sequence of pre- 16 S rRNA, suggest a role for spRNA in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis, i. e. 16 S rRNA maturation. By sequencing of tomato plastid DNA and heterologous northern hybridizations, the presence of sprA homologs and their expression in a number of dicot plants have also been shown...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{experimentally}} determined 3 D structure of an intact activator-dependent transcription initiation complex comprising the Escherichia coli {{catabolite activator protein}} (<b>CAP),</b> <b>RNA</b> polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP), and a DNA fragment containing positions − 78 to + 20 of a Class I CAP-dependent promoter with a CAP site at position − 61. 5 and a premelted transcription bubble. A 20 -Å electron microscopy reconstruction was obtained by iterative projection-based matching of single particles visualized in carbon-sandwich negative stain and was fitted using atomic coordinate sets for CAP, RNAP, and DNA. The structure defines the organization of a Class I CAP-RNAP-promoter complex and supports previously proposed interactions of CAP with RNAP α subunit C-terminal domain (αCTD), interactions of αCTD with σ 70 region 4, interactions of CAP and RNAP with promoter DNA, and phased-DNA-bend-dependent partial wrapping of DNA around the complex. The structure also reveals the positions and shapes of species-specific domains within the RNAP β′, β, and σ 70 subunits...|$|R
