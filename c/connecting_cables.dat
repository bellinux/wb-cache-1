5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron <b>connecting</b> <b>cables</b> during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} bus {{was equipped}} with an innovative system of Bombardier PRIMOVE, allowing inductive charging without <b>connecting</b> <b>cables.</b> The drive system uses an electric drive system by Vossloh Kiepe GmbH made in Düsseldorf. The motor was centrally mounted by 4 poles with the asynchronous motor which has a maximum power output of 160kW (1400 Nm) and allows the use of standard axles: ZF AV 132, and the independently sprung axle ZF RL 75 EC. Energy recovered during braking is stored in the lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 210 kWh. The vehicle is also equipped with a plug-in connector {{that allows you to}} connect additional to an external energy source. All devices in the vehicle, which are usually powered by a diesel engine have been electrified. The air conditioning system has a built-Konvekta UL500EM CO2 heat pump, which is also used for heating the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Using a long, {{flexible}} test <b>cable</b> <b>connected</b> with a one-wire {{voltage feedback}} circuit, a resistive tactile sensor in a shared row-column fashion exhibited flexibility in robotic operations but suffered from crosstalk {{caused by the}} <b>connected</b> <b>cable</b> due to its wire resistances and its contacted resistances. Firstly, we designed a new non-scanned driving-electrode (VF-NSDE) circuit using two wires for every row line and every column line to reduce the crosstalk caused by the <b>connected</b> <b>cables</b> in the circuit. Then, an equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) for the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit was analytically derived. Following this, the one-wire VF-NSDE circuit and the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit were evaluated by simulation experiments. Finally, positive features of the proposed method were verified with the experiments of a two-wire VF-NSDE prototype circuit. The experiment {{results show that the}} two-wire VF-NSDE circuit can greatly reduce the crosstalk error caused by the cables in the 2 -D networked resistive sensor array...|$|R

50|$|A {{communication}} channel is simply {{referring to the}} medium by which a signal travels. There {{are two types of}} media by which electrical signals travel, i.e. guided and unguided. Guided media refers to any medium that can be directed from transmitter to receiver by means of <b>connecting</b> <b>cables.</b> In optical fiber communication, the medium is an optical (glass-like) fiber. Other guided media might include coaxial cables, telephone wire, twisted-pairs, etc... The other type of media, unguided media, refers to any {{communication channel}} that creates space between the transmitter and receiver. For radio or RF communication, the medium is air. Air is the only thing between the transmitter and receiver for RF communication while in other cases, like sonar, the medium is usually water because sound waves travel efficiently through certain liquid media. Both types of media are considered unguided because there are no <b>connecting</b> <b>cables</b> between the transmitter and receiver. Communication channels include almost everything from the vacuum of space to solid pieces of metal; however, some mediums are preferred more than others. That is because differing sources travel through subjective mediums with fluctuating efficiencies.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors need {{overcurrent}} protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or {{to protect against}} short circuits in <b>connecting</b> <b>cables</b> or internal faults in the motor windings. The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a bimetallic strip, or where a solder pot melts, releasing a spring to operate auxiliary contacts. These auxiliary contacts are in series with the coil. If the overload senses excess current in the load, the coil is de-energized.|$|E

The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 44 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{designers}} often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting {{on electronic}} equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are {{more resistant to}} damage or contamination, {{by virtue of their}} concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to <b>connecting</b> <b>cables,</b> which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.|$|E
50|$|The second model, GL02, also {{includes}} two SatLights and <b>connecting</b> <b>cables.</b> These are separate lights that are {{wired in series}} from the main GravityLight unit. Each SatLight can be turned on or off separately. When used with SatLights, {{the light on the}} main unit can be turned on or off. Up to 4 SatLights can be connected, giving extra light to different locations in the house. The rate of the bag drop is almost not affected by the number of SatLights attached.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the other}} {{protocols}} break the ground loop at data baud rate frequency by fitting small ferrite cores around the <b>connecting</b> <b>cables</b> near each end, and/or just inside the equipment boundary. These form a common-mode choke which inhibit unbalanced current flow, without affecting the differential signal. This technique is equally valid for coaxial interconnects, and many camcorders have ferrite cores fitted to some of their auxiliary cables such as DC charging and external audio input, to break the high frequency current flow if the user inadvertently creates a ground loop when connecting external equipment.|$|E
