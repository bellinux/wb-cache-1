50|$|The color {{reaction}} between borates and curcumin is used {{within the}} spectrophotometrical determination and quantification of boron present in food or materials. Curcumin is a yellow coloring natural pigment {{found in the}} root stocks of some Curcuma species, especially <b>Curcuma</b> <b>longa</b> (<b>turmeric),</b> in concentrations up to 3%. In the so-called curcumin method for boron quantification it serves as reaction partner for boric acid. The reaction is very sensitive and so the smallest quantities of boron can be detected. The maximum absorbance at 540 nm for rosocyanine is used in this colorimetric method. The formation of rosocyanine depends on the reaction conditions. The reaction is carried out preferentially in acidic solutions containing hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The color reaction also takes place under different conditions; however, in alkaline solution, gradual decomposition is observed. The reaction might be disturbed at higher pH values, interfering with other compounds.|$|E

Recent studies have revealed that many channels and transporters are modulated by curcumin, such as voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, high-voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (HVGCC), volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + channel (CRAC), aquaporin- 4 (AQP- 4), glucose transporters, etc. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the interactions of curcumin with different types of ion channels and transporters and to help better understand and integrate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the multiple pharmacological activities of curcumin...|$|E
40|$|The histiophagous scuticociliate Philasterides dicentrarchi is the {{aetiological}} {{agent of}} scuticociliatosis, a parasitic disease of farmed turbot. Curcumin, a polyphenol from <b>Curcuma</b> <b>longa</b> (<b>turmeric),</b> {{is known to}} have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the in vitro effects of curcumin on the growth of P. dicentrarchi and on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in turbot leucocytes activated by parasite cysteine proteases. At 100 μm, curcumin had a cytotoxic effect and completely inhibited the growth of the parasite. At 50 μm, curcumin inhibited the protease activity of the parasite and expression of genes encoding two virulence-associated proteases: leishmanolysin-like peptidase and cathepsin L-like. At concentrations between 25 and 50 μm, curcumin inhibited the expression of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acids methionine and cysteine. At 100 μm, curcumin inhibited the expression of the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) produced in turbot leucocytes activated by parasite proteases. Results show that curcumin has a dual effect on scuticociliatosis: an antiparasitic effect on the catabolism and anabolism of ciliate proteins, and an anti-inflammatory effect that inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the host. The present findings suggest the potential usefulness of this polyphenol in treating scuticociliatosis...|$|E
30|$|From the {{toxicity}} point of view, {{the main concern}} is the excessive exposure that requires elimination of accumulated nanoparticles from biological organs {{as well as it}} requires urgent treatment of inflammatory disorders. Some researchers have tried to study several anti-inflammatory drugs on the treatment of toxicity of nanoparticles in vivo, and they found that these anti-inflammatory drugs could promote the excretion of nanoparticles that are accumulated in the body to a certain extent in order to reduce or eliminate the tissue inflammatory effects [8, 9]. <b>Curcuma</b> <b>longa</b> (<b>turmeric)</b> is a traditional medicinal herb with a quite long history of its use as a treatment for inflammatory diseases in Southeast Asia. Numerous studies have been reported on the antioxidant properties, antimutation and antitumor effects, and carcinogenic characteristics of curcumin [10, 11]. Curcumin has the ability of healing wounds as well as treating the liver ailments, urinary tract diseases, and hepatitis [11]. It alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic diseases through the Nrf 2 -keap 1 pathway. Curcumin can suppress pro-inflammatory pathways related with most chronic diseases and blocks both the production of TNF and the cell signaling mediated by TNF in various types of cells. Moreover, curcumin may also act as a TNF blocker from in vitro and in vivo by binding to TNF directly [12].|$|E

Plant with neem cake application had the taller plant (79. 30 cm), maximum number of tillers per plant (5. 40), leaf number (5. 40), leaf area (44. 09) leaf area index (0. 429), fresh weight of halum (190. 05 g), fresh weight of root (49. 13 g), fresh weight of rhizome per plant (256. 21 g) and dry weight of halum (15. 21 g), dry weight of root (7. 32 g), dry weight of rhizome per plant (40. 35 g), total dry matter yield (6. 85 t ha- 1) than those received other types of manures. Moreover, yield attributes such as number of mother rhizomes per plant- 1 (1. 75), more number of primary rhizomes per plant- 1 (5. 19), secondary rhizomes per plant- 1 (18. 03) and tertiary rhizomes per plant (7. 69) were also highly accelerated by neem cake application. Similarly, the same treatment expressed the best in terms of size of mother rhizome (7. 69 cm), primary rhizome (21. 86 cm) and secondary rhizomes (7. 05 cm). All these parameters in cumulative contributed to produce the highest estimated fresh rhizomes yield & cured rhizomes yield (29. 48 t ha- 1, 5. 59 t ha- 1 respectively). The highest curing percentage (20. 28) was observed in T 3 treatment having mustard cake @ 2. 0 t/ha. Thus, organic manure like neem cake was best fitted natural fertilizer for turmeric cultivation...|$|R

Turmeric powder {{derived from the}} rhizome of <b>Curcuma</b> <b>longa</b> is commonly used as a spice, food preservative and food colouring agent. It also {{has a long history}} of therapeutic uses. The compound shows yellow colour in Turmeric are three curcuminoids namely curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxy curcumin. Curcumin [1, 7 -bis(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl)- 1, 6 -heptadiene- 3, 5 -dione], a yellow bioactive pigment is the major component of Turmeric. Curcumin shows some biological activities exhibiting anti-inflammatory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], antifungal, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial [6], antiprotozoal wound healing, antispasmodic, anticoagulant, antitumor and hepatoprotective activities [7, 8, 9, 10]. Antioxidant and wound-healing gives by curcumin, its anticancer and anti-viral attributes, its effect on lymphocytes, platlet aggregation, detoxification mechanism. Curcumin is a potential anticancer drug it show its effect through molecular targets and it also cure colon cancer. The water-soluble extract turmerin, inhibits HIV infected T cell proliferation. It has also been studied extensively as a chemo preventive agent in several cancer cells [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. From the figure the acceptor site is the active region to cure cancer cells and also some tumors. Structurally curcuminoids are linear 1, 7 -diaryl- 1, 6 -heptadiene- 3, 5 -diones which exist in tautomeric forms as α,β unsaturated 1, 3 -diketo form and enol form. The proton-transfer of dissociation is associated with radical-scavenging mechanisms of curcumin. The curcumin structure containing enol form supposes to be more stable than diketo form. Curcumin has a potential singlet oxygen quencher at low conditions. The compound has an effect in protecting skin against UV light. The results indicate that unsaturation in the side chain a methoxy group on benzene ring and keto-enol in the curcumin molecule structural. The theoretical also reported wherein DFT and TD-DFT calculations help to find out keto-enol equilibrium of curcumin in solution state and low pKa value for the dissocation of enol proton. Quanta methods are useful in determining the effect of inter molecular interactions on the vibrational spectra. The pervious study explain the understanding of hydrogen bonding that conform spectroscopic approach (FT-IR, FT-Raman) with quantum chemical methods (DFT). Density Functional theory is useful in vibrational assignment, hydrogen bonding, High chemical reactivity (Homo-Lumo) and NMR. The delocalisation of π-electron is further supported by red-shifted UV–visible absorption maximum of keto-enol tautomer of curcumin.|$|R
