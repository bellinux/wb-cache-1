5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Rougier {{was called}} to the Bar, and the family moved first to Brighton, then to Hove, so that Rougier could easily commute to London.

5|$|Resident Evil was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo.

The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game.|$|E

5|$|The {{season was}} the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after {{production}} was moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This move was done largely on the behest of Duchovny, who wished to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, although series director Kim Manners and Anderson approved of it, although to a less-vocal degree than Duchovny. The first half of the season also saw Mimi Rogers and Chris Owens' characters—Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender, respectively—become recurring characters.|$|E
