The paper is carefully lowered onto the floating pattern and then lifted, rinsed and hung out to dry. Each pattern on each piece of paper must be controlled to check they are the same.|$|E
5000|$|Chondrus crispus is an {{industrial}} source of carrageenan, which {{is commonly used}} as a thickener and stabilizer in milk products such as ice cream and processed foods, including lunch meat. In Europe, it is indicated as E407 or E407b. It may {{also be used as}} a thickener in calico-printing and for fining beer or wine. Irish moss is frequently used with Mastocarpus stellatus (Gigartina mamillosa), Chondracanthus acicularis [...] (G. acicularis) and other seaweeds, which are all commonly found growing together. <b>Carragheen</b> and agar-agar are also used in Asia for gelatin-like desserts, such as almond jelly. Presently, the major source of carrageenan is tropical seaweeds of the genera Kappaphycus and Eucheuma.|$|E
