40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} {{application}} of the synergistic effects of various advanced oxidation processes (AOP) used for decomposition of <b>chemical</b> compounds <b>resistant</b> to biodegradation. The synergistic effect of photocatalytically active material and low temperature plasma were tested in my thesis. Model substances with photocatalytically active material were exposed to atmospheric plasma discharge (Gliding Arc) in order to improve generation of the active hydroxyl groups and oxidation processes. The first chapter of the theoretical part summarizes the knowledge of advanced oxidation processes, their principles and utilization. Next chapters are dedicated to basic summary of titanium dioxide and types of creating the thin films. The last part of theoretical chapter describes the types of plasma discharges. The experimental part describes the equipment for decomposition of <b>chemical</b> compounds <b>resistant</b> to biodegradation using AOP. Next chapter of the experimental part is dedicated to decomposition of organic dye AO 7 and antibiotic Verapamil hydrochloride. The last chapter summarizes the results of the experiments...|$|R
