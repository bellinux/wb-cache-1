5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career {{home run}} record of 733. The home run {{came in the}} top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The {{achievement}} was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' Chris Spurling with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> the playoffs, Bonds's home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, though Bonds went 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe competed at the 1996 Australian Age Championships in Brisbane, winning five gold, two {{silver and}} two bronze medals. His {{times in the}} 400m {{freestyle}} and 200m backstroke qualified him for the Australian Championships, which doubled as selection trials for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at only 13 years and six months. He sent Thorpe to Sydney merely to gain competition experience at senior national level. As expected, Thorpe missed selection; he finished 23rd in the 400m freestyle and 36th in the 200m backstroke. At {{the end of the}} year, Thorpe qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance to gain national selection, as the event served as the selection trials for the 1997 FINA World Swimming Championships.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature of {{relationships}} between individual endowments, efforts, rewards and institutions toward explaining the generation of path-breaking discoveries in academics. Individual endowments are explicitly modeled as the capability to do lateral and vertical thinking which lead to knowledge generation, funding and also influence the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> breakthroughs in research. Our findings highlight the role of optimal combination of individual effort within the institutional constraints {{in order to maximize}} the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> success. Under certain situations higher efforts do not necessarily lead to higher <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> breakthroughs. When individual endowments can be augmented through institutional reward mechanisms, individual or institutional shortcomings can be overcome through optimal timing and placement of efforts. The paper also seeks to explain why researchers may be reluctant to explore new lines of inquiry and often pursue research that has negligible impact on societal improvements...|$|R

There was a small collapse from 243/2 to 281/6, but Vic Wilson (cricketer) (62 not out) and Johnny Wardle entertained with 111 for the sixth wicket and Hutton declared at 427/7 on the second morning, Noel Diprose the best of the bowlers with 4/107. The Tasmanians had no answer to the in-swing and off-cutters of Peter Loader who took 6/22 off 12 eight-ball overs and were out for 117, captain Emerson Rodwell had to retire hurt on 2, but returned to be bowled by Loader for 11. Hutton, 310 runs ahead elected to bat again, perhaps to entertain the Saturday crowd the next day and sent in nightwatchmen Frank Tyson to open with Reg Simpson. Simpson failed again, ending his chances of playing in the Tests and Bob Appleyard joined Tyson.

25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

South Australia were stronger than Western Australia, but rarely won the Sheffield Shield and fielded no Test players, though batsman Graeme Hole and wicket-keeper Gil Langley would later play for Australia. Len Hutton had by now recovered from his finger damaged in Colombo and was reunited with his old opening partner Cyril Washbrook. Washbrook had been an original choice for the team who had declined to tour before changing his mind and being flown out to join the party. Brown won the toss again and this time put the opposition in at the Adelaide Oval on what was by tradition a flat, lifeless wicket so that he could fully test his bowlers. Allen MacLean was out for 2, {{but the rest of the}} team batted solidly and Ron Hamence making 114 as Doug Wright (4/103) worked his way expensively through the batting and Brown took 3/55 in the absence of Alec Bedser. Bob Berry was put on and took 0/33 off 12 overs, which made Brown doubt his ability, leading him to be underused for the rest of the tour. When it was their return to bat the MCC bettered the home score by one run before Brown declared on 351/9 with nearly all the runs coming from Hutton (126) and Reg Simpson (119) adding 170 for the second wicket, Godfrey Evans reaching 38 and nobody else making 20. The game looked doom to a draw, but the South Australia captain Ridings declared on 185/3 after Dansie had made 64 to give the MCC a sporting <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> 185 runs in 135 minutes.
