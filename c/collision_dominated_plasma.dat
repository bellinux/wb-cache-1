40|$|The {{kinetic theory}} of the {{electrons}} in a strongly ionized, <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>plasma</b> is reconsidered. By means of a perturbation expansion combined with a multiple time scales formalism, the kinetic equation for the electron distribution function is solved. The usual integro- differential operator {{is transformed into a}} pure differential operator. In a fully ionized plasma this operator reduces to a surprisingly simple form when compared to the original one of Spitzer et al. This greatly simplifies the numerical calculation of the transport coefficients...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} first principle {{kinetic theory}} for electrons which {{is neither a}} classical fluid treatment nor an exospheric calculation is presented. This theory illustrates the global and local properties of the solar wind expansion that shape the observed features of the electron distribution function, such as its bifurcation, its skewness and the differential temperatures of the thermal and suprathermal subpopulations. Coulomb collisions are substantial mediators of the interplanetary electron velocity distribution function and they place a zone for a bifurcation of the electron distribution function deep in the corona. The local cause and effect precept which permeates the physics of denser media is modified for electrons in the solar wind. The local form of transport laws and equations of state which apply to <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>plasmas</b> are replaced with global relations that explicitly depend on the relative position of the observer to {{the boundaries of the}} system...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the temporal behaviour of a plasma at several time varying conditions is of great interest under general physical aspects {{as well as from}} the point of view of very different applications. After an short survey concerning the investigations related to such problems in the following we discuss some more comprehensive results which were recently obtained in the investigations of the electron ensemble both at the field free <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> relaxation in the afterglow during the first period of temporal decay and at the <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> relaxation in a plasma with additional heating by an electric field. These studies take into account all main collision processes using realistic functions for the energy dependence of the correlated collision cross sections. The results were attained by the numerical determination of the isotropic velocity distribution function of the electrons and resulting macroscopic quantities. In this way on the basis of kinetic theory a deeper insigth into the temporal relaxation mechanism of the electron ensemble in weakly ionized <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>plasmas</b> can be gained for many different models of the temporal behaviour of the electric field as the jump-like change and the continuous aperiodical as well as periodical alteration of the field. Thus with the developed sure and widely applicable numerical methods a firm basis has been established to perform further investigations of more general problems grouped around the relaxation models presented here...|$|R

It is found that {{the expansion}} rate, defined as the time rate of change of the particles' mean-square radius, scales approximately linearly with pressure and inversely as {{the square of the}} magnetic field strength in this regime, in agreement with classical predictions...|$|R
40|$|A cylindrical, weakly ionized, and <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> neon <b>plasma</b> {{described}} by a system of nonlinear, parabolic reaction-diffusion equations for the electron and metastable atom axial densities exhibits a bifurcation from a uniform to a striated state at a critical length of the plasma column. The sharp transition between states predicted by the theory is {{in contrast with the}} smooth transition observed in experiments. We apply the theory of singular per urbations of bifurcations to show that small inhomogeneities in the plasma, such as those caused by non-uniform heating and contamination, are sufficient to qualitatively explain the experimental results. We observe that a steady, axial magnetic field in the plasma can also produce a smooth transition...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{lines from}} highly-excited states (n >= 5) of H- and He-like ions have been {{detected}} in astrophysical sources and fusion plasmas. For such excited states, R-matrix or distorted wave calculations for electron-impact excitation are very limited, due to the large size of the atomic basis set needed to describe them. Calculations for n >= 6 are also not generally available. We study the behaviour of the electron-impact excitation collision strengths and effective collision strengths for the most important transitions used to model electron <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> astrophysical <b>plasmas,</b> solar, for example. We investigate the dependence on the relevant parameters: the principal quantum number n or the nuclear charge Z. We also estimate the importance of coupling to highly-excited states and the continuum {{by comparing the results}} of different sized calculations. We provide analytic formulae to calculate the electron-impact excitation collision strengths and effective collision strengths to highly-excited states (n >= 8) of H- and He-like ions. These extrapolated effective collision strengths can be used to interpret astrophysical and fusion plasma via collisional-radiative modelling.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> and isothermal <b>plasma</b> consisting of N particles species. Starting from the momentum balance equations of the plasma components the flux-friction relations are derived for every magnetic surface. The plasma is considered in general toroidal geometry, therefore the results apply to tokamaks and stellarators. Taking into account inertial forces leads to non-linear equations which determine the poloidal and toroidal {{rotation of the}} plasma within the magnetic surfaces. In the first part the flux-friction relations are established in the one-fluid model. Furthermore, some integral relations of the stationary equilibrium are derived and the spin-up equations of poloidal rotation are generalised to stellarator geometry. The {{main part of the}} paper deals with the multi-fluid model and generalises the flux-friction relations to a multi-species plasma. Because of the Coriolis forces the flux-friction relations become first order differential equations instead of algebraic equations. The viscous damping is analysed for a collisional plasma showing the influence of the magnetic field topology and Pfirsch-Schlueter currents on the spin-up mechanism. The similarity between the spin-up equations and the theory of circulation in planetary atmospheres is indicated. Finally the effect of shear viscosity and gyro viscosity is considered. (orig.)

40|$|The ambipolarity {{constraint}} and {{the parallel}} momentum balance equation of neoclassical theory, accounting for finite Larmor radius effects and inertia, allow {{to describe the}} radial electric field and the related spin up in <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> edge - <b>plasma</b> with steep gradients. Thus they may contribute significantly {{to the understanding of}} the L-H transition. The equations are treated analytically using a linear interpolation for the poloidal velocity, v_#theta#(#LAMBDA#" 2), based on v_#theta#(#LAMBDA#_ 0 " 2) = 0 and on the neoclassical value v_n_e_o for small #LAMBDA#. This allows to account for finite #LAMBDA# effects in the just mentioned integration. The equations are also solved numerically (1) to benchmark with a simplified analytical theory with #LAMBDA#= 0 and vanishing neutral gas density; (2) to compare with the analytical theory accounting for finite #LAMBDA# effects and (3) to explore the parameter space in regions where the analytical theory is not valid, in particular in the cases where the neutral gas density is larger than 10 " 1 " 4 m"-" 3. The method resorts to an ODE - solver for the classical momentum balance which is combined with a solver for transcendental equations yielding v_#THETA#. The results concern the comparison with the analytical solution and the experimental results of the ohmically heated ALCATOR plasma. For #LAMBDA# = 0 the numerical solution and the analytical one agree exactly. For finite #LAMBDA# #approx# 1 the deviations are surprisingly small. The toroidal spin up of the ALCATOR plasma, characterized by a very short decay length L_#PSI# = 0. 76 cm, is #approx# 40 km/sec. This compares well the measured value of 35 km/sec.

40|$|The {{correspondence}} between gyrofluid and low frequency fluid equations is examined. The lowest order conservative effects in ExB advection, parallel dynamics, and curvature match trivially. The principal concerns are polarisation fluxes, and dissipative parallel viscosity and parallel heat fluxes. The {{emergence of the}} polarisation heat flux in the fluid model and its contribution to the energy theorem is reviewed. It is shown that gyroviscosity and the polarisation fluxes are matched by the finite gyroradius corrections to advection in the long wavelength limit, provided that the differences between gyrocenter and particle representations is taken into account. The dissipative parallel viscosity is matched by the residual thermal anisotropy in the gyrofluid model in the <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> limit. The dissipative parallel heat flux is matched by the gyrofluid parallel heat flux variables in the <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> limit.

40|$|The {{steady state}} flow of a fully ionized H(+) -O(+) -electron plasma along {{geomagnetic}} field {{lines in the}} high-latitude topside ionosphere is investigated theoretically, with emphasis on the electron temperature anisotropy and heat flow in the polar wind. The 13 -moment system of transport equations developed by Schunk (1975, 1977), which contains a continuity, momentum, internal energy, stress tensor and heat flow equation for each species, is employed to represent the electrons, with a simplified set of transport equations used for the ions, and the transport equations are solved at altitudes from 1500 to 12, 000 km for both subsonic and supersonic H(+) outflows. For subsonic H(+) outflows, the electron gas is found to remain <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> to high altitudes. For supersonic H(+) outflows, the electron gas is also found to be <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> at altitudes below 2500 km, with an anisotropy in electron temperature distribution developing such that {{the temperature of the}} perpendicular electrons is greater than that of the parallel electrons at higher altitudes. In addition, the magnitude of downward electron heat flux at 1500 km is shown to have a dramatic effect on the individual parallel and perpendicular electron temperatures...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{generation}} of magnetic field in the primordial plasma of the standard model (SM) particles at temperature T> 80 TeV {{much higher than the}} electroweak scale. It is assumed that there is an excess number of right-handed electrons over left-handed positrons in the plasma. Using the Berry-curvature modified kinetic theory to incorporate the effect of the Abelian anomaly, we show that this chiral-imbalance leads to generation of hyper-magnetic field in the plasma in both the <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> and the collisionless regimes. It is shown that in the <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> regime the chiral-vorticity effect can generate finite vorticity in the plasma together with the magnetic field. Typical strength of the generated magnetic field is 10 ^ 27 Gauss at T∼ 80 TeV with the length scale 10 ^ 5 /T whereas the Hubble length scale is 10 ^ 13 /T. Further the instability can also generate the magnetic field of order 10 ^ 31 Gauss at typical length scale 10 /T. But there may not be any vorticity generation in this regime. We show that the estimated values of the magnetic field are consistent with the bounds obtained from present observations. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

In the present paper, the frequency down-chirped technique is employed to investigate the nitrous oxide-foreign gas collisions. We have demonstrated that the measurements may be characterized by the induced polarization <b>dominated</b> and <b>collision</b> <b>dominated</b> measurement limits.

40|$|The {{effect of}} poloidal {{asymmetry}} of impurities on impurity transport driven by electrostatic turbulence in tokamak plasmas is analyzed. It is {{found that in}} the presence of in–out asymmetric impurity populations the zero-flux impurity density gradient (the so-called peaking factor) is significantly reduced. A sign change in the impurity flux may occur if the asymmetry is sufficiently large. This may be a contributing reason for the observed outward convection of impurities {{in the presence of}} radio frequency heating. This paper extends a previous work (Fülöp and Moradi 2011 Phys. Plasmas 18 030703), by including the effect of ion parallel compressibility on the peaking factor, which is found to have a significant contribution in the presence of poloidal asymmetry. It is shown here that in the ion temperature gradient mode <b>dominated</b> <b>plasmas</b> the presence of an in–out poloidal asymmetry can lead to a negative impurity peaking factor, and it becomes more negative in regions with larger ion temperature gradients. In the trapped electron mode <b>dominated</b> <b>plasmas</b> an in–out poloidal asymmetry results in a strong reduction of the peaking factor; however, it remains positive for typical experimental parameters. Furthermore, it is shown that an up–down asymmetry reduces the peaking factor while an out–in asymmetry increases it...|$|R
