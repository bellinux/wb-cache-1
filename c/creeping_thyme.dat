And in their happiness they played at being children just as in the old days they had played at being grown-ups. Casting themselves down on the green, elastic, flower-sprinkled turf, they rolled one after the other down the smooth slopes of the terrace, the old [...] "shepherd's steps," [...] and by and by Johnnie, coming upon a patch of <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme,</b> rubbed his hands in the pale purple flowers, then rubbed her face to make it fragrant.|$|E
6000|$|This eternal [...] "swowing of a flode" [...] was {{the sound}} made by the {{circling}} stream of Oceanus, as he turns on his bed, washing {{the base of the}} White Rock, and the sands of the region of dreams. So we fleeted onwards till we came to marvellous lofty gates of black adamant, that rose before us like the steep side of a hill. On {{the left side of the}} gates we beheld a fountain flowing from beneath the roots of a white cypress-tree, and to this fountain my guide forbade me to draw near. [...] "There is another yonder," [...] he said, pointing to the right hand, [...] "a stream of still water that issues from the Lake of Memory, and there are guards who keep that stream from the lips of the profane. Go to them and speak thus: 'I am the child of earth and of the starry sky, yet heavenly is my lineage, and this yourselves know right well. But I am perishing with thirst, so give me speedily of that still water which floweth forth of the mere of Memory.' And they will give thee to drink of that spring divine, and then shalt thou dwell with the heroes and the blessed." [...] So I did as he said, and went before the guardians of the water. Now they were veiled, and their voices, when they answered me, seemed to come from far away. [...] "Thou comest to the pure, from the pure," [...] they said, [...] "and thou art a suppliant of holy Persephone. Happy and most blessed art thou, advance to the reward of the crown desirable, and be no longer mortal, but divine." [...] Then a darkness fell upon me, and lifted again like mist on the hills, and we found ourselves in the most beautiful place that can be conceived, a meadow of that short grass which grows on some shores beside the sea. There were large spaces of fine and solid turf, but, where the little streams flowed from the delicate-tinted distant mountains, there were narrow valleys full of all the flowers of a southern spring. Here grew narcissus and hyacinths, violets and <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme,</b> and crocus and the crimson rose, as they blossomed on the day when the milk-white bull carried off Europa. Beyond the level land beside the sea, between these coasts and the far-off hills, was a steep lonely rock, on which were set the shining temples of the Grecian faith. The blue seas that begirt the coasts were narrow, and ran like rivers between many islands not less fair than the country to which we were come, while other isles, each with its crest of clear-cut hills, lay westward, far away, and receding into the place of the sunset. Then I recognized the Fortunate Islands spoken of by Pindar, and the paradise of the Greeks. [...] "Round these the ocean breezes blow and golden flowers are glowing, some from the land on trees of splendour, and some the water feedeth, with wreaths whereof they entwine their hands." [...] {124} And, as Pindar says again, [...] "for them shineth below the strength of the sun, while in our world it is night, and the space of crimson-flowered meadows before their city is full of the shade of frankincense-trees and of fruits of gold. And some in horses and in bodily feats, and some in dice, and some in harp-playing have delight, and among them thriveth all fair flowering bliss; and fragrance ever streameth through the lovely land as they mingle incense of every kind upon the altars of the gods." [...] In this beautiful country I took great delight, now watching the young men leaping and running (and they were marvellously good over a short distance of ground), now sitting in a chariot whereto were harnessed steeds swifter than the wind, like those that, Homer says, [...] "the gods gave, glorious gifts, to Peleus." [...] And the people, young and old, received me kindly, welcoming me in their Greek speech, which was like the sound of music. And because I had ever been a lover of them and of their tongue, my ears were opened to understand them, though they spoke not Greek as we read it. Now when I had beheld many of the marvels of the Fortunate Islands, and had sat at meat with those kind hosts (though I only made semblance to eat of what they placed before me), and had seen the face of Rhadamanthus of the golden hair, who is the lord of that country, my friends told me that there was come among them one of my own nation who seemed most sad and sorrowful, and they could make him no mirth. Then they carried me to a house in a grove, and all around it a fair garden, and a well in the midst.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} amount of confusion in the naming of thymes. Many nurseries use common names rather than the binomial name, which can lead to confusion. For example golden thyme, lemon thyme and <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme</b> can all refer to more than one cultivar. There is some confusion over the naming and taxonomy of some species, and Margaret Easter (who holds the NCCPG National Plant Collection of thymes in the UK) has compiled a list of synonyms for cultivated species and cultivars.|$|E
50|$|Some lawns are {{replaced}} with low ground covers, such as <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme,</b> camomile, Lippia, purple flowering Mazus, grey Dymondia, creeping sedums, and creeping jenny.An {{example of this}} is the floral lawn in Avondale Park. Other alternatives to lawns include meadows, drought-tolerant xeriscape gardens, natural landscapes, native plant habitat gardens, paved Spanish courtyard and patio gardens, butterfly gardens, rain gardens, tapestry lawn and kitchen gardens. Trees and shrubs in close proximity to lawns provide habitat for birds in traditional, cottage and wildlife gardens.|$|E
50|$|Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme, <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme)</b> is an {{important}} nectar source plant for honeybees. All thyme species are nectar sources, but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty, rocky soils in southern Europe (both Greece and Malta are especially famous for wild thyme honey) and North Africa, {{as well as in}} similar landscapes in the Berkshire and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US. The lowest growing of the widely used thyme is good for walkways.It is also {{an important}} caterpillar food plant for large and common blue butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Thymus serpyllum, {{known by}} the common names of Breckland thyme, Breckland wild thyme, wild thyme, <b>creeping</b> <b>thyme,</b> or elfin thyme, is a species of {{flowering}} plant in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to most of Europe and North Africa. It is a low, usually prostrate subshrub growing to 2 cm tall with creeping stems up to 10 cm long. The oval evergreen leaves are 3-8 mm long. The strongly scented flowers are either lilac, pink-purple, magenta, or a rare white, all 4-6 mm long and produced in clusters. The hardy plant tolerates some pedestrian traffic and produces odors ranging from heavily herbal to lightly lemon, depending on the variety.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} done during {{november}} 2016 on strongyls eggs from feces from {{a total of}} 28 horses in Tulcea county, C. A. Rosetti locality in the Danube Delta. To determine the degree of infestation was used the method McMaster and Stoll (adapted for quantitative larvohelmintology). The tests of hatching eggs (egg hatching assay - EHA) and larval development (larvae development assay - LDA) were made, using as active substances herbal decoctions and hydro-alcoholic solutions made from well known anthelmintic plants. One decoction and two hydro-alcoholic extracts were tested, Hippophae rhamnoides (sea buckthorn) respectively Thymus serpyllum (<b>creeping</b> <b>thyme)</b> and Arthemisia absinthium (wormwood). In order to achieve the two tests for therapeutic efficacy of the tested products were obtained six serial dilutions with concentrations of 50...|$|E
