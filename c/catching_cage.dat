5|$|In 2015 Massachusetts banned <b>catching,</b> <b>cage</b> diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its {{significant}} and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.|$|E
5000|$|Pisthetaerus and Euelpides {{emerge from}} the Hoopoe's bower {{laughing}} at each other's unconvincing resemblance to a bird. After discussion, they name the city-in-the-sky Nubicuculia, or literally [...] "cloud-cuckoo-land" [...] (Νεφελοκοκκυγία), and then Pisthetaerus begins {{to take charge of}} things, ordering his friend to oversee the building of the city walls while he organizes and leads a religious service in honour of birds as the new gods. During this service, he is pestered by a variety of unwelcome visitors including a young versifier out to hire himself to the new city as its official poet, an oracle-monger with prophecies for sale, a famous geometer, Meton, offering a set of town-plans, an imperial inspector from Athens with an eye for a quick profit, and a statute-seller trying to peddle a set of laws originally written for a remote, barely-heard-of town called Olophyx. Pisthetaerus chases off all these intruders and then retires indoors to finish the religious service. The birds of the Chorus step forward for another parabasis. They promulgate laws forbidding crimes against their kind (such as <b>catching,</b> <b>caging,</b> stuffing, or eating them) and they end by advising the festival judges to award them first place or risk getting defecated on.|$|R
500|$|In a 1960s working-class {{neighborhood}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{a teenage boy}} nicknamed [...] "Birdy" [...] befriends his next-door neighbor Al Columbato, and relates to him his fascination with birds {{and their ability to}} fly. The two begin pursuing Birdy's hobby of <b>catching</b> pigeons and <b>caging</b> them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents' home. One night, they climb atop a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary.|$|R
