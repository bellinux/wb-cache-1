500|$|In The Observer, Hilary Spurling {{called the}} book [...] "a scathing {{indictment}} of the British bread industry" [...] and also [...] "a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns".

[...] The Times said, [...] "This is probably Mrs. David's most academic work yet.

500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a toy dog, where they are set up for a trap to eat <b>crumpets</b> with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the <b>crumpets</b> (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her to take care of them. She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or a tiny little smidgen of respect". They attempt to console her, but World gasses them and they fall asleep. When they awaken, they find themselves in a fake version of Foster's created by World, who shrank them into it.|$|E
500|$|Keable's novels won him immense {{international}} {{popularity and}} intense controversy. His novels were equated with Mrs Humphry Ward's Robert Elsmere, a similarly scandalous tale of religious doubt among the clergy published 40 years earlier: H.D.A. Major, {{editor of the}} Modern Churchman magazine, made this comparison with respect to Keable's Peradventure, noting [...] "It is slighter, but it has need to be. The twentieth century novel reader is intellectually and morally lighter than the nineteenth." [...] Reporting his death, the Melbourne Argus attributed the best-selling popularity of Keable's novels to the licentiousness of their contents: [...] "they have no literary value". His former college acquaintance James later wrote that [...] "his friends sought to dissuade him from publication. The transition from the beautiful book on The Loneliness of Christ (1914) – of his Central African period – to Simon Called Peter (1921) came as a great shock to all who had known and loved him in earlier days." [...] Where Rosemary Grimble calls Keable's novels [...] "splendidly erotic", a Birmingham News correspondent in Birmingham, Alabama, accused Keable of [...] "fashioning abnormalities". Other critics called his success [...] "undeserved" [...] and attributed it to prurience {{on the part of}} his readers. Reviewers also suggested that the contrast between Keable's ecclesiastical background and the frank, often sexual, content of his novels attracted curiosity in itself. A Time columnist, [...] "J.F.", expressed the fascination of this disconnect overtly, responding to a piece titled [...] "The censorship of thought" [...] that Keable had contributed to a 1922 volume, Nonsenseorship (sic), after Simon Called Peters publication had made him notorious. [...] "Surely, here is a modern personality worth the study of the psychologists," [...] J.F. wrote, noting the romance of Keable's unusual circumstances: [...] "From a quiet English clergyman to the author of a sensational best-seller who has taken up his permanent residence in the South Seas seems a long jump." [...] In person, he said, Keable was the antithesis of his novels' striking directness: He does not impress one as a radical gentleman. There is nothing to suggest the resigned clergyman, author of books marked by their sex frankness and melodrama. In fact, his scholarly bearing and gentleness mark him rather as the country curate, who should be acting as a character in a novel by May Sinclair and passing out <b>crumpets</b> to maiden ladies in a decorous drawing-room instead of writing of Tahitian damsels as he has done in his new novel, Numerous Treasure.|$|E

2500|$|Other foods {{associated}} with the county include: Yorkshire curd tart, a curd tart recipe with rosewater; Parkin, a sweet ginger cake which is different from standard ginger cakes in that it includes oatmeal and treacle; and Wensleydale cheese, a cheese made with milk from Wensleydale and often eaten as an accompaniment to sweet foods. The beverage ginger beer, flavoured with ginger, came from Yorkshire and has existed since the mid 18th century. Liquorice sweet was first created by George Dunhill from Pontefract, who in the 1760s thought to mix the liquorice plant with sugar. Yorkshire {{and in particular the}} city of York played a prominent role in the confectionery industry, with chocolate factories owned by companies such as Rowntree's, Terry's and Thorntons inventing many of Britain's most popular sweets. Another traditional Yorkshire food is pikelets which are similar to <b>crumpets</b> but much thinner. [...] The Rhubarb Triangle is a location within Yorkshire which supplies most of the rhubarb to locals.|$|E

He appreciated English beer, taken regularly and moderately, despised drinkers of lager and wrote about an imagined, ideal British pub in his 1946 English Standard article, [...] "The Moon Under Water".

50|$|A Scottish <b>crumpet</b> is {{essentially}} a pancake cooked {{in a slightly different}} way, made from the same ingredients as a Scotch pancake, and is about 180 mm diameter and 8 mm thick. They are available plain, or as a fruit <b>crumpet</b> with raisins baked in, usually fried in a pan and served with a fried breakfast - they are also sometimes served with butter and jam. The ingredients include a leavening agent, usually baking powder, and different proportions of eggs, flour, and milk which create a thin batter. Unlike a pancake, they are cooked to brown on one side only, resulting in a smooth darker side where it has been heated by the griddle, then lightly cooked on the other side which has holes where bubbles have risen to the surface during cooking. It bears little resemblance to the English <b>crumpet.</b>|$|R
