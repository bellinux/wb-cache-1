5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> form, which is single-stage <b>crystal</b> <b>growth.</b> Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E
5|$|After he had {{completed}} his doctoral study, {{he was offered}} a job at EG Corporation Energy Measurements in Goleta, California, to work on <b>crystal</b> <b>growth.</b> EG was a defense contractor of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered years of research and management experience {{in the preparation of}} crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors. During his work at EG, Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> experiments in space, which NASA approved.|$|E

5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor <b>Crystal</b> <b>Growth</b> System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E

5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|It {{was ever}} {{reported}} in a communication of this journal that the large crystal grains having “bamboo leaf-like (BL) ” morphology were produced by a rapid heating of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) from the mesophase. In order to optimize the condition to generate the BL crystals, heating rate effects on the crystallization behavior from the mesophase of iPP have been studied by utilizing a de-polarized light transmission (DPLT) method. The DPLT sensitively detected not only the cold crystallization from the mesophase around 100 – 120 °C but also the <b>crystal</b> grain <b>growth</b> in a narrow temperature region just below the melting temperature.

25|$|Several {{strategies}} {{exist for}} constructing homochiral MOFs. Crystallization of homochiral MOFs via self-resolution from achiral linker ligands {{is one of}} the way to accomplish such a goal. However, the resulting bulk samples contain both enantiomorphs and are racemic. Aoyama and coworkers successfully obtained homochiral MOFs in the bulk from achiral ligands by carefully controlling nucleation in the <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> process. Zheng and coworkers reported the synthesis of homochiral MOFs from achiral ligands by chemically manipulating the statistical fluctuation of the formation of enantiomeric pairs of crystals. Growing MOF crystals under chiral influences is another approach to obtain homochiral MOFs using achiral linker ligands. Rosseinsky and coworkers have introduced a chiral coligand to direct the formation of homochiral MOFs by controlling the handedness of the helices during the <b>crystal</b> <b>growth.</b> Morris and coworkers utilized ionic liquid with chiral cations as reaction media for synthesizing MOFs, and obtained homochiral MOFs. The most straightforward and rational strategy for synthesizing homochiral MOFs is, however, to use the readily available chiral linker ligands for their construction.|$|E
25|$|Impurity {{concentrations}} can {{be controlled}} by <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> or direct addition of impurities to the crystal solutions. Although impurities in the silver bromide lattice are necessary to encourage Frenkel defect formation, studies by Hamilton have shown that above a specific concentration of impurities, the numbers of defects of interstitial silver ions and positive kinks reduce sharply by several orders of magnitude. After this point, only silver-ion vacancy defects, which actually increase by several orders of magnitude, are prominent.|$|E
25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a {{solid material}} whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.
