The <b>CONOP</b> is used by special operations forces (SOF) and other units to gain concurrence for an operation by its higher headquarters. It is typically a PowerPoint slide presentation submitted by a Special Forces Operational Detachment-Alpha (SFODA) or another similar combat unit in order to describe the type of operation, the operations level of risk, the assets required to conduct the operation, and when the operation is to take place. Concurrence can typically take up to 72 hours for a high-risk operation or up to 48 hours for a medium-risk operation after the <b>CONOP</b> is submitted through the chain of command.

Paleoenvironmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean are inferred from changes in fossil diatom abundance, preservation, and assemblage composition. A robust, new age model for Holes 744 A and 744 B is constructed using Constrained Optimization (<b>CONOP)</b> model ages for diatom biostratigraphic datum levels and new magnetic polarity data, which enables assessment of a nearly continuous record of paleoenvironmental change from ~ 20. 25 to 13. 75 Ma, and the dating of specific paleoenvironmental events identified in the diatom record. This study spans stratigraphically from the lowest occurrence of Thalassiosria spinosa var. aspinosa (~ 20. 26 Ma) up to the lowest occurrence of Nitzschia denticuloides (~ 13. 73 Ma), including the interval known as the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) ~ 17 to 15 Ma. Two stratigraphic breaks are recognized at Site 744 during the study interval. Ages interpreted for diatom events at Site 744 confirm the utility of <b>CONOP</b> modeled ages and indentify that Total Range Model and Hybrid Range Model ages presented the greatest utility in age model development at this site.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{goal of the}} Joint Synthetic Battlespace Experiment (JDPE) is {{to prove}} the {{underlying}} concept of the Joint Synthetic Battlespace (JSB) {{in the context of}} the warfighters, i. e., USAF operational users. The JSB has been conceptualized and prototyped to support the transforming USAF into a capability oriented standard, such as Global Strike Task Forces (GSTF), rather than the current weapon platform centric. The new capability can only be realized by synergistic integration of existing and new weapons/C 2 /ISR systems. JSB plans on being the very tool for <b>CONOP</b> development, R&D, acquisition, training, mission planning, rehearsal, and even disposal of component systems in the future USAF.

40|$|Conodonts {{are one of}} the stratigraphically most {{important}} fossil groups in the Silurian Period. We examine the regional diversity dynamics of the Llandovery condonts on the Upper Yangtze Platform. The data set of 41 species from seven sections is compiled from the Geobiodiversity Database. Four measures of taxonomic richness based on zonal counting are used to demonstrate the conodont diversity change. The <b>CONOP</b> (Constrained optimization) program is used to build up a more precise composite sequence, which provides the data for comparative analysis of diversity change. Conodont richness keeps growing from the Ozarkodina aff.  hassi Zone through the Ozarkodina obesa Zone to the Ozarkodina guizhouensis Zone and reaches a peak at the fourth zone, the Pterospathodus eopennatus Zone. This significant growth was followed by a rapid decrease, which probably represents an extinction in the mid-Telychian.

We show how {{the development of a}} new unparalleled weapon system or platform will evoke a response by potential adversaries, based on capabilities and asset investment, by unconventional means. The Arsenal Ship is a formidable threat, yet is vulnerable relative to other high value. units. These reasons make it an inviting target across the spectrum of conflict. This thesis will describe threats that are usually overlooked and examine the Arsenal Ship's vulnerability to them.

40|$|Procedures used {{to define}} an {{international}} chronostratigraphic stage boundary and to locate and ratify a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) are outlined. A majority of current GSSPs use biostratigraphic data as primary markers with no reference to any physico-chemical markers, despite the International Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification (ISSC) suggestion that such markers should be included if possible. It is argued that such definitions will not produce the high-precision Phanerozoic time scale necessary to understand such phenomena as pre-Pleistocene ice ages and global climate change. It is strongly recommended that all GSSPs should have physico-chemical markers {{as an integral part}} of their guiding criteria, and where such markers cannot be found, the GSSP should be relocated. The methods and approach embodied in oceanic stratigraphy – coring, logging, analysing and archiving of drill sites by numerous experts using a wide range of methods – could usefully serve as a scientific model for the analysis and archiving of GSSPs, all of which are on the present-day continents. The incorporation of many more stratigraphic sections into GSSP studies, the application of physico-chemical methods, and the replacement of old U–Pb dates by newer CA-TIMS U–Pb dates, together with the use of constrained optimization (<b>CONOP)</b> programs that produce a calendar of events from many sections, should lead to much more precise timescales for pre-Cenozoic time than are currently available. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} biostratigraphic and radiometric calibration {{is presented}} for the Pennsylvanian through Early Permian global time scale, based upon high-precision, isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometer (ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon ages for interstratified ash {{beds in the}} parastratotype sections of the southern Urals of Russia. Twenty-four ash-bed ages in three outer ramp and basinal sections of the Pre-Uralian foredeep bracket the biotic definitions of global stages and regional substages {{from the base of}} the Upper Pennsylvanian Kasimovian Stage to the base of the Lower Permian Artinskian Stage; four additional ash-bed ages in two sections of the eastern slope of the Urals constrain the global Bashkirian and Serpukhovian Stages. Quantitative stratigraphic methods (<b>CONOP</b> 9) are applied to a compilation of over 2000 bioevents in 22 stratigraphic sections supplemented by our dated volcanic horizons to refine the Pennsylvanian–Early Permian global time scale. Significant shifts in the duration of several stages are demonstrated, ranging from one to six million years, compared with prior estimates. The unprecedented density of radiometric calibration points for the Pennsylvanian–Permian transition provides a high-resolution (∼ 0. 1 -Ma) global chronostratigraphic standard for testing and improving biostratigraphic correlations across Euramerica. We integrate radiometric ages, biostratigraphic correlation, and cyclostratigraphic tuning of major cyclothems to the long-period (404 -ka) eccentricity cycle to elucidate the tempo, magnitude, and forcing of eustatic changes and cyclothemic deposition associated with the waxing and waning of Gondwanan ice sheets, and establish a pan-Euramerican chronostratigraphic framework for most of Pennsylvanian and Early Permian time...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the end-Permian mass {{extinction}} have suggested {{a variety of}} patterns from a single catastrophic event to multiple phases. But most of these analyses {{have been based on}} fossil distributions from single localities. Although single sections may simplify the interpretation of species diversity, they are susceptible to bias from stratigraphic incompleteness and facies control of preservation. Here we use a data set of 1450 species from 18 fossiliferous sections in different paleoenvironmental settings across South China and the northern peri-Gondwanan region, and integrate it with high-precision geochronologic data to evaluate the rapidity of the largest Phanerozoic {{mass extinction}}. To reduce the Signor-Lipps effect, we applied constrained optimization (<b>CONOP)</b> to search for an optimal sequence of first and last occurrence datums for all species and generate a composite biodiversity pattern based on multiple sections. This analysis indicates that an abrupt extinction of 62 % of species took place within 200 Kyr. The onset of the sudden extinction is around 252. 3 Ma, just below Bed 25 at the Meishan section. Taxon turnover and diversification rates suggest a deterioration of the living conditions nearly 1. 2 Myr before the sudden extinction. The magnitude of the extinction was such that there was no immediate biotic recovery. Prior suggestions of highly variable, multi-phased extinction patterns reflect the impact of the Signor-Lipps effect and facies-dependent occurrences, and are not supported following appropriate statistical treatment of this larger data set...|$|R
