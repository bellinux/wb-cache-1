Existing techniques rely on either visible deposits or hidden (latent) fingerprints resulting from the transfer of residues from the finger to the surface.

It is extremely difficult to establish a timeline, from fingerprint evidence alone. We present the capability of a new technique which images the electrical charge deposited by tribocharging when a finger contacts an electrically insulated surface. The method is applicable to insulating surfaces and has been tested on PVC, PTFE, Acetate and PVDF sheets. The latent electrostatic charge pattern is detected using a novel, microscopic, electric potential sensor. The sensor is capable of imaging static charge distributions non-invasively, with no discharging effect on the sample.

Both nanomembranes with a diffuse charge and with local charges are considered (in both cases, two surface charge densities are considered, - 0. 9 e/nm(2) and - 1. 8 e/nm(2)). For all nanomembranes, significant layering of water and ions {{in the vicinity of}} the nanomembrane surface is observed. While the distribution of water and chloride ions is nearly insensitive to the nanomembrane charge and type, the arrangement of sodium cations within the nanomembrane depends on the system being considered.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{flat panel}} imager (FPI) with programmable avalanche gain and field emitter array (FEA) readout {{is being investigated}} for low-dose and high resolution x-ray imaging. It is made by optically coupling a structured x-ray scintillator, e. g., thallium (Tl) doped cesium iodide (CsI), to an amorphous selenium (a-Se) avalanche photoconductor called high-gain avalanche rushing amorphous photoconductor (HARP). The <b>charge</b> <b>image</b> created by the scintillator∕HARP (SHARP) combination is read out by the electron beams emitted from the FEA. The proposed detector is called scintillator avalanche photoconductor with high resolution emitter readout (SAPHIRE). The programmable avalanche gain of HARP can improve the low dose performance of indirect FPI while the FEA {{can be made with}} pixel sizes down to 50 μm. Because of the avalanche gain, a high resolution type of CsI (Tl), which has not been widely used in indirect FPI due to its lower light output, can be used to improve the high spatial frequency performance. The purpose of the present article is to investigate the factors affecting the spatial resolution of SAPHIRE. Since the resolution performance of the SHARP combination has been well studied, the focus of the present work is on the inherent resolution of the FEA readout method. The lateral spread of the electron beam emitted from a 50 μm× 50 μm pixel FEA was investigated with two different electron-optical designs: mesh-electrode-only and electrostatic focusing. Our results showed that electrostatic focusing can limit the lateral spread of electron beams to within the pixel size of down to 50 μm. Since electrostatic focusing is essentially independent of signal intensity, it will provide excellent spatial uniformity...|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 The advances in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology {{have led to}} the integration of all components of electronic system into a single integrated circuit. Ultra-low power circuit techniques have reduced the power consumption of circuits. Moreover, solar cells with improved efficiency can be integrated on chip to harvest energy from sunlight. As a result of all the above, a new class of miniaturized electronic systems known as self-powered system on a chip has emerged. There is an increasing research interest in the area of self-powered devices which provide cost-effective solutions especially when these devices are used in the areas that changing or replacing batteries is too costly. Therefore, image compression and energy harvesting are studied in this dissertation. The integration of energy harvesting, image compression, and an image sensor on the same chip provides the energy source to charge a battery, reduces the data rate, and improves the performance of wireless image sensors. Integrated circuits of image compression, solar energy harvesting, and image sensors are studied, designed, and analyzed in this work. In this dissertation, a hybrid image sensor that can perform the tasks of sensing and energy harvesting is presented. Photodiodes of hybrid image sensor can be programmed as image sensors or energy harvesting cells. The hybrid image sensor can harvest energy in between frames, in sleep mode, and even when it is taking images. When sensing images and harvesting energy are both needed at the same time, some pixels have to work as sensing pixels, and the others have to work as solar cells. Since some pixels are devoted to harvest energy, the resolution of the image will be reduced. To preserve the resolution or to keep the fair resolution when a lot of energy collection is needed, image reconstruction algorithms and compressive sensing theory provide solutions to achieve a good image quality. On the other hand, when the battery has enough <b>charge,</b> <b>image</b> compression comes into the picture. Multiresolution decomposition image compression provides a way to compress image data {{in order to reduce the}} energy need from data transmission. The solution provided in this dissertation not only harvests energy but also saves energy resulting long lasting wireless sensors. The problem was first studied at the system level to identify the best system-level configuration which was then implemented on silicon. As a proof of concept, a 32 x 32 array of hybrid image sensor, a 32 x 32 array of image sensor with multiresolution decomposition compression, and a compressive sensing converter have been designed and fabricated in a standard 0. 5 [micrometer] CMOS process. Printed circuit broads also have been designed to test and verify the proposed and fabricated chips. VHDL and Matlab codes were written to generate the proper signals to control, and read out data from chips. Image processing and recovery were carried out in Matlab. DC-DC converters were designed to boost the inherently low voltage output of the photodiodes. The DC-DC converter has also been improved to increase the efficiency of power transformation.
