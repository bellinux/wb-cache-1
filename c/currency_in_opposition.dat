Soon afterwards, Horam made a lateral move to the Department of Health where {{he served as a}} junior minister {{for the duration of the}} Major Government. Horam gained some notoriety during the 1997 general election when he was the first member of the Major Government to come out publicly against joining a single <b>currency.</b> <b>In</b> <b>opposition,</b> Horam served as the first Chairman of the House Environmental Audit Select Committee from 1997-2004. In the 2005 general election, he increased his majority to 4,947, a significant increase over his narrow victory of only 269 votes in 2001 over Liberal Democrat Chris Maines.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} to model the daily series of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> {{circulation}} <b>in</b> Turkey. The <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation is one of the most significant factors influencing the liquidity of the Turkish banking system. Therefore, the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation has to be forecasted as accurately as possible. The <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation displays an increasing long-term trend and strong seasonal factors which can be forecasted. This paper introduces the ARIMA-based approach to model seasonality in daily time series and evaluates the forecasting performance of the model. The results indicate that the forecasting performance of the model is better than the expert judgments both in the short-term and the long-term. <b>Currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation, Liquidity management, Time series models, Seasonality...|$|R

40|$|Although {{financial}} dollarization {{is widely}} observed in developing countries, {{there is no}} clear evidence of how banks deal with multiple <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> their operation. We conducted a survey on Cambodian financial institutions and collected financial data at bank- and branch-level, in order to reveal the actual situation of Cambodian financial dollarization. We found that there were differences in shares of FX currency deposit and loans between commercial banks (CBs) and microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDIs). MDIs are likely to have more local <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> their cash on hand, loans, deposits, and borrowings, while CBs rely mostly on FX <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> intermediation. Furthermore, although it is subtle, it can be observed that the share of local <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> deposits has increased over the period of 2009 - 2013 in the cases both of CBs and MDIs. However, CBs did not allocate KHR funds, although they had large excess KHR funds in Phnom Penh, the capital city. Moreover, FX <b>currency</b> shares <b>in</b> MDIs' loans have been increasing despite the increase of KHR <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> their deposits. Finally, we found that there were regional differences in dollarization of deposits and loans. In particular, branches in rural areas tend to extend more local <b>currency</b> loans than <b>in</b> Phnom Penh...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} factors influencing the liquidity of the financial market is the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation. Although the central bank is responsible for the distribution of the currency it cannot assess the demand for the currency, as that demand is influenced by the non-banking sector. Therefore, the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation has to be forecasted. This paper introduces a feedforward structured neural network model and discusses its applicability to the forecasting of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> circulation. The forecasting performance of the new neural network model is compared with an ARIMA model. The results indicate that the performance of the neural network model is better and that both models might be applied at least as supportive tools for liquidity forecasting.
