In this picture the artists seems to have intended to accentuate the caricatural aspects of the behavior of the feasting satyrs. Architecture, landscape and sky are used to express the internal state of the various figures. Bizarre, crumbling remnants of sublime architecture provide the backdrop for the funny goings-on of the satyrs. In rhythmic repetition three successively staggered, large arches with feathery vegetation divide the space of the composition. The center of the space is occupied by a vine-covered, broken <b>column</b> <b>shaft.</b> The figures seem almost reduced to casual narration and yet their turbulence and drunkenness are reflected in the moving, bizarre ruins. The viewer is kept at a distance from the carousing satyrs. One sleeping drunkard on the left and another with a goat on the right only show their bare backsides. A third satyr who clings to the large <b>column</b> <b>shaft</b> appears to have no good intentions.

40|$|Five ancient shipwrecks {{have been}} found in the sea off Croton, in {{southern}} Italy, each carrying a marble cargo composed of massive blocks, <b>column</b> <b>shafts,</b> and smaller artifacts. Three of them were located while surveying the seafloor with a multibeam sonar, and the remaining two with the help of divers, in the summers of 2005 and 2006. Two of the marble carriers are located in the bay of Punta Scifo and, therefore, are identified as the Punta Scifo A and Punta Scifo B shipwrecks, the remaining three take their names from the closest promontories: Punta Cicala, Capo Cimiti, and Capo Bianco. The Punta Scifo A shipwreck was chosen as the main focus of this work because it contains a unique assemblage of marble artifacts; including 13 basins, 15 stands decorated with lions? paws, 16 <b>column</b> <b>shafts,</b> 14 blocks, 6 statue pedestals, and one statuette of Eros and Psyche. Moreover, because the original discovery dates back to 1908, and in 1915 salvors raised 150 tons of marble artifacts, much information was in danger of being lost. Consular inscriptions on the Punta Scifo A?s marble blocks and <b>column</b> <b>shafts</b> date the shipwreck to the early third century A. D. The merchantman was ca. 30 m long and 10 m wide, with a cargo of marble items weighting ca. 200 tons. The merchantman was loaded with its marble cargo in Asia Minor: all the items carried on board came from the quarries of Proconnesus and Docimium. The most likely point of departure was either Epheus or Miletus. While sailing toward the Strait of Messina, it is likely that a Grecale or Levante storm broke, and the helmsman was forced to look for shelter in the protected bay of Punta Scifo. Due to a change in wind direction a southerly Scirocco storm caused the ship to sink. Since the entire coastline south of Croton is totally unprotected to the south, there was no way for the crew to save their ship. Where the Punta Scifo A merchantman was destined remains unknown, although Rome appears to be a likely candidate...|$|R
