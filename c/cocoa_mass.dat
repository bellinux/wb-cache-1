40|$|Chocolate {{antioxidant}} {{properties are}} often claimed; however, they are frequently {{different from the}} parent natural sources due to the industry or artisan transformation. In particular, antioxidant property of chocolate and cocoa are not adequately taken into consideration by consumers who normally make use of this food just for its flavor and taste properties. In this study, we have investigated the antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of <b>cocoa</b> nibs, <b>cocoa</b> <b>masses,</b> and corresponding chocolate bars with different percentages of cocoa from different origins. The antioxidant capacity of the different samples was measured by two different assays [1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant of potency (FRAP) tests]. The Folin–Ciocalteu reagent {{was used to assess}} the total phenolic content.

40|$|The {{study was}} a survey to {{investigate}} farmers’ management practices to ensure quality of cocoa beans in the Upper Denkyira District of Ghana. Forty cocoa farmers {{were randomly selected from}} four communities in the district and interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. The study showed that the major problems affecting the quality of cocoa beans in the district were financial constraints, pests and diseases, high cost of spraying and incidence of weeds. These accounted for 91. 5 % of the problems affecting the quality of cocoa beans. The main practices adopted by farmers to ensure high quality cocoa beans were proper drying, regular spraying and proper fermentation. In order to enhance the quality cocoa beans, farmers recommended the provision of credit to farmers, education on post-harvest management practices, and provision of input subsidies. It was concluded that farmers were conversant with the proper management practices and applied very strict measures to ensure quality cocoa beans. Farmers’ good management practices accounted for the quality premium enjoyed by the country on the international market. The study recommended that the <b>mass</b> <b>cocoa</b> spraying exercise should be extended to cover all farmers who currently do not benefit to reduce the effects of pests and diseases...|$|R
30|$|The high {{incidence}} of cocoa insect pests and diseases, low soil fertility and bad weather/poor climate (erratic rainfall and long drought spills, strong winds, etc.) results in increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, and planting of improved cocoa varieties by farmers in the study area. However, the farmers indicated {{that the government of}} Ghana interventions—supply of high-yielding and disease resistant cocoa seedlings, distribution of fertilizers and mass spraying (spraying of cocoa farms with pesticides) were totally inadequate to revive the sector. For instance, the farmers indicated that cocoa farms in the district are to be sprayed four times a year, between July and November under the Government of Ghana <b>mass</b> <b>cocoa</b> spraying Programme with Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) approved pesticides. However, in the year of the study, only 51.7  % had their farms sprayed once while only 6.9  % of the farmers had their farms sprayed four times. According to Aneani et al. (2012) and Danso-Abbeam et al. (2014), spraying frequency of the ‘mass spraying exercise’ is not adequate and cocoa farmers are expected to do additional spraying. This situation made farmers in the study area to purchase pesticides from the open market which they claim are very expensive, hence, impacting on cocoa production. This finding confirmed the study by Dormon et al. (2004) which reported that most cocoa farmers in Ghana are not able to control insect pests and diseases on their farms due to high cost of pesticides, spraying equipment and labour (sprayers) resulting in poor yield and in some cases total destruction of cocoa trees. Some of the farmers indicated that they received their fertilizer and pesticide supplies from Ghana Cocoa Board late in the previous year of this study.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{chocolate}} first made its way to Germany, after the ladies of the upper classes in Spain, Italy and France had long been used to a daily cup of hot chocolate. When the Dutchman Coenraad Johannes van Houten managed to press out the <b>cocoa</b> <b>mass,</b> the additional ingredients cocoa butter and cocoa powder were created. The chocolate thinned with cocoa butter was used to pour a variety of figures, and painting cakes with cocoa powder became popular. The trade of the “Chocolatier”, a Konditor specialised in working with chocolate, was born. Chocolate now {{played a major role in}} the Konditorei. A good example is the chocolate cake created by Franz Sacher, who was the chocolate cook for Klemens von Metternich in Vienna in 1832.|$|E
50|$|Cocoa solids are {{a mixture}} of many {{substances}} remaining after cocoa butter is extracted from cacao beans. When sold as an end product, {{it may also be}} called cocoa powder or cocoa. Cocoa solids are a key ingredient of chocolate, chocolate syrup, and chocolate confections. In contrast, the fatty component of chocolate is cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is 50% to 57% of the weight of cocoa beans and gives chocolate its characteristic melting properties. Cocoa liquor or <b>cocoa</b> <b>mass</b> is a paste of roasted cocoa beans with cocoa butter and solids in their natural proportions. Recipes for chocolate require the addition of extra cocoa butter to cocoa liquor, leading to a cocoa solids surplus and thus a relatively cheap supply of cocoa powder. This contrasts with the earliest European usage of cocoa where, before milk and dark chocolate was popularized, cocoa powder was the primary product and cocoa butter {{was little more than a}} waste product.|$|E
40|$|Chocolate {{is one of}} {{the foods}} that may contain cadmium. Cadmium can cause kidney damage in humans and when inhaled, it is deemed to be carcinogenic. So far there are no legally binding maximum levels for cadmium in {{chocolate}} either on the EU level or in Germany. The European maximum levels for heavy metals in food are currently being revised. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has suggested a maximum level for cadmium in chocolate after assessing possible cadmium intake from chocolate consumption and its health consequences. The cocoa content in chocolate varies. In the case of plain chocolate, the cocoa content is between 50 and 99 %. The main components of chocolate are ground cocoa beans that are called the <b>cocoa</b> <b>mass.</b> Depending {{on the state of the}} soil, cocoa beans and the <b>cocoa</b> <b>mass</b> made from it may contain very different levels of cadmium. Chocolate with a high <b>cocoa</b> <b>mass</b> proportion in particular, like plain chocolate, may contain high levels of cadmium. Consumers mainly ingest cadmium orally from the contaminated food and inhalationally from cigarette smoke. The provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of cadmium that can be taken in daily over a lifetime without any health risks established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is 0. 007 milligram per kilogram body weight. Based on exposure estimations, BfR recommends establishing a maximum level for cadmium in chocolate of between 0. 1 and 0. 3 milligram per kilogram...|$|E
