The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court.

60|$|Wrayson, {{from his}} seat in the {{opposite}} corner of the cab, watched her with growing sympathy. In her very <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> <b>type,</b> she represented so naturally a real and living unit of humanity. Her poor commonplace prettiness {{was already on the}} wane, stamped out by the fear and trouble of the last few months. Yet inane though her features, lacking altogether strength or distinction, there was stamped into them something of that dumb, dog-like fidelity to some object which redeemed them from utter insignificance. Wrayson, as he watched her, found himself thinking more kindly of the dead man himself. In his vulgar, selfish way, he had probably been kind to her: he must have done something to have kindled this flame of dogged, persevering affection. Already he scarcely doubted that Morris Barnes and Augustus Howard had been the same person. Within a very few minutes of her entering the flats there remained no doubt at all. With a low moan, like a dumb animal mortally hurt, she sank down upon the nearest chair, clasping the photograph which Sydney Barnes had passed her in her hands.|$|E

40|$|Subject of this {{dissertation}} is conformity {{of goods}} in sales contracts. The {{responsibilities of the}} seller concerning quality are examined. Part I consists of two chapters. Chapter 1 provides {{an introduction to the}} subject, discussing different perspectives on conformity, and applicability of the concept of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> different <b>types</b> of sales. Chapter 2 discusses inter alia the question whether the "warranty or quality" is based on the law or whether it is contractual in nature. An overview of Dutch legal literature is provided. In Part II criteria for conformity are examined under Dutch law (Chapter 3), and uniform law and English law (Chapter 4). Part III deals with conformity and warranties. The law under the old Dutch Civil Code (Chapter 6) and the new Dutch Civil Code (Chapter 7) is discussed. Chapter 8 provides the conclusions of the research.

6000|$|We {{have seen}} {{that the members of}} the same class, {{independently}} of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term [...] "unity of type;" [...] or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under the general term of Morphology. This {{is one of the most}} interesting departments of natural history, and may almost be said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking instance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted for bounding over the open plains--those of the climbing, leaf-eating koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees--those of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots--and those of some other Australian marsupials--should all be constructed on the same extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third digits extremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that they appear like a single toe furnished with two claws. Notwithstanding this similarity of pattern, it is obvious that the hind feet of these several animals are used for as widely different purposes as it is possible to conceive. The case is rendered all the more striking by the American opossums, which follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their Australian relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan. Professor Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in conclusion: [...] "We may call this <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> <b>type,</b> without getting much nearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;" [...] and he then adds [...] "but is it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of inheritance from a common ancestor?" ...|$|E

The participants (N= 239) completed the <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Masculine Norms Inventory- 46, <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Feminine Norms Inventory- 45, Negative Attitudes Toward Effeminacy Scale, Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionnaire, and Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale. Analyses indicated that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms predicts minority stress, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms does not predict minority stress, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms predicts anti-effeminacy, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms does not predict anti-effeminacy, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms predicts internalized homophobia, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms does not predict internalized homophobia, that anti-effeminacy does not predict minority stress, and that internalized homophobia does not predict minority stress. Components of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> {{masculine and feminine}} norms that predict minority stress are explored. The results suggest that gay men who conform to feminine norms may face increased minority stress and that gay men who conform to masculine norms may face increased internalized homophobia and anti-effeminacy. These results can inform efforts to reduce minority stress among gay men. Further investigation with a more racially and ethnically diverse sample is suggested...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the politics}} of English, and translation into Englishness, in the film Dirty Pretty Things (Frears). With a celebrated multilingual cast, some of whom did not speak much English, the film nevertheless unfolds in English as it follows migrant characters living illegally and on the margins in London. We take up the filmic representation of migrants in the “compromised, impure and internally divided” border spaces of Britain (Gibson 694) as one of translation into the imagined nation (Anderson). Dirty Pretty Things might seem in its style {{to be a kind}} of multicultural “foreignized translation” which reflects a heteropoetics of difference (Venuti); instead, we argue that Dirty Pretty Things, through its performance of the labour of learning and speaking English, strong accents, and cultural allusions, is a kind of domesticated translation (Venuti) that homogenises cultural difference into a literary, mythological English and Englishness. Prompted by new moral panics over immigration and recent UK policies that heap further requirements on migrants to speak English in order to belong to “One Nation Britain” (Cameron), we argue that the film offers insights into how {{the politics of}} British national belonging continue to be defined by <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> a <b>type</b> of deserving subject, one who labours to learn English and to translate herself into narrow, recognizably English cultural forms. By attending to the subtleties of language in the film, we trace the pressure on migrants to translate themselves into the linguistic and mythological moulds of their new host society...|$|R

40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community only. <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms {{is defined as}} meeting societal expectations for what constitutes masculinity in one’s public or private life (Mahalik et al., 2003). Research shows that conforming to masculine norms can produce negative outcomes in men’s behavior, such as greater depression and anxiety (Cournoyer & Mahalik, 1995). <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms also {{has been shown to}} be affected by athletic identity specifically in college football players (Steinfeldt & Steinfeldt, 2012). However, <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms has been studied minimally in relation to positive factors such as life satisfaction or psychological well-being (Rochlen, McKelley, Suizzo, & Scaringi, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to study the relationship among <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms, athletic identity, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being in college football players across different divisions. Total years in football, year in school, and position were measured in relation <b>to</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms to extend previous findings (Steinfeldt & Steinfeldt, 2012). Participants were 110 male athletes participating on intercollegiate football teams at the Division I, II, III, and NAIA levels who completed a demographic questionnaire, the <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Masculine Norms Inventory- 46 (CMNI- 46), Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) online.

40|$|The role of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> {{dominant}} U.

However, the role of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms on help-seeking attitudes for noncollege-age men or for men from diverse backgrounds is not well understood. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study examined the cross-cultural relevance of a mediational model {{of the relationships between}} <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> dominant U.

However, some important differences in the presence and strengths of the relation-ships between <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> dominant masculine norms and the other variables in the model were present across different racial/ethnic groups and sexual orientations.
