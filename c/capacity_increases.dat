5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding <b>capacity</b> <b>increases</b> in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
25|$|The {{station is}} {{designed}} to serve up to 10,500 passengers during the peak hour as a terminus. <b>Capacity</b> <b>increases</b> will probably not be possible without turning Britomart into a through station, with a tunnel underneath Auckland CBD (see City Rail Link section below).|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of tenders rebuilt from the Type TJ, the {{rebuilding}} resulted in a tender with larger water tanks, with the <b>capacity</b> <b>increased</b> from 3500 to 3900 imp gal, and a larger coal <b>capacity,</b> <b>increased</b> from 6 lt t to 8 lt 15 lcwt t.|$|R
30|$|The {{next step}} is to tie the <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> coming from the supply-side {{simulation}} to the demand-side household data to see who is impacted by the newly created capacity and enrollments. The <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> found in the supply-side simulation is used as the “exogenous shock” in the demand-side simulations.|$|R
30|$|Where an {{operational}} grant is introduced {{with a price}} cap (Scenario 2 B), the <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> is—as expected—smaller compared to no price cap scenarios. In the supply-side simulation model, when {{an operational}} grant is introduced with a price cap, child care centers that charge more than the cap do not find it profitable to opt in. As a result, <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> remains smaller compared to the scenario with no price cap where every service provider would have the incentive to opt-in. Hence for instance in the scenario when an operational grant of 300 TL is provided without a price cap a <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> of 24 % is expected {{as opposed to a}} <b>capacity</b> <b>increase</b> of 17 % when the same grant is provided but with a price cap of 750 TL per month per child.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} was made to introduce a series of other minor improvements to produce the Whitley Mk V. These included the modification of the tail fins and rudders, the fitting of leading edge de-icers, further fuel <b>capacity</b> <b>increases,</b> a smaller D/F loop in a streamlined fairing being adopted, and the extension of the rear fuselage by 15in (381mm) to improve the rear-gunner's field of fire. The Whitley Mk V was by far the most numerous version of the aircraft, with 1,466 built until production ended in June 1943.|$|E
25|$|During peak hours, {{stations}} can get {{so crowded}} {{that they need}} to be closed. Passengers may not get on the first train and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains, some trains having more than four passengers every square metre. When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health. <b>Capacity</b> <b>increases</b> have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 percent since 2004/5.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the hope}} that mental illness could be {{ameliorated}} through treatment during the mid-19th century was disappointed. Instead, psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population. The average number of patients in asylums in the United States jumped 927%. Numbers were similar in Britain and Germany. Overcrowding was rampant in France where asylums would commonly take in double their maximum <b>capacity.</b> <b>Increases</b> in asylum populations {{may have been a}} result of the transfer of care from families and poorhouses, but the specific reasons as to why the increase occurred is still debated today. No matter the cause, the pressure on asylums from the increase was taking its toll on the asylums and psychiatry as a specialty. Asylums were once again turning into custodial institutions and the reputation of psychiatry in the medical world had hit an extreme low.|$|E

25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data <b>capacity</b> <b>increases.</b> Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.|$|E
500|$|The Trail Blazers {{play their}} home {{games in the}} Moda Center, a {{multipurpose}} arena which is located in Portland's Rose Quarter, northeast of downtown.

[...] Like the Trail Blazers, the Moda Center is owned by Paul Allen through subsidiary Vulcan Sports and Entertainment. During a two-year period between 2005 and 2007, the arena was owned by a consortium of creditors who financed its construction after the Oregon Arena Corporation, a now-defunct holding company owned by Allen, filed for bankruptcy in 2004. In August 2013, the arena's name was changed from the Rose Garden to the Moda Center, after the Blazers' front office officials reached a $4 million agreement with Moda Health Corporation. The name change was met with considerable criticism from fans.|$|E
