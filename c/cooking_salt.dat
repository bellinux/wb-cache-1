50|$|Brining is {{a process}} similar to marination in which meat is soaked in brine before <b>cooking.</b> <b>Salt</b> is added to cold water in a container, where the meat is soaked {{anywhere}} from 30 minutes to a few days. The amount of time needed to brine depends {{on the size of}} the meat. More time is needed for a large turkey compared to a broiler fryer chicken. Similarly, a large roast must be brined longer than a thin cut of meat.|$|E

500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and <b>salted,</b> prior to <b>cooking.</b> <b>Salting</b> of raw meat draws out {{the blood that}} lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of salt, while the meat is laid over a grating or colander to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed {{to remain on the}} meat for the duration of time that it takes to walk one biblical mile (appx. 18– 24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.|$|R

In this review, the opportunities for the extraction and the valorisation of bioactive compounds from sardine, sardine-type fish and mackerel canning residues are examined and discussed.

40|$|The {{texture of}} {{restructured}} muscle products {{is well known}} to be strongly affected by various salts. In the present work the effects of NaCl and CaCl 2 on the ultrastructure of both fresh and <b>cooking</b> <b>salted</b> silvercarp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) muscle were examined, in order to elucidate the heat-initiated binding phenomenon. Sodium chloride at 0. 3 and 1. 5 % caused swelling and fusion of the myofibrils and loss of arrayed structure. Calcium chloride at all the tested concentrations resulted in shrinkage of myofibrils, The present study demonstrated two main effects of salts on the ultrastructure of fish muscles: (i) swelling of myofibrils which, at relatively high NaCl concentrations (1. 5 %) resulted in conversion of the arrayed structure of the myofibriles into a homogeneous and amorphous mass, and (ii) shrinkage of myofibrils, which may result in compact and denser appearance of filaments within myofibrils and their shortening.

50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; <b>cooking</b> <b>salt,</b> table salt, sea-salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|E

The São Paulo State Antimalarial Service, the Special Public Health Service in the Amazon (SESP) and the National Malaria Service (SNM) were the three Brazilian organizations involved in malaria control.

40|$|Depending on {{the origin}} of the water, the sodium levels in mineral water may vary consid-erably. The range extends from 0. 5 mg (0. 0005 g) up to 3. 4 g sodium per litre. Mineral water with a sodium content of more than 0. 2 g/l must carry the wording "contains sodium". In order to claim that a mineral water is {{suitable}} for a "low sodium diet", its sodium content must be lower than 0. 02 g/l. Roughly 98 % of the salt used for cooking purposes in the home is sodium chloride. A high <b>cooking</b> <b>salt</b> intake is under discussion as a risk factor for the onset of high blood pressure. The consequences of this may be cardiac, cardiovascular and renal disease. The German Nutrition Society (DGE), therefore, recommends that adults restrict their average daily salt intake to 6 g. Besides processed foods like cheese, sausage, bread or ready meals, which sometimes have very high salt levels, mineral waters may also make a major contribution to daily salt intake. Consumers who wish to follow a diet with a low content of <b>cooking</b> <b>salt</b> should, therefore, pay attention to the labelling on mineral water. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a health assessment of deep groundwater with a very high sodium chloride content of at least 25 g per litre from the angle of its possible use as a mineral water.

500|$|Salt was {{ubiquitous}} and indispensable {{in medieval}} <b>cooking.</b> <b>Salting</b> and drying {{was the most}} common form of food preservation and meant that fish and meat in particular were often heavily salted.

Although its etiology is complex, its prevention can be simply and effectively achieved by increasing the iodine intake of the population. The best way of ensuring a continual supply of iodine is by iodization of salt. Indian salt, however, is obtained mostly by solar evaporation of sea water or inland salt water, and is coarse and moist; it is consequently difficult to iodize uniformly.
