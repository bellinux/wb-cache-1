25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control <b>cable</b> <b>tension.</b> The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the simulation {{of the state}} of a discrete-time controlled cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) with nondeformable or elastic cables over a given trajectory. Being given a CDPR, an arbitrary model for the coiling system and for the control strategy, we exhibit a simulation algorithm that allows one to determine, in a guaranteed way, the platform pose and the <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> at any time. We show that such a simulation may require a computing accuracy that imposes to use extended arithmetic and that discrete-time control may lead to drastic differences in the <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> as compared to usual continuous time simulation. Hence, the proposed simulation tool allows for a better estimation of the positioning accuracy together with safer estimation of the maximum of the <b>cable</b> <b>tensions...</b>|$|R

40|$|A major {{open issue}} {{in the design and}} {{operation}} of cable-direct-driven-robots (CDDRs) is ensuring tensile cable forces for any admissible motion of the CDDR. Such a problem is particularly challenging when underconstrained and non-redundant CDDR configurations are considered. In this paper a new and general trajectory planning method is introduced, which has been specifically developed to ensure always positive and bounded <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> in underconstrained planar two-degree-of-freedom translational CDDRs. The proposed method translates the typical bilateral force constraints of the cables (i. e. positive and bounded tensions) into constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the CDDR end-effector along the path. Such constraints are computed making use of the robot dynamic model and are then incorporated in a suitable trajectory planning algorithm also yielding the minimum traversal time. The method is explained and validated numerically by applying it to a novel concept of underconstrained hybrid (serial/parallel) CDDR. The results achieved prove that the proposed method may a priori ensure positive and bounded <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> along any straight line and circular path...|$|R
40|$|The main {{consideration}} of any reeling {{system is the}} effect it has on <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> and hence <b>cable</b> life. This paper explains the relationship of reel torque to <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> and the reasons why this relationship is so important. Such system is characterized by variable parameters, primarily a variable moment of inertia and a variable diameter of the coiled cable. For these reasons, {{in order to ensure}} proper dimensioning of the drive, it is necessary to know the motor torques that need to be developed {{as a function of the}} coiled cable. The motor should be able to develop the required torques in a very wide speed range.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{cooperative}} transportation of a cable-suspended payload by multiple quadrotors. In previous work, quasi-static models have been used to study this problem. However, these approaches are severely limited because they ignore the payload dynamics, and do not explicitly model the underactuation in the control problem. Thus, there are no guarantees on the payload trajectory or the <b>cable</b> <b>tensions,</b> which must be non negative. In this paper, we develop a complete dynamic model for the case when payload is a point load and for the case when the payload is a rigid body. We show in both cases the resulting system is differentially flat when the <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> are strictly positive. We also consider the case where the tensions are non negative (including the case with zero tensions) and establish that these systems are differentially flat hybrid systems by considering the switching dynamics induced by the unilateral tension constraints. We use the differential flatness property to find dynamically feasible trajectories for the payload+quadrotors system. We show using numerical and experimental methods that these trajectories are superior to those obtained by quasi-static models. I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an extended adaptive control scheme via terminal sliding mode (TSM) for cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPM). Compared with linear hyperplane-based sliding mode control, TSM {{is able to}} guarantee high-precision and robust tracking performances which arise from its main feature of finite-time convergence. This motivates applying TSM to robotic manipulators in general and, as presented in this paper, to CDPM in particular. The scheme pre-sented in this paper extends early developed TSM control schemes {{which are based on}} partial knowledge of system dynamics. Instead, making use of the property that the dynamic models of mechanical manipulators are linear in inertial parameters, an adaptive control law is synthesised based on an appropriate choice of Lyapunov function which guarantees finite-time convergence to neighborhood of sliding mode. A key challenge of the control of CDPM is that <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> must be admissible, i. e. lying in a non-negative range of admissible values. As long as <b>cable</b> <b>tensions</b> are admissible, the overall dynamics of CDPM can be easily written in either ac-tuator space or operational space which in turn facilitates control system design. The extended adaptive control scheme has been applied to a large redundantly ac-tuated CDPR prototype, CoGiRo. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control method...|$|R
