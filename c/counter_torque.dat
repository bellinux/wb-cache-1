50|$|A {{change in}} speed {{out of this}} stable {{operating}} point is only possible with a new control intervention. This can be changing the load of the machine or {{the power of the}} drive which both changes the torque because it is a change in the characteristic curves. The drive-machine system then runs to a new operating point with a different speed and a different balance of torques. Should the drive torque be higher than the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> at any time then the system does not have an operating point. The result will be that the speed increases up to the idle speed or even until destruction. Should the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> be higher at any times the speed will decrease until the system stops.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, the USA built {{prototype}} tailsitter aircraft (the Lockheed XFV, and Convair XFY Pogo), {{but these}} were powered by conventional turboprops, with nose-mounted contra-rotating propellers to <b>counter</b> <b>torque.</b> They also used conventional wings for lift, though their cruciform tails with integral landing gear were broadly comparable to the Triebflügel.|$|E

40|$|Torque {{ripple of}} permanent-magnet motors can be {{classified}} into four types depending {{on the nature of}} their origin. The four types are pulsating torque, fluctuating torque, reluctance cogging torque, and inertia and mechanical system torque. Pulsating torques are inherently produced by the trapezoidal back-emf`s and trapezoidal currents used in certain permanent-magnet adjustable-speed motors. The torque ripples caused by pulsating torques may be reduced by purposely produced fluctuating <b>counter</b> <b>torques.</b> Air-gap torque measurements are conducted on a sample motor. Experimental results agree with theoretical expectations...|$|R
50|$|The X³ {{demonstrator}} {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopter, with the addition of short span wings each fitted with a tractor propeller, having different pitch to <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> effect of the main rotor. Conventional helicopters use tail rotors to <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> effect. The tractor propellers are gear driven from the two main turboshaft engines which also drive the five-bladed main rotor system, taken from an Eurocopter EC155.|$|R
50|$|In the {{discussion}} above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In {{the case of}} a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity - via the pitching motion - elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.|$|E
50|$|Nicolas Florine, a Russian engineer, {{built the}} first twin tandem rotor machine to perform a free flight. It flew in Sint-Genesius-Rode, at the Laboratoire Aérotechnique de Belgique (now von Karman Institute) in April 1933, and {{attained}} an altitude of six meters (20 ft) and an endurance of eight minutes. Florine chose a co-rotating configuration because the gyroscopic stability of the rotors would not cancel. Therefore, the rotors had to be tilted slightly in opposite directions to <b>counter</b> <b>torque.</b> Using hingeless rotors and co-rotation also minimised the stress on the hull. At the time, {{it was one of}} the most stable helicopters in existence.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{fundamental}} of induction generators is {{the conversion}} between mechanical energy to electrical energy. This requires an external torque {{applied to the}} rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed. However, indefinitely increasing torque doesn't lead to an indefinite increase in power generation. The rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter {{the motion of the}} rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction. As the speed of the motor increases the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> reaches a max value of torque (breakdown torque) that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable. Ideally, induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region.|$|E
50|$|In helicopters, {{the result}} of the torque effect is a {{tendency}} of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. A small tail rotor is the most common configuration to <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> effect.|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} {{also has}} the advantage of being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. Also, all of the power from the engines can be used for lift, whereas a single rotor helicopter uses power to <b>counter</b> the <b>torque.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{design that}} Igor Sikorsky settled on for his VS-300 was a smaller tail rotor. The tail rotor pushes or pulls against the tail to <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> effect, {{and this has}} become the most common {{configuration}} for helicopter design, usually {{at the end of a}} tail boom.|$|R
5000|$|At impact, {{the club}} head can twist {{as a result}} of torque applied to the shaft, {{reducing}} accuracy as the face of the club is not square to the player's stance. The ability of a shaft to twist along its length due to this torque is fundamentally a function of the flex of the shaft itself; a stiffer shaft will also torque less. To <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> in more flexible shafts, club makers design the shafts with varying degrees of torque through their length, particularly along the thinnest part of the shaft where it joins with the club head. This results in a point at which the shaft is most flexible, called the [...] "kick point"; above that point the increasing diameter of the shaft makes it more rigid, while below that point the shaft is reinforced internally to reduce torquing of the club head. Shafts have typically been classified as having a low, medium or high kick; a low kick means the shaft will store energy closer to the club head, which means the club head can twist more but also allows for higher club head speeds. A high kick shaft will store energy closer to the grip; such a shaft will feel firmer when swinging it and will give better control over direction, but the same strength swing will flex the shaft less, which will reduce club-head speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lower}} right picture the {{electrical}} drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant counter-torque over {{the whole range of}} speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way. In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics {{in the middle of the}} curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> will only be introduced when the load-less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past shunt-motors have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous AC motors are being used or AC motors in combination with a variable frequency drive.|$|E
40|$|Finned {{bodies of}} {{revolution}} firing lateral jets in flight may experience lower spin rates than predicted. This reduction in spin rate {{is a result}} of vortices generated by the interaction between the lateral jets and freestream air flowing past the body. The vortices change the pressure distribution on the fins, inducing a <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> that opposes the desired spin. Wind tunnel data measuring roll torque and fin pressures were collected for a full-scale model at varying angle of attack, roll angle, airspeed, and jet strength. The current analysis builds upon previously written code that computes torque by integrating pressure over the fin surfaces at 0 {sup o} angle of attack. The code was modified to investigate the behavior of <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> at different angles of attack and roll angles as a function of J, the ratio of jet dynamic pressure to freestream dynamic pressure. Numerical error analysis was applied to all data to assist with interpretation of results. Results show that agreement between balance and fin pressure <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> at 0 {sup o} angle of attack was not as close as previously believed. <b>Counter</b> <b>torque</b> at 4 {sup o} angle of attack was higher than at 0 {sup o}, and agreement between balance and fin pressure <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> was closer. Plots of differential fin pressure coefficient revealed a region of high pressure at the leading edge and an area of low pressure over the center and aft regions of the tapped surface. Large differences in the counter-torque coefficient were found between various freestream dynamic pressures, especially at Mach 0. 95 and 1. 1. Roll angle had significant effect only for cases at angle of attack, where it caused <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> to change unpredictably...|$|E

25|$|On one engine the Lerwick {{could not}} {{maintain}} height, nor could it maintain a constant heading, as the controls could not <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> of one engine on maximum power.

30|$|To {{correct the}} wrong {{position}} or fractured implant {{is necessary to}} remove it. For this purpose, it may be used various surgical techniques {{such as the use}} of trephine, implant drills, ultrasound, and others. But the use of these techniques cause great loss of peri-implant bone, what limits or prevents a new immediate rehabilitation [16, 17]. Alternatives to removal implants without losing or expanding alveolar bone led Anitua and Orive [18] to use the <b>counter</b> <b>torque.</b> Studies comparing <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> with trephine drills to remove implants indicated better performance for the first [18, 19].|$|E
40|$|In flight tests, certain finned {{bodies of}} {{revolution}} firing lateral jets experience slower spin rates than expected. The primary {{cause for the}} reduced spin rate is {{the interaction between the}} lateral jets and the freestream air flowing past the body. This interaction produces vortices that interact with the fins (Vortex-Fin Interaction (VFI)) altering the pressure distribution over the fins and creating torque that counteracts the desired spin (<b>counter</b> <b>torque).</b> The current task is to develop an automated procedure for analyzing the pressures measured at an array of points on the fin surfaces of a body tested in a production-scale wind tunnel to determine the VFI-induced roll torque and compare it to the roll torque experimentally measured with an aerodynamic balance. Basic pressure, force, and torque relationships were applied to finite elements defined by the pressure measurement locations and integrated across the fin surface. The integrated fin pressures will help assess the distinct contributions of the individual fins to the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> and aid in correlating the <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> with the positions and strengths of the vortices. The methodology produced comparisons of the effects of VFI for varying flow conditions such as freestream Mach number and dynamic pressure. The results show that for some cases the calculated <b>counter</b> <b>torque</b> agreed with the measured counter torque; however, the results were less consistent with increased freestream Mach numbers and dynamic pressures...|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable.

A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and <b>counter</b> the <b>torque</b> of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|R

50|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} need {{a mechanism}} to neutralize the yawing movement produced by the single large rotor. This is commonly accomplished by a tail rotor, coaxial rotors, and the NOTAR systems. Tandem rotor helicopters, however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each cancelling out the other's torque.
