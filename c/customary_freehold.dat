50|$|<b>Customary</b> <b>freehold</b> is in English law {{a species}} of tenure which may be {{described}} as a variety of copyhold. It is also termed privileged copyhold or copyhold of frank tenure. It is a tenure by copy of manorial roll, but not expressed to be at the will of the lord. It is, in fact, only a superior kind of copyhold, and the freehold is in the lord. It is subject to the general law of copyholds, except where the law may be varied by the custom of the particular manor.|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} of the original ‘Eagle & Child ’ is somewhat difficult to date. It definitely existed in 1742 and was therefore constructed before {{the time of the}} Kendal to Ambleside Turnpike road in 1761. It could have been earlier than 1742 as the bridge over the Gowan was a key crossing point for almost a century before the turnpike. All we know is that in 1742 the licensee was George Birket. 1 The ‘Dorothy Wordsworth ’ steps, still in situ some 200 years later. The second reference is in 1771 when the Trustees of the Turnpike road tendered for construction of a road from the Eagle & Child ‘home stone ’ – thought to refer to a mounting stone outside the inn – to the newly constructed toll bar. 2 There are then several references {{at the start of the}} 19 th century when the owner was Robert Braithwaite of Scroggs Mill. 3 (Owner in this context was that of a tenancy of <b>Customary</b> <b>Freehold,</b> where the tenant held ‘according to the customs of the Manor’, with a rent payable to the Lord of the Manor – in this case the Lowthers). Almost certainly, the references to an inn at Staveley in Dorothy Wordsworth’s journal of October 18024 refer to the Eagle. She wrote: I am always glad to see Stavel(e) y; it is a place I dearly love to think of – the first mountain village that I came to with William when we first began our pilgrimage together. Here we drank a Bason of milk at a Publick house, and I washed my feet in the Brook and put on a pair of silk stockings by William’s advice. The steps that led from the inn to the side of the Gowan are now affectionately known locally as the ‘Dorothy Wordsworth ’ steps...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} different customary manorial tenures on the land transfer activities of rural tenants between 1645 and 1705. The study of land transfer has formed part of the attempt by historians to establish how and why England developed from family-based subsistence farming into large-scale commercialised agriculture before many of its Continental neighbours. A key element in any study of land transfer is the property rights of those undertaking the transfers. England had a variety of customary tenures, and little research has focussed on how they operated and impacted on rural tenant transfer behaviour in the early modern period. This study uses evidence from eight manors in Hampshire with four different types of tenure to explore how they affected what land transfer options the tenants had, and how transfers were used to further family and economic objectives. The types of tenure were copyhold of inheritance; copyhold for three lives; copyhold for three lives where the first could act alone; and a form of <b>customary</b> <b>freehold.</b> The main documentary sources are manorial records augmented by parish, probate, survey and taxation material. The tenurial and landholding structure of the manors is established for 1645 using the Cromwellian Parliamentary Surveys of confiscated ecclesiastical estates. The analysis of subsequent tenant land transfers through to 1705 then {{examines the}}ir volume and any correlation with prices and population movements. The permanent transfers of death/inheritance and the inter vivos land market are analysed to assess {{the extent to which}} tenants were attached still to family, or taking part in an active extra-familial investment and sales market; and whether this led to changes over time in farm holding size and distribution. The temporary transfers of sub-letting of land and sub-tenure of dwellings are then analysed. The latter has not been studied before, and uses the Hearth Tax returns to compare occupiers of dwellings with formal tenants. Finally a detailed study of mortgages is made. Previous studies of the use of land as collateral for a mortgage loan have often overlooked the rural tenant as a participant in the credit market, and changes in the laws of usury {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century produced a significant uptake of mortgaging in the seventeenth, which makes this study timely. The research reveals that the tenants were very active with their transfers, but that the way in which they were active was determined by tenure. Those with copyhold of inheritance tenure had many options including inheritance, sale, mortgaging, sub-letting, splitting holdings, and conditional surrenders to provide for old age or several children. Those with copyhold for lives were restricted to after-death transfers, shuffling of reversion lives, or sub-letting. However, they adapted, and while Inheritance-tenured tenants adopted mortgages with enthusiasm, Lives tenants sub-let on a large scale. Both thereby acquired financial support from their lands, so that although the land-family bond was not absent, the bond was strongest in terms of using the land as an economic asset. The sub-letting of dwellings enabled Lives tenants to accommodate a landless workforce, where their tenure prevented the splitting of parcels for sale as manorial smallholdings. Aggressive accumulation of land was largely absent, and purchasers of land and mortgage lenders were overwhelmingly local. Some polarisation of holding size was found, but sub-tenure meant that actual farmed units were probably very different. It is concluded that differences in tenure significantly shaped the transfer behaviour of the tenants, so that any future research involving customary tenants must take tenure into account. However, their economic ambitions were found to be similar whichever tenure they had, so that they had to take different means to the same end...|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that land {{is perhaps the most}} {{essential}} resource and an important pillar of national development. In Uganda, the management of land is regulated by the 1995 constitution and the Land Act of 1998, which recognise four tenure systems, namely; <b>Customary,</b> Mailo, <b>Freehold</b> and Leasehold tenure systems, each of which possess unique features and associated ownership rights. This study analysed important dimensions largely of a locational and regional nature, on tenure system and the value of agricultural land. The general objective was to investigate the determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. The study hypothesized that institutional factors such as land titles were important determinants of agricultural land prices in Uganda; that there was a significant premium for agricultural land with title/certificate relative to that without, and that the premium for agricultural land with a freehold title was significantly higher than that for other titles/certificates. Data was obtained from the third round of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) conducted by Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) during the 2004 / 2005 crop year. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression techniques using 9, 045 parcel level observations were used to answer the study objectives. Results showed that region, location in the peri-urban and institutional factors such as leasehold title were the major determinants of the value of agricultural land in Uganda. Compared to the Central region, agricultural land in the Eastern and Northern regions had significantly lower prices suggesting a high demand for land in the urbanising Central. Results from the characterisation of agricultural land ownership systems revealed that mailo tenure was dominant in the Central region, whereas customary tenure was dominant in the other regions of Uganda. However, current agricultural use, soil quality, trees/perennials, as well as proximity of agricultural land which were associated with higher land values in developed countries were not generally capitalised into the price of agricultural land. The study recommended that the current land policy should promote the leasehold system in upcoming cities/ or urbanising areas, since it opens land {{to a wide range of}} users and use-options to encourage allocation of land to the best alternative uses. The land policy should also address the double ownership structure under mailo tenure which constrains its marketability and transferability, and probably services to discount its price. This can be done possibly by facilitating arrangements for single ownership of land such that either the landlord willingly sells off his ownership rights to the tenant; or the tenant accepts compensation to leave the land; or alternatively the two parties could agree to share the land. Further research was recommended to explore the benefits of freehold title since it is viewed as the tenure system of the future. More research is also needed on the impact of converting one form of land tenure to another, for instance, on the conversion of <b>customary</b> land to <b>freehold,</b> since it is the dominant tenure system in Uganda.
