5|$|Various {{parts of}} trees {{are used as}} spices. These include <b>cinnamon,</b> made from the bark of the <b>cinnamon</b> tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice, the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum).|$|E
5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes <b>cinnamon.</b> The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are <b>cinnamon</b> or tan.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fruit}} body matures, the gills darken to <b>cinnamon</b> brown {{following}} spore release. The spore mass is colored brown to rust.|$|E
5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of <b>cinnamon.</b> S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter <b>cinnamon</b> coloring.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, hot {{chocolate}} remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, <b>cinnamon,</b> sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate {{of this type}} is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican <b>cinnamon</b> {{hot chocolate}} as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.|$|E
5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked with pieces of meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, <b>cinnamon,</b> allspice, nutmeg and cumin. Plain rice cooked in meat or chicken broth and flavored with mild spices including <b>cinnamon</b> is known as fatteh ghazzawiyyeh. The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, smothered in ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is <b>cinnamon</b> or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} used {{can include}} yogurt, buttermilk, raisins, dates, walnuts, hazelnuts, allspice, <b>cinnamon</b> and nutmeg among others. Lemon juice {{may be used}} on the avocado to prevent browning from occurring. Avocado cake can be prepared as a vegetarian and vegan dish. Chocolate cake and pancakes can be prepared with avocado as an ingredient in the batter.|$|E
5|$|After later {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with {{a larger number of}} birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for <b>cinnamon</b> teal. Seven other species of duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed <b>cinnamon</b> Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Debian offers CD images {{specifically}} {{built for}} GNOME (the default desktop), KDE Software Compilation, Xfce and LXDE. MATE is officially supported, while <b>Cinnamon</b> support was added with Debian 8.0 Jessie. Less common window managers such as Enlightenment, Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Window Maker {{and others are}} available.|$|E
5|$|Examples include citrus-flavored {{semolina}} cakes, moistened with {{syrup and}} called basbousa, tishpishti or revani in Sephardic bakeries. The Ashkenazi babka has been adapted to include halva or chocolate spread, {{in addition to}} the old-fashioned <b>cinnamon.</b> There are also many varieties of apple cake. Cookies made with crushed dates (ma'amoul) are served with coffee or tea, as throughout the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|For desserts or {{informal}} gatherings on Shabbat, home bakers still bake a {{wide variety}} of cakes on Fridays to be enjoyed on the Sabbath, or purchased from bakeries or stores, cakes such as sponge cake, citrus semolina cake, <b>cinnamon</b> or chocolate babkas, and fruit and nut cakes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, BK co-branded {{several of its}} breakfast {{products}} with former parent Pillsbury; Pillsbury produced a fresh-baked biscuit product for the chain in 1996 and miniature <b>cinnamon</b> rolls called Cini-Minis in 1998. As part of the cachet built into the products, Burger King advertises that products are cooked fresh in the restaurant each morning.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has <b>cinnamon</b> upperparts, {{brownish}} crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts. Its redder coloration and small size led German naturalist Ernst Hartert to describe it as a distinct taxon in 1906. The call is {{similar to those of}} the Australian subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Sahlab is a {{drinkable}} pudding {{once made}} of the powdered bulb of the orchid plant but today usually made with cornstarch. It is usually sold in markets or by street vendors, especially in the winter. It is topped with <b>cinnamon</b> and chopped pistachios.|$|E
5|$|Stuffed {{chicken in}} Israel is usually stuffed with rice, meat (lamb or beef), parsley, dried fruits like dates, {{apricots}} or raisins, spices like <b>cinnamon,</b> nutmeg or allspice; sometimes herbs like thyme and oregano (not the dried ones) are added {{on the top}} of the chicken to give it a flavor and than it is baked in the oven.|$|E
5|$|While some pet rats {{retain the}} agouti {{coloring}} {{of the wild}} brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include agouti, <b>cinnamon,</b> and fawn. Black-based colors include black, beige, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|According to the Scottish {{physician}} Francis Buchanan {{who visited}} Mangalore in 1801, Mangalore {{was a rich}} and prosperous port with flourishing trading activity. Rice was the grand article of export, and was exported to Muscat, Bombay, Goa and Malabar. Supari or Betel-nut was exported to Bombay, Surat and Kutch. Pepper and Sandalwood were exported to Bombay. Turmeric was exported to Muscat, Kutch, Surat and Bombay, along with Cassia <b>Cinnamon,</b> Sugar, Iron, Saltpeter, Ginger, Coir and Timber.|$|E
5|$|Burger King cooks its {{foods in}} one of four ways: broiling, deep frying, baking, or microwaving. As noted in its mottos and advertisements, BK cooks its burgers and grilled chicken on an {{automated}} grill, while its other chicken products, fish, sides, and breakfast sausage are deep-fried in vegetable oil. BK prepares its biscuits, <b>cinnamon</b> rolls, and cookies by baking in a convection oven and microwaves its BK Veggie burger patty.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to general commodities, Han historians list the goods of specific regions. Common trade {{items from the}} region of modern Shanxi included bamboo, timber, grain, and gemstones; Shandong had fish, salt, liquor, and silk; Jiangnan had camphor, catalpa, ginger, <b>cinnamon,</b> gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shell, pearls, ivory, and leather. Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd-century AD tomb in Wuwei, Gansu (along the Hexi Corridor fortified by the Great Wall of China), evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy <b>cinnamon</b> with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred rufous in coloration. The female's tail {{feathers}} are longer and more pointed at the tip {{than those of the}} male. The juvenile purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E
5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies {{are larger than}} those of M. l. leucopterus but have a shorter tail. The female has a more <b>cinnamon</b> tinge to her plumage than the grey-brown {{of the other two}} subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, <b>cinnamon</b> teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, <b>cinnamon,</b> cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and <b>cinnamon</b> also come from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Rose or mint {{water is}} a drink {{commonly}} added to Palestinian sweets and dishes. However, {{it is also a}} popular drink on its own, and is seen as refreshing in the heated summers. Herbs such as sage can also be boiled with water to create a drink that is sometimes used for medicinal purposes. A warm drink made from sweetened milk with salep garnished with walnuts, coconut flakes and <b>cinnamon,</b> is known as sahlab and is primarily served during the winter season.|$|E
5|$|Several musical {{instruments}} have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a viola da gamba, all expensive objects that probably belonged {{to either the}} officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board {{was a member of}} the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and <b>cinnamon</b> quills.|$|E
5|$|Shrimp, {{chicken and}} lemon-filled briouats are another {{traditional}} specialty of Marrakesh. Rice is cooked with saffron, raisins, spices, and almonds, while couscous may have added vegetables. A pastilla is a filo-wrapped pie stuffed with minced chicken or pigeon {{that has been}} prepared with almonds, <b>cinnamon,</b> spices and sugar. Harira soup in Marrakesh typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and tripe stew are commonly sold at the stalls of Jemaa el-Fnaa.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, <b>cinnamon</b> fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee—(milk fat rendered from butter, {{also called}} clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds (shah zeera), <b>cinnamon,</b> cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, allspice (kabab cheeni); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot {{topped with a}} ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish.|$|E
5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting <b>cinnamon,</b> rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|While domesticated rats are not removed {{enough from}} their wild {{counterparts}} {{to justify a}} distinct subspecies (compare Canis lupus familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to <b>cinnamon</b> to blue.|$|E
5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and <b>cinnamon.</b> It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple <b>cinnamon</b> sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light <b>cinnamon</b> to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
