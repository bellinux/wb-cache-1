500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a <b>camlet</b> cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leiden {{flourished in}} the 16th and 17th century. At {{the close of the}} 15th century the weaving establishments (mainly broadcloth) of Leiden were very important, and after the {{expulsion}} of the Spaniards Leiden cloth, Leiden baize and Leiden <b>camlet</b> were familiar terms. [...] In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. The influential printer Christoffel Plantijn lived there at one time. One of his pupils was Lodewijk Elzevir (1547–1617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by his descendants through 1712 and the name subsequently adopted (in a variant spelling) by contemporary publisher Elsevier.|$|E
2500|$|The first European importations of alpaca fiber {{were into}} Spain. Spain {{transferred}} that fiber to Germany and France. Apparently, alpaca yarn was spun in England {{for the first}} time about the year 1808, but the fiber was condemned as an unworkable material. In 1830, Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted spinning it, and again it was condemned. These two attempts failed due to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven—a type of <b>camlet.</b> With the introduction of cotton warps into Bradford trade about 1836, the true qualities of alpaca could be assessed as it was developed into fabric. It is not known where the cotton warp and mohair or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from, but it was this simple and ingenious structure which enabled Titus Salt, then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully. Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing center for alpaca. Large quantities of yarns and cloths are exported annually to the European continent and the US, although the quantities vary with the fashions in vogue. The typical [...] "alpaca fabric" [...] is a very characteristic [...] "dress fabric." ...|$|E
50|$|Waved <b>camlets</b> feature {{impressed}} waves, as on tabbies.|$|R
50|$|Figured <b>camlets</b> are of one color, {{on which}} are stamped various figures, flowers, foliages, etc. The figures were applied with hot irons, passed {{together}} with the fabric, under a press. In the 18th century, these were chiefly brought from Amiens and Flanders. In antiquity, figured <b>camlets</b> were much more sought after than in modern times.|$|R
50|$|Water <b>camlets,</b> after weaving, {{received}} a certain preparation with water; and were afterwards passed under a hot press, {{giving them a}} smoothness and lustre.|$|R
60|$|In {{compliment}} {{for this}} civility, we sent the governor a small present of fine scarlet <b>camlet</b> and {{two pieces of}} baize; {{and he made a}} very handsome return, in such refreshments as he thought we most wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "A bicycle, a bicycle!" [...] he said breathlessly to the guard. He {{felt himself}} {{a man of}} action. The guard paid no attention, but {{continued}} methodically to hand out, one by one, the packages labelled to <b>Camlet.</b> [...] "A bicycle!" [...] Denis repeated. [...] "A green machine, cross-framed, name of Stone. S-T-O-N-E." ...|$|E
60|$|A rosy, dark-eyed {{face looked}} {{out from the}} faded green calash, a gayly flowered gown was looped up over a blue quilted petticoat, and a red <b>camlet</b> cloak hung down behind. A big {{reticule}} and a funny umbrella were held in either hand, and red hose and very high-heeled, pointed shoes covered a trim pair of feet.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, England, France, Holland, and Flanders {{were the}} chief places of its manufacture; Brussels {{exceeded}} {{them all in}} the beauty and quality of its <b>camlets,</b> followed by England.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the term is uncertain. While certain authors {{reference}} <b>camlets</b> as originally being made of camel hair, others believe {{it is from the}} Arabic seil el kemel, the Angora goat. According to Chambers's Encyclopaedia, it comes from Arabic chamal, meaning fine.|$|R
50|$|He was for {{the most}} part self-educated. Apprenticed in 1804 to a {{manufacturer}} of <b>camlets</b> and bombazines, a taste for serious study was stimulated by his master, Alderman John Herring and by Joseph John Gurney. Becoming interested in geology and archaeology, he began to form the collection which after his death was purchased for the Norwich museum. In 1820 he obtained a clerkship in Gurney's (afterwards Barclay's) bank at Norwich, and Hudson Gurney and Dawson Turner (of Yarmouth), both fellows of the Royal Society, encouraged his scientific work.|$|R
60|$|Mistress Susan {{was unusually}} severe {{with the girl}} on the indiscretion of gadding in strange places with no better escort than Diccon, and of {{entering}} into conversation with unknown persons. Moreover, Cicely's hair, her shoes, and <b>camlet</b> riding skirt were all so dank with dew that she was with difficulty made presentable by the time the horses were brought round.|$|E
60|$|Along this {{particular}} stretch of line no express had ever passed. All the trains--the few that there were--stopped {{at all the}} stations. Denis knew {{the names of those}} stations by heart. Bole, Tritton, Spavin Delawarr, Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally, Camlet-on-the-Water. <b>Camlet</b> was where he always got out, leaving the train to creep indolently onward, goodness only knew whither, into the green heart of England.|$|E
60|$|It is {{needless to}} add {{that he was the}} same personage already {{introduced}} in the character of Father Buonaventure, by which name he was distinguished at Fairladies. His dress was not different from what he then wore, excepting that he had a loose riding-coat of <b>camlet,</b> under which he carried an efficient cut-and-thrust sword, instead of his walking rapier, and also a pair of pistols.|$|E
5000|$|The merchandises {{exported}} {{there were}} limited in quality and range, suggesting an imbalance of trade; they included traditional cloths, especially shortcloth and kerseys, tin, pewter, lead, pepper, re-exported cochineal, black rabbit skins {{and a great}} deal of American silver, which the English took up at Cadiz. The more valuable returns were in raw silk, cotton wool and yarn, currants and [...] "Damascus raisins", nutmeg, pepper, indigo, galls, <b>camlets,</b> wool and cotton cloth, the soft leathers called maroquins, soda ash for making glass and soap, and several gums and medicinal drugs. Velvet, carpets, and silk were bought by the traders.|$|R
25|$|England {{could no}} longer compete in the {{carrying}} trade to Spain and Portugal; the Dover entrepot that had competed successfully with the Amsterdam one in the 1640s {{as far as the}} Mediterranean was concerned, completely collapsed; the transmission of silver to Flanders was switched by the Spanish bankers to Amsterdam from London. But England lost not just the carrying trade. Far more important was that the ascendancy of English textile exports to Spain was now lost, that had been total in the 1640s, as had been the English role in Spanish wool exports. Within a year or two this was completely reversed by the Dutch who in 1650 handled 80 percent of this trade. Dutch lakens and <b>camlets</b> took over the Spanish textile market, whereas Holland also took over the entrepot for Ibero-American dyestuffs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me extricate! I might hae {{hung there}} till {{the day of}} {{judgment}} or I could hae helped mysell, wi' my head hinging down on the tae side, and my heels on the tother, like the yarn-scales in the weigh-house. It was the creature Dougal that extricated me, as he did yestreen; he cuttit aff the tails o' my coat wi' his durk, and another gillie and him set me on my legs as cleverly as if I had never been aff them. But {{to see what a}} thing gude braid claith is! Had I been in ony o' your rotten French <b>camlets</b> now, or your drab-de-berries, it would hae screeded like an auld rag wi' sic a weight as mine. But fair fa' the weaver that wrought the weft o't--I swung and bobbit yonder as safe as a gabbart* that's moored by a three-ply cable at the Broomielaw." ...|$|R
6000|$|This discovery, as Mr. Pepys says of {{the rent}} in his <b>camlet</b> cloak, was but a trifle, yet it troubled me; and I was at {{a good deal of}} pains to efface any marks by which I thought my secret could be traced before the conclusion, when I relied on it with the same hope of {{producing}} effect, with which the Irish post-boy is said to reserve a [...] "trot for the avenue." ...|$|E
60|$|Obediently Denis {{left the}} room. Never again, {{he said to}} himself, never again would he do {{anything}} decisive. <b>Camlet,</b> West Bowlby, Knipswich for Timpany, Spavin Delawarr; {{and then all the}} other stations; and then, finally, London. The thought of the journey appalled him. And what on earth was he going to do in London when he got there? He climbed wearily up the stairs. It was time for him to lay himself in his coffin.|$|E
60|$|The train came bumpingly to a halt. Here was <b>Camlet</b> at last. Denis jumped up, crammed his hat {{over his}} eyes, {{deranged}} his pile of baggage, leaned {{out of the}} window and shouted for a porter, seized a bag in either hand, and had to put them down again in order to open the door. When at last he had safely bundled himself and his baggage on to the platform, he ran up the train towards the van.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured <b>camlets,</b> gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|R
60|$|Not a child complained after that, but ran about helpfully, {{bringing}} moccasins, {{heating the}} footstone, and {{getting ready for}} a long drive, because Gran'ma lived twenty miles away, and there were no railroads in those parts to whisk people to and fro like magic. By the time the old yellow sleigh was at the door, the bread was in the oven, and Mrs. Bassett was waiting, with her <b>camlet</b> cloak on, and the baby done up like a small bale of blankets.|$|E
60|$|With this {{announcement}} he hurried {{away to the}} outer door of the Blue Dragon, and almost immediately returned with a companion shorter than himself, who was wrapped in an old blue <b>camlet</b> cloak with a lining of faded scarlet. His sharp features being much pinched and nipped by long waiting in the cold, and his straggling red whiskers and frowzy hair being more than usually dishevelled from the same cause, he certainly looked rather unwholesome and uncomfortable than Shakspearian or Miltonic.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I tell thee, friend," [...] {{said the}} mercer, [...] "it {{is the very}} horse on which I was this day to carry Jane Thackham, of Shottesbrok, {{as far as the}} parish church yonder, to become Dame Goldthred. She hath jumped out of the shot-window of old Gaffer Thackham's grange; and lo ye, yonder she stands at the place where she should have met the palfrey, with her <b>camlet</b> riding-cloak and ivory-handled whip, like a picture of Lot's wife. I pray you, in good terms, let me have back the palfrey." ...|$|E
6000|$|The hour of noon was {{accordingly}} {{heard to}} peal from Saint Dunstan's. [...] "Well banged, brave hammers!" [...] said Lord Dalgarno, in triumph.--"The estate and lands of Glenvarloch are crushed beneath these clanging blows. If my steel to-morrow prove but as true as your iron maces to- day, the poor landless lord will little miss what your peal hath cut him out from.--The papers--the papers, thou varlet! I am to-morrow Northward, ho! At four, afternoon, I am {{bound to be}} at <b>Camlet</b> Moat, in the Enfield Chase. To-night most of my retinue set forward. The papers!--Come, dispatch." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{horses were}} put to. The baggage was {{strapped}} on. Francis {{came out with}} his master's sword, cane, and umbrella tied up together, and laid them in the well, and his desk and old tin cocked-hat case, which he placed under the seat. Francis brought out the stained old blue cloak lined with red <b>camlet,</b> which had wrapped the owner up any time these fifteen years, and had manchen Sturm erlebt, as a favourite song of those days said. It had been new for the campaign of Waterloo and had covered George and William after the night of Quatre Bras.|$|E
60|$|But Sophie {{declared}} that the old yellow sleigh, with Punch, the farm-horse, must be used, as she wished everything to be in keeping; and Saul obeyed, thinking {{he had never seen}} anything prettier than his cousin when she appeared in his mother's old-fashioned <b>camlet</b> cloak and blue silk pumpkin hood. He looked remarkably well himself in his fur coat, with hair and beard brushed till they shone like spun gold, a fresh color in his cheek, and the sparkle of amusement in his eyes, while excitement gave his usually grave face the animation it needed to be handsome.|$|E
60|$|It {{was agreed}} that Eleanor had better make as royal and {{imposing}} an appearance as possible, {{so instead of}} the plain <b>camlet</b> riding kirtles that she and Lady Lindsay had worn, she donned a heraldic sort of garment, a tissue of white and gold thread, with the red lion ramping on back and breast, and the double tressure edging all the hems, part of the outfit furnished at her great-uncle's expense in London, but too gaudy for her taste, and she added to her already considerable height by the tall, veiled headgear that had been despised as unfashionable.|$|E
6000|$|She donned her <b>camlet</b> {{cloak and}} hood, and looked {{once more in}} upon Grisell, who after her loss of blood, had, on reviving, been made to swallow a draught of which an {{infusion}} of poppy heads formed a great part, so that she lay, breathing heavily, in a deep sleep, moaning now and then. Her mother did not scruple to try to rouse her with calls of [...] "Grizzy! Look up, wench!" [...] but could elicit nothing but a half turn on the pillow, and a little louder moan, and Master Miles, who was still watching, absolutely refused to let his patient be touched or shaken.|$|E
60|$|After her the congregation, {{the well-to-do}} {{and the poor}} alike, poured {{out of the church}} and spread in merry groups over the grass: keel boatmen in tow shirts and party-colored worsted belts, the blacksmith, the shoemaker, the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in large cotton pantaloons and light-wove <b>camlet</b> coat, the more favored in skull-caps, linen small-clothes, cotton stockings, and silver-buckled shoes,--every man pausing, dipping into his tabatiere, for a word with his neighbor. The women, too, made a picture strange to our eyes, the matrons in jacket and petticoat, a Madras {{handkerchief}} flung about their shoulders, the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco.|$|E
60|$|The shoeing of Stead Kenton's horse {{seemed a}} trivial matter beneath the {{attention}} of such an orator; but he vouchsafed to bid his lad drive in a few nails; {{and just as the}} task was commenced, there came to the forge a lady in a <b>camlet</b> riding dress and black silk hood, walking beside a stout horse, which a groom was leading with great care, for it had evidently lost a shoe. And it had a saddle with a pillion on which they had been riding double, after the usual fashion of travelling for young and healthy gentlewomen in those days of bad roads.|$|E
60|$|I went to {{see this}} {{creature}} with the lovely eyes, having made my wife describe the fellow's dress to me, and I saw a little bandy-legged wretch in a blue <b>camlet</b> coat, with his red hair tied with a dirty ribbon, about whom I forbore generously even to reproach my wife; nor will she ever know that I {{have looked at the}} fellow, until she reads the confession in this page. If our wives saw us as we are, I thought, would they love us as they do? Are we as much mistaken in them, as they in us? I look into one candid face at least, and think it never has deceived me.|$|E
60|$|The coachmen always {{change with}} the horses, and are usually as dirty as the coach. The first was dressed like a very shabby English baker; the second like a Russian peasant: for he wore a loose purple <b>camlet</b> robe, with a fur collar, tied round his waist with a parti-coloured worsted sash; grey trousers; light blue gloves: and a cap of bearskin. It had by this time come on to rain very heavily, {{and there was a}} cold damp mist besides, which {{penetrated}} to the skin. I was glad {{to take advantage of a}} stoppage and get down to stretch my legs, shake the water off my great-coat, and swallow the usual anti-temperance recipe for keeping out the cold.|$|E
6000|$|Master Headley, {{with some}} sighing and groaning, applied himself {{to write to}} the mother at Salisbury {{what had become of}} her son; but he had only spent one evening over the trying task, when just as the supper bell was ringing, with Master Hope and his wife as guests, there were horses' feet in the court, and Master Tiptoff appeared, with a servant on another horse, which carried besides a figure in <b>camlet,</b> on a pillion. No sooner was this same figure lifted from her steed and set down on the steps, while the master of the house and his {{daughter}} came out to greet her, than she began, [...] "Master Alderman Headley, I am here to know what you have done with my poor son!" ...|$|E
60|$|That metamorphosis, of itself, {{was enough}} to set Garnache in a good humour; he felt himself again, and the feeling gave him confidence. His mustachios {{bristled}} as fiercely as of old, his skin was clear and healthy, and his dark brown hair showed ashen at the temples. He was becomingly arrayed in a suit of dark brown <b>camlet,</b> with rows of close-set gold buttons running up his hanging sleeves; a leather jerkin hid much of his finery, and his great boots encased his legs. He wore a brown hat, with a tallish crown and a red feather, and Rabecque carried his cloak for him, for the persistent Saint Martin's summer rendered that day of November rather as one of early autumn.|$|E
