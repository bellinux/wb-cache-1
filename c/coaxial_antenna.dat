Since <b>coaxial</b> <b>antennas</b> extend along a straight line and can have almost any radius, they may be easily inserted into confined spaces that require an <b>antenna.</b> <b>Coaxial</b> <b>antennas</b> are easy to construct, naturally adapted to a coaxial input connection, thus avoiding the use of a balun (a balanced to unbalanced adapter), and avoid using a T-shaped structure (as for the two-wire dipole). By altering in specific ways the inner and outer conductors of a 50 Ω transmission line, four different <b>coaxial</b> <b>antennas</b> are formed that have characteristics {{similar to those}} of a two-wire dipole antenna. These antennas are compared and discussed, while noting the similarities and differences between them and the two-wire dipole antenna. The antenna parameters determined are the near-field and far-field radiation patterns, the input impedance and the input reflection coefficient (S 11).

40|$|The {{construction}} and operating {{characteristics of a}} microwave (MW) electrodeless UV lamp are described. Instead of using a MW oven or a MW cavity to excite a plasma discharge in a glass bulb, in this work the optical radiation emitted by the gaseous plasma discharge is produced by the near field of a coaxial cable dipole antenna placed inside the recess of the quartz bulb. Experimental results are reported, which were obtained by applying MW power up to 700 W in continuous wave regime to an Ar-Hg filled cylindrical bulb, and 160 W to a XeBr 2 filled spherical bulb at 2. 45 GHz. The UV emission from a 6 W Ar-Hg lamp is compared with a commercial lamp, demonstrating {{the advantages of the}} new method in terms of efficiency. When the lamp is excited at high MW levels, the MW <b>coaxial</b> <b>antenna</b> is cooled using forced air or water flowing into the glass recess.

Due to the 100 mA p+ current, a large amount of continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) power must be transmitted into the SC cavities through the input power coupler. In 1997, the coupler requirement of 210 kW, CW (at 700 MHz) was chosen for the APT couplers as a reasonable extrapolation of the technology. Later, due to testing results, this was increased to 420 kW, CW requiring only one coupler per cavity. Multipacting and window failure concerns governed the design features of the coupler/window assembly. Figure 1 shows the APT coupler layout...|$|E
