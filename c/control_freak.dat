5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case.

[...] Portman suggested to Aronofsky that her good friend Mila Kunis would be perfect for the role. Kunis contrasted Lily with Nina, [...] "My character is very loose... She's not as technically good as Natalie's character, but she has more passion, naturally. That's what [...] lacks." [...] The female characters are directed in the Swan Lake production by Thomas Leroy, played by Cassel.

500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{reception}} of the Alien prequel films, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David was met with critical acclaim, with his performance {{generally considered to be}} the standout. Following the critics screening of Prometheus in May 2012, critics from a number of media companies, including /Film and Screen International, proclaimed Fassbender to have been the highlight of the film. Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine lauded Fassbender for being able to emulate uncanny valley through his mannerisms alone and ranked David as being the greatest portrayal of an android to date. Philip French from The Guardian praised the character for being a cross between the fictional valet Jeeves, created by P. G. Wodehouse, and a double agent commonly found in an English Renaissance theatre production. French further complimented the character for paying homage to T. E. Lawrence by being portrayed as a <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> caught between two cultures- the parallel in Prometheus being that David is caught between humanity and synthetics. Referencing the Titan Prometheus of Greek mythology, Kwaak Je-yup stated in his review of Prometheus that Fassbender [...] "steals fire" [...] in every scene, upstaging Noomi Rapace's leading performance as Shaw.|$|E

[...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her. Sharma explained: [...] "He is ready to test her promise to the limits! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab's buttons, and now he's going {{to take full advantage of}} the fact that she won't let herself be the <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> she normally likes to be!"

She added that the look that Eric Singleton gave Detective Baker was [...] "positively evil". She praised the interaction between the Megan and the rest of the main cast, saying, [...] "We got to know more about the cast of characters in Megan's office and Curtis was the standout. Last week Megan questioned Curtis' abilities as a doctor.

500|$|The sixth season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the media. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said, [...] "Wrapping up plot lines so quickly creates {{a bit of}} disappointment for audiences. Typically, season finales end with exciting cliffhangers to entice fan interest. Degrassi’s finale really had no loose ends. There is no pending excitement for fans and the two-part finale became a disappointment. The episodes felt more like a series finale rather than just a season ending." [...] In his end of year review, Joel Rubnoff of the Waterloo Region Record said Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was one of the}} best shows of 2007, adding, [...] "The greatest teen show on the planet rediscovers its mojo with a same sex romance between <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> Paige and teen rebel Alexa. The year's most compelling—and bittersweet—love story." [...] AfterEllen.com, a website which focuses on the portrayal of lesbian and bisexual women in the media, and owned by MTV Networks' Logo cable television network reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi: The Next Generation lesbian characters. [...] "Paige and Alex's relationship, developed over three seasons, has become one of the best portrayals of a lesbian teen relationship we've seen on American television," [...] said Sarah Warn, the website's Editor in Chief, before giving the series an [...] "A" [...] Grade for the portrayal of class issues, character development, sexual orientation, dialogue, the relationship and lesbian sex.|$|E
500|$|Although Monica and Rachel have {{remained}} best friends since high school, {{they are very}} much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on [...] "different ends {{of the high school}} social order," [...] with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica [...] "deal with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen." [...] Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that [...] "Monica’s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, as well as more prepared for adulthood." [...] Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the [...] "perfect match". Michael Hogan of The Guardian believes that the character's [...] "competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef." [...] However, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode [...] "The One With the Prom Video" [...] via flashback. One of the character's childhood nicknames was [...] "Big Fat Goalie" [...] when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make fun of her appearance. Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica's tendency to come off as a <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order [...] "to cope with her emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through {{a tour de force}} of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious <b>control</b> <b>freak</b> with no regard for human life", Porky, {{by the end of the}} series' Mother 3.|$|E
