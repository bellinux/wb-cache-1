No previously existing method appears to make this assessment easily available. This thesis predicts that architecture will fail in some combination of eleven predictable ways that a simple robot can observe and distinguish by measuring the slope of select points on the floor. This prediction was tested on a case study house, and the model predicted 78. 7 % of the observed contour. A compact robot was fabricated and measurements of inclination were compared with those of a standard digital inclinometer. The ratio of the angle measured with the robot to that measured with the inclinometer was found to be 1. 034 ± 0. 193. This proof-of-concept study indicates that an inexpensive robot could be developed as a commercial product capable of assessing the structural safety of common houses. by Noah <b>S.</b> <b>Caplan.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), oleic acid, and chloroform is further investigated by measuring {{in the presence}} of a certain concentration of each type of uncoupler (i) the mitochondrial P/O and respiratory control ratios upon progressive inhibition of the redox pumps and (ii) delta mu H and the rate of either electron transfer or adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis in static head upon progressive inhibition of either the redox or the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) proton pumps. Chloroform exhibits in all the experiments a behavior very different from that of FCCP and oleic acid. For example, upon addition of antimycin to chloroform-supplemented mitochondria, the respiratory control ratio remains unchanged and the P/O ratio slightly increases (in a certain range of inhibition) instead of decreasing as expected for an increased membrane conductance (and as indeed measured {{in the presence of}} either FCCP or oleic acid). From the kinetic model of chemiosmotic free energy coupling described by Pietrobon and Caplan [Pietrobon, D., & <b>Caplan,</b> <b>S.</b> R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 7690 - 7696] all the results can be simulated by making the assumptions that (i) chloroform acts specifically at the level of the proton pumps and intrinsically uncouples electron transfer and ATP hydrolysis/synthesis from proton translocation and (ii) FCCP and oleic acid have a mixed behavior and act both as protonophores and as intrinsic uncouplers of the redox pumps (but not of the ATPases).

In the present report we document a systematic time-course study of the posterior segment changes in the Lewis rat. The disease varied somewhat in severity in animals sacrificed at identical times after immunisation. In the prodromal stage of the disease, usually around day 14, early pathological changes included mild peripapillary vasculitis and low grade mononuclear and neutrophilic infiltration of the subretinal space with phagocytosis of the rod outer segments. The features of the severe or active diseases were most evident on day 21 and included mixed cellular infiltrate of the vitreous, subretinal serohaemorrhagic exudate, focal retinal detachment and necrosis. Outer retinal destruction was often most severe adjacent areas of retinal vasculitis. Focal monocytic subpigment epithelial microgranulomas, reminiscent of Dalen-Fuch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>nodules</b> in humans, were also identified. By day 28 and 49 active inflammation had subsided and large segments of the outer retina were completely destroyed. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also showed signs of activation in the vicinity of focal retinochoroidal mononuclear infiltrates including multilayering, proliferation and increased phagocytosis.

40|$|This work builds upon an {{adaptive}} simulation framework {{to allow for}} mixed-element meshes in two dimensions. Contributions are focused {{in the area of}} mesh generation which employs the Lk norm to produce various mesh types. Mixed-element meshes are obtained by first using the L[alpha] norm to create a right-triangulation which is then combined to form quadrilaterals through a graph-matching approach. The resulting straight-sided mesh is then curved using a nonlinear elasticity analogy. Since the element sizes and orientations are prescribed to the mesh generator through a field of Riemannian metric tensors, the adaptation algorithm used to compute this field is also discussed. The algorithm is first tested through the L² error control of isotropic and anisotropic problems and shows that optimal mesh gradings can be obtained. Problems drawn from aerodynamics are then used to demonstrate the ability of the algorithm in practical applications. With mixed element meshes, the adaptation algorithm works well in practice, however, improvements can be made in the cost and error models. In fact, using the L[alpha]-generated meshes inherits the same properties of traditional triangulations while adding structure to the mesh. The use of the L[alpha]-norm in generating tetrahedral meshes is worth pursuing in the future. by Philip Claude Delhaye <b>Caplan.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2014.

We examined whether the effect of sulphate addition on N fixation resulted from a stimulation of host plant growth, a specific effect of S on nodulation, or a specific effect of <b>S</b> on <b>nodule</b> metabolism. Clones of white clover, inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum, were grown for 140 d in a hydroponic system with three levels of sulphate concentration (0 mM, 0. 095 mM, and 0. 380 mM). Nodule morphological and biochemical traits, such as root length, nodule biomass and volume, nodule protein contents (nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin obtained by an immunological approach), and root amino acid concentrations, were used to analyse the effect of sulphate availability on N 2 fixation. The application of sulphate increased whole plant dry mass, root length, and nodule biomass, expressed on a root-length basis. N uptake proved less sensitive than N 2 fixation {{to the effects of}} S-deficiency, and decreased {{as a consequence of the}} lower root length observed in S-deficient plants. N 2 fixation was drastically reduced in S-deficient plants as a consequence of a low nodule development, but also due to low nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin production. This effect is likely to be due to down-regulation by a N-feedback mechanism, as, under severe S-deficiency, the high concentration of whole plant N and the accumulation of N-rich amino acids (such as asparagine) indicated that the assimilation of N exceeded the amount required for plant growth...|$|R

The callus, {{which would not}} grow {{in the absence of}} the added auxin, was much firmer in texture than a sycamore callus (S 2) isolated in this laboratory in 1958 which has not been induced to differentiate. When kinetin over the range 0 - 05 - 0 - 5 mg/ 1. was included in the growth medium of <b>S</b> 4 <b>nodules</b> of xylem and phloem were induced within the tissue and roots frequently grew from the surface of the callus. Some roots developed geotropic sensitivity although the majority grew radially outwards from the callus surface. The roots also varied with respect to the number of root hairs they carried. No roots were produced at sucrose concentrations less than 2 %, although histological examination revealed extensive xylem and phloem differentiation relative to the amount of growth which had taken place. When sugars other than sucrose were supplied in the medium at a concentration of 3 % (w/v) roots were also induced in those calluses where the carbon source had supported good growth. Sucrose, glucose and fructose were identified in the ethanol-soluble extracts of all these calluses. Radioactivity was incorporated into sucrose when S 4 was incubated on a medium con-taining D-[U- 14 C]glucose for 24 h.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is a potent}} proangiogenic factor {{associated}} with tumor development. Spirocerca lupi is a nematode of canids that induces an esophageal nodule that progresses to a sarcoma in 25 % of cases. Determination of neoplastic transformation is challenging and usually based on endoscopy-guided biopsies under general anesthesia, an expensive procedure that often yields nondiagnostic, necrotic samples. HYPOTHESIS : Circulatory VEGF concentrations are increased in dogs with neoplastic spirocercosis and can distinguish between dogs with neoplastic and nonneoplastic disease. ANIMALS : A total of 24 client-owned dogs, 9 nonneoplastic, 9 neoplastic, and 6 controls. METHODS : Case-control study. Plasma and serum VEGF concentrations {{at the time of}} diagnosis were compared with those of healthy controls. Measurement of VEGF was performed using a canine-specific ELISA. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests were used for statistical analysis with significance set at P <. 05. RESULTS : The median plasma VEGF concentrations of dogs with neoplastic spirocercosis were 629 pg/mL (range, 282 – 2, 366) higher than both the nonneoplastic (< 39. 5 pg/mL; range, < 39. 5 – 716) and control dogs (< 39. 5 pg/mL; all values, < 39. 5; P =. 0003). The median serum VEGF concentration of the neoplastic dogs was 69 pg/mL (range, < 39. 5 – 212) higher than the nonneoplastic (< 39. 5 pg/mL; range, < 39. 5 – 44. 13) and control dogs (< 39. 5 pg/mL; all values, < 39. 5; P =. 001).

The ΔparA mutant showed a pleiomorphic cell shape phenotype and was polyploid, with differences in nucleoid sizes due to dramatic defects in chromosome partitioning. Upon inoculation of the ΔparA mutant onto the stem of Sesbania rostrata, three types of immature nodule-like structures with impaired nitrogen-fixing activity were generated. Most showed signs of bacteroid early senescence. Moreover, the ΔparA cells within the nodule-like structures exhibited multiple developmental-stage phenotypes. Since the bacA gene has been considered an indicator for bacteroid formation, we applied the expression pattern of bacA as a nodule maturity index in this study. Our data indicate that the bacA gene expression is parA dependent in symbiosis. The presence of the parA gene transcript was inversely correlated with the maturity of nodule; the transcript was switched off in fully mature bacteroids. In summary, our experimental evidence demonstrates that the parA gene not only plays crucial roles in cellular development when the microbe is free-living but also negatively regulates bacteroid formation in <b>S.</b> rostrata stem <b>nodules...</b>|$|R

Over 26, 000 clones were differentially screened by two rounds of macroarray hybridizations.

40|$|Nodulation factor (NF) signal {{transduction}} in the legume-rhizobium symbiosis involves calcium oscillations that are instrumental in eliciting nodulation. To date, Ca 2 + spiking {{has been studied}} exclusively in the intracellular bacterial invasion of growing root hairs in zone I. This mechanism {{is not the only}} one by which rhizobia gain entry into their hosts; the tropical legume Sesbania rostrata can be invaded intercellularly by rhizobia at cracks caused by lateral root emergence, and this process is associated with cell death for formation of infection pockets. We show that epidermal cells at lateral root bases respond to NFs with Ca 2 + oscillations that are faster and more symmetrical than those observed during root hair invasion. Enhanced jasmonic acid or reduced ethylene levels slowed down the Ca 2 + spiking frequency and stimulated intracellular root hair invasion by rhizobia, but prevented nodule formation. Hence, intracellular invasion in root hairs is linked with a very specific Ca 2 + signature. In parallel experiments, we found that knockdown of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene of <b>S.</b> rostrata abolished <b>nodule</b> development but not the formation of infection pockets by intercellular invasion at lateral root bases, suggesting that the colonization of the outer cortex is independent of Ca 2 + spiking decoding...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{symbiotic}} legume nodules, endosymbiotic rhizobia (bacteroids) fix atmospheric N 2, an ATP-dependent catalytic process yielding stoichiometric ammonium {{and hydrogen}} gas (H 2). While in most legume nodules this H 2 is quantitatively evolved, which loss drains metabolic energy, certain bacteroid strains employ uptake hydrogenase activity and thus evolve {{little or no}} H 2. Rather, endogenous H 2 is efficiently respired {{at the expense of}} O 2, driving oxidative phosphorylation, recouping ATP used for H 2 production, and increasing the efficiency of symbiotic nodule N 2 fixation. In many ensuing investigations since its discovery as a physiological process, bacteroid uptake hydrogenase activity has been presumed a single entity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Azorhizobium caulinodans, the nodule endosymbiont of Sesbania rostrata stems and roots, possesses both orthodox respiratory (exo-) hydrogenase and novel (endo-) hydrogenase activities. These two respiratory hydrogenases are structurally quite distinct and encoded by disparate, unlinked gene-sets. As shown here, in <b>S.</b> rostrata symbiotic <b>nodules,</b> haploid A. caulinodans bacteroids carrying single knockout alleles in either exo- or-endohydrogenase structural genes, like the wild-type parent, evolve no detectable H 2 and thus are fully competent for endogenous H 2 recycling. Whereas, nodules formed with A. caulinodans exo-, endo-hydrogenase double-mutants evolve endogenous H 2 quantitatively and thus suffer complete loss of H 2 recycling capability.

The Ca, Fe-rich nodule superficially resembles a clast that pre-dated and was engulfed by the CAI, but closer inspection shows that relic spinel grains are enclosed in the nodule, and corroded CAI primary phases interfinger with the Fe-rich phases at the <b>nodule</b> <b>s</b> margins. This CAI also contains abundant sodalite and nepheline (alkali-halide) alteration that occurs around the rims of the CAI, but also penetrates more deeply into the CAI. The two types of alteration (Ca-Fe and alkali-halide) are adjacent, and very fine-grained Fe-rich phases are associated with sodalite-rich regions. Both types of alteration appear to be replacive; if that is true, it would require substantial introduction of Fe, and transport of elements (Ti, Al and Mg) out of the nodule, and introduction of Na and Cl into alkali-halide rich zones. Parts of the CAI have been extensively metasomatized...|$|R
40|$|Sucrose synthase (SS) is a known phosphoserine (SerP) -containing enzyme in {{a variety}} of plant “sink” organs, {{including}} legume root nodules, where it is phosphorylated primarily at Ser- 11. Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we documented that part of the total SS (nodulin- 100) pool in mature soybean (Glycine max) nodules is apparently associated with the plasma membrane in situ, and we report that this association is very “tight,” as evidenced by a variety of chemical and enzymatic pretreatments of the isolated microsomal fraction. To investigate the in situ and in planta phosphorylation state of the membrane (m) and soluble (<b>s)</b> forms of <b>nodule</b> SS, three complementary approaches were used. First, excised nodules were radiolabeled in situ with [32 P]Pi for subsequent analysis of phosphorylated m- and s-SS; second, immunopurified s- and m-SS were used as substrate in “on-bead” assays of phosphorylation by nodule Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinase; and third, SS-Ser- 11 (P) phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were developed and used. The collective results provide convincing evidence that microsomal nodulin- 100 is phosphorylated in mature nodules, and that it is hypophosphorylated relative to s-SS (on an equivalent SS protein basis) in attached, unstressed nodules. Moreover, the immunological data and related phosphopeptide mapping analyses indicate that a homologous N-terminal seryl-phosphorylation domain and site reside in microsomal nodulin- 100. We also observed that mild, short-term inorganic nitrogen and salt stresses have a significant negative impact on the content and N-terminal phosphorylation state of nodule m- and s-SS, with the former being the more sensitive of the two SS forms...|$|R
30|$|A 64 -year-old {{woman with}} {{spontaneous}} menopause at age 50 was referred for increasing pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and repetitive constipation which had started some 5 [*]years ago. She was a G 3 P 1 A 2 with menarche at 11 [*]years {{of age and}} a BMI of 37. At age 51, she had been operated for abdominal pain, nausea, and a large endometriotic mass close to the left kidney with signs of renal failure. An abdominal total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and left nephrectomy had confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. She never had taken HRT, and the vaginal epithelium was atrophic. Clinical exam revealed a large painful nodule. MRI showed two nodules: one large nodule in the pouch of Douglas, invading the vaginal cuff and left parametrium and extending up to the hypogastric plexus and the left sacral nerves (S 3 and <b>S</b> 4); another <b>nodule</b> of 37 [*]×[*] 32 [*]×[*] 14  mm {{was seen in the}} rectum at 7.9 [*]cm from the anal border, infiltrating the muscularis and submucosa. Transvaginal ultrasound examination confirmed a 35 [*]×[*] 28 [*]×[*] 23  mm nodule in the vaginal cuff and a 41 [*]×[*] 10 [*]×[*] 19  mm nodule in the recto-sigmoid, compromising 50 % of the circumference, infiltrating the muscularis and submucosa at 9 [*]cm from the anal border. A laparoscopic segmental bowel resection and resection of the deep endometriosis nodule invading the pelvic floor, the sacral nerves, and the left sciatic nerve confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged on day 5 and is pain free for 5 [*]months.|$|R
40|$|RAC/ROP {{proteins}} (ρ-related GTPases of plants) are plant-specific small G {{proteins that}} function as molecular switches within elementary signal transduction pathways, including {{the regulation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during early microbial infection via the activation of NADPH oxidase homologs of plants termed RBOH (for respiratory burst oxidase homolog). We investigated the role of Medicago truncatula Jemalong A 17 small GTPase MtROP 9, orthologous to Medicago sativa Rac 1, via an RNA interference silencing approach. Composite M. truncatula plants (MtROP 9 i) whose roots have been transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying the RNA interference vector were generated and infected with the symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Glomus intraradices and the rhizobial bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti {{as well as with}} the pathogenic oomycete Aphanomyces euteiches. MtROP 9 i transgenic lines showed a clear growth-reduced phenotype and revealed neither ROS generation nor MtROP 9 and MtRBOH gene expression after microbial infection. Coincidently, antioxidative compounds were not induced in infected MtROP 9 i roots, as documented by differential proteomics (two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis). Furthermore, MtROP 9 knockdown clearly promoted mycorrhizal and A. euteiches early hyphal root colonization, while rhizobial infection was clearly impaired. Infected MtROP 9 i roots showed, in part, extremely swollen noninfected root hairs and reduced numbers of deformed <b>nodules.</b> <b>S.</b> meliloti nodulation factor treatments of MtROP 9 i led to deformed root hairs showing progressed swelling of its upper regions or even of the entire root hair and spontaneous constrictions but reduced branching effects occurring only at swollen root hairs. These results suggest a key role of Rac 1 GTPase MtROP 9 in ROS-mediated early infection signaling...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a recombinant defective adenovirus that expresses functional murine IFN-gamma-inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10) chemokine (AdCMVIP- 10). Injection of AdCMVIP- 10 into <b>s.</b> c. tumor <b>nodules</b> {{derived from the}} CT 26 murine colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line displayed some antitumor activity {{but it was not}} curative in most cases. Previous studies have shown that injection of similar s. c. CT 26 tumor nodules with adenovirus-encoding IL- 12 (AdCMVIL- 12) induces tumor regression in nearly 70 % of cases in association with generation of antitumor CTL activity. AdCMVIP- 10 synergizes with the antitumor effect of suboptimal doses of AdCMVIL- 12, reaching 100 % of tumor eradication not only against injected, but also against distant noninjected tumor nodules. Colocalization of both adenoviruses at the same tumor nodule was required for the local and distant therapeutic effects. Importantly, intratumoral gene transfer with IL- 12 and IP- 10 generated a powerful tumor-specific CTL response in a synergistic fashion, while both CD 4 and CD 8 T cells appeared in the infiltrate of regressing tumors. Moreover, the antitumor activity of IP- 10 plus IL- 12 combined gene therapy was greatly diminished by simultaneous in vivo depletion of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells but was largely unaffected by single depletion of each T cell subset. An important role for NK cells was also suggested by asialo GM 1 depletion experiments. From a clinical point of view, the effects of IP- 10 permit one to lower the required gene transfer level of IL- 12, thus preventing dose-dependent IL- 12 -mediated toxicity while improving the therapeutic efficacy of the elicited antitumor response...|$|R
40|$|Sinorhizobium meliloti forms a {{symbiosis}} with Medicago {{species of}} legumes. Within the legume root <b>nodules,</b> <b>S.</b> meliloti differentiates into a bacteroid, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for the legume. The legume produces hundreds of nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides, which mediate bacteroid differentiation. The S. meliloti BacA protein {{was the first}} bacterial factor identified to be essential for bacteroid development. BacA sensitises S. meliloti to certain antimicrobial peptides and influences the modification of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA). Therefore, {{it is thought that}} either the peptide uptake function or the role of BacA in LPS VLCFA decoration could be essential for survival of S. meliloti within the legume. In this PhD project, a role for BacA in the response of S. meliloti towards NCR peptides was investigated. It was determined that BacA protects S. meliloti from NCR-induced cell death. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} structure and composition of the LPS plays a key role in the response of S. meliloti to NCR peptides. It was also shown that the peptide uptake function of BacA was conserved among different rhizobia. The role and biosynthesis of the LPS VLCFA in bacteroid development was also explored. It was determined that the acyltransferase but not the acyl-carrier-protein, was essential for the biosynthesis of VLCFA modified LPS in planta. Six genes, located in a gene cluster were proposed to be involved in the LPS VLCFA biosynthesis in rhizobia and my research found that this was the case. The outcome of this research has provided important insights into the mechanism of prolonged bacterial-host infections and the biosynthesis of unusual lipids.

Functional {{plasticity}} of Trifolium repens L. {{in response}} to sulphur and nitrogen availability. Plant and Soil, 317, (1 - 2), 189 - 200. IMPF: 02. 52 RONO: 1330 2406 Recent control of atmospheric SO 2 pollution is leading to important soil sulphur impoverishment. Plasticity could be a mechanism allowing species to adapt to this rapid global change. Trifolium repens L. is a key grassland species whose performances in community are strongly linked to nitrogen availability. Plasticity of three white clover lines contrasting {{in their ability to}} use atmospheric N 2 or soil N was assessed by analysing a set of functional traits along a gradient of nitrogen and sulphur fertilisation applied on a poor soil. White clover traits showed high morphological and physiological plasticity. Nitrogen appeared to be the most limiting factor for the VLF (Very Low Fixation) line. S was the element that modulated the most traits for the nitrogen fixing lines NNU (Normal Nitrate Uptake) and LNU (Low Nitrate Uptake). As expected, N fertilisation inhibited white clover fixation, but we also observed that N 2 fixation was enhanced when S was added. <b>S</b> fertilisation increased <b>nodule</b> length as well as the proportion of <b>nodules</b> containing leghaemoglobin. <b>S</b> fertilisation, with a direct effect and an indirect effect through N 2 fixation, increases white clover performances particularly with regards to photosynthesis and potential vegetative reproduction. The important plasticity {{in response to}} S availability should allow it to adapt to a large range of abiotic conditions, but its sensitivity to S nutrition would be a disadvantage for competition in a situation of soil sulphur impoverishment. In contrast, S fertilisation could help maintain this species when nitrogen status is against it. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{genesis of}} {{ferruginous}} nodules and pisoliths in soils and weathering profiles of coastal {{southern and eastern}} Australia has long been debated. It {{is not clear whether}} iron (Fe) nodules are redox accumulations, residues of Miocene laterite duricrust, or the products of contemporary weathering of Fe-rich sedimentary rocks. This study combines a catchment-wide survey of Fe nodule distribution in Poona Creek catchment (Fraser Coast, Queensland) with detailed investigations of a representative ferric soil profile to show that Fe nodules are derived from Fe-rich sandstones. Where these crop out, they are broken down, transported downslope by colluvial processes, and redeposited. Chemical and physical weathering transforms these eroded rock fragments into non-magnetic Fe nodules. Major features of this transformation include lower hematite/goethite and kaolinite/gibbsite ratios, increased porosity, etching of quartz grains, and development of rounded morphology and a smooth outer cortex. Iron nodules are commonly concentrated in ferric horizons. We show that these horizons form as the result of differential biological mixing of the soil. Bioturbation gradually buries nodules and rock fragments deposited at the surface of the soil, resulting in a largely nodule-free ‘biomantle’ over a ferric ‘stone line’. Maghemite-rich magnetic nodules are a prominent feature of the upper half of the profile. These are most likely formed by the thermal alteration of non-magnetic nodules located {{at the top of the}} profile during severe bushfires. They are subsequently redistributed through the soil profile by bioturbation. Iron nodules occurring in the study area are products of contemporary weathering of Fe-rich rock units. They are not laterite duricrust residues nor are they redox accumulations, although redox-controlled dissolution/re-precipitation is an important component of post-depositional modification of these Fe <b>nodules.</b> <b>S.</b> C.

40|$|Several faecal {{examination}} {{techniques have}} shown variable sensitivity in demonstrating Spirocerca lupi (S. lupi) eggs. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine which faecal examination technique, including a novel modified centrifugal flotation technique, was most sensitive to diagnose spirocercosis. Ten coproscopic examinations were performed on faeces collected from 33 dogs confirmed endoscopically to have spirocercosis. The tests included a direct faecal examination, a faecal sedimentation/flotation test, 4 direct faecal flotations and 4 modified faecal centrifugal flotations. These latter 2 flotation tests utilised 4 different faecal flotation solutions:NaNO 3 (SG 1. 22),MgSO 4 (SG 1. 29),ZnSO 4 (SG 1. 30) and sugar (SG 1. 27). The sensitivity of the tests ranged between 42 %and 67 %, with theNaNO 3 solution showing the highest sensitivity in both the direct and modified-centrifugal flotations. The modified NaNO 3 centrifugal method ranked 1 st with the highest mean egg count (45. 24 ± 83), and was superior (i. e. higher egg count) and significantly different (P&lt; 0. 05) compared with the routine saturated sugar,ZnSO 4 andMgSO 4 flotation methods. The routine NaNO 3 flotation method was also superior and significantly different (P &lt; 0. 05) compared with the routine ZnSO 4 andMgSO 4 flotation methods. Fifteen per cent (n= 5) of dogs had neoplastic oesophageal nodules and a further 18 % (n = 6) had both neoplastic and non-neoplastic <b>nodules.</b> <b>S.</b> lupi eggs were demonstrated in 40 %of dogs with neoplastic nodules only and 72. 9 % of the dogs with non-neoplastic nodules. The mean egg count in the non-neoplastic group (61) was statistically greater (P = 0. 02) than that of the neoplastic group (1). The results show that faecal examination using a NaNO 3 solution is the most sensitive in the diagnosis of spirocercosis. The modified centrifugal flotation faecal method using this solution has the highest egg count. The study also found that dogs with neoplastic nodules shed significantly fewer eggs than dogs with non-neoplastic nodules...|$|R
