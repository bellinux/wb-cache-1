Immunohistochemical localization of the enzyme in the muscles of these animals was also determined. Results The levels of CA-III in the tensor fasciae latae and the superficial pectoral muscles of the DA <b>chickens</b> were higher than the level in normal <b>chickens.</b> The concentrations of CA-III in erythrocytes and plasma from diseased <b>chickens</b> were approximately 15 -fold and 1. 4 -fold higher than in the normal <b>chickens,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of reoviruses in commercial <b>chickens</b> with the runting/stunting syndrome, tenosynovitis, and normal <b>chickens</b> was investigated. Reoviruses were isolated from 3 -week-old <b>chickens</b> affected with the runting/stunting syndrome and from older <b>chickens</b> with tenosynovitis; viruses were isolated from tissues {{with and without}} lesions. Reoviruses were also frequently isolated from rectal contents of normal 3 -week-old <b>chickens,</b> and there was serological evidence of previous reovirus infection in all flocks of adult meat breeder <b>chickens</b> examined. The widespread occurrence of reoviruses in both normal and diseased <b>chickens</b> indicates that the isolation of reoviruses from tissues of <b>chickens</b> with lesions does not necessarily imply any aetiological relationship of reovirus with disease, {{even in the absence}} of other known causes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{neuraminidase}} inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir on the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in <b>chickens</b> was studied. Per group, five <b>chickens</b> inoculated with HPAI A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/ 1370 / 83 H 5 N 2 virus were placed 1 day post-inoculation (p. i.) in one cage with five contact <b>chickens.</b> Inoculated and contact <b>chickens</b> were treated twice daily from 1 day before inoculation up to day 7 p. i. All untreated inoculated and contact <b>chickens</b> became infected and four inoculated and two contact <b>chickens</b> died.

40|$|<b>Chickens</b> {{from two}} inbred lines {{selected}} for high (L 10 H) or low (L 10 L) mannose-binding lectin (MBL) serum concentrations were infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and innate {{as well as}} adaptive immunological parameters were measured throughout the experimental period. <b>Chickens</b> with high MBL serum concentrations {{were found to have}} less viral load in the trachea than <b>chickens</b> with low MBL serum concentrations indicating that these <b>chickens</b> were less severely affected by the infection. This study is the first to show that MBL expression is present in the lungs of healthy <b>chickens</b> and that the expression is upregulated at days 3 postinfection (p. i.) in L 10 H <b>chickens.</b> Furthermore, in the liver of infected <b>chickens,</b> the MBL expression was upregulated at day 7 p. i., {{despite the fact that the}} MBL serum concentrations were decreased below baseline at that time point. The number of TCR gamma delta+CD 8 alpha+ cells in the blood of noninfected <b>chickens</b> increased from week 0 to 3 p. i. However, the number of cells was higher in L 10 H <b>chickens</b> than in L 10 L <b>chickens</b> throughout the experiment. No increase was observed in the number of TCR gamma delta+CD 8 alpha+ cells in the blood of the infected L 10 H and L 10 L <b>chickens.</b> The numbers of B cells at week 3 p. i. were higher for noninfected L 10 L <b>chickens</b> than for the other <b>chickens.</b> No differences were observed between the infected and noninfected L 10 H <b>chickens</b> or between the infected L 10 H and L 10 L <b>chickens.</b> Furthermore, at week 3 p. i., the number of monocytes was higher in infected and noninfected L 10 H <b>chickens</b> than in the infected and noninfected L 10 L <b>chickens.</b> Thus, these results indicate that MBL is produced locally and may be involved in the regulation of the cellular immune response after an IBV infection.

The mean haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer in sera of 14 -day-old progeny <b>chickens</b> was approximately 8 -fold lower than the mean titer in sera of vaccinated dams. After H 5 N 1 infection at the age of 14 days, <b>chickens</b> with maternal antibody titers lived a few days longer than control <b>chickens.</b> However, only a low percentage of <b>chickens</b> with maternal immunity survived challenge with H 5 N 1.
