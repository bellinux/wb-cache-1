ECSOD has been used in gene therapy of diseases involving oxidative stress. 4 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells from bone marrow. These cells have advantages over other stem cells in that they can be easily isolated from patients or donors, readily expanded ex vivo, and efficiently gene engineered. Therefore, MSCs hold promise as vehicles for adult stem cell–based gene therapy. 5 To test the hypothesis that MSCs genetically modified with ECSOD have a radioprotective effect, mouse MSCs (mMSCs) were isolated by their adherence to tissue-culture plastic from 6 -week-old female BALB/c mice and ex vivo expanded as previously described. 6, 7 The cells were differentiated into osteoblasts and adipocytes in vitro, and cell pheno-type was analyzed by flow cytometry.

40|$|The {{concept that}} {{the immune system}} is {{involved}} in defence against cancer goes back nearly a hundred years. Despite increased sophistication in our analysis of the immune response it has proven difficult to demonstrate a powerful role {{of the immune system}} in either the prevention or treatment of cancer. Animal data has consistently and clearly shown that the immune system can identify and reject experimental tumours. In patients the data is more conflicting. The isolation of individual cytokines which stimulate specific components of the immune response and have a anti-cancer effect does suggest, however, that as we learn more about the interaction between immunity and cancer, novel methods for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer will be developed. To trigger any form of immune modulation an interaction must take place between some component of the immune response and a target antigen. Tumours possess a range of proteins not normally expressed in the host animal. These include a variety of viruses, e. g. hepatitis B, Epstein Barr virus; tumour neoantigens, such as tumour specific transplantation antigens (TSTAs); and other com-ponents. These are not normally present in the host <b>cells</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). In addition to these new antigens a whole range of normal cellular antigens may be expressed appropriately, such as prostate specific antigen in prostate cancer, or inappropriately, such as carcinoem-bryonic antigen in colorectal cancer.

30|$|SIRT 3 {{is known}} to {{play a crucial role}} in {{maintenance}} of mitochondrial proteostasis. Proteomic analysis showed that multiple subunits of respiratory complex IV were down-regulated in SIRT 3 -OE cells, which compromised the integrity and assembly of respiratory complexes, leading to over-production of ROS (Fig.  1 D). Excessive ROS can negatively regulate cell growth and may activate the Nrf 2 /Keap 1 pathway that protects SIRT 3 -OE cells from oxidative stress (Fig.  1 E). An alternative explanation for the high resistance to oxidative stress exhibited in SIRT 3 -OE cells is that deacetylation of antioxidant proteins by SIRT 3 enhances their enzymatic activities, which needs to be confirmed in the future study. Three key proteins in fatty acid β-oxidation pathway were also down-regulated in SIRT 3 -OE <b>cells</b> (<b>Table</b> S 2). Growth and proliferation of tumor cells require fatty acids for synthesis of membranes and signaling molecules. Disruption of fatty acid oxidation pathway causes a decrease in both acetyl-CoA production that is essential for the de novo lipid synthesis and NADH and FADH 2 generation that are important for ATP and citrate production (Carracedo et al., 2013). Moreover, SIRT 3 -meidated disruption of fatty acid β-oxidation can lead to the accumulation of fatty acids to induce lipotoxicity. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK 1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) were found to be downregulated in SIRT 3 -OE cells as confirmed by qPCR and Western blotting. CDK 4 is associated with D-type cyclins to promote cell-cycle entry and progression through G 1 by inactivating the retinoblastoma protein Rb (Sherr and Roberts, 1999). SIRT 3 -induced CDK 4 downregulation causes the prolonged G 1 cell cycle arrest that contributes to the slower growth of SIRT 3 -OE cells as compared to the control cells.|$|E

We thank Dr Brodlie and coworkers for their letter 1 and fully {{agree on the}} necessity to evaluate whether cells other than lymphocytes and macrophages are involved in IL- 17 release in sarcoid lungs. The main manifestation of sarcoidosis is an accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells, mostly CD 4 + T cells and monocytes/macrophages in involved organs, including the lungs. 2 As specified in our ‘Materials and methods’ section, we evaluated cells obtained by filtering bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid through gauze. A standard morphological and immunological analysis of BAL cellular components was performed. The analysis included cell recovery and differential count of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils (table 1) coupled with a flow cytometry analysis of BAL <b>cells.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 integrates information given in our published paper, 2 clearly demonstrating {{that the number of}} BAL neutrophils was fair in our case series. This unfortunately prevented a definitive evaluation of whether polymorph nucleates represent a source of IL- 17. Nonetheless, as shown in figure 1, in selected cases with a significant number of BAL neutrophils (two subjects) a certain degree of IL- 17 expression was shown. Experiments are in progress in our lab aimed at evaluating the role of the IL- 17 and neutrophil interaction in fibrogenic diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), including sarcoidosis. In fact, neutrophils are known to {{play a crucial role in}} alveolar injury mechanisms in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other types of DPLD.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Gene {{transfer}} of osteoinductive agents {{is being developed}} {{for a variety of}} orthopaedic applications includine spine fusion and treatment of non-union fractions and craniofacial defects. Human Lim Mineralization Protein- 3 (hLMP- 3) is an osteoinductive agent coded by one of the three LMP gene splice variants. We have previously demonstrated that LMP- 3 upregulates bone-specific genes in murine fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) following adenoviral gene transfer and can induce bone formation in murine models, similar to BMPs, following in vivo and ex vivo delivery approaches. Recently, microarray analysis has been used to identify new early regulators of BMPs-induced osteoblast differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the gene expression profile of hMSCs expressing hLMP 3 in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in LMP 3 -induced osteogenesis. METHODS: hMSCs were transduced with 1000 MOI (particles per cell) of a defective adenoviral vector carrying either the hLMP 3 codon-optimized sequenze (AdLMP 3) or the green fluorescent protein (AdEGFP). Cells transduced with an empty adenoviral vector (Ad 5) and untransduced cells served as additional controls. mRNA was isolated from cells 24 hrs post-transduction and transgene expression was assessed by RT-PCR using sequence-specific primers. RNA was then reverse-transcripted, labeled and amplified for microarray expression analysis. Replicate experiments were performed in order to increase singificance and control reproducibility. The microarray analysis was performed by a specific software based on GC-RMA algorythms for normalization and filtering. Analysis of variance was performed on filtered data by means of t-Test. RESULTS: 189 out of 8793 genes spotted on the array were modulated inLMP 3 - transduced cells by more than 1. 2 fold change. Crossed normalization against Ad 5 - and mock-transduced cells data showed a smaller set of genes (25) exhibiting significant (p< 0. 01) differential expression in AD.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{has been}} implicated {{in a number of}} {{pathological}} diseases and oxidative stress has been proposed as one of its mechanisms of toxicity. In this present study, the toxic effect of 5, 10 and 50 μM of cadmium as cadmium chloride was investigated in three human cell lines: human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG 2), human astrocytoma cells (1321 N 1) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Antioxidant defence responses of these cells were determined in order to evaluate the extent of oxidative stress induced by this metal after 24 hrs exposure. Results indicate that CdCl 2 decreases the viability of all three cells in a dose-dependent manner in agreement with earlier reports of Fotakis and Timbrell (2006). However it is clear that HepG 2 cells are more sensitive (EC 50 = 13. 96 μM) than 1321 N 1 (EC 50 = 19. 92 μM) and HEK 293 (EC 50 = 221. 8 μM) cells. This may be related to increased uptake, as it has been observed that Cd preferentially accumulates in liver cells in vivo. Increase LDH leakage has earlier been reported to be associated with CdCl 2 induced toxicity (Bradley et al., 1987). Table 1 shows a significant increase in LDH leakage in all the three cells at 50 μM. An increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was also significant in HepG 2 cells but was not significant in 1321 N 1 and HEK 293 cells. This implies that ROS production may not be involve in CdCl 2 induced toxicity in 1321 N 1 and HEK 293 cells. The results also show that CdCl 2 does not deplete GSH in HepG 2 cells but does deplete GSH in 1321 N 1 and HEK 293 <b>cells</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde MDA levels at 50 μM exposure in all the three cells. The results also show {{a significant increase in the}} activities of the antioxidant enzymes; GST, GPx, SOD and catalase in the three cell lines at 50 μM CdCl 2 with the exception of glutathione reductase in HepG 2 cells and catalase in 1321 N 1 cells.

40|$|Nanomaterials {{are already}} {{impacting}} on virtually {{all sectors of}} industrial and domestic products (cosmetics, clothing, personal care, sporting goods, sunscreens, filtration, electronics and computers, food and beverage), and their production and marketing will increase in the coming years. Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 -NPs) are produced on an industrial scale and are an addition to {{a growing number of}} commercial products. SiO 2 -NPs also have great potential for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in medicine. Contrary to the well-studied crystalline micron-sized silica, relatively little information exists on the toxicity of its amorphous and nano-size forms. Because nanoparticles possess novel properties, kinetics and unusual bioactivity, their potential biological effects may differ greatly from those of micron-size bulk materials. The objectives of this project is to determine: (1) which physico-chemical characteristics of nanoparticles direct the toxicity;(2) which mechanisms are involved in the toxicity of silica nanoparticles. The strategy of the presented doctoral project was to conduct toxicity studies with a very carefully characterized model material  silicon dioxide (silica) nanoparticles (SiO 2 -NPs). The general (cyto) toxicity of these particles was assessed and two specific mechanisms were Investigated; oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. The effect that monodisperse amorphous spherical silica particles of different sizes have on the viability of endothelial cells (EA. hy 926 cell line) was investigated. The results indicate that exposure to silica nanoparticles causes cytotoxic damage (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release) and a decrease in cell survival (tetrazolium reduction, MTT assay) in the EA. hy 926 cell line in a dose- and size-related manner. Concentrations leading to a 50 % reduction in cell viability (TC 50) for the ranged from 33 µg/cm² for the smallest particles (14 nm diameter) to 1087 µg/cm² for 335 nm diameter particles. The smaller particles also appear to affect the exposed cells faster, by necrosis, compared to the bigger particles. We showed that the surface area of monodisperse amorphous silica nanoparticles is an important parameter in determining the toxicity. A similar study has been undertaken using nanosized zeolite particles (crystalline silica particles). The synthesis of nanozeolites Y and A resulted in particle sizes of 25 - 100 nm and an adequate colloidal stability for in vitro cytotoxicity experiments. The cytotoxic response of macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells to these nanocrystals was also assessed by the MTT assay and the LDH leakage assay. After 24 h of exposure, no significant cytotoxic activity was detected for zeolite doses up to 500 μg/ml. Addition of fetal calf serum to the cell culture medium during exposure did not significantly change this low response. The nanozeolites are of low toxicity compared with monodisperse amorphous silica nanoparticles of similar size (60 nm). These results may contribute to the application of nanozeolites for purposes such as medical imaging, sensing materials, low-k films and molecular separation processes. The association of oxidative stress with SiO 2 -NPs induced cytotoxicity in human endothelial cells was studied with pure monodisperse amorphous silica nanoparticles of two sizes (16 and 60 nm; S 16 and S 60) and iron-doped nanosilica (19 nm; SFe). We found significant modifications in GSSG/total glutathione ratio and MDA and HAE concentrations only in cells treated with SFe nanoparticles. Significantly higher HO- 1 mRNA expression was found in endothelial cells after 6 h treatment with S 16 or SFe nanoparticles; no such up-regulation was seen with S 60 particles. Our study demonstrates that cytotoxicity occurs in endothelial cells exposed to pure SiO 2 -NPs in the absence of oxidative stress. There is evidence suggesting that nanoparticles can induce endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to vascular diseases. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of amorphous (monodisperse) SiO 2 -NPs of different sizes (28, 59 and 174 nm) on endothelial (EA. hy 926 cell line or primary hPAEC) cell function, in the absence or presence of a previously established in vitro human airway model consisting of triple cell co-cultures. At non-toxic concentrations, a significant increase (up to 2 -fold) in U 937 cell adhesion was observed. Exposure to all three SiO 2 -NPs induced expression of ICAM- 1 but no VCAM- 1 in the EA. hy 926 and ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 in hPAEC cultures. Experiments performed with fluorescently labeled amorphous monodisperse SiO 2 -NPs (24 nm) showed the uptake of the nanoparticles into the cytoplasm of both EC tested. We concluded that exposure of human endothelial cells to amorphous silica nanoparticles enhances adhesive properties of the studied <b>cells.</b> <b>TABLE</b> OF CONTENT List of abbreviations General introduction and objectives 1 Chapter 1 : The nanosilica hazard: another variable entity 31 Chapter 2 : Size-Dependent Cytotoxicity of Monodisperse Silica Nanoparticles in Human Endothelial Cells 65 Chapter 3 : Investigation of the Cytotoxicity of Nanozeolites A and Y 83 Chapter 4 : Oxidative stress is not associated with the cytotoxicity of pure amorphous silica nanoparticles 113 Chapter 5 : Adhesive properties of human endothelial cells exposed to amorphous silica nanoparticles 141 General discussion, conclusions and future perspectives 159 Summary 187 Samenvatting 191 Short curriculum vitae and list of publications 195 nrpages: 200 status: publishe...|$|E

With the notable exception of luminal epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney, glucose transport occurs by facilitated diffusion. Molecular cloning studies have revealed a family of facilitated glucose transporters, or “GLUTs”, the mem-bers of which have {{a high degree of}} amino acid and struc-tural homology (Fig. 1). Differences in transport kinetics, substrate specificity, tissue expression and subcellular tar-geting presumably contribute to the metabolic phenotype of a particular <b>cell</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).
