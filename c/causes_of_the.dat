5|$|Changes {{in farming}} practices, {{especially}} the drainage of land, the more intensive use of grassland and {{the removal of}} hedgerows, has affected wildlife in Wales. The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline are complex and factors such as climate change also play a part.|$|E
5|$|Despite these changes, {{and many}} other minor ones, The Scout Association fell into a decline through the 1990s with falling {{membership}} levels. This spurred a major review into the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Rome's Ciampino airport, {{the site}} of the first Comet hull loss, was the origin of more {{disastrous}} Comet flights just over a year later. On 10 January 1954, 20minutes after taking off from Ciampino, the first production Comet, G-ALYP, broke up in mid-air while operating BOAC Flight 781 and crashed into the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Elba with the loss of all 35 on board. With no witnesses to the disaster and only partial radio transmissions as incomplete evidence, no obvious reason for the crash could be deduced. Engineers at de Havilland immediately recommended 60 modifications aimed at any possible design flaw while the Abell Committee met to determine potential <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash. BOAC also voluntarily grounded its Comet fleet pending investigation into the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident.|$|E

50|$|India's {{investigative team}} {{concluded}} that pilot error was <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, which {{was supported by}} Airbus Industries. However, the India Commercial Pilot Association disputed the report. Claiming that design flaw on the Airbus A320 was <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash.

5|$|The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline {{include the}} {{fragmentation}} {{and loss of}} open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E

50|$|The final report, {{investigated}} by the Indian AAIB (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau), concluded that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash was due to pilot error. Initially, the Bihar Air Traffic Controller was blamed as <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. Even after the official final report was published, most residents live near the crash site and <b>the</b> relatives <b>of</b> those who perished on the flight believed that ATC error was <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident.|$|R

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked about the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disaster which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly {{primordial}} and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variation of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
