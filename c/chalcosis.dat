50|$|Fibrosis or scar {{formation}} is another pro-oxidant-related symptom. E.g., interocular copper or vitreous <b>chalcosis</b> {{is associated with}} severe vitreous fibrosis, as is interocular iron. Liver cirrhosis is also a major symptom of Wilson's disease. The pulmonary fibrosis produced by paraquat and the antitumor agent bleomycin is also thought to be induced by the pro-oxidant properties of these agents. It may be that oxidative stress produced by such agents mimics a normal physiological signal for fibroblast conversion to myofibroblasts.|$|E
40|$|A 35 -year-old male, with {{a history}} of injury {{sustained}} three years back, underwent pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal copper foreign body removal. Post-operatively, visual acuity improved; however, glistening refractile particles were seen at the macula. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and en-face imaging were performed to localise the level of the deposits.

30|$|Occult {{penetrating}} globe injuries with retained IOFBs are {{a relatively}} infrequent occurrence [1 – 6] and may rarely present with chronic anterior or posterior segment inflammation [2, 5, 6]. Besides meticulous ophthalmic examination, B-scan ultrasound, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and CT scans are extremely {{useful in the}} diagnosis of occult IOFB injuries. ERG changes have been characterized {{in the context of}} siderosis associated with IOFB injuries [1, 3]. In addition, retained copper IOFBs may result in acute [1] or chronic <b>chalcosis</b> [7 – 9]. In both siderosis and <b>chalcosis,</b> ERG changes may be partially reversible in some patients [10, 11].|$|E
40|$|Two unusual events {{concerning}} intraocular {{foreign bodies}} are presented. The first patient had an occult or unsuspected intraocular foreign body. He showed iridoplegia with mydriasis, siderosis iridis, and an intraocular piece of iron lying posteriorly near the retina. The foreign body was removed {{and the patient}} regained normal iris color and pupillary activity. His vision remains 20 / 15 six years postoperatively dispite ensuing retinal detachment one year after removal of the foreign body. The second patient was a young boy injured by a blasting cap explosion. He lost one eye from the injury and had a piece of intraocular brass in his left eye. In spite {{of the development of}} <b>chalcosis</b> and a mature cataract the lens gradually shrank in the pupillary space permitting a clear aphakic area and 20 / 25 vision. The brass fragment migrated forward and inferiorly and was finally extruded under the conjunctiva five years later, where it was removed and chemically analyzed by x-ray diffraction...|$|E
30|$|An IOFB is any material, organic, or inorganic, which penetrates {{into the}} ocular tissue. According to the literature, the vast {{majority}} of the patients with IOFB were male (94 %) and relatively young (mean, 33  years), with most in the working-age group. Metal-on-metal activities, particularly with various tools, are often associated with metallic IOFBs [4]. Typically, a small, high-speed projectile penetrates the eye and, possibly, finally lodges in the eye [5]. The foreign bodies may be classified as metallic or nonmetallic, with the metallic being divided into magnetic and nonmagnetic. They are also classified into toxic and nontoxic [3]. Intraocular foreign bodies can cause mechanical, and also chemical injury if they contain iron (siderosis) or copper (<b>chalcosis),</b> but the most important risk of a retained foreign body is infection. For these reasons, IOFBs need prompt evaluation and management as they may quickly lead to sight-threatening complications. Management of such cases is not always easy and certain foreign bodies of inert material (those made of stone, plastic, glass, and inert metals such as gold, silver, and platinum) excite minimum inflammation and may remain quiescent for a long period [6].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Chalcosis</b> is an ocular {{condition}} {{caused by}} penetration injury of copper or its alloy, {{which leads to}} extensive ocular inflammation. N-acetyl-serotonin has recently {{been identified as a}} potent antioxidant against free radical stress. In this study, we determined the efficacy of N-acetyl-serotonin against the copper (I) -induced retinal lipid peroxidation. Methods: Copper (I) -treated (100 μM) bovine retinal homogenates were incubated with 6 different concentrations (i. e. 0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 00, 2. 00 and 4. 00 mM) of N-acetyl-serotonin or vitamin E. The malondialdehyde level was measured as an index of lipid peroxidation. Results: Copper (I) ions induced a significant dose-dependent increase in malondialdehyde (p= 0. 007). Co-incubation with N-acetyl-serotonin or vitamin E significantly suppressed the copper (I) -induced malondialdehyde production (p< 0. 0001). The concentration to inhibit 50 % of damage for N-acetyl-serotonin and vitamin E were found to be 1. 54 mM and 0. 45 mM, respectively. Conclusion: Although N-acetyl-serotonin is only 29 % as effective as vitamin E in suppressing the copper (I) -induced lipid peroxidation, the present study supports a pharmacological potential of N-acetyl-serotonin combating free radical oxidative damages in the ocular tissues.

40|$|THE {{penetration}} of a splinter of copper or copper alloy into the eye always presents a serious problem. If the metal, {{especially in a}} relatively pure state, is left in the eye, it is bound to produce a heavy reaction {{in the form of}} acute iridocyclitis, violent uveitis, or vitreous abscess with all the sequelae of these conditions. Copper alloys containing less than 85 per cent. of copper usually cause a less severe reaction, but then <b>chalcosis</b> may develop, a condi-tion which in most cases leads to a gradual loss of vision, although its course depends on the individual tolerance of the eye to the metal. The most reasonable though not the easiest course of action is to remove the copper splinter mechanically, using one of the methods devised for the removal of non-magnetic foreign bodies. These methods, though constantly being improved, are still far from perfect. Both the older instruments, such as the Desmarres-Luer forceps, and the more recent ones, such as the Holth forceps or the endoscopic appliances, may prove inadequate, and the only result of the operation will be a severe additional trauma.

40|$|Introduction. Penetrating {{injury is}} {{characterized}} by the existence of entry wound only, and it can be with or without an intraocular foreign body (IOFB). IOFB can lead to a mechanical injury of the eye and to cause infection or to manifest other toxic effects on intraocular structures. Iron and copper can dissolve and cause siderosis, i. e. <b>chalcosis</b> of the eye. Ocular siderosis is diagnosed by clinical and electroretinogram (ERG) findings. Outline of Cases. The first patient was a 37 ­year­old male who was injured by a metal foreign body. He presented at the Clinic two years after the injury. Visual acuity of the right eye (VOD) on admission was VOD=L+P+ (light projection). Pars plana phacovitrectomy with IOFB extraction was done. Visual acuity on discharge was VOD= 3 / 60 cc + 7. 50 Dsph= 0. 2. The second patient was a 55 ­year­old male who presented at the clinic 18 months after injury. On admission visual acuity in his left eye was VOS 1 / 60. Pars plana phacovitrectomy with IOFB extraction was done. Visual acuity on discharge was VOS= 0. 7 through the stenopeic slit. Conclusion. In penetrating injuries caused by a metal IOFB pars plana vitrectomy with IOFB extraction is indicated. In cases with IOFB, when visual acuity is preserved, the lens is transparent, while the eye is without signs of infection, urgent pars plana vitrectomy is not necessary. Such patients need regular follow­up with obligatory ERG findings...|$|E
