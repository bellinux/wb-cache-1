5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as <b>coypu</b> and muskrats. <b>Coypu</b> can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} wild mammalians {{may be found}} in Canadian {{territory}} without being confirmed natives. Some were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced. These include the house mouse (Mus musculus), and Norway and black rats (respectively Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Other include escaped animals; the <b>Coypu</b> (Myocastor coypus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as feral cats, dogs and horses fall into this category. Fallow deers (Dama dama) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) were introduced for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the <b>coypu</b> was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The Siberian tiger and Japanese sea lion have probably been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E
5|$|Carletonomys {{was found}} in {{association}} with remains of several other animals, including fishes, chelid turtles, frogs, birds, armadillos, and several rodents, including Reithrodon auritus, the <b>coypu</b> (Myocastor), both of which {{still live in the}} area, the extinct echimyid Dicolpomys, and unidentified caviids and octodontids. C.cailoi probably lived in a wetland habitat under relatively warm and moist climatic conditions. Although the limited material known permits few inferences as to the animal's natural history, it likely fed on hard plant material, as do related, morphologically similar extant species.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the American alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the American alligator. However, most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than the American alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced <b>coypu</b> are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adult American alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E
25|$|Local {{extinction}} {{in their}} native range due to overharvesting {{led to the development}} of <b>coypu</b> fur farms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first farms were in Argentina and then later in Europe, North America, and Asia. These farms have generally not been successful long-term investments, and farmed <b>coypu</b> often are released or escape as operations become unprofitable. The first attempt at <b>coypu</b> farming was in France in the early 1880s, but it was not much of a success. The first efficient and extensive <b>coypu</b> farms were located in South America in the 1920s. The South American farms were very successful, and led to the growth of similar farms in North America and Europe. Coypus from these farms often escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild to provide a game animal or to remove aquatic vegetation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>coypu</b> {{is often}} {{mistaken for a}} muskrat, another widely dispersed, semiaquatic rodent that {{occupies}} the same wetland habitats. The muskrat, however, is smaller and more tolerant of cold climates, and has a laterally flattened tail it uses to assist in swimming, whereas {{the tail of a}} <b>coypu</b> is round. It can also be mistaken for a small beaver, as beavers and coypus have very similar anatomies. However, beavers' tails are flat and paddle-like, as opposed to the round tails of coypus.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of game is worked below ground with terriers, {{including}} red fox, groundhogs (also known as woodchucks), raccoons, opossums, nutria (also known as <b>coypu),</b> European and American badgers.|$|E
25|$|M. c. bonariensis, the {{subspecies}} {{present in}} the northernmost (subtropical) part of the coypu's range, {{is believed to be}} the type of <b>coypu</b> most commonly introduced to other continents.|$|E
25|$|Alligators {{are raised}} commercially for their meat and their skin, {{which is used}} for bags and shoes. They also provide {{economic}} benefits through the ecotourism industry. Visitors may take swamp tours, in which alligators are a feature. Their most important economic benefit to humans may be the control of <b>coypu</b> and muskrats.|$|E
25|$|The type of food {{eaten by}} {{alligators}} depends upon their age and size. When young, alligators eat fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and worms. As they mature, progressively larger prey is taken, including larger fish such as gar, turtles, and various mammals, particularly <b>coypu</b> and muskrat, {{as well as}} birds, deer, and other reptiles. Their stomachs also often contain gizzard stones. They will even consume carrion if they are sufficiently hungry. In some cases, larger alligators are known to ambush dogs, Florida panthers and black bears, making them the apex predator throughout their distribution. In this role as a top predator, it may determine the abundance of prey species, including turtles and <b>coypu.</b> As humans encroach into their habitat, attacks are few but not unknown. Alligators, unlike the large crocodiles, do not immediately regard a human upon encounter as prey, but may still attack in self-defense if provoked.|$|E
25|$|Coypus were {{introduced}} to the Louisiana ecosystem in the 1930s, when they escaped from fur farms that had imported them from South America. <b>Coypu</b> were released into the wild by at least one Louisiana nutria farmer in 1933 and these releases were followed by E. A. McIlhenny who released his entire stock in 1945 on Avery Island. In 1940, some of the nutria escaped during a hurricane and quickly populated coastal marshes, inland swamps, and other wetland areas. From Louisiana, coypus have spread across the Southern United States, wreaking havoc on marshland.|$|E
25|$|Like Cornwall, Wales and Ireland, {{the waters}} of Brittany attract marine animals {{including}} basking sharks, grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Bass is common along the coast, small-spotted catsharks live on the continental shelf, rattails and anglerfish populate the deep waters. River fish of note include trout, Atlantic salmon, pikes, shades and lampreys. The Breton rivers are also home to beavers and otters and to some invasive American species, such as the <b>coypu</b> which destroys the ecosystem and accelerated the extinction of the European mink.|$|E
25|$|Other {{regional}} {{products are}} wicker baskets {{and pieces of}} furniture. The cultivation of osier (salix sp), which is native to European and Asiancold and temperate regions, was proposed by Sarmiento because it can resist floods. Another plant that adapts to floodable lands is New Zealand flax (phormium tenax), which was industrialised as from 1925 and is used in containers, burlap, cords, threads, runners and mats. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the competence with synthetic fibres made New Zealand flax plantations anti-economic. Fishing and <b>coypu</b> breeding are other economic activities that are no longer attractive.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{contains}} many invasive species brought by man, including scores of molluscs which usually live around gardens and greenhouses {{but also in}} natural habitats of native molluscs. As of 2008, over 220 species of invasive insects have been identified, some of them considered pests. The situation is little better with vertebrates, as a 2004 report reported {{that there are two}} mammalian invasive species (the <b>coypu</b> and Indian palm squirrel), one fish species (mosquito fish), two reptilian species (the red-eared pond slider and the roughtail gecko) as well as 18 bird species. There are no amphibian invasive species, most likely due to the fact there are no suitable habitats for such.|$|E
500|$|The {{capybara}} (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a rodent {{of unusual}} size. Also called chigüire and [...] "carpincho", it {{is a member}} of the genus Hydrochoerus, of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). [...] Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the <b>coypu.</b> Native to South America, the capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species but is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin which is used in the pharmaceutical trade.|$|E
500|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{can be a}} harmful pest that attacks {{domestic}} animals such as turkeys, lambs, sheep, goats, [...] domestic water buffalo calves, and valuable game species like newborn roe deer, hares, <b>coypu,</b> pheasants, francolins, grey partridges, bustards and waterfowl. It destroys grapes and eats watermelons, muskmelons, and nuts. In Greece, golden jackals are not as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes but they can become a serious nuisance to small stock when in great numbers. In southern Bulgaria, over 1,000 attacks on sheep and lambs were recorded between 1982 and 1987, along with some damage to newborn deer in game farms. The damage by jackals in Bulgaria was minimal {{when compared to the}} livestock losses due to wolves. Approximately 1.5%–1.9% of calves born on the Golan Heights die due to predation, mainly by jackals. The high predation rate by jackals in both Bulgaria and Israel is attributable to the lack of preventative measures in those countries and the availability of food in illegal garbage dumps, leading to jackal population explosions. There are no known attacks on humans in Europe.|$|E
500|$|American {{alligators}} play {{an important}} role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. American alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. American alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly <b>coypu,</b> which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. [...] In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. American alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of American alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, American alligators can and will climb trees to bask in if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the American alligators will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.|$|E
500|$|Humanity {{has long}} used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur {{provides}} extra insulation. The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them {{together to make}} robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as [...] "beaver wool" [...] {{was found to be}} ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. Later, the <b>coypu</b> took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used {{in the creation of the}} Native American [...] "porky roach" [...] headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Coypu</b> meat is {{lean and}} low in cholesterol. [...] While many {{attempts}} have been made to establish markets for <b>coypu</b> meat, most documented cases have generally been unsuccessful. [...] Unscrupulous entrepreneurs have promoted <b>coypu</b> and <b>coypu</b> farms for their value as [...] "meat", [...] "fur", or [...] "aquatic weed control". [...] In recent years, they have done so in countries such as the United States, China, Taiwan, and Thailand. [...] In every documented case, the entrepreneurs sell <b>coypu</b> [...] "breeding stock" [...] at very high prices. Would-be <b>coypu</b> farmers find the markets for their products disappear after the promoter has left. [...] , a Baton Rouge, Louisiana based company, received a grant from the [...] to establish a company that uses nutria meat for dog food products. [...] In 2012, the [...] recognized Marsh Dog with [...] "Business Conservationist of the Year" [...] award for finding a use for this ecosustainable protein.|$|E
2500|$|American {{alligators}} live in freshwater environments, such as ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and swamps, {{as well as}} in brackish environments. When they construct alligator {{holes in}} the wetlands, they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animals during droughts. [...] They are, therefore, considered an important species for maintaining ecological diversity in wetlands. Farther west, in Louisiana, heavy grazing by <b>coypu</b> and muskrat are causing severe damage to coastal wetlands. [...] Large alligators feed extensively on <b>coypu,</b> and provide a vital ecological service by reducing <b>coypu</b> numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>coypu</b> {{somewhat}} {{resembles a}} very large rat, or a beaver with a small tail. Adults are typically [...] in weight, and [...] in body length, with a 30- to 45-cm (12- to 18-in) tail. It is possible for <b>coypu</b> to weigh up to , although adults usually average [...] They have coarse, darkish brown outer fur with soft dense grey under fur, also called the nutria. Three distinguishing features are a white patch on the muzzle, webbed hind feet, and large, bright orange-yellow incisors. The nipples of female <b>coypu</b> are high on her flanks, to allow their young to feed while the female is in the water.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>coypu</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 as Mus coypus, {{a member of}} the mouse genus. The genus Myocastor was assigned in 1792 by Robert Kerr.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{breeding}} quickly, each <b>coypu</b> consumes {{large amounts}} of vegetation. [...] An individual consumes about 25% of its body weight daily, and feeds year-round. [...] Being one of the world's larger extant rodents, a mature, healthy <b>coypu</b> averages [...] in weight, but they can reach as much as [...] [...] They eat {{the base of the}} above-ground stems of plants, and often dig through the organic soil for roots and rhizomes to eat. Their creation of [...] "eat-outs", areas where a majority of the above- and below-ground biomass has been removed, produces patches in the environment, which in turn disrupts the habitat for other animals and humans dependent on marshes.|$|E

2500|$|As {{demand for}} <b>coypu</b> fur declined, <b>coypu</b> have since become pests in many areas, {{destroying}} aquatic vegetation, marshes, and irrigation systems, and chewing through human-made items, such as tires and wooden house panelling in Louisiana, eroding river banks, and displacing native animals. Damage in Louisiana has been sufficiently severe since the 1950s to warrant legislative attention; in 1958, the first bounty {{was placed on}} nutria, though this effort was not funded. [...] By the early 2000s, the Coastwide Nutria Control Program was established, which began paying bounties for nutria killed in 2002. [...] In the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, where they were introduced in the 1940s, coypus {{are believed to have}} destroyed [...] of marshland in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. [...] In response, by 2003, a multimillion-dollar eradication program was underway.|$|E
2500|$|Louisiana {{celebrations}} also vary somewhat {{from the}} traditional Groundhog Day theme. Since about the late 1980s, Groundhog Day in New Orleans has featured T-Boy the Nutria, a <b>coypu</b> based at the Audubon Zoo. Since 1997 Pierre C. Shadeaux, also a <b>coypu,</b> {{has been the focus}} of [...] "Cajun Groundhog Day" [...] festivities in New Iberia. Because of Louisiana's subtropical climate, Pierre actually forecasts either a longer spring or an earlier summer, as opposed to the usual groundhog options of a longer winter or an earlier spring. Another Louisiana tradition influenced by Groundhog Day occurs in Shreveport on February 1—one day before Groundhog Day—centering on Claude the Cajun Crawfish. Claude annually predicts the weather for Northwest Louisiana-area parades held during Mardi Gras season, a season that has a long history in Louisiana but also happens to overlap with Groundhog Day festivities.|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, coypus were {{introduced}} to East Anglia, for fur, in 1929; many escaped and damaged the drainage works, and a concerted programme by MAFF eradicated them by 1989. However, in 2012, a [...] "giant rat" [...] was killed in County Durham, with authorities suspecting the animal was, in fact, a <b>coypu.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The canal {{is a long}} {{ribbon of}} water {{stretching}} through the landscape and attracts many animal species. Several species of fish such as bream breed in the canal, and others reproduce in its feeding rivers and spend part of their life in the canal. [...] Molluscs such as anadontes — a kind of freshwater mussel, and corbicules — a kind of freshwater clam occur in the canal. Invasive <b>Coypu</b> (River rat or nutria) and Muskrats introduced from the Americas burrow into the banks, which they damage. Finally, many animals and birds come to drink water from the canal.|$|E
2500|$|The fur is coarse {{and usually}} brown or dark grey, while the underparts are lighter grey or brown. The brown rat {{is a rather}} large true murid and can weigh {{twice as much as}} a black rat and many times more than a house mouse. The length is {{commonly}} in the range of , with the tail a further , thus being roughly the same length as the body. Adult body weight averages [...] in males and about [...] in females. Exceptionally large individuals can reportedly reach [...] but are not expected outside of domestic specimens. Stories of rats attaining sizes as big as cats are exaggerations, or misidentifications of other rodents, such as the <b>coypu</b> and muskrat. In fact it is common for breeding wild brown rats to weigh (sometimes considerably) less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|Coypus {{can live}} up to six years in captivity, but {{individuals}} uncommonly live past three years old; according to one study, 80% of coypus die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over three years old. Male coypus reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up {{to the age of}} 9 months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. Baby coypus are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation with their parents within hours of birth. [...] A female <b>coypu</b> can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. [...] If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. [...] Newborn coypus nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{names are}} {{commonly}} used in English for Myocastor coypus. The name [...] "nutria" [...] is generally used in North America, Asia, and throughout countries of the former Soviet Union; however, in Spanish-speaking countries, the word [...] "nutria" [...] refers to the otter. To avoid this ambiguity, the name [...] "coypu" [...] (derived from the Mapudungun language) is used in Latin America and Europe. In France, the <b>coypu</b> {{is known as a}} ragondin. In Dutch, it is known as beverrat (beaver rat). In German, it is known as Nutria, Biberratte (beaver rat), or Sumpfbiber (swamp beaver). In Italy, instead, the popular name is, as in North America and Asia, [...] "nutria", but it is also called castorino ("little beaver"), by which its fur is known in Italy. In Swedish, the animal is known as sumpbäver (marsh/swamp beaver). In Brazil, the animal is known as ratão-do-banhado, nútria, or caxingui (the last from the Tupi language).|$|E
60|$|With {{reference}} to this animal, which, {{as we have}} seen, is prolific, a strange thing once happened in Buenos Ayres. The <b>coypú</b> was much more abundant fifty years ago than now, and its skin, which has a fine fur under the long coarse hair, was largely exported to Europe. About that time the Dictator Rosas issued a decree prohibiting the hunting of the <b>coypú.</b> The result was that the animals increased and multiplied exceedingly, and, abandoning their aquatic habits, they became terrestrial and migratory, and swarmed everywhere in search of food. Suddenly a mysterious malady fell on them, from which they quickly perished, and became almost extinct.|$|E
60|$|A third great fact, partly {{included}} in the foregoing statement, is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the naturalist, in travelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be struck by {{the manner in which}} successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and Australia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but they plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the <b>coypu</b> and capybara, rodents of the South American type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all peculiar species. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep organic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and water, independently of physical conditions. The naturalist must be dull who is not led to inquire what this bond is.|$|E
60|$|This last {{consideration}} {{leads us}} up to the argument from Geographical Distribution. In considering the various local faunas and floras {{on the face of}} the globe, no point strikes one more forcibly than the fact that neither their similarities nor their dissimilarities can be accounted for by climate or physical conditions. The animals of South Africa do not in the least resemble the animals of the corresponding belt of South America; the Australian beasts and birds and trees are utterly unlike those of France and Germany; the fishes and crustaceans of the Pacific at Panama are widely different from those of the Caribbean at the same point, separated from them only by the narrow belt of intervening isthmus. On the other hand, within the same continuous areas of sea or land, however great the differences of physical conditions, we find everywhere closely related types in possession of the most distinct and varied situations. On the burning plains of La Plata we get the agouti and the bizcacha as the chief rodents; we ascend the Cordillera, and close to the eternal snows we discover, not hares and rabbits like those of Europe, but a specialised chilly mountain form of the same distinctly South American type. We turn to the rivers, and we see no musk-rat or beaver, but the <b>coypu</b> and capybara, slightly altered varieties of the original bizcacha ancestor. Australia has no wolf, but it has instead fierce and active carnivorous marsupials; it has no mice, but some of its tiny kangaroo-like creatures fulfil analogous functions in its animal economy. Everywhere the evidence points to the conclusion that local species have been locally evolved from pre-existing similar species. The oceanic isles, of which Darwin had had so large an experience, and especially his old friends the Galapagos, come in usefully for this stage of the question. They are invariably inhabited, as Darwin pointed out, and as Wallace has since abundantly shown in the minutest detail, by waifs and strays from neighbouring continents, altered and specialised by natural selection in accordance with the conditions of their new habitat. As a rule, they point back to the districts whence blow the strongest and most prevalent winds; and the modifications they have undergone are largely dependent upon the nature of the other species with which they have to compete, or to whose habits they must needs accommodate themselves. In such cases it is easy to see how far Darwin's special conception of natural selection helps to explain and account for facts not easily explicable by the older evolutionism of mere descent with modification.|$|E
