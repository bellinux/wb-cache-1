500|$|David Rubenstein's fears {{would be}} {{confirmed}} when in 2007, the Service Employees International Union {{launched a campaign}} against private equity firms, specifically the largest buyout firms through public events, protests as well as leafleting and web campaigns. [...] A number of leading private equity executives were targeted by the union members however the SEIU's campaign was non nearly as effective at slowing the buyout boom as the credit <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> 2007 and 2008 would ultimately prove to be.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic rock-inherited pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, double entendres for sexual intercourse, a homogeneous sound and message, the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune, and rotations of lead vocals. Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album [...] "far more mechanical" [...] than their debut album, although {{noted that it}} is sonically and lyrically similar. San Lansky, an editor for Idolator, described it as [...] "’80s-inflected and intermittently rock-dappled," [...] and as more indebted to the [...] "sanitized punk <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> McFly" [...] than to teen pop.|$|E
60|$|Still going astern, we touched slowly, {{broadside}} on, to a suggestive <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> fenders, and I {{looked into}} {{the deck of a}} Brixham trawler, her crew struck dumb.|$|R

500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{discusses}} the author's {{love of the}} BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is [...] "America's favorite sandwich". The author wrote, [...] "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, {{the best thing you}} could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the bacon ... It is sheer delight." [...] She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E

2500|$|Worsening weather {{gave all}} {{signs of an}} {{approaching}} typhoon; and Vigilance was forced to anchor in various berths at Wakanoura Wan, off Honshū, between the 16th and 19th. As the storm reached its climax before dawn on the 18th, [...] dragged her anchors and drifted down toward Vigilance's berth.

Soon there came the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> steel on steel as the landing ship crashed into the minesweeper's starboard side, forward, bending in the bulwarks near the bow.|$|E
60|$|With palpitating {{heart the}} woman stood, scarce daring to breathe, and then, very faintly but unmistakable to her keen ears, came the {{stealthy}} <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> twigs and grasses beneath padded feet.|$|R
60|$|Alvarita heard {{a sudden}} <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> the gravel below her. Turning her head {{she saw a}} big, swarthy Mexican, with a daring and evil expression, contemplating her with an ominous, dull eye.|$|R

2500|$|Crocs {{completed}} the {{initial public offering}} of its common stock in February 2006. [...] It began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol CROX. [...] On October 31, 2007 the stock CROX dropped from $75 per share to slightly under $40 (its value six months previously) when the company announced decreased revenue projections. On April 14, 2008, during {{the midst of the}} Credit <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> 2008, the stock dropped 30% in after-hours trading after the company issued a press release in which they significantly guided down earnings estimates for the first quarter.

[...] "The retail environment in the U.S. has become increasingly challenging as consumer spending and traffic levels have slowed," [...] Chief Executive Officer Ron Snyder said.

60|$|George Pendyce {{walked quickly}} forward, and {{disappeared}} beside her. There was a <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> wheels; the brougham rolled away.|$|E
60|$|Wheeler was {{sensible}} of {{a certain}} uneasiness as {{he listened to the}} <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the boring tool and the jarring thud of the hammers.|$|E
60|$|She {{staggered}} {{across the}} room towards the door by which Saton had departed. Before she could reach it, however, they heard the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> wheels as his car swept by the front on its way down the avenue.|$|R
60|$|From a short {{distance}} up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the greedy feeding of a lion. The <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> bones, the gulping of great pieces, the contented growling, all attested the nearness of the king at table.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a fearful}} scream of anguish and terror from the black, and mingled with {{it was the}} hideous {{challenge}} of the killing panther. Then came silence--silence except for the rending of bloody flesh and the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> human bones between mighty jaws.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} with a jerk plunged {{forward into}} darkness, curved with a <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> wheels, and vanished, swinging between the black tree-pillars at the entrance....|$|E
6000|$|Her face shines {{out in the}} embers; [...] I see her {{holding the}} light, And hear the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the gravel [...] And the sweep of the rain that night.|$|E
6000|$|The {{moon was}} rising. Swinging hands, they tramped toward the board-walk. The <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> {{their feet in}} the sand was the rhythmic spell of a magician, which she broke when she sighed: ...|$|E
60|$|I turned, and Miss Ingram darted {{forwards}} {{from her}} sofa: the others, too, {{looked up from}} their several occupations; for {{at the same time}} a <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.|$|R
60|$|Smith-Oldwick lighted his {{cigarette}} and sat puffing slowly upon it.

60|$|I beard a <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> gravel. Even as I wheeled I felt a {{tremendous}} {{pull on the}} lasso and I seemed to be sailing in the air. I got a blurred glimpse of Herky-Jerky leaning back on the taut lasso. Then I plunged down, slid over the rocks, and went souse into the spring.|$|R
60|$|Before Bill Saltman {{could make}} reply, two running men joined the group. These were {{followed}} by several more, while the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> feet on the snow heralded the imminent arrival of many others.|$|E
60|$|Crack! {{heard the}} {{familiar}} {{music of the}} dog whip, the whining howl of the Malemutes, and the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> a sled as it drew up to the cabin. Conversation languished while they waited the issue.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Colfax, yawning, {{had taken}} a book and gone to bed. Still Virginia sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the {{lightning}} quivered across the eastern sky. She heard the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> wheels in the gravel.|$|E
60|$|From without {{there came}} the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> gravel as the wagonette turned and rattled down the avenue.

Her heart failed her completely, and she burst into tears.|$|R
50|$|According to Hogan, online data is {{becoming}} more of an asset for three reasons: First, the rise in technology is causing people to spend {{a significant amount of}} time online, second, marketing infrastructure enables the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> big data sets that yield high percentages of actual sales, and third, the rise in social media enables the collecting of personal data in large quantities.|$|R
60|$|I {{clutched}} {{hold of the}} railings. She {{came over}} to my side. Up the road I heard in the distance the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> heavy wheels. A wagon was passing through the lodge gates. John, the woodman, was walking with unaccustomed briskness by the horses' heads, cracking his whip as he came. I looked into the girl's face by my side.|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated no longer, but tapped at {{the door}} and entered. The young woman turned at the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> his boots on the sanded floor, and exclaiming, [...] "Oh, Mr. Percombe, how you frightened me!" [...] quite lost her color for a moment.|$|E
60|$|At one in {{the morning}} he walked along an unusually populous Main Street and took the turning that led up the hill to his cabin. And when he paused on the ascent, he could hear behind him the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> moccasins in the snow.|$|E
60|$|For {{the space}} of several seconds the girls stood staring at the figure outside the window. Then, the man turned sharply, and Hetty gasped as she heard the <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> {{footsteps}} in the snow below. There was a little {{of it on the}} verandah, and the stars shone brilliantly.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose she}} must have seen me from the open window. It {{did not seem to}} me that I had stood there very long before I heard the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> {{footsteps}} on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in no spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near. She was all changed again, to the clocked stockings.|$|R
60|$|They {{opened the}} door cautiously, {{and found that the}} wind, conquered by the rain, had abated. Miss Wilson's candle, though it flickered in the draught, was not {{extinguished}} this time; and she was presently left with the housekeeper, bolting and chaining the door, and listening to the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> feet on the gravel outside dying away through the steady pattering of the rain.|$|R
60|$|So {{again they}} traversed {{the path and}} this time came to the pretty garden behind the house. Ethel was tending a flower bed.

But the <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> the gravel aroused her attention, and, observing her visitors, she sprang up and hastened toward them.|$|R
