40|$|Abstract: Air {{inflated}} cushion using pre-sealed two-layer plastic films forms air filled structural cushion when {{compressed air}} is charged to pre-sealed airtight chambers during packaging operation. The plastic films {{are made by}} co-extrusion of polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene (PE/PA/PE) to keep required strength, permeability of the cushioning materials and easy production of the cushion. The air filled cushion structure is designed into column chambers with five different selective widths which form five different–cushion thick-ness when regulated compressed air is charged into the chambers using <b>controlled</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> during packaging performance. Uniquely designed charge port to each chamber provides individual chamber {{with the ability to}} work independently, hence ensures the protective function of packaging and allows the air cush-ions to be easily manipulated to a given product to be packaged. Static cushioning performance tests to air filled cushion materials at desirable air pressures showed that minimum cushion factor was about 4, and ap-peared at compressive strain of the materials from 55 - 80 %. Dynamic impact to the samples with dimension of 180 by 180 cm at drop height of 76 cm demonstrates relationship between impact mass and acceleration levels, indicating the suitability of the materials {{for a wide range of}} packaging application to electronic products and devices. Overall packaging properties of the material relating to co-extruded film strength, permeability, seal-ing strength of the plastic films were discussed...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{rainfall}} simulators {{have been}} designed for high intensity events; however {{there is a lack}} of studies on the simulation of low rainfall intensities. This research presents a system capable of performing rainfall simulations over large areas with intensities as low as 15. 5 mm/h (0. 6 in/h) and a Coefficient of Variation greater than 0. 8. The system consists of towers distributed spatially in the corners of hypothetical equilateral triangles with varying sizes. The simulation area should be inside the triangles to ensure adequate coverage and minimize wind effects. Thus, the minimum configuration for the system is three towers. Each tower consists of three aluminum legs that are 2. 5 m (8 ft) high and support a 1 / 4 GG - SS 10 nozzle, manufactured by Spraying Systems Corporation. A <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is incorporated in each tower to monitor the flow. The water supply is pumped from a tank into a main hose that has a flow <b>control</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> The water is subdivided into individual hoses that supply water to each tower. The hose diameters vary according to the number of towers used in each simulation. This configuration is capable of simulating a wide range of rainfall intensities over small and large regions. The collection of the runoff is accomplished with a 1 1 / 2 in semicircular PVC Pipe. This system is applied to a research project that evaluates the impacts of dust suppressants on disturbed lands...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} development of a low cost small engine dynamometer for engine testing to measure engine performance i. e. power, torque and specific fuel consumption. The data and result were achieved by using a small hydraulic engine dynamometer with specific considerations and standard followed {{in order to have}} good engine dynamometer. Small engine was used by coupling it with the hydraulic pump that come with the <b>control</b> valve and <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> <b>Control</b> valve was set to build back pressure inside the pumping area. When the engine starts, the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will give a reading which can be used to calculate the engine torque. By using the engine torque, engine power can be obtained by multiplying the angular speed with engine torque. Specific fuel consumption can be defined, by dividing the brake engine power with the fuel rate. From the experiment data, the brake power of the single cylinder engine showed that it is almost similar to the specification given by the manufacturer. The low cost hydraulic engine dynamometer, which is less than RM 15, 000 can be used to measure an engine performance. The engine power, torque, engine speed and air fuel ratio data can be achieved from our developed engine dynamometer...|$|R

The reaction behavior of 1 -butanol as a woody biomass model compound was studied in subcritical conditions at 200 – 250 °C and 8 – 12 MPa with a batch autoclave. The autoclave volume was 500 mL and equipped system with agitation stirrer, electric current control, electric heating and temperature <b>control</b> and a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> The chemical species in aqueous products were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified using gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD).

40|$|The water {{distribution}} regulation system of Fukuoka City {{is a system}} in which motor valves are operated by remote <b>control</b> while <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, motor valve operations to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators. For this reason, an improvement of valve operations support should be done based on valve operation planning for flow and pressure regulation and the operation knowledge database which is constructed on the basis of past experience in order to prevent the events of pressure regulation falls outside the required target pressure range and also to reduce the effort of operators. Therefore in this study and with the assistance of three years of telemetry data, an analysis of the existing valve operation of a certain block within the city district is performed using both correlation analysis and an unsupervised class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) named Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Results show that correlation analysis has successfully classified the operation types of different valves attached to the studied network into three categories while SOM is an efficient tool in clustering the different complicated operational patterns of valves, visualizing the huge amount of telemetry valves data, detecting the patterns which need future improvement and could present good alternative solutions for improving future valve operational support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
