Sculptures of a Calusa family stand on the mound next to a palm-thatched house, suggesting that the visitor is looking outside and into the past. Inside, interpretive panels discuss mounds and Calusa town plans. Next to the window, an interactive model shows a <b>cutaway</b> <b>view</b> of a mound and explains archaeologists' methods of interpreting the past.|$|E

40|$|Exploded <b>views</b> and <b>cutaway</b> <b>views</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be powerful visualization techniques to explore the complex internal structures in 3 D volume data. Current approaches for creating them are mainly based on algorithms with very limited user controls. This paper proposes a novel set of whole-hand multitouch gestures for interactive creation and manipulation of these views on 3 D volume data. Moreover, users can also interactively perform bimanual ‘V’-shape cut and volume exploding, remove unwanted volume partitions to effectively create <b>cutaway</b> <b>views,</b> and create threshold-based volume segmentation and exploded views. Our proposed interaction design was also tried out by eight participants in a preliminary pilot study.

40|$|We {{present a}} system for {{creating}} appealing illustrative cutaway renderings. This system bases on simple sketch-based interfaces and stylized rendering techniques {{for the study of}} elaborate 3 D models. Since interactive visualization technology found its way to the general public, there is a demand for novel interaction techniques that allow easy exploration of the displayed illustrations. Hence, our system lets users create individual <b>cutaway</b> <b>views</b> to focus on hidden objects. At the same time, important contextual information is emphasized by illustrative rendering techniques...|$|R

(Angles of 45 ffi, 60 ffi, and 90 ffi occur with high frequency.) The extreme dihedral angles are 15. 2 ffi and 158. 2 ffi. This mesh took 55 seconds to generate on a Mac Pro with a 2. 66 GHz Intel Xeon processor,but the mesh generation time was only 642 milliseconds; nearly all the time was spent in the isosurface evaluation code.

40|$|Figure 1 : <b>Cutaway</b> <b>views</b> {{generated}} by our system. To create these illustrations, we “rigged ” 3 D models of a disk brake and human neck using the authoring component of our system. The illustrations were then generated automatically from the rigged models to expose user-selected target structures (shown in red). We present {{a system for}} authoring and <b>viewing</b> interactive <b>cutaway</b> illustrations of complex 3 D models using conventions of traditional scientific and technical illustration. Our approach {{is based on the}} two key ideas that 1) cuts should respect the geometry of the parts being cut, and 2) cutaway illustrations should support interactive exploration. In our approach, an author instruments a 3 D model with auxiliary parameters, which we call “rigging, ” that define how cutaways of that structure are formed. We provide an authoring interface that automates most of the rigging process. We also provide a viewing interface that allows viewers to explore rigged models using high-level interactions. In particular, the viewer can just select a set of target structures, and the system will automatically generate a cutaway illustration that exposes those parts. We have tested our system on a variety of CAD and anatomical models, and our results demonstrate that our approach can be used to create and <b>view</b> effective interactive <b>cutaway</b> illustrations for a variety of complex objects with little user effort...|$|R

5000|$|The work, a {{forerunner of}} Marriage à-la-mode, was {{intended}} to satirise and poke fun at the types of dress and garbs that were in fashion at the time, and the superficiality of the tastes {{and nature of the}} aristocracy in general. Several figures are seen in the painting, all of whom are dressed in heavily caricatured renditions of the fashion that reigned in the 1740s. Most prominently exhibited is an elderly woman wearing a sacque covered with satirically overblown roses expanded by a large hoop. Standing near her is an opulently dressed man, thought to be [...] "Beau" [...] Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore (the dress he wears {{is said to be the}} very same he wore to his birthday in the year of the painting's creation) The two huddle together in admiration over the minute porcelain cup held by the lady and saucer held by the lord. Also part of the company is another woman clutching the chin of a black page boy wearing a turban [...] - [...] thought to be designed after Ignatius Sancho, an actor and writer, in his youth [...] - [...] both of whom are also dressed as exquisitely as the first two. The black page, holding a type of Chinese porcelain figure, is a servant, and was painted in as an element of irony in the work; as a slave, he mocks his masters, who themselves bowed before fashions and the latest frivolities of upper-class life. Even the monkey standing in the centre foreground wears a flowing, cuffed robe as he examines the list of purchases made by one of the four [...] - [...] it is not known whom [...] - [...] at a recent auction. In the painting on the wall, the transitory nature of fashion is represented by the cupids at left, who use a bellows to blow up a fire of discarded petticoats and wigs; at right, the classical form of the female sculpture is contrasted with the <b>cutaway</b> rear <b>view</b> of her enormous hoop underskirt stiffened with whalebone, [...] "the mode 1742" [...] as the painting's legend has it. The fashionable hoops make the seated lady's dress rise up ridiculously behind her, and in a vignette on the fire-screen at right, a lady is shown trapped in a sedan chair that is filled by her hoops—this woman appears again in the background of Hogarth's Beer Street in 1752.|$|R
