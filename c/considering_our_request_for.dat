Conversations initially focused on the current issues facing library and information professionals, before projecting forward into how we saw the landscape developing by 2025.

40|$|When elected {{officials}} decide to delegate authority to an agency, that choice determines {{not only the}} likely policy outputs in that area but also the policy outputs in other areas. New delegations may invite more congressional committees to participate in agency oversight, lead {{to the creation of}} new organizational units to implement newly delegated authority, and force department leadership with limited time, attention, and resources to prioritize among programs and tasks. Each of these changes can influence the agency performance in areas outside the primary focus of their delegation. In this paper we examine how the proliferation of statutory responsibilities in federal agencies influences performance. Working with the staff of the U. S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, we obtained three new unique measures of federal agency performance on a task that might be influenced by the proliferation of new responsibilities, responding to Freedom of Information Act <b>requests.</b> <b>Our</b> results indicate that agencies with a greater number and diversity of statutory responsibilities were the least responsive to congressional <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> information about FOIA, slowest in responding to <b>our</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> information, and were the least likely to include the appropriate information in thei...|$|R
