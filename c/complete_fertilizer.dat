2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{propagated}} {{entirely by}} seed. In the transitional zone of West Africa this crop is sown during the major rainy season between March and May. Here the soils {{are rich in}} organic matter with a high rainfall of 1,400mm distributed April–October. Propagation starts after the first couple heavy rainfalls of the season. Holes around 2cm deep and 1 m apart are planted with 3-4 seeds in each. A <b>complete</b> <b>fertilizer</b> should be applied before the propagation, with periodical application of nitrogenous fertilizer to follow. [...] Growing methods contrast in the northern savannahs where conditions are more challenging with low fertility and organic matter. Rainfall in this zone is small at 800mm annually. Cucumeropsis mannii is more successful in this area as a mixed crop, specifically grown in the ridges of sorghum crops. In more challenged areas this crop should be spaced at least 3 m apart, greatly decreasing per-hectare production. After 6–8 months, around September–December the fruit are ready for harvest. The physical signs of ripe fruit include creamy colour and dried stems and leaves. Each plant averages at 2-5 fruits, each weighing 0.8-1.8kg and containing 90-400 seeds.|$|E

Start with no more than 1/4 pound at monthly or bi-monthly intervals, increasing the rates commensurate with growth. If iron deficiency in calcareous soils is a problem, this element should be applied as Sequestrene 138, injected or drenched into the soil when needed. Nutritional sprays to supply other minor elements should also be applied as needed. After the tree has matured, a fertilizer such as 8-3-9 with 5% MgO is more appropriate. The plants should be supplied with adequate water at all times but especially during bloom and fruit development. The cherry of the Rio Grande has fairly good drought tolerance.

Although P and K stratification existed at each site, favorable moisture and high soil P and K levels probably precluded any grain yield response to added fertilizer or placement in several site-years. Corn and soybean yields were even reduced on a high testing soil. Broadcast applications were equal or better than banded applications. On one occasion, the 36. 2 kg P ha - 1 rate not only raised corn yields in the year of application but had residual effect on soybean yields the following year. Soybean responded to direct P on optimum or very low testing soil. Direct and residual K fertilizers resulted in similar yields.

Overall symptoms were increased in severity by reducing light intensity, days length and soil moisture; by restricting root development, and by earlier inoculations. Symptoms were also influenced by temperature in the test range 20 - 28 C, being more severe at the lower temperatures when plants were inoculated within eight weeks of seeding. Lower temperatures and shorter day lengths also retarded plant maturity, thus indirectly increasing severity of final symptoms. Symptom expression was unaffected by nitrogenous, phosphatic, potassic and <b>complete</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> although nitrogenous dressings increased yield. Symptoms caused by the isolate in wheat were compared with those by Fusarium graminearum, HeIminthosporium sativum and Pythium ultimum under spring glasshouse conditions. Swelling of root tips was caused by P. ultimum and root discolouration by the remainder, but only O. graminis significantly reduced plant height, fresh weight, numbers of functional roots and yield. Nuclear distribution in hyphae of the isolate was compared with that of Curvularia ramosa, C. spicifera, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum and Wojnowicia graminis. Tip cells of O. graminis were predominantly uni-nucleate whilst those of other fungi were generally multi-nucleate. When opposed to other fungi in culture, O. graminis was slightly antagonistic towards Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum. Helminthosporium satiyum and Wojnowicia graminis, whereas Pythium ultimum exhibited antagonism towards O. graminis. The combination of O. graminis with Curyularia ramosa was mutually antagonistic, but no antagonism was evident in combination with either C. spicifera or Fusarium graminearum. The saprophytic survival of the isolate was examined on artificially-infected wheat straw buried in unsterilized soil. Survival was prolonged by nitrogenous soil amendments, unaffected. by superphosphate dressings and reduced by growing various plant species over infected straw. O. graminis was isolated from all species, including dicotyledons, sown over straw. Three methods for estimating survival on various hosts were compared, viz., those involving artificially-infected straws previously sterilized by either propylene oxide or autoclaving and inverted sods of infected hosts. The use of sods was the most satisfactory and indicated O. graminis survived better on barley than wheat if inoculated at seeding and inverted after four weeks. Delaying inversion further increased survival on barley but not on wheat. Survival was also increased by increasing plant density, the effect being relatively greater with barley than wheat. However, survival was greater on wheat than barley when inoculation was delayed until eight weeks after seeding. O. graminis also survived better on Lolium perenne, Bromus mollis and B. sterilis than on Avena fatua and Vulpia myuros; and on Bromus gussonii and Hordeum hystrix than on PhalarIs minor, Avena sterilis, Ehrharta erecta and linseed when inoculated at seeding and inverted eight weeks later.

40|$|Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thumb) Matsun and Nakai] is an {{important}} cash crop in West Africa where it is cultivated under rainfed conditions. The objective of this work was to identify best cultural practices for production of watermelons in the Sahel on stored rainwater in acid sandy soils. The experiments were carried out at the ICRISAT Sadore research center in Niger during two consecutive dry seasons, 2003 - 2004 and 2004 - 2005. Three soil management treatments were applied: microcatchments (also called half-moons), planting pits (also called zaï) and sowing on flat land. Each of these three treatments came with and without a soil amendment comprising of 500 g of manure mixed with 24 g of a <b>complete</b> (NPK) <b>fertilizer</b> (15 - 15 - 15) individually applied to each planting hill. Two watermelon cultivars were tested: ‘Malali’ and ‘Kaolack’. In {{each of the two}} years the experiments were sown on the 1 st and on the 21 st of September. Fruit and biomass yield, fruit Total Soluble Solids (TSS), days to fruiting and harvesting were determined. Soil fertility, root development and other physiological parameters were monitored to explain some of the differences between treatments. Soil amendments increased marketable yields from 1. 3 to 3. 5 tons ha- 1 on average. Marketable yields at the first planting date were double the yields of the second planting date (3. 2 vs. 1. 6 tons ha- 1). Yield differences were due to changes in fruit number not in fruit weight. Deep placement of soil amendments resulted in significant root development in deeper soil layers. Highest watermelon yields were achieved when sowing the Malali cultivar in amended planting pits on September 1 st giving a yield of 8. 2 tons ha- 1...|$|R
