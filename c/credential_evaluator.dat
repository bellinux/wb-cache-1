In July 2004, the Georgia Professional Standards Commission revoked the licenses of all 11 teachers. When it was discovered St. Regis University was a diploma mill, six teachers resigned. Georgia officials accepted those credentials because of letters they received from a <b>credential</b> <b>evaluator,</b> Career Consultants International of Sunrise, Florida. CCI said the credentials were equal to those from a regionally accredited U.S. university. The officials now suspect that CCI was not giving independent evaluations, according to the Georgia Professional Standards Commission executive secretary, F.D. Toth. Toth said the commission received letters from CCI for 11 of the 12 educators, stating that their Saint Regis degrees met the same rigor and content standards as do those from regionally accredited U.S. colleges and universities, which is the standard for Georgia’s recognition of degrees.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practices}} of those individuals acting as foreign credential evaluators {{with a focus on}} postgraduate access at Irish higher education institutions (HEIs). Using a research design that involves a refined form of Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Charmaz 2000, 2006; Glaser 2001), the researcher explores what constitutes and influences practice in differing local contexts for credential evaluators. A preliminary research phase aided the development of four research questions which facilitated the conducting of 14 semi-structured interviews and two focus group interviews with credential evaluators. Each of the four research questions concern a key aspect of the work of credential evaluators. - Role: What do credential evaluators feel their role entails, and what are their priorities when evaluating foreign qualifications? - Values: What values are important to credential evaluators in evaluating foreign qualifications? - Processes: What resources, tools and procedures are used in carrying out credential evaluation? - Policy: What policies impact on the work of a <b>credential</b> <b>evaluator</b> and how? These specific questions do not exhaust the broader aims of the research. These are concerned with advancing understanding of credential evaluation practice at HEIs, thereby offering a reliable means of improving practice, based on an analysis of best available information and knowledge. Based on the researcher’s interpretation of the data, five key issues impacting on credential evaluation practice emerged from the interviews. I. Discrepancies in approach to credential evaluation in higher education institutions II. Benefits and difficulties in using UK NARIC as an authority in credential evaluation III. Differing levels of professional support for credential evaluation within and across higher education institutions IV. Understanding credential evaluation practice through connections with existing policies and activities V. Tensions between the needs of the individual applicant, the <b>credential</b> <b>evaluator</b> and the higher education institution The issues highlighted above are interdependent with the matter of professional identity offered by the researcher as the main connecting thread. Firstly, there is as yet no designated role of evaluator of foreign credentials in Irish HEIs, leading to a lack of clarity. Secondly, extensive use of UK NARIC services, although helpful in some key respects, can also exacerbate confusions where the role of Irish HEIs as competent recognition authorities is concerned. The duration and depth of experience of a <b>credential</b> <b>evaluator</b> have a strong impact on his/her capability, especially when seeking and accessing appropriate assistance for credential evaluation activities. This experience factor is all the more important currently, as the context for foreign credential evaluation is changing rapidly. The global demand for higher education has increased exponentially, resulting in increased mobility of potential students {{and the development of a}} plethora of credential evaluation tools. This dynamic has led to greater demands on HEIs for transparency, fairness and accountability in how foreign qualifications are recognised. Finally, while the Lisbon Recognition Convention provides a legal and ethical framework to guide practice, the research undertaken for this thesis suggests that decision-making is highly individualised. It frequently relies on tacit knowledge, experience and informal networks and is impacted on by the prevailing organisational culture. There is a tension between the push for standardised approaches to practice on the one hand and the pressures of internationalisation, and the autonomy of academics and institutions on the other. In summary, credential evaluation at Irish HEIs is shown to be an emergent, rather than established practice. Based on analysis of the findings, the thesis explores the merits of promoting community of practice approaches (Wenger 1998) to address fruitfully the main issues of concern investigated during the research. The study concludes by offering a number of recommendations for attention and action by credential evaluators and management staff at HEIs in particular. A number of reflections by the researcher are also offered...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} present an {{overview}} of the developments of policies and practices for national (Irish) and international recognition of qualifications. The recognition of formal learning in the form of qualifications is a key focus point in the area of higher educational policy especially under the remit of recognition of prior learning initiatives, a part of the lifelong learning approaches adopted in large part by policy-makers and practitioners alike. At the meta-policy level from UNESCO to the various European Declarations from Bologna in 1999 down to Leuven in 2009, and at national and individual levels, the focus has been placed on the comparability and compatibility of qualifications, by way of the development of a European Higher Education Area, national qualifications frameworks, and sectoral as well as professional body procedures for the recognition of awards. The development of policies and practices for the recognition of qualifications Policy-makers, institutions of higher education and practitioners alike have increasingly embraced recognition of prior learning, especially in the form of recognition of qualifications. The importance now attached to lifelong learning and learning routes has renewed attention on qualifications systems. The various UNESCO Conventions on the Recognition of Qualifications (6 Regional, 2 European, and 1 interregional) are expressly aimed at recognising qualifications for academic purposes. They do not discount recognition for professional purposes, which is explicitly offered by the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC), the Educational <b>Credential</b> <b>Evaluators</b> (ECE) in th...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{educational}} credential {{assessment is}} responsive to assessors’ social, economic, and cultural stimuli. Academic institutions, industries, and governmental bodies treat placement specialists’ recommendations as signals of cross-cultural productive capacity, giving significance to the methodology of foreign education-system analysis. A conceptual framework incorporating globalization, internationalization, massification, and marketization (GLIMM) helps explain how and why paradigms have shifted. GLIMM forces can help explain changes in international higher education and illustrate the fluidity of education in an evolving global society. This study employs a naturalistic qualitative research design with a two-step analysis of the target resource documents, constructivist typological study and substance analysis. The study then asks (a) what information academic credential placement recommendations offer, (b) if and how those styles have changed, and (c) if the forces of massification and marketization resulting from globalization and internationalization inform those changes. The objective of the analysis was to understand authorial intent for the placement recommendations, use of the placement recommendations, {{and the consequences of}} authors changing over time. This study examines 1932 - 2015 primary placement recommendation resource materials from all global regions and potential relationships between those materials and the increasing number of international students in the U. S. Also examined in this study are the impact of economics on international student recruitment and the evolving purpose of education through the late- 20 th and early- 21 st centuries. In the absence of regulatory oversight, HEI leaders have needed increasingly to understand national trends regarding use of credential evaluation services, in-house credentialing and necessary resources for success, and impact of inconsistent credential evaluation on fairness in enrollment and admission. The outcomes of this study are relevant to higher education leaders in that they address a common blind spot at many HEIs and challenge accreditation bodies to examine policies and adopt best practices. The researcher cataloged (a) the kinds of information and placement recommendations generally provided, (b) why the information and recommendations were credible or non-credible, (c) changes in this information during the time period under investigation, (d) if and how these changes can be linked to GLIMM, and (e) how in-house <b>credential</b> <b>evaluators</b> have responded...|$|R
40|$|For {{several decades}} {{members of the}} American Evaluation Association have {{discussed}} and disputed the issue of evaluator certification. Our past inability {{to agree on a}} certification solution may have been partially caused by the weaknesses of traditional certification systems, which rely on candidates obtaining a degree and completing a comprehensive exam. In this article we propose a certification system based on digital open badges. The open badge framework uses a top-down design to structure and understand the certification process as micro-certification units. These types of systems are adaptable and clearly communicate the evidence of knowledge, skill, and experience represented by the credential. The potential benefits of using an open badge infrastructure make this an enticing option and viable solution for the AEA to establish policy and practice regarding an efficient, rigorous and credible way to certify evaluators. Keywords <b>evaluator</b> certification, <b>credentialing,</b> open badges, <b>evaluator</b> training, assessment For several decades, members of the American Evaluation Association (AEA) have discussed and disputed the issue of evaluator certification (Becker & Kirkhart, 1981; Worthen, 1972).

40|$|Much of {{the sociological}} {{literature}} on professions {{is based on}} the traditional professions that emerged in the nineteenth century in response to the Industrial Revolution. This Portfolio uses literature from the sociology of professions to examine evaluation as a recently emerged area of work. The implications of this are considered for the further professionalisation of the practice of evaluation and contribution {{to our understanding of the}} sociology of professions. Research Stage One This Paper considers four theoretical approaches that have made a significant contribution to the sociology of professions literature. First, the work of the social commentator Herbert Spencer (1896) and his social Darwinian approach is reviewed. Spencer’s work led to the development of the second approach to be considered, trait theory (Chitty, 1997; Flexner, 1915, reprinted 2001; Greenwood, 1957, 1972). Both of these approaches come from within the structural functionalist school of sociology. In response to trait theory and its focus on the attributes of professions that developed under very specific social conditions, feminist approaches and the professional project concept emerged from the symbolic-internationalist school of sociology (Larson, 1977; Maack, 1997; Macdonald, 1995). While structural functionalists are concerned with how professions function in society, symbolic-internationalists are concerned with how occupations are granted professional status by society. This paper considers these different approaches and develops a pluralist model of professionalisation. This approach is then used in Paper 3 to explore the professionalisation of the practice of evaluation and to suggest how this could be further developed in the future. Research Stage Two In the major western economies of the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, evaluation emerged as a distinct area of work in the 1970 s as a result of the growth of government spending on social services and a need for public accountability. Evaluation has been described as a transdiscipline that serves practitioners from other disciplines (Scriven, 2013) and a metaprofession that draws practitioners from other professions to its workforce (Australasian Evaluation Society, 2013). It is generally accepted that evaluation is not a profession, but is professionalising (Canadian Evaluation Society, 2004; Cousins & Aubry, 2006). Evaluation offers an opportunity to apply learnings from the sociology of professions literature to understand the process of professionalisation in the modern era and consider the implications of this for both the future professionalisation of evaluation and the theoretical base of the sociology of professions. The recent history of evaluation demonstrates a continued process of professionalisation through the establishment of a need for services, the development of a community of practice, the establishment of ethics and development of evaluation specific theories and methods. The process of professionalisation of the practice of evaluation will be considered in Paper 3, using the model developed in Paper 1. Research Stage Three Most of the discourse on sociology of professions is derived from research on two professions – doctors and lawyers (Torstendahl, 1990 b). While this gap in research has begun to be addressed in recent years with studies on the professionalisation of other groups such as nurses (Chua & Clegg, 1990; Johannisson & Sundin, 2007), librarians (Maack, 1997; Sundin & Hedman, 2004), engineers (Ressler, 2011) and others, there remains an opportunity to further contribute to the growing body of knowledge and theory of professions in general and professionalisation in different social contexts in particular. Similarly, the early studies in sociology of professions were based on initial research in the United Kingdom and the United States, then applied to continental Europe and elsewhere, not as a specific-type but as an ideal-type (Torstendahl, 1990 b). This limited the inclusion of many knowledge-based occupations in the field of study (Maack, 1997) and disregarded the impact of the state on the development of professions (Torstendahl, 1990 a). Using the approach developed in Paper 1, which incorporates themes from trait theory and the professional project, this final research stage examines the professionalisation of evaluation since the 1980 s, when the first associations were established in evaluation. These associations established academic journals, professional development programs, international conferences and ethical guidelines for members. Evaluation has developed specific methods and is developing its own theories. The weaknesses of the professionalisation of evaluation generally relate to a lack of occupational closure: no qualifications and experience are required to work as an evaluator and evaluation associations accept non-evaluators as full members. Canada is the only country to have in place an evaluation credentialing system. The Canadian model, led by the Treasury Board of Canada, involves a partnership between educational providers, the Canadian Evaluation Association and the Treasury Board’s Centre for Evaluation Excellence in order to develop and administer a voluntary <b>evaluator</b> <b>credentialing</b> system (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, 2012 a, 2012 b). Comparison of the Canadian model with the approach taken in Australia demonstrates the important role of government as the main purchaser of evaluation in generating market pressure for improved quality. The Canadian model also demonstrates the importance of engagement with the educational sector to ensure an academic pathway into evaluation with a consistent national curriculum. While at a practical level this research suggests options to improve the professionalisation of the practice of evaluation in Australia, at a theoretical level the research demonstrates how trait theory and the professional project can be integrated in a pluralist model to advance the professionalisation of an occupation. Furthermore, an occupation, by establishing a deliberate plan for professionalisation that includes goals (or objective traits) linked to outputs and outcomes (or subjective traits), develops a framework to test the logic of the relationships within the model. This resolves the issue of untested causal assumptions that have been one of the main limitations of trait theory. This approach takes a continuous improvement perspective, where professionalisation is both an objective and a process. The award of the title profession is controlled by public opinion on the merit and achievements of the goals of the occupation through this process of professionalisation...|$|R
