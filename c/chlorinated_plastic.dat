40|$|The {{aim of this}} degree {{project was}} to study the use and {{presence}} of plastic in municipal large-scale catering establishments from preschool to high school and in geriatric care. It was also to get a deeper knowledge about the substance BPA and the plastic PVC and their connection with food. The third aim was to lay forward some suggestions for Eskilstuna about continued work and substitution in their municipal large-scale kitchens. The means for data gathering was databases, websites, scientific reports, on site visits, interviews, online survey and communication by phone and email. The result from the case study was that plastic articles as containers, disposable materials, utensils and food packages for storing food were used in hot, ambient, cold and freezing temperatures. Nine types of plastic were found: PP, PE, PC, PVC, PA, PS, PET, melanin and SAN. All large-scale kitchens had disposable gloves, plastic films and plastic bags. In the first two examples, some brands were made of PVC-plastic. PC-plastic was found in some drinking glasses, plastic food pans, utensils, bowls and jugs. BPA is a common additive in production of PC-plastic and therefore these articles may contain BPA. Between all ten municipal large-scale kitchens, there are some differences and similarities. Of all the kitchens, no one had exactly the same articles or methods, and some had also special routines that differed from the others. The suggestions to Eskilstuna municipality were to remove those articles that contained BPA or <b>chlorinated</b> <b>plastics</b> (especially those products that already had an alternative on the procurement contract), contact the suppliers and wholesalers and ask which products that both are made of PC and contain BPA or other bisphenols, develop a exchange plan for products that do not fulfil the future regulations of KRAV and finally demand in procurement that the product do not contain BPA, PVC or other <b>chlorinated</b> <b>plastics.</b> KRAV-certifiering av kommunala stork√∂k inom Eskilstuna kommu...|$|R
40|$|Technologies used {{within our}} {{environment}} are {{important aspect of}} our life; however, their environmental impacts are often not realized or considered. These impacts are expressed throughout the manufacturing, use and disposal of these products within our environmental premises and thus require monitoring {{and an understanding of}} each stage of technological life cycle. These technological accessories and machineries are located in our homes, offices, hospitals, schools (universities and colleges), laboratories, libraries, farms and every other place in our environmental premises, such technological accessories and machineries consumes various quantities of energy, but as a whole are not operating at optimal efficiency. The inefficient use and disposal of these technological by-products within our environment do not occur in the most environmentally sound manner possible, thus resulting in diverting unwanted places to landfills or storing them for extended periods of time. Both the inefficient use, manufacturing and disposal leads to generation and release of toxic compounds into the environment. Most organizations and industries begin their efforts to decrease technological waste and minimize their environmental impact by tackling small and focused problems. For example, there are <b>chlorinated</b> <b>plastics</b> in cable wiring, lead in cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, brominated flame retardants in computers, and mercury in LCD displays. This paper identified the needs for the implementation of environmental-wide green procurement strategies with respect to technology acquisition, use and disposal, as well as, offers recommendations regarding improvement of our environmental current systems...|$|R
