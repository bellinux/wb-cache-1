25|$|In 1385, {{the king}} ordered his two eldest sons {{to lead a}} two-pronged {{invasion}} of the southern kingdom in what would {{become known as the}} Forty Years' War. Tarabya commanded the First Army (7000 infantry, 500 cavalry, 20 elephants) while Swe led the Second Army (6000 infantry, 500 cavalry, 20 elephants). The two princes were advised by Ava's best commanders, including Thilawa of Yamethin and Theinkhathu Saw Hnaung. The Ava command expected an easy victory over an overpowered opponent. But Ava forces could not break through well-organized Peguan defenses for five months. Then, King Razadarit of Hanthawaddy made a tactical error by <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fortified capital to attack Ava positions near Pankyaw. Tarabya's army pounced, driving back and pursuing Razadarit's army. Meanwhile Swe's army had positioned in the path of retreat of the Hanthawaddy army. Tarabya, the overall commander-in-chief, sent a messenger, ordering Swe to hold his position and not to engage Razadarit until his army could reach the scene. But Swe ignored the order and the advice of his seasoned commanders, and ordered his troops to engage. Razadarit's army defeated Swe's premature attack, and got back inside Pegu. Five days later, with the rainy season approaching, the invasion was called off.|$|E
25|$|The first {{points of}} the match came from a penalty in the ninth minute. Brisbane's Shaun Berrigan, playing at hooker, tried to burrow over the Storm's try-line from dummy half but was ruled {{to have had the}} ball taken from his arms by Billy Slater in a two-man tackle. The {{resulting}} penalty kick by captain Darren Lockyer in front of the posts was a gift two points for the Broncos to take an early 2-0 lead. Three minutes later, Melbourne halfback Cooper Cronk kicked a 40/20 <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> side's territory. Following the subsequent scrum in an attacking position, the Storm raided Brisbane's line and got the first try of the match. Scott Hill did well to evade a few attempted tackles and shoot a remarkable pass around the back of a Broncos defender and into the arms of winger Steve Turner who dived over out wide. Cameron Smith missed the conversion, leaving the score at 4-2. Brisbane then got a scrum of their own close to Melbourne's line after Turner knocked on trying to take a Lockyer bomb. Lockyer, moving across-field fed the ball back inside to Justin Hodges who went over untouched to put the ball down near the posts, affording the Broncos captain another easy kick.No more points were scored {{in the first half and}} Brisbane went into the break with an 8-4 lead. Darren Lockyer was limping around in the dressing room but went on to play through the rest of the game.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the episode}} {{took place in}} August 2007. The opening and closing outdoor scenes were filmed in Trefil Quarry in the Brecon Beacons, the {{external}} scenes of the complex at Aberthaw Cement Works, and scenes in the [...] "battery farm" [...] were filmed in a hangar at RAF Saint Athan. CGI was used sparingly in production; the snow was paper snow adhered by water, and the Ood heads contained complex animatronics. McInnerny wore a prosthetic mask with two layers for his transformation scene though the production team's best boy provided motion capture for the computer-generated profile of the appendages <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth when this needed to be refilmed and McInnerny was unavailable.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{was told}} that he would be a series regular in season 3 the {{previous}} February, only a few days after his wedding. Muhney was very pleased to be a series regular, comparing his status to becoming a family member in the show rather than [...] "someone who comes over for dinner occasionally." [...] Piz (Chris Lowell) was named after the director of the show's pilot episode, Mark Piznarski. He was created in order to give Veronica a male friend who was not upper class. Thomas called Piz a [...] "Lloyd Dobler mold" [...] and [...] "a middle-class kid from a Portland suburb who has too many words <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{recollection}} of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): [...] "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal." [...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But {{the whole thing was}} created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} self-published November 5, 2009, and was made {{available}} through the author's website at www.blownforgood.com and on Amazon.com. Blown for Good was selected as a finalist in the 2009 [...] "Book of the Year Awards", by ForeWord Magazine. The Editor in chief of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega, described the book as a [...] "remarkable account". Ortega noted, [...] "Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology ..." [...] He concluded the review by commenting, [...] "Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's really like to work, {{day in and day}} out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit was <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ears and pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy." ...|$|E
500|$|A seventh caution was {{triggered}} on lap 138 when Gordon had smoke and fluid <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, ending his race. Most of the field, including Harvick, elected to pit under caution. Edwards spun {{after he left}} pit road but avoided damage to his car. During the pit stop period, {{the record for the}} most leaders in a Sprint Cup Series race was broken when Nemechek led one lap (the 27th race leader) before pitting. Kyle Busch led on the lap-144 restart, followed by Ragan, Kvapil, Stewart and Johnson. Four laps later, Johnson dropped from fifth {{to the rear of the}} field, as part of a strategy to run at the rear until the race ended. Kyle Busch lost the draft on lap 151, allowing Earnhardt to retake first place. Burton, with assistance from Richard Childress Racing teammates Bowyer, Harvick and Mike Wallace, moved back into the lead on lap 156. Ragan took over the lead on lap 160, after he was helped by Earnhardt.|$|E
500|$|Forster was {{at fault}} for Aston Villa's goal in a 1–1 draw in November; <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> penalty box {{in an attempt}} to {{intercept}} a long clearance but missing the ball and gifting Gabriel Agbonlahor a goal. However, he was defended by manager Ronald Koeman, who stated, [...] "He [...] is a great goalkeeper and that doesn't change after this mistake." [...] Another error by Forster a month later in the League Cup led to the only goal in a surprise 1–0 win for Sheffield United. Those two mistakes, however, proved to be exceptions, as Forster's form generally continued to be very impressive. By 7 February 2015, another clean sheet in a 1–0 win away at Queens Park Rangers saw Southampton move up to third place in the League. Fraser again gained plaudits, this time for pulling off a reflex save to tip a Charlie Austin downward header over the crossbar. The match was his 11th clean sheet in the Premier League, the best record among top-flight goalkeepers {{over the course of the}} season at that point.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Abernathy {{stated in}} his 1989 {{autobiography}} And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a [...] "weakness for women", although they [...] "all understood and {{believed in the}} biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just {{that he had a}} particularly difficult time with that temptation." [...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get her {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E

"'Humfray Adderton, who at {{the trial}} of Wenlock Christison, did, as it were, bid {{defiance}} to Heaven, by saying to Wenlock, 'You pronounce Woes and Judgements, {{and those that are}} gone before you pronounced Woes and Judgements; but the Judgements of the Lord God are not upon us yet,' was suddenly surprised: having been, on a certain day, exercising his men with much pomp and ostentation, he was returning home in the evening, near the place where they usually loosed the Quakers from the cart, after they had whipped them, his horse, suddenly affrighted, threw him with such violence, that he instantly died; his eyes being dashed out of his head, and his brains <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose, his tongue hanging out at his mouth, and the blood running out at his ears: Being taken up and brought into the Courthouse, the place where he had been active in sentencing the innocent to death, his blood ran through the floor, exhibiting to the spectators a shocking instance of the Divine vengeance against a daring and hardened persecutor; that made a fearful example of that divine judgment, which, when forewarned of, he had openly despised, and treated with disdain.'

500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E

50|$|Much {{later in}} to {{the life cycle of}} Call of Duty: Ghosts, FaZe saw yet another roster change; however this change is a result of {{personal}} issues between Parasite and his teammates and he got benched. Shortly after a very professional ordeal <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Censor, <b>his</b> actions are quickly undone as Dedo is traded to Evil Geniuses in exchange for a temporary loan of Karma, and Parasite is back in play.|$|R
2500|$|Some of the {{language}} used in Revelation 1 is also used in [...] to describe the Rider on the White Horse. In both places he has a sword <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth (1:16 and 19:15) and has [...] "eyes like blazing fire" [...] (1:14 and 19:12).|$|E

2500|$|John's {{vision of}} the Son of Man is {{described}} in the scriptural Revelation [...] John sees a {{vision of the}} risen, ascended and glorified Jesus Christ, whom he describes as one [...] "like the Son of Man" [...] (verse 12). Jesus is portrayed in this vision as having a robe with a golden sash, white hair, eyes like blazing fire, feet like bronze and a voice like rushing waters. He holds seven stars in his right hand and has a double-edged sword <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth. The vision is also notable for being the only identifiable physical description of Jesus in any form in the Biblical canon.|$|E

In his confession to this murder, he wrote: [...] "His brains were <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ears when I left him and he will never be any deader."
