5|$|General-purpose {{computing}} on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is {{a fairly}} recent trend in computer engineering research. GPUs are co-processors that have been heavily optimized for <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> processing. <b>Computer</b> <b>graphics</b> processing is a field dominated by data parallel operations—particularly linear algebra matrix operations.|$|E

5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the <b>Computer</b> <b>Graphics</b> Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the <b>Computer</b> <b>Graphics</b> Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to drive}} sales of the system, Pixar {{employee}} John Lasseter—who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr. (1986), {{to show off the}} device's capabilities—premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the boundary element method (BEM) as a valid tool for solving problems in structural mechanics and in other fields of applied physics is discussed. The development of an integrated interactive <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> system {{for the application of}} the BEM to three dimensional problems in elastostatics is described. The integration of interactive <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> techniques and the BEM takes place at the preprocessing and postprocessing stages of the analysis process, when, respectively, the data base is generated and the results are interpreted. The interactive <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> modeling techniques used for generating and discretizing the boundary surfaces of a solid domain are outlined...|$|R
5|$|Early {{encryption}} {{techniques such}} as the Hill cipher also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break. <b>Computer</b> <b>graphics</b> uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish tasks such as projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation. Matrices over a polynomial ring are important {{in the study of}} control theory.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game developed {{and published by}} LucasArts in 1998 for Microsoft Windows, with Tim Schafer as the game's project leader. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> overlaid on pre-rendered, static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in order to progress.|$|E
5|$|ILM's <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> {{division}} {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E

When Planetarian was released for Windows PCs on CD-ROM, Yumemi had full voice acting. The PlayStation 2 (PS2) port offers full voice acting for the entire cast. Other changes to the PS2 version include a higher resolution for the <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> and an extended soundtrack. All other later versions contained full voice acting.|$|E
5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because {{of their ability to}} help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was originally}} attributed to John Carmack, but an investigation {{showed that the}} code had deeper roots in both the hardware and software side of <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> Adjustments and alterations passed through both Silicon Graphics and 3dfx Interactive, with Gary Tarolli's implementation for the SGI Indigo as the earliest known use. It is not known how the constant was originally derived, though investigation has {{shed some light on}} possible methods.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> Rossum, Wilson, and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and so had music lessons. The Phantom of the Opera grossed approximately $154 million worldwide, despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, which praised the visuals and acting but criticized the writing and directing.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were {{completed}} by seven special effects studios, including Double Negative and Luma Pictures. Blur Studio {{was the lead}} studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years {{before the start of}} the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of Svartalfheim. The sequence consisted mostly of <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.|$|E

5|$|Applications of {{matrices}} {{are found}} in most scientific fields. In every branch of physics, including classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, {{they are used to}} study physical phenomena, such as the motion of rigid bodies. In <b>computer</b> <b>graphics,</b> they are used to manipulate 3D models and project them onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search. Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. Matrices are used in economics to describe systems of economic relationships.|$|E
