Traditionally, civic education has emphasized the facts of government processes detached from participatory experience. [...] In an effort to combat the existing approach, the National Council for the Social Studies developed the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards. The C3 Framework emphasizes “new and active approaches” including the “discussion of controversial issues and current events, deliberation of public issues, service-learning, action civics, participation in simulation and role play, and the use of digital technologies”.|$|E

The program aims to engage and inspire local youth through an education in philosophy, reasoning and the verbal arts of dialogue and rhetoric; building self-confidence and exposing its students to a wide range of philosophical material. Recognized by the American Philosophical Association, the program provides an introduction to philosophy and Socratic dialogue and includes writing, public speaking, debate, drama, poetry and art. The material uses the Socratic method to engage students and to encourage the use of critical thinking, reasoning and expression. Such modes of thought and communication foster the sense of wonder that is at the root of serious introspection, intellectual growth, and ethical reflection. February 2012, the American Philosophical Association's Committee on Pre-Collegiate Philosophy featured Winning Words and the <b>Civic</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Project in its Central Division meeting.|$|E

Three hundred sixty one Hispanic students of Cuban (253), Colombian (57), and Nicaraguan (51) ancestry from 10 middle schools participated in the study. Two hundred twenty eight students were from low socio-economic status (SES) background, and 133 were of middle SES background. There were 136 boys and 225 girls. The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement Civic Education Student Questionnaire was used to collect data. The instrument {{assessed the}} students’ <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> skills, and attitudes. Multivariate {{analysis of variance was}} used to test for differences in the <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> skills, and attitudes of participants based on ancestry, SES, and gender. ^ The findings indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> skills, and attitudes of Hispanic eighth grade students that were of Cuban, Colombian, and Nicaraguan ancestry. There was no significant difference in the civic skills and in five of the civic attitude scales for students from low SES families compared to those from middle SES families. However, there was a significant difference in the <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and in the civic attitude concerning classroom discussions and participation based on SES. The <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of middle SES students was higher than that of low SES students. Furthermore, middle SES Hispanic students displayed a higher mean score for the civic attitude of classroom discussions and participation than low SES students. There was no significant difference in the <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and in five of the civic attitude scales between boys and girls. However, there was a significant difference in the civic skills and the civic attitude of support for women’s rights between boys and girls.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the status of civics and {{citizenship}} education in schools in Afghanistan. My purpose for this study was (a) to understand what is taught about civics education in classrooms, (b) what concepts of civics education are addressed in the national curriculum and the text books, and (c) what role civics education plays in Afghan schools to produce productive citizens. My assumption is that schools have direct impact on civics understanding of the students and how they use their <b>civics</b> <b>knowledge</b> in everyday life. Civics education raises students’ political, governance, and social awareness and informs them about their rights and responsibilities as citizens. At this time of transition of Afghanistan from isolation to connection {{with the rest of the}} countries of the world, it is very important to understand how students build up their social and political views and how they perform their civil responsibilities. During my field work, I visited two female schools and one male school in Herat city. My research method was mostly qualitative; phenomenology, case study, and document review approaches. My findings are mostly based on school and classroom observations and my interviews with school teachers, students, and few of the administrative members. I also looked at the signs, symbols, and norms that represent civics education in schools. The little that I might have achieved through this research is aimed to strengthening Afghanistan schools in producing more productive citizens...|$|R

National Standards for Civics and Government (Center for Civic Education, 1994) promote civic literacy for all students including elementary children. Therefore, understanding important civic concepts is essential knowledge for elementary educators. <b>Civic</b> <b>knowledge</b> has not been required or monitored in teacher preparation or licensure. At the time of this study, there were no comprehensive measures of elementary teachers’ <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate a project funded by the Center for Civic Education that developed a <b>Civic</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Inventory (CKI) for elementary teachers using a Delphi technique. Specifically, this study analyzed the use of a Delphi process to identify major civic constructs elementary teachers should know and to create a valid and reliable measure of elementary teachers’ knowledge of these selected civic constructs. The Delphi technique engaged eight anonymous civic scholars to work together via the Internet. Through rounds of input and feedback they identified important <b>civic</b> <b>knowledge</b> that elementary teachers should know and created a multiple-choice measurement tool aligned to these constructs. In final analysis, the Delphi panelists collectively created a map of civic concepts that included: Constitutionalism, Representative Democracy, Citizenship, Human Rights, Civic Society, Market Economy and Examples of Non-Democracy as essential constructs accompanied by an outline of related sub-concepts and elements. This outline was then used to design, improve, and ultimately select the best test items for each construct. An item analysis was completed on data produced by 89 volunteer pre-service elementary teachers to identify high performing items to be included in the CKI. Therefore, the CKI could be used to examine the extent to which teacher preparation programs adequately prepare elementary teachers to be civic educators and thus guide teacher preparation as well as related professional development initiatives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we examine}} Florida’s sixth-eighth grade {{geography}} standards {{to determine the}} potential for teaching critical geography, a field that interrogates space, place, power, and identity. While 57 % of the standards demonstrated evidence of critical thinking, only six standards foster higher levels of critique consistent with critical geography. Current conversations about 21 st century learners {{stress the importance of}} skills necessary to function in a global society. These conversations have raised awareness of the interconnectedness of economic issues, problematized notions of citizenship, and complicated political and cultural boundaries (Castles, 2007; Suarez-Orozco, 2004). In the United States, the social studies curriculum at the K- 12 level builds a foundation to help students address these issues. However, as reading and math are privileged in the current high-stakes testing environment and research initiatives encourage Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, social studies education is marginalized in American school systems (Boyle-Baise, Hsu, Johnson, Serriere, & Stewart, 2012). As a result, social studies is taught only when it is tested, and these tests usually only feature American history and <b>civics</b> <b>knowledge.</b> A global perspective requires knowledge, skills, and dispositions addressed within geography-related material (Hanvey, 1982), yet geography courses are virtually non-existent in primary and secondary schools. In this paper, we examine the importance of, and potential for, geography as a discipline to prepare global citizens. In order to do this we feature data from a larger cross-case analysis of geography standards. Our analysis uses a lens that privileges critical geography, a field that interrogates the intersection of place, space, power and identity. Florida Department of Education’s (FLDOE) Next Generation Sunshine State Standards (NGSSS, FLDOE, 2008 a) at the middle school level were analyzed to determine where there is potential to have conversations facilitated by critical geography. We argue that a foundation in this field helps individuals develop an inclusive global perspective and higher level critical thinking skills...|$|R
