40|$|The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{recently}} updated its 2003 and 2010 {{logistic regression}} {{analyses of the}} effect of a reduction in light-duty vehicle mass on US societal fatality risk per vehicle mile traveled (VMT; Kahane, 2012). Societal fatality risk includes the risk to both the occupants of the case vehicle as well as any crash partner or pedestrians. The current analysis is the most thorough investigation of this issue to date. This paper replicates the Kahane analysis and extends it by testing the sensitivity of his results to changes in the definition of risk, and the data and control variables used in the regression models. An assessment by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) indicates that the estimated effect of mass reduction on risk is smaller than in Kahane's previous studies, and is statistically non-significant for all but the lightest cars (Wenzel, 2012 a). The estimated effects of a reduction in mass or footprint (i. e. wheelbase times track width) are small relative to other vehicle, driver, and crash variables used in the regression models. The recent historical correlation between mass and footprint is not so large to prohibit including both variables in the same regression model; excluding footprint from the model, i. e. allowing footprint to decrease with mass, increases the estimated detrimental effect of mass reduction on risk in cars and <b>crossover</b> <b>utility</b> <b>vehicles</b> (CUVs) /minivans, but has virtually no effect on light trucks. Analysis by footprint deciles indicates that risk does not consistently increase with reduced mass for vehicles of similar footprint. Finally, the estimated effects of mass and footprint reduction are sensitive to the measure of exposure used (fatalities per induced exposure crash, rather than per VMT), as well as other changes in the data or control variables used. It appears that the safety penalty from lower mass can be mitigated with careful vehicle design, and that manufacturers can reduce mass as a strategy to increase their vehicles' fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without necessarily compromising societal safety...|$|R

40|$|The recent spikes in {{gasoline}} prices have triggered some chatter about drivers shifting towards smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles. While Canadians tend to purchase smaller cars {{during periods of}} rapidly rising fuel costs, {{there has been an}} overall shift towards trucks over the last ten years. Consumer uptake of hybrid and electric vehicles has been quite slow. These alternative-powered vehicles still have a number of hurdles to overcome before they will comprise a significant share of the Canadian market. Despite ongoing efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of all vehicles, the rising demand for light trucks has left the overall fuel economy in Canada unchanged over the past decade. With gas prices still hovering at elevated levels, there has {{been a great deal of}} talk surrounding a shift toward more fuel efficient vehicles. While consumers do tend to purchase smaller cars during times of rapid gas price spikes, light trucks (which include <b>crossover</b> and sport <b>utility</b> <b>vehicles,</b> vans and pick-up trucks) have become a more popular choice among Canadian drivers over the years. What’s more, the overall fuel economy in Canada has remained quite constant over the past decade, despite ongoing efficiency gains created by automakers. Gas price spikes boost small car sale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There is now {{significant}} {{interest in}} {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) propulsion systems globally. Economics {{play a major role}} as evidenced by oil prices in North America pressing upwards of $ 100 /Bbl coupled with a customer preference for full size <b>crossover</b> and sport <b>utility</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The situation in Oceania is milder, but emerging markets such as China are experiencing automotive sector growth rates of 37 %/year. Europe remains least affected by hybrids since nearly 47 % of all new vehicles sold are diesel fueled and have economy ratings on par with that of gaso-line-electric hybrids. In the global economy there are presently some 57 Mil new vehicles manufactured each year. Toyota and Honda have projected that HEVs will be 10 % to 15 % of the U. S. market by 2009, with Toyota raising the bar further by stating they will produce 1 Mil hybrids a year in the 2012 time frame. Hybrid propulsion system types are only vaguely comprehended by the buying public, and to a large measure, even by technical professionals. This paper addresses this latter issue by presenting a summary of the globally accepted standard in hybrid power trains—the power split architecture, or more generically and in common usage, the electronic-continuously variable transmission.

40|$|Light duty {{vehicles}} {{represent a}} notable target of regulation in the United States {{due to their}} environmental, safety, and economic externalities. Fuel economy regulation {{represents one of the}} more prominent attempts to limit the environmental externalities of passenger vehicles entering the U. S. fleet, but focus intently on technology improvements rather than encouraging the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. More precisely, the current fuel economy standards, which will be phased in between 2012 and 2025, reflect an approach that is explicitly intended to be neutral with regard to the size and types of vehicles sold, with the stringency of the standard scaled to vehicle footprint, or the area between the four wheels. In light of this size-neutral approach to fuel economy regulation, as well as a lack of precedent in the automotive literature, the author examined the extent to which shifts in demand for different light duty vehicle segments can impact fleet-wide LDV fuel demand. Shifts in the demand for LDV segments have occurred in recent decades, with the market share of conventional passenger cars decreasing from more than 80 percent in the early 1980 s to just over half today, replaced largely by sport <b>utility</b> <b>vehicles</b> (SUVs) and <b>crossover</b> <b>utility</b> <b>vehicles</b> (CUVs). Though many factors influenced this transition away from conventional passenger cars, available literature suggests that misalignment between fuel economy policy and prevailing market conditions, combined with some protectionist tax policies for the domestic auto industry, were the main culprits. Moreover, a fleet model analysis suggests that the impact in terms of fleet-wide fuel consumption was not trivial, with vehicles sold between 1985 and 2010 consuming, over their entire useful life, over 100 billion gallons of petroleum more than if 1985 LDV market segments have prevailed over that period. This historical analysis provided motivation and justification for exploring the potential for shifts between segments in the LDV market to influence LDV petroleum demand over the next several decades, in order to illustrate the potential missed opportunities of implementing fuel economy regulations that do not encourage the sale of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. Using a spreadsheet-based accounting model of the vehicle fleet, the author's analysis suggests that plausible shifts in the market shares of different LDV segments could increase or decrease LDV petroleum demand by up to seven percent, relative to a reference case provided by the U. S. Energy Information Administration (which, in itself, suggests a modest decrease in the demand for SUVs and CUVs through 2040). The author also explored the potential of a more radical -yet still plausible - change to LDVs to impact fleet-wide fuel consumption over the next few decades. Automating passenger vehicle controls has long been imagined by futurists and tested in various forms by automotive manufacturers since the 1950 s, but recent developments stemming from a series of competitions sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency between 2007 and 2011 suggest that increasingly automated vehicle features may soon become a production reality. Though intended primarily as a means of improving safety, automated vehicle systems have the potential to also decrease fuel consumption. Also using the fleet model, the author evaluated the potential of a highway-only partial automation system - akin to systems reportedly being introduced to the market by General Motors and Tesla, among others, within the next two years - to reduce fleetwide LDV fuel consumption. Results suggest that, depending {{on a wide range of}} variables, reductions in fleet-wide fuel consumption of up to two percent are possible by 2050 relative to the Energy Information Administration reference case. Though the results of the analysis explored in this thesis may seem modest, they are notable nonetheless. Most importantly, they represent reductions in fuel consumption that are possible to achieve in addition to those likely to be driven by current fuel economy regulations. Therefore, the changes to passenger vehicles explored in this thesis represent potential strategies for reducing LDV fuel consumption as manufacturers reach the limits of technological improvements to engines. by David Perlman.
