50|$|According to Jay Levinson, guerrilla {{marketing}} emphasizes strongly on <b>customer</b> <b>follow-up</b> {{rather than}} ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on <b>customer</b> <b>follow-up</b> is a cheaper strategy because {{the cost of}} selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, {{it is important to}} focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of customer service strategies engaged by First Mutual Life Assurance Company. The objectives being: to find out the effects that training employees on customer service have on customer loyalty; to identify if employee emotional intelligence results in customer loyalty; and lastly, to establish the effects of <b>customer</b> <b>follow-up</b> on customer loyalty. Studies on other customer service management strategies in the past decade, have been done by many scholars in other countries, but a study, particularly on these issues has not yet been made in Zimbabwe. The insights and concepts by these scholars were of significant help in the completion of this research study, as the research managed to identify knowledge gaps and close the gaps using the ideas and suggestions by other authors, which gave the researcher a more profound understanding of the customer service strategies and how these build customer loyalty. The research adopted exploratory and descriptive research design, using non-probability and probability sampling techniques. Questionnaires for collecting data on customers and employees were used, while management data collection was done using interviews, with the use of 118 respondents as the sample size out of a population size of 2569 people. With pilot testing having been done, data was gathered using interviews with management, questionnaires that were administered by researcher for customers and employees. The research found some challenges with obtaining information from management due to their busy schedules. Management was not available for some time during the research hence the researcher then booked appointments to interview them in order to overcome this challenge. In order to avoid respondents feeling uncomfortable to give the information they were assured by the researcher that their responses would be held in strict confidence. The data from the study was then presented, analysed and discussed by the research in relation to the research objectives. The research then concluded that employee customer service training, employee emotional intelligence, and customer follow up have a positive effect on customer loyalty. From the conclusions made, the research recommends that FML should identify areas that need training, conduct regular training in form of refresher courses, and make sure that management encourage the expression of positive emotions in every service encounter. The research also recommends that management should adopt the concept of regular follow ups so as to get feedback from customers about their service encounter...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of an {{evaluation}} into the identification/brief advice (IBA) service about alcohol in community pharmacy settings in the North West of England. Since 2007, almost 100 pharmacies in the North West have - at some point - been commissioned to provide an identification and brief advice (IBA) service for alcohol. This evaluation sought {{to understand how the}} service had been adapted for and implemented in the community pharmacy setting, and how its potential might be maximised. Its aims were: 1. To characterise, consolidate and optimise both the constant and variable elements of the pharmacy alcohol identification/brief advice (IBA) service in NHS Northwest, and 2. To inform planning for current and future pharmacy based services promoting safe consumption of alcohol. The evaluation was split into three main workstreams, supported by a preliminary scoping phase, and combined quantitative and qualitative methods: •	Descriptive and comparative statistical analysis of pharmacy alcohol IBA data; •	In-pharmacy work, including observation of staff engagement with customers, recording consultations between staff and <b>customers,</b> <b>follow-up</b> telephone interviews with customers, and group feedback interviews with pharmacy staff; •	Stakeholder engagement through self-completion surveys, semi-structured interviews and a workshop.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented {{the practice of}} transactional sex in sub-Saharan Africa and its association with gender-based violence, gender inequalities and HIV risk. At the same time, {{it has been suggested}} that women may use transactional sex to obtain a greater sense of control over their lives and their sexualities, and to garner access to resources. The aim of this study was to better understand the practice of exchanging alcohol for sex in alcohol-serving venues in a township in Cape Town, South Africa. Data were collected between June 2009 and October 2010. Six venues were included and observations were conducted in each for four one-week periods over the course of a year. In-depth qualitative interviews included 31 women and 13 men whom interviewers had observed as regular venue <b>customers.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> interviews were conducted with 24 respondents to explore emerging themes. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Using a grounded theory approach, Atlas. ti was used to code transcripts, field notes, and analytical memos written about each document. Results revealed that alcohol was commonly used as a currency of sexual exchange in this setting, and both women and men understood that accepting alcohol from a man implied consent for sexual favors. Women reported a sense of agency in participating in the transactional sex dynamic, especially when they were able to manipulate it to meet their own ends without fulfilling the men's sexual expectations. At the same time, data revealed that the norm of transactional sex reinforced the undervaluing and commoditization of women. As identified elsewhere, transactional sex put both women and men at greater risk of HIV through multiple partners and inconsistent use of condoms, and the possibility of rape. Interventions are needed to address sexual risk behaviors and substance use within this context to prevent new HIV infections. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Expectations towards fitness {{exercises}} {{are the major}} factor in customer satisfaction {{in the service sector}} in question. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present a segmentation framework for fitness customers, based on their individual expectations. The survey was designed and validated to evaluate individual expectations towards exercises. The study included a randomly recruited sample of 723 subjects (53 % males; 47 % females; 42. 1 ± 19. 7 years). Factor analysis and cluster analysis with Ward’s cluster method with squared Euclidean distance were used to analyse the data obtained. Four components were extracted (performance, enjoyment, beauty and health) explaining 68. 7 % of the total variance and three distinct segments were found: Exercise Lovers (n= 312), Disinterested (n= 161) and Beauty Seekers (n= 250). All the factors identified have a significant contribution to differentiate the clusters, the first and third clusters being most similar. The segmentation framework obtained based on customer expectations allows better understanding of customers’ profiles, thus helping the fitness industry develop services more suitable for each type of <b>customers.</b> A <b>follow-up</b> study was conducted 5 years later and the results concur with the initial study...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaf [99]International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) {{acquired}} Bell & Gossett Company in 1963. Bell & Gossett {{was by far}} {{the leading}} company in the hydronics heating and cooling market (hot water/chilled water systems), with an estimated market share at that time of approximately 65 to 70 percent. Subsequently, ITT received negative media coverage in the 1960 s and 1970 s for a variety of reasons. Four brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted of Bell & Gossett's primary customers, plumbing and heating contractors, from 1968 through 1971. These studies uncovered a negative attitude towards ITT that was adversely affecting Bell & Gossett's own image with its <b>customers.</b> A <b>follow-up</b> opinion study conducted in 1980 using personal interviews clearly indicated that this negative attitude toward ITT was continuing to grow with a corresponding growth in the negativism displayed towards Bell & Gossett since it was owned by ITT. ITT then launched a public relations program with all of its major publics to offset this negative publicity that began in the late 1970 s and continued throughout the 1980 s. Follow-up brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted in 1987 with this same Bell & Gossett customer group to determine if the negative attitude towards ITT was still impacting adversely on Bell & Gossett. The 1987 study results contained little or no negative attitude toward ITT and its ownership of Bell & Gossett. This series of studies demonstrated two conclusions: 1. A conglomerate's image can adversely affect the reputation of its acquired companies. An effective public relations program can offset negative publicity and transform a negative attitude into a positive one. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a {{framework}} for the role of key account management systems in knowledge transfer, especially in the context of an expert organisation. Expert organisations constitute an interesting focus of analysis, while loosely coupled characteristics of that specific context might inhibit knowledge sharing. From our point of view, key account management provides a powerful tool for compensating such inhibitors. Within this framework, the phenomenon of knowledge transfer in the loosely coupled context is described mainly from the point of view of key account managers and KAM teams, and the role of this KAM system as a “junction ” of knowledge and information flows is emphasised. In our opinion, these views related to knowledge transfer in a loosely coupled system (such as expert organisations) and their effects on customer-relationship management have not been adequately studied in terms of the meaningfulness of expert work in today’s business life. This paper also presents findings from our dissertation projects. The case material consists of a pilot study, and the empirical data was gathered through personal interviews in a business service firm and its <b>customers.</b> In addition, <b>follow-up</b> type information gathering and internal document...|$|R
40|$|The {{world today}} faces many {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} sustainability and how {{the world will be}} able to continue to meet demands of future generations. Sustainability aspects are considered by customers and organizations to a greater extent today than ever before. Businesses need to find new ways forward to encourage sustainable consumption to be able to exist in the future. The increasing amount of food waste represents one of many sustainability challenges and is a stated problem in developed countries. In Sweden, the households stand for the biggest amount of food waste along the entire supply chain. Producing something that is later wasted is an inefficient use of resources. This study aims to identify barriers for consumers to act pro-environmentally when consuming products of low involvement and find ways for the industry to overcome them. The thesis is commissioned for a large bread company in Sweden, who is in the starting blocks of start selling frozen bread, something that is not done to a great extent today. Frozen bread is a more environmentally sustainable alternative than substitute products and it will serve as the low-involvement product in focus of this study. The theoretical framework is built on theories regarding consumer decision-making, consumer behavior, sustainability and sustainable consumption. Through in-store observations of <b>customers</b> accompanied by <b>follow-up</b> interviews, a solid amount of data was gathered which allowed the authors to address the gap between intentions and behavior. Semi-structured interviews with the manager of the grocery store and the commissioned company give insights to the industry perspective of sustainability and consumer behavior. The empirical findings are presented from each data collection instance and are later analyzed and discussed with regard to four sub-purposes and the theoretical framework. The results have shown that existing barriers relate to customers’ habits, inertia, attitudes and lack of knowledge. The industry has the opportunity to bring forward sustainable products without tradeoffs, to create a win-win situation. By appealing to the customers’ hedonic needs and informing them about environmental benefits it is possible to influence customer norms to achieve a pro-environmental behavioral change. ...|$|R
