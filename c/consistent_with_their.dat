5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|Dividing a(x) by b(x) {{yields a}} {{remainder}} r0(x) = x3 + (2/3) x2 + (5/3) x − (2/3). In the next step, b(x) is divided by r0(x) yielding a remainder r1(x) = x2 + x + 2. Finally, dividing r0(x) by r1(x) yields a zero remainder, indicating that r1(x) {{is the greatest}} common divisor polynomial of a(x) and b(x), <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> factorization.|$|E
5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E

50|$|They {{shared a}} guiding philosophy, {{to make the}} best motion {{pictures}} they could at any cost, even if it meant reshooting the entire picture. More important than showing a <b>consistent</b> profit <b>with</b> <b>their</b> films, was for them to see MGM become a high quality studio. That goal began <b>with</b> <b>their</b> early silent films, when stars such as Greta Garbo, Mayer's discovery, acted on lush settings with spectacular camera work.|$|R
50|$|These {{findings}} suggest that human beings, who are the targets of many perceivers in everyday life, may routinely act in ways which are <b>consistent</b> not <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own attitudes, beliefs, or feelings; but rather with the perceptions and stereotypes which others hold of them and their attributes. This {{seems to suggest that}} the power of others' beliefs over one's behaviour is extremely strong.|$|R
5|$|The PTC {{also has}} an Advisory Board {{consisting}} of politicians and entertainers working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media. Notable members of the advisory board include singer Pat Boone, former football player Mel Renfro, writer-producer Coleman Luck, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, comedian and actor Tim Conway of CBS's The Carol Burnett Show, former U.S. Senator from Kansas and 2008 presidential candidate Sam Brownback, film critic Michael Medved, star of 1980s soap opera Dallas Susan Howard, and ION Television producer Gary Johnson. In addition, the PTC has established numerous local chapters for most American media markets. Notable former Advisory Board members include - {{both of whom are}} now deceased - comedian Steve Allen, original host of NBC's The Tonight Show, and C. Delores Tucker, participant in the Civil Rights Movement and activist against gangsta rap music; Allen is now given the title of National Honorary Chairman-Emeritus. Bahçeşehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC advisory board members as not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> stance on morality.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

5000|$|Inhibitory control, {{also known}} as {{response}} inhibition, is a cognitive process that permits an individual to inhibit their impulses and natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral responses to stimuli ( [...] prepotent responses) in order to select a more appropriate behavior that is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> completing <b>their</b> goals. For example, successfully suppressing the natural behavioral response to eat cake when one is craving it while dieting {{requires the use of}} inhibitory control.|$|R

50|$|In many countries, Country of Origin {{information}} {{is used by}} migration officials {{as part of the}} assessment of asylum claims, and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports. Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions, finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases - and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims, so that the decision of one adjudicator is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> what <b>their</b> colleagues decide.|$|R
25|$|Between the two {{assessment}} periods, {{the views}} of many supporters changed dramatically as Perot re-entered the race in October and received nearly {{a fifth of the}} popular vote. The results showed that supporters recalled their past emotions as having been more <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> current appraisals of Perot than they actually were.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{it has become}} {{possible}} to reassign sex surgically. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual {{for some of the}} possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Ken Livingstone's Transport Strategy for London 2005 stated that: The {{safe use}} of the Thames for {{passenger}} and freight services should be developed.

50|$|The {{next step}} for {{companies}} is to rationalize their mail processing {{to be as}} <b>consistent</b> as possible <b>with</b> <b>their</b> organizational structure, e.g. choosing between {{the implementation of a}} centralized digital mailroom and the implementation of decentralized mail scanning facilities or a combination of the two.|$|R
25|$|In some 50% of {{the initial}} models of Tsiganis and colleagues, Neptune and Uranus also {{exchange}} places.

50|$|Yamaha was {{actually}} the first company to produce <b>consistent</b> results <b>with</b> <b>their</b> YPVS in their race bikes. The 1977 OW35K was the first race bike to incorporate the power valve system and it won the Finnish GP in 1977. The Kadenacy effect was harnessed and controlled {{to a point that}} gave Yamaha great advantage over all the other manufacturers throughout the late '70s and into the mid '80s. The first street bikes with YPVS were the RZ/RD350 YPVS (LC2-onwards), and RZ/RD500 GP Replica in 1983-84.|$|R
25|$|A 2005 {{study done}} in Belgium {{concluded}} that consumers' buying {{behavior is not}} <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> positive attitude toward ethical products. On average 46% of European consumers claimed {{to be willing to}} pay substantially more for ethical products, including fair-trade products such as coffee. The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.|$|E
25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism {{have altered}} the text to varying degrees to bring it into {{alignment}} with their view of modern needs and sensibilities. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional number and time periods during which the Amidah must be said, while omitting explicit supplications for restoration of the sacrifices. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> views that {{the rhythm of the}} ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often omit some of the Amidah prayers, such as the Mussaf, omit temporal requirements, and omit references to the Temple and its sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in a party's {{decision}} to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> desired outcomes, {{they are less likely}} to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.|$|E

40|$|Malaria parasites, though {{widespread}} among wild chimpanzees and gorillas, {{have not}} been detected in bonobos. Here, we show that wild-living bonobos are endemically Plasmodium infected in the eastern-most part of their range. Testing 1556 faecal samples from 11 field sites, we identify high prevalence Laverania infections in the Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba (TL 2) area, but not at other locations across the Congo. TL 2 bonobos harbour P. gaboni, formerly only found in chimpanzees, {{as well as a}} potential new species, Plasmodium lomamiensis sp. nov. Rare co-infections with non-Laverania parasites were also observed. Phylogenetic relationships among Laverania species are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> co-divergence <b>with</b> <b>their</b> gorilla, chimpanzee and bonobo hosts, suggesting a timescale for their evolution. The absence of Plasmodium from most field sites could not be explained by parasite seasonality, nor by bonobo population structure, diet or gut microbiota. Thus, the geographic restriction of bonobo Plasmodium reflects still unidentified factors that likely influence parasite transmission...|$|R
25|$|Althusser's {{influence}} is also {{seen in the}} work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on class as a process is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> reading and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{this theory}} of alien genetic-evolutionary {{intervention}} on Earth {{argue that if}} the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations with pre-human life forms on Earth that these aliens may have attempted to influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically {{that is what they}} would presumably be most familiar with. Counter to this view, the anatomy, physiology, and genetic makeup of primates and humans are extremely similar to other animals on Earth, including those with divergent non-humanoid forms such as sea urchins, sea squirts, and acorn worms.|$|E
25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E
40|$|Gut {{peptides}} play multiple {{roles in}} the controls of gastrointestinal function and in the initiation and termination of meals. Plasma levels of these peptides are differentially affected {{by the presence of}} nutrients in the digestive tract, and the patterns of peptide release are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> both <b>their</b> feeding stimulatory and inhibitory actions. A number of these peptide systems have been investigated as potential targets for antiobesity drug development. Progress has been made in developing long-acting peptide analogs and, in some cases, nonpeptide agonists and antagonists. Whether any individual approach will have significant long-term efficacy remains to be demonstrated. Approaches that target multiple systems may hold the most promise...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{changes in}} the gender composition of jobs in a large American bank. This change was occasioned by a restructuring initiative that created new positions. Through interviews with employees and direct observation of work in four geographic regions, we identify five factors that underlie the process of resegregation: managers built gendered assumptions into the new jobs; managers framed employees' choices based on these assumptions; employees responded to these cues and to {{the characteristics of the}} jobs; management made job assignments that were <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> both <b>their</b> assumptions and employees' choices; and both managers and employees developed shared gender norms associated with the new positions. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{tripartite}} {{pattern was}} found {{in each of the}} three types of risk-taking (i.e. fall-, burn-, and traffic-related) as reported by children (see Table  2).
