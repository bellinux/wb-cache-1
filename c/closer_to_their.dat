5|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> star than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.|$|E
5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|After the 1907 season, Stricklett {{returned}} to the California League to pitch for the San Jose Prune Prickers and Sacramento Sacts, and refused to report to Brooklyn in 1908 as his wife wanted him to remain <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> California home. As the California League was not recognized in organized baseball at this time, Stricklett was banned by MLB for four years. Though he applied for reinstatement, his banishment was upheld. Stricklett continued to pitch for San Jose through 1910, pitching to a 23-12 record in 1909 and a 19-14 record in 1910.|$|E

Among them, places <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> {{home is the}} primary choice because the living space {{is the center of}} all activities. Similarly, people also become victims at places <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> living center (Brantingham and Brantingham 1993, 1995, 2011).|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without {{a good candidate for}} a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> young.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> age than the coach's.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 1807, the Emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided {{that he needed to}} move northeast, in order to prevent Bennigsen's Russian army from using the bridge at Friedland to cross the Alle river. If the Russians managed to cross the Alle river at Friedland, they could then move <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> Prussian allies, who were based in Königsberg. Napoleon drew up a plan, giving Marshal Murat two army corps and a powerful cavalry reserve, with orders to march on Königsberg, while sending the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal Jean Lannes's Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), with Grouchy's dragoons and Nansouty's horse carabiniers and cuirassiers temporarily attached. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> {{production company}} and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 {{in the category of}} New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E
5|$|Initially, screenwriter Dan Sterling {{wrote his}} script {{based on a}} fake {{dictator}} from a fake country, but Rogen, Goldberg, and Sony executives asked him to rewrite the script focusing on Kim. The screenplay was then titled Kill Kim Jong Un. Previous iterations of the story revolved around Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously by reading non-fiction books and watching video footage about North Korea. The script was later reviewed by an employee in the State Department. Rogen and Goldberg aimed to make the project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor. They were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced their belief that {{the premise of the}} film was realistic.|$|E

As was the case under British rule, many locally recruited civilians worked in the base, though the Japanese Navy subjected them to harsh discipline which included physical beatings for minor mistakes as well as imprisonment or execution for theft and leaks of information. The Japanese Second Fleet and Third Fleet were transferred from the central Pacific to Singapore and the nearby Lingga Islands between February and April 1944 to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> sources of fuel oil. These two fleets comprised {{the main body of}} the IJN, and operated most of its remaining battleships and aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} farther from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E
5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E
