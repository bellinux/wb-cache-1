40|$|The current {{challenge}} in metal cutting models is to estimate cutting forces {{in order to}} achieve a more accurate and efficient machining process simulation and optimization system. This paper presents an efficient mathematical model for process simulation to evaluate the cutting action with variable part geometries of helical cutters and predict the cutting forces involved in the process. The objective of this paper has been twofold: to improve both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the algorithm for cutting force estimation in peripheral milling. Runout effect and the real tool tooth trajectory are taken into account to determine the instantaneous position of the <b>cutting</b> <b>flute.</b> An expression of average chip thickness for the engaged flute in the cut is derived for cutting force calculations resulting in a more efficient process simulation method in comparison with previous models. It provides an alternative to other studies in scientific literature commonly based on numerical integration. Experiments were carried out to verify the validity of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Application of mills with a {{curvilinear}} {{profile of}} the cutting edge (often called rough end mills) allows us to increase milling rate, but a roughness of the surface treated by such mills is higher, than after milling by the "ordinary" mills with the "smooth" cutting edge. Deterioration of a roughness {{is caused by a}} curvature of cutting edge. The shape and sizes of a profile are of crucial importance for forming roughness on a surface. A literary review revealed that depending on a {{profile of the}} cutting edge the roughness of the machined surface makes Ra 2 … 12, 5 μm. There is a developed parametrical computer model to visualize roughness formed on a surface after milling by the fluting cutter and curved cutting edge mill. The computer model also allows a 3 D chip type to be cut off from a work-piece by the mills with various cutting edge profiles. When developing the model it was assumed that the tilt angle of a <b>cutting</b> <b>flute</b> is equal 0 °, a trajectory of the tooth movement is a circle rather than a trochoidal curve. An experimental test of the model has shown that the radial beats of the mill teeth have a very significant effect on the extent of the roughness formed on the machined surface. After amendments - taking into consideration teeth beats - introduced into model the modeling error made less than 5 % that {{can be explained by the}} fact that profile parameters of the cutting edge of mills embedded in the model are inaccurate because of the tilt angle the cutting flutes. The analysis of the surface model has shown that after milling the work piece has a cellular structure. Each tooth with curved cutting edge forms the cell repeating with the next turn of a mill. The adjacent teeth form identical cells displaced in the feed path with respect to the cell formed by the previous tooth by the chip load Sz. Unlike processing by the ordinary mills with the "smooth" cutting edge in this case on a surface there is a surface texture not only in the feed path, but in the axial direction as well. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMachining {{optimization}} algorithms in end-milling with helical cutters {{require an}} efficient and accurate {{model of the}} uncut chip thickness (UCT) at every location along the <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes.</b> Past work has either ignored the effects of tool tilt and orientation or treated them with simple assumptions about their coupling with tool shape. The current paper treats the problem with considerably greater generality using an arc-length parameterization of the axis-symmetric tool profile. Each discrete tool move was considered a 3 -axis motion. Ignoring tool run-out, UCT was calculated {{in the direction of}} direct correspondence to local oblique cutting geometry, i. e., perpendicular to the local cutting edge and <b>cutting</b> velocity. The <b>flute</b> curves were intersected with the engagement contour corresponding to the instantaneous tool-work contact and the UCT inspected within. For a candidate taper ball end mill, the UCT results of the new model were compared with the standard Martellotti model.

40|$|Multi-axis {{machining}} (especially 5 -axis machining) {{is widely}} used in precision machining for automotive, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. The goal in precision machining is to increase production while meeting high part quality needs which can be achieved through decision of appropriate process parameters considering machine tool constraints (such as power and torque), chatter-free operations and part quality. In order to predict and decide on optimal process parameters, simulation models are used. In the literature, individual tool geometries for multi-axis machining are examined in detailed with different modeling approaches to simulate cutting forces.

40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenging}} task to avoid ploughing effects in micro-milling. When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum chip thickness boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum chip thickness effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate chip thickness, ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes</b> entry and exit the workpiece, minimum chip thickness and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal chip area is dividing into ploughing zone and shearing zone by the minimum chip thickness. Ploughing zone is the area as chip thickness {{is less than the}} minimum chip thickness. In the shearing zone, chip thickness is larger than the minimum chip thickness. The total chip ploughing volume is obtained by adding all ploughing area along axial direction...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} uncemented femoral stems were {{designed}} for patients having revision hip surgery, {{with the goals of}} promoting axial stability and preserving proximal bone stock. These stems were made individually using computer design and manufacturing technology. Various design features were examined using nonlinear finite element analysis. All stems had lateral, medial, and anterior flares in the proximal region, proximal hydroxyapatite coating, and a collar. Based on a published classification system, the three designs were found suitable for variously encountered cavitary defects. For cases involving small amounts of bone destruction, a primary type of stem was used. With severe cases, an extended polished stem was used. For the worst cases, an extended stem with longitudinal <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes</b> and complete hydroxyapatite coating was necessary. The axial migration was measured radiographically for a 2 -year period. The migration rates were comparable with those seen in cemented primary and in custom primary hydroxyapatite coated stems. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry data were obtained during a 4 -year postoperative period. Average bone density in all regions was maintained within 12 % of the immediate postoperative values. It was concluded that the proposed system for treating patients needing revision hip surgery showed desirable properties that were comparable to primary hip replacements...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{placement}} of self-tapping implants {{is associated with}} microfractures {{and the formation of}} bone chips along the <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes.</b> This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different cutting edge angles on chip formation during the machining of trabecular and cortical bone using instruments with a rough titanium surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mandibular cortical and trabecular bone specimens were obtained from freshly slaughtered domestic pigs. A predefined thrust force was applied to the specimens. Four specially designed cutting instruments that simulated dental implants and had a rough titanium surface were allowed to complete one full revolution at cutting edge angles of 55, 65, 75, and 85 degrees, respectively. Torque and thrust were measured during the cutting process. Bone chips were measured and weighed under a microscope. RESULTS: Different cutting edge angles did not lead to significant differences in torque. The lowest torque values were measured when the cutting edges were positioned at 65 degrees in trabecular bone and at 85 degrees in cortical bone. Bone chips were significantly larger and heavier at angles of 55 and 65 degrees than at angles of 75 and 85 degrees in trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: Instruments with a rough titanium surface show considerable angle-dependent differences in chip formation. In addition to bone density, the angle of the cutting edges should be taken into consideration during the {{placement of}} dental implants. Good results were obtained when the cutting edges were positioned at an angle of 65 degrees. This angle can have positive effects on osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Active {{parts and}} tips of various new {{stainless}} steel and nickel-titanium endodontic instruments can be coated with fragments or metal residues, which can become detached during endodontic treatment. These fragments may obstruct the root canals or even reach the periapical tissue during biomechanical preparation {{and should be}} removed before clinical use. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the presence of metal residues on both new stainless steel and nickel-titanium endodontic instruments, and to determine the cleaning efficacy of ultrasound using distilled water or disinfectant solution for removing these residues. Methods. Forty-eight stainless steel and nickel-titanium instruments were carefully removed from their original packages with dental tweezers, in order to avoid any contact with the <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes</b> and tips. The instruments were evaluated in term of metal debris presence, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The instruments were then removed from the electron microscopy analysis stubs and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes at a frequency of 28 kHz, using distilled water or disinfectant solution. The surfaces of the instruments were re-evaluated after cleaning. Results. Before ultrasound cleaning, a larger amount of metal debris was observed on the nickel-titanium endodontic instruments when compared to those made of stainless steel. The presence of metal particles on the instruments was evaluated by using EDS analysis. The use of ultrasound was effective in removing the metal residues from both types of endodontic instrument surfaces. Conclusion. The use of ultrasound proved to be an efficient method for the removal of metal particles from the surface of new stainless steel and nickel-titanium endodontic instruments...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} the pitting and crevice corrosion characteristics {{of stainless steel}} (SS) and NiTi endodontic files in R-EDTA and NaOCl irrigating solutions. Methodology The corrosion behaviour of two H-files produced from different SS alloys (Mani, AISI 303 SS, Dentsply Maillefer, AISI 304 SS) and one file produced from NiTi alloy (Maillefer) was determined in R-EDTA and NaOCl irrigating solutions by the cyclic potentiodynamic polarization method. The <b>cutting</b> <b>flutes</b> of 12 files of each material were embedded in an epoxy resin, polished, exposed to the irrigating solutions and used as an electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode {{was used as a}} reference, a platinum plate was used as a counter electrode and polarization curves were obtained for all files in R-EDTA and NaOCl irrigating solutions in 37 degreesC with a potential scan rate of 5 mV min(- 1). Corrosion potential (E-corr), Corrosion current density (I-corr) and Pitting potential (E-pit) were calculated from each curve. The results were statistically analysed with two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) multiple comparison test with materials and irrigating solutions serving as discriminating variables (a = 0. 05). Results Cyclic polarization curves presented negative hysteresis implying that pitting or crevice corrosion are not likely to occur for all the materials examined in both irrigating solutions. In NaOCl all materials showed significantly higher E-corr (P = 0. 011) as well as lower I-corr compared with R-EDTA reagent. Moreover, all materials demonstrated equal E-pit in NaOCl, which was to be found significantly lower (P = 0. 009) than the value of E-pit in R-EDTA. Conclusions None of the tested materials is susceptible to pitting or crevice corrosion in R-EDTA and NaOCl solutions and from this standpoint are appropriate for the production of endodontic files...|$|R

50|$|Milling is {{a cutting}} process {{that uses a}} milling cutter to remove {{material}} {{from the surface of}} a workpiece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. As the milling cutter enters the workpiece, the <b>cutting</b> edges (<b>flutes</b> or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving off chips (swarf) from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that hang together {{to a greater or lesser}} extent (depending on the material) to form chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its mechanics) from slicing softer materials with a blade.|$|R
40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous dynamic radii on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} dynamic radii and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial and axial depths of cut because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial and axial depths of cut affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial and axial depths of cut increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged flute lengths are increased. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} clearer idea of the milling forces, the influences of dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, and radial and axial depths of cut are discussed in this paper.

50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as <b>cutting</b> a tap's <b>flutes</b> with a hand file became a thing of the past.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the experimental validation for chatter stability prediction. An optimum machining was aimed to maximize the material removal rate, whilst maintaining a sufficient stability margin to assure the surface quality. High material removal rate in machining produced self-excited vibration or chatter of the cutting tool and the workpiece. This resulted in a poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy, chipping of the cutter teeth, and also may damage the workpiece as well as machining tool. Frequency response function of a single degree freedom flexural was measured and the cutting stiffness of tools were determined {{in order to be}} used in predicting chatter stability using semi discretization method. The aluminium 7075 specimens were used in the milling cutting experiment to validate the chatter stability diagram of mill uniform and variable cutters, where a set of spindle speed and depth of cut had tested. The vibration conditions of machining were identified by analysing the vibration signals and FFT spectrum whether it was stable or in a chatter condition. There are good agreement between predicted stability and cutting experiment for the down-milling operation using uniform 4 <b>flute</b> <b>cutting</b> tool. Stable conditions were shown outside the boundary of chatter region. The optimized cutting tool was predicted to suppress chatter. Machining experiment tests showed there were no chatter vibration conditions during machining process until 1. 5 mm depth of cut.

40|$|The {{development}} of nickel–titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments is undoubtedly {{a quantum leap}} for the field of endodontics. Nevertheless, those who have gained some experience {{in the use of}} such instruments will confirm that each file system has its own special advantages and dis-advantages and that particular rules for its usage need to be followed. With most NiTi systems, it is easy to reach working length and prepare the apex to a small size such as International Standards Organization (ISO) size 20. When the apex is prepared to larger sizes, however, the limits of a particular system quickly become apparent. The idea of the hybrid concept is to combine instruments of different file systems and use different instrumen-tation techniques to manage individual clinical situations to achieve the best biomechanical cleaning and shaping results and the least procedural errors. The hybrid concept combines the best features of different systems for safe, quick, and predictable results. Nickel–titanium rotary instrument systems Some NiTi rotary instrument systems that presently can be used for this hybrid concept are introduced here, and their main features are described. Among these systems, two main categories of NiTi rotary instruments need to be differentiated: active and passive instruments.

40|$|Objectives. This article explores {{in detail}} {{questions}} of instrument operation function of tapping internal threads in hard materials. The existing relationship between vibration system amplitude and tool durability is indicated; on this basis, it is {{determined that the}} best course for improving the durability performance is increasing vibratory resistance. Based on a critical analysis of existing designs with consideration of their flaws, {{the development of new}} technological designs of taps is tasked with ensuring stable operation when handling hard materials. Methods. It is noteworthy that one of the main vibration resistance improvement methods of the tool is to reduce the contact area of the tool with the work piece in the cutting zone. Methods are proposed for improving the vibration resistance of taps, considering the correlation adjustment of tap teeth in order to completely eliminate friction at the sides of the thread cutting surface and uneven implementation <b>flute</b> <b>cutting</b> steps. Results. The idea of increasing vibration resistance has seen the new development of vibration-proof tap designs, heralded as innovations due to the accuracy of thread cutting and durability achieved by reducing the thread contact area with the work piece in the cutting zone.

40|$|This {{innovation}} comprises {{a compact}} drill that uses low-axial preload, via vibrations, that fractures the rock under the bit kerf, and rotates the bit {{to remove the}} powdered cuttings while augmenting the rock fracture via shear forces. The vibrations fluidize the powered <b>cuttings</b> inside the <b>flutes</b> around the bit, reducing the friction with the auger surface. These combined actions reduce the consumed power and the heating of the drilled medium, helping to preserve the pristine content of the produced samples. The drill consists of an actuator that simultaneously impacts and rotates the bit by applying force and torque via a single piezoelectric stack actuator {{without the need for}} a gearbox or lever mechanism. This reduces the development/fabrication cost and complexity. The piezoelectric actuator impacts the surface and generates shear forces, fragmenting the drilled medium directly under the bit kerf by exceeding the tensile and/or shear strength of the struck surface. The percussive impact action of the actuator leads to penetration of the medium by producing a zone of finely crushed rock directly underneath the struck location. This fracturing process is highly enhanced by the shear forces from the rotation and twisting action. To remove the formed cuttings, the bit is constructed with an auger on its internal or external surface. One of the problems with pure hammering is that, as the teeth become embedded in the sample, the drilling efficiency drops unless the teeth are moved away from the specific footprint location. By rotating the teeth, they are moved to areas that were not fragmented, and thus the rock fracturing is enhanced via shear forces. The shear motion creates ripping or chiseling action to produce larger fragments to increase the drilling efficiency, and to reduce the required power. The actuator of the drill consists of a piezoelectric stack that vibrates the horn. The stack is compressed by a bolt between the backing and the horn in order to prevent it from being subjected to tensile stress that will cause it to fail. The backing is intended to transfer the generated mechanical vibrations towards the horn. In order to cause rotation, the horn is configured asymmetrically with helical segments and, upon impacting the bit, it introduces longitudinal along the axis of the actuator and tangential force causing twisting action that rotates the bit. The longitudinal component of the vibrations of the stack introduces percussion impulses between the bit and the rock to fracture it when the ultimate strain is exceeded under the bit...|$|R
