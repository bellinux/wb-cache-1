5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, republican {{sentiment}} in Britain, {{fed by the}} Queen's seclusion, was boosted after {{the establishment of the}} Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> spray. In late November 1871, {{at the height of the}} republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century William Stewart Halstead (1852–1922) laid out basic {{surgical}} principles for asepsis known as Halsteads principles. Halsted also introduced the latex medical glove. After {{one of his}} nurses suffered skin damage due to having to sterilize her hands with <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> Halsted had a rubber glove that could be dipped in <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> designed.|$|E

25|$|Soon afterward, in 1834, Friedrich Ferdinand Runge {{discovered}} <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> in coal-tar, and Auguste Laurent obtained it from phenylhydrate, {{which was}} soon {{determined to be}} the same compound. There was no clear view on the relationship between <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> and creosote; Runge described it as having similar caustic and antiseptic properties, but noted that it was different, in that it was an acid and formed salts. Nonetheless, Reichenbach argued that creosote was also the active element, as it was in pyroligneous acid. Despite evidence to the contrary, his view held sway with most chemists, and it became commonly accepted wisdom that creosote, <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> and phenylhydrate were identical substances, with different degrees of purity.|$|E
25|$|Commercially used {{creosote}} {{is often}} treated {{to extract the}} <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> naphthalene, or anthracene content. The <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> or naphthalene is generally extracted {{to be used in}} other commercial products. American produced creosote oils typically will have low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of naphthalene, because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will be ruined and only the hard pitch will remain; this ruins it for use in roofing purposes, and only leaves a product which isn't commercially useful.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, {{physician}} Agostino Gemelli {{wrote that}} Pio was a hysteric and his stigmata was self-induced not of supernatural origin. Gemelli also speculated that his wounds were kept open with <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{pharmacist}} sold four {{grams of}} <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> to Padre Pio {{in the year}} 1919. The archbishop of Manfredonia, Pasquale Gagliardi, reported this as evidence that Padre Pio could have effected the stigmata with acid. This suggestion was examined and dismissed by the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|Phenol, {{also known}} as <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> is an {{aromatic}} organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a phenyl group (−C6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (−OH). It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns.|$|E
25|$|A {{recipe for}} {{preparing}} the ink is as follows: Take one lb. of bruised galls, one gallon of boiling water, 5½ oz of ferrous sulfate in solution, 3 oz of gum arabic previously dissolved, {{and a few}} drops of an anti-septic, such as <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Macerate the galls for 24 hours, strain the infusion and add the other ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> as he called it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Angus Smith {{developed}} and patented a product called McDougall's Powder as a sewer deodorant; it was mainly composed from <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a sewage farm. This later led to {{widespread use of}} creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted dip, and drenching tubes {{would be used to}} administer doses to the animals' stomachs to kill internal parasites.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{benefits}} of gas lighting and heating, the process for producing coal gas yielded {{a number of other}} substances which were subsequently successfully exploited. Among these were coke; ammonia; phenol (<b>carbolic</b> <b>acid),</b> a disinfectant and one of the components of bakelite, the first synthetic plastic invented in 1910; and coal tar, which contained a number of organic chemicals. Coal tar was subsequently used to produce the first synthetic dye, mauve, by William Henry Perkin in 1856 and in 1853 was found, by Charles Gerhardt to contain the chemical acetylsalicylic acid, now known as aspirin.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, Pasteur's rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, used <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> to kill anthrax bacilli {{and tested}} the vaccine on sheep. Pasteur {{thought that this}} type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. In early 1881, Pasteur discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method {{in a speech to the}} French Academy of Sciences on February 28. Later in 1881, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at Pouilly-le-Fort on sheep, goats and cows, was successful. Pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort. His laboratory notebooks, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, show that he actually used heat and potassium dichromate, similar to Toussaint's method.|$|E
500|$|According to an eye witness, an {{assistant}} janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer to Our Lady. Each time the guards checked on him, {{he was standing}} or kneeling {{in the middle of}} the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. [...] After two weeks of dehydration and starvation, only Kolbe remained alive. “The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientist}} Michael Faraday {{described the}} situation {{in a letter to}} The Times in July 1855: shocked at the state of the Thames, he dropped pieces of white paper into the river to [...] "test the degree of opacity". His conclusion was that [...] "Near the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind.... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." [...] The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, chloride of lime and <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> into the waterway to ease the stench.|$|E
500|$|In late 1891, the Prince was implicated {{as having}} been {{involved}} with a former Gaiety Theatre chorus girl, Lydia Miller (stage name Lydia Manton), who committed suicide by drinking <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Although she was the nominal mistress of Lord Charles Montagu, who gave evidence at the inquest, it was alleged that he was merely a cover for the Prince who had requested she give up her theatrical career on his behalf, and that the authorities sought to suppress the case by making the inquest private and refusing access to the depositions. Similarly to the Cleveland Street scandal only overseas newspapers printed Albert Victor's name, but regional British newspapers did quote the radical London newspaper The Star which published: [...] "It is a fact so well known that the blind denials of it given in some quarters are childishly futile. Lydia Manton was the petite amie of a certain young prince, and that, too, quite recently." [...] It was labelled [...] "a scandal of the first magnitude... on the lips of every clubman", and compared to the Tranby Croft affair, in which his father was called to give evidence at a trial for slander.|$|E
500|$|A {{few years}} later, when World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse {{with her mother}} and Olga. They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot her mother had been born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip she heard about her own German connections.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in Carlisle, England, {{officials}} were {{experimenting with a}} sewage treatment, using <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> to reduce the smell of sewage cess pools. [...] Having heard of these developments and having himself previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success, Lister decided to try <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> as an wound antiseptic. [...] He had his first chance on August 12, 1865, when he received a patient: an eleven year old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced {{the skin of his}} lower leg. [...] Ordinarily, amputation would be the only solution. [...] However, Lister decided to try <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> [...] After setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints, Lister soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> and applied them to the wound, covered with a layer of tin foil, leaving them for four days. [...] When he checked the wound, Lister pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection, just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> [...] Reapplying fresh bandages with diluted <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were both}} {{religious}} and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{to make the}} wounds. [...] The historian Sergio Luzzatto recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Pio had requested <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> from a pharmacist. She said it was for sterilization.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was soon}} {{commonly}} sold {{under the name}} [...] "creosote", and the scarcity of wood-tar creosote in some places led chemists {{to believe that it}} was the same substance as that described by Reichenbach. In the 1840s, Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez, after realizing that two samples of substances labelled as creosote were different, started a series of investigations to determine the chemical nature of <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> leading to a conclusion that it more resembled chlorinated quinones and must have been a different, entirely unrelated substance.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were both}} {{religious}} and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> {{to make the}} wounds. In 2007, The Telegraph reported on the book, The Other Christ: Padre Pio and 19th Century Italy, by the historian Sergio Luzzatto. He recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Padre Pio requested <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> from a pharmacist. She said it was for sterilization. The Catholic Anti-Defamation League said Luzzatto was spreading [...] "anti-Catholic libels" [...] and needed {{to learn more about}} religion. [...] Luzzatto was awarded the [...] in History for the book.|$|E
2500|$|The Church {{dismissed}} {{charges that}} he had faked the stigmata. [...] "The boys had needed injections to fight the Spanish Flu which was raging at that time. Due to a shortage of doctors, Padres Paolino and Pio administered the shots, using <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> as a sterilizing agent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Using [...] Belgian chemist Dr. Leo Baekland's {{patented}} <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> and formaldehyde {{phenolic resin}} compound marketed as [...] "Bakelite", Dr. Robert Nebesar patented a process where bakelite-bonded fine grain plywood was formed under pressure and heat {{to produce a}} strong light weight curved panel. The process was marketed under the trade name [...] "Duraloid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phenol was {{discovered}} in 1834 by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who extracted it (in impure form) from coal tar. Runge called phenol [...] "Karbolsäure" [...] (coal-oil-acid, <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid).</b> [...] Coal tar remained the primary source until {{the development of the}} petrochemical industry. [...] In 1841, the French chemist Auguste Laurent obtained phenol in pure form.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{continued}} on alternative sclerosants {{in the early}} 20th century. During that time <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> and [...] perchlorate of mercury were tried and whilst these showed some effect in obliterating varicose veins, side-effects also caused them to be abandoned. Prof. Sicard and other French doctors developed the use of sodium carbonate and then sodium salicylate {{during and after the}} First World War. Quinine was also used with some effect during the early 20th century. At the time of Coppleson's book in 1929, he was advocating the use of sodium salicylate or quinine as the best choices of sclerosant.|$|E
2500|$|A lorry {{carrying}} 100kg of phenol (<b>carbolic</b> <b>acid),</b> a {{toxic product}} {{used in the}} pharmaceutical industry, was initially thought {{to be close to}} the seat of the fire; however this is discovered to be an error and only 100g was carried. Eyewitness accounts state that two loud bangs, described as explosions, were heard and then thick smoke swept through the carriage. The train came to a grinding halt, and the lights went out. Further eyewitness accounts suggest that the emergency exit was jammed, and one passenger smashed a window with a hammer in order to climb out. The temperature in the tunnel was described as [...] "very hot".|$|E
2500|$|The {{founder of}} Milan's Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, friar, physician, and {{psychologist}} Agostino Gemelli, met Padre Pio once, {{for a few}} minutes, {{and was unable to}} examine his stigmata. According to Agostino Gemelli, Padre Pio was [...] "an ignorant and self-mutilating psychopath who exploited people's credulity." [...] Gemelli speculated that Padre Pio kept his wounds open with <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid.</b> As a result, Padre Pio was required to wrap the wounds in cloth. For many years, he wore fingerless gloves that concealed his wounds. According to believers, the bleeding continued for some 50 years until the wounds closed within hours of his death.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of coal-tar distillation, the {{distillate}} is collected into four fractions; the [...] "light oil", which remains lighter than water, the [...] "middle oil" [...] which passes over when the light oil is removed; the [...] "heavy oil", which sinks; and the [...] "anthracene oil", which when cold is mostly solid and greasy, of a buttery consistence. Creosote refers to the portion of coal tar which distills as [...] "heavy oil", typically between 230270°C, also called [...] "dead oil"; it sinks into water but still is fairly liquid. <b>Carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> is produced in the second fraction of distillation and is often distilled into what {{is referred to as}} [...] "carbolic oil".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Lister was {{a student}} at University College London under Robert Liston, later rising to the rank of Surgeon at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. [...] Lister experimented with cloths covered in <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> after {{studying}} the works and experiments of his contemporary, Louis Pasteur in sterilizing various biological media. [...] Lister was inspired {{to try to find a}} way to sterilize living wounds, which could not be done with the heat required by Pasteur's experiments. [...] In examining Pasteur's research, Lister began to piece together his theory: that patients were being killed by germs. [...] He theorized that if germs could be killed or prevented, no infection would occur. [...] Lister reasoned that a chemical could be used to destroy the micro-organisms that cause infection.|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield {{was shot}} by Charles J. Guiteau. One bullet was thought later to have {{possibly}} lodged near his liver but could not be found. Standard medical practice at the time called for physicians to insert their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe and locate {{the path of the}} bullet. Surgically opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds, Germ theory, and Dr. Joseph Lister's technique for [...] "antisepsis surgery" [...] using dilute <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid,</b> which had been first demonstrated in 1865, had not yet been accepted as standard practice by prevailing medical authorities. Sixteen doctors attended to Garfield and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's death.|$|E
2500|$|Until the {{pioneering}} work of British surgeon Joseph Lister in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see [...] "miasma") {{was responsible for}} infections in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient's wounds were not available. Lister {{became aware of the}} work of French chemist Louis Pasteur, who showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if micro-organisms were present. [...] Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the micro-organisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. [...] As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying <b>carbolic</b> <b>acid</b> on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in The Lancet.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{national}} medical associations conferred honorary fellowships on Illingworth, {{both within}} Britain and abroad. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Surgeons ('Abdominal Surgery', 1954). Four years later, {{he was made}} an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. At the awarding ceremony on 11 June 1958, he delivered a speech addressing those starting out on their medical careers. University honours, {{in addition to the}} Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees received in 1965 during the Lister and Moynihan centenaries, included two Honorary Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degrees, one from the University of Sheffield (1962), and one from the University of Belfast (July 1963). That same year, it was announced that Illingworth would receive the Lister Medal. The announcement of the award in the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England stated that it was for:"...his devotion to surgical science over a long period; and in particular for his contributions to knowledge of jaundice and diseases of the biliary tract, of peptic ulcer, and of the endocrine aspects of the treatment of cancer; and for his perception {{of the importance of the}} use of oxygen in treatment under hyperbaric conditions as a field for physiological research." [...] Illingworth's Lister Oration was delivered on 9 April 1964 at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in London under the title 'On the Interdependence of Science and the Healing Art'. The Lister Medal itself was presented following the Oration, both events taking place as part of what was then known as the Lister Festival. A few months later, Illingworth delivered the Lister Lecture of the Canadian Medical Association in Vancouver, Canada, on 24 June 1964, under the title 'Wound Sepsis—From <b>Carbolic</b> <b>Acid</b> to Hyperbaric Oxygen'.|$|E
