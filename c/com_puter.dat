The benign, reticu-lar pattern of hyperpigmentation occurs with direct repeated exposure to heat sources, such as heating pads, and has been found in up to 3 % of the population. 1 Heat is thought to induce epidermal damage along superficial blood vessels, causing deposition of hemo-siderin in a net-like distribution. Most instances result from repeated exposure (last-ing one to several hours) of the skin to heat. 2, 3 Erythema ab igne can appear as early as two weeks or as late as one year following the onset of heat exposure, depending on the intensity of the heat and the presence of clothing between the skin and the heat source. 3 Recently, the heat from laptop <b>com</b> <b>puters</b> has been implicated. 3 Other than the permanent removal of the heat source from the skin, no further treatment is required.

And what responses are possible, other than dutifully churning out ever more ameliorative “plans ” for schools to “implement”? What are the contours of praxis in such times? The inquiry detailed below originated in such questions and my desire {{to contribute to the}} larger hermeneutic community that seeks more satisfying interpretations of curriculum change and the people who live it. There is no paucity of advice for teachers. Their work world is a pre scriptive milieu peppered with criticism, exhortations, and man dates, among which are the curriculum innovations or inventions (Westbury, 1984) of educational researchers and curriculum workers. My purpose in this study was to generate grounded speculations, or hypotheses, about the mediating influence of teachers, conceived as autonomous agents, on the implementation of one such curriculum invention in their classrooms. Computer assisted instruction (CAT) was deemed an appropriate in vention for this exploration of teachers as curriculum agents. First, it was accessible. Most schools in the United States now have <b>com</b> <b>puters</b> (Quality Educational Data, 1984), {{and many of them are}} in some way implementing CAT. Second, CAT is a relatively unplanned invention and, consequently, its potential in the hands of teachers is vast. They can take the basic abstraction of CAT (using computers to help students learn the curriculum) in myriad directions and ex press it in as many forms. The invention itself is feeble compared to the level of development needed before it can be used in actual situ ations for particular purposes, so the terrain between invention and implementation is rich with practical mediation. Dorothy and Mary I interviewed two teachers over a period of eight months as they in quired into CAT and attempted to develop classroom applications. Their interest in this au courant invention had inclined them to en roll in a local university course on CAT, and in addition to this self selection, each had indicated a desire to carry on the inquiry in their elementary school settings.

Methods: Liver biopsy procedures performed on chronic hepatitis C patients in our gastroenterology unit at King Khalid University Hospital were traced from records between the years 1998 to 2003. The hospital <b>com</b> [...] <b>puter</b> database was then accessed and detailed laboratory parameters obtained. By plotting receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), three selected models (platelet count, AST/ALT ratio, and the APRI score) were compared in terms of the best variable to predict significant fibrosis. Results: Two hundred and forty-six patients with hepatitis C were included in this analysis. Overall, 26 &#x 0025; of patients had advanced fibrosis.

The phase-space distribution does not remain smooth and well-behaved but collapses onto a multifractal strange attractor in phase space with an information dimension smaller than the phase-space dimension.
