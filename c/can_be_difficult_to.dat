5|$|The Golondrina <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> type {{because of}} its {{similarity}} to other point classifications. In particular the distinction between Golondrina and Plainview is not yet completely resolved.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. However, the underlying cause <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract from the follicles. Seeds {{do not require}} any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E

5|$|Since Norfolk {{serves as}} the {{commercial}} and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk {{from that of the}} region as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to {{the sensitivity of the}} bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|The song {{differs from}} that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta. However, mixed singers occur in the {{hybridisation}} zone and elsewhere, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> allocate to species.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{diagnose}} from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors {{occur with}} other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors {{similar to those}} seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> collect large amounts of data.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E

5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used}} to show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
