5|$|The Chimariko also {{suffered}} heavily when European prospectors entered {{the region in}} the 19th century searching for gold. After clashing with the Europeans, many members of the tribe were dispersed to Shasta territory or killed. Some returned to the Trinity River in the late 19th century, after the gold seekers had left. People of Chimariko ancestry <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the region, although the tribe functionally no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, {{his cousin}} and {{intended}} fiancée, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As {{they wait for}} an opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.|$|E

5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He said later that he could not <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A {{few of the}} larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including {{a large proportion of}} fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into Old House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the village today and many old farm buildings still exist.

25|$|Parasitic fungi derive {{some or all}} {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from plants, other fungi, or animals, and unlike mycorrhizal fungi which have a mutualistic relationship with their host plants, they are pathogenic.
