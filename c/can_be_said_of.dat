5|$|Little more <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Padarn, {{though he}} later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed {{details of his}} life. He {{may have been more}} closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports {{the theory that the}} ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E

25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought {{to put up a}} good fight but never expected to win. Much the same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E
25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E

25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|The {{role and}} nature of Sanskrit {{must be taken into}} {{consideration}} to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (a-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.|$|E

Several critics {{identified}} that the script was excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that [...] "the chief credit for... joy {{of a film}} should go to T. E. B. Clarke". The unnamed reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "every line, every 'gag', is a little masterpiece of wit", while the critic C. A.

500|$|In 1867, a {{policeman}} named Armand Barbier arrested Norton to commit him to involuntary {{treatment for a}} mental disorder. The arrest outraged the citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers. Police Chief Patrick Crowley ordered Norton released and issued a formal apology {{on behalf of the}} police force. Crowley wrote [...] "that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> his fellows in that line." [...] Norton magnanimously granted an Imperial Pardon to the errant policeman. All police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted Norton as he passed in the street.|$|E
500|$|It must be emphasized, however, that {{an entity}} {{is not merely}} a sum of its relations, but also a {{valuation}} of them and reaction to them. [...] For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. [...] Of course, most entities do not have consciousness. [...] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. [...] Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.|$|E

500|$|From a {{technical}} and tactical point of view, the D-1 project provided the Red Army (RKKA) corps artillery with a modern 152mm howitzer, which combined both good mobility and firepower. When {{compared with a}} typical contemporary howitzer of similar caliber, the D-1 had shorter range, but was much lighter. For example, the German 15 cm sFH 18 had a range of 13,325 meters - about one kilometer longer {{than that of the}} D-1 - but also weighed almost two tons more (5,510 kilograms in traveling position). The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the US 155-mm howitzer M1 (14,600 meters, 5,800 kilograms) or the 149mm howitzer manufactured by the Italian Ansaldo (14,250 meters, 5,500 kilograms). A German howitzer with characteristics {{similar to those of the}} D-1 [...] the 15 cm sFH 36 [...] did not reach mass production. Compared with older pieces such as the French Schneider model 1917 (11,200 meters, 4,300kg), the D-1 had the advantage in both weight and range.|$|E

So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And the same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the entire team."
