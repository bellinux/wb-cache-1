40|$|The {{question}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the risk prevention measures related to the use of <b>CMR</b> <b>chemicals</b> represents high challenges in terms of the health of the workers exposed to them. In most cases, prevention measures are limited to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), although the regulation favours collective protective equipment (CPE). Constraints related to wearing PPE are generally known: discomfort in the movements, thermal discomfort, inadequate forms, premature wear and tear. The originality of the work to be presented in this article is to articulate the necessary knowledge about the dangers of the products, the PPE prescription modalities by the company and the workers’ risk perception of their effects on their body and of the PPE’s effectiveness. This work as a case study emerges from a transdisciplinary approach based on ergonomics, according to the Ergotoxicology approach, and on Anthropology...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and spectral {{characterization of}} an extensive series of 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetraarylcyclopropanes are reported. The effects of substituents on the 13 Cmr and 1 Hmr chemical shifts are examined in detail. In {{a series of}} symmetrically substituted derivatives, the, 13 <b>Cmr</b> <b>chemical</b> shifts correlate with ??R 0. This correlation is only observed {{in cases where the}} C?? bond has no net polarity. Details of the thermal isomerization of those derivatives for which the possibility of cis and trans configurations exists are also reported. Trends in the Arrhenius parameters provide evidence for the biradical character of the transition state. Other data supporting the biradical character of the transition state are discussed.

40|$|This is the 60 th Report of {{a series}} of {{workshops}} organised by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The main goal of ECVAM, as defined in 1993 by its Scientific Advisory Committee, is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods that have scientific relevance and that reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals. One of the first measures taken by ECVAM was the implementation of procedures that would enable it to become better informed about the state-of-the-art of non-animal test development and validation, and the potential for the possible incorporation of alternative tests into regulatory procedures. The decision was taken that this would be best achieved by the organisation of ECVAM Workshops each addressing a specific topic, and at which selected groups of independent international experts would review the status of various types of in vitro tests and their potential application, and make recommendations about the best way forward. A workshop on Chemical Respiratory Allergy, chaired by Ian Kimber, was held at ECVAM from 11 – 13 October 2006. 	Chemical respiratory allergy, typically associated with rhinitis and/or asthma, is considered to be an adverse health effect of high concern. For example, under the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) system, respiratory sensitisers are included among substances of higher risk, together with <b>CMRs</b> (<b>chemicals</b> that are Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or toxic for Reproduction), and are regulated under Annex 1 of Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, which contains a list of dangerous substances, including respiratory sensitisers. Although some animal methods (such as measurements of IgE antibody responses in mice, or specific pulmonary reactions in guinea-pigs) are mentioned in this Directive, these methods have not been validated, nor are they widely accepted by the scientific community. 	At present, chemical respiratory sensitisation hazard is assigned to chemicals on the basis of epidemiological evidence or, in the case of diisocyanates, as a default classification. Therefore, there is clearly a need to develop new and improved methods for hazard identification and characterisation, and it was the objective of this workshop to explore what opportunities might now be available.

40|$|Purpose : To explore varied {{exposure}} to carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reprotoxic <b>chemicals</b> (<b>CMR)</b> for French employees. Methods: Our study assessed {{data from the}} French national cross-sectional survey of occupational risks (SUMER) that was conducted in 2010 in a national representative sample of employees. We selected 28 CMR agents that were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer or European Union as being known or presumed to have CMR potential in humans. The association of individual and job characteristics with exposure prevalence, duration, and intensity of the CMR agents during a 1 -week period was examined using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: Overall, 10. 4 % of employees in 2010 were exposed {{to one or more}} CMR agents at their workplace, and 3. 4 % were subjected to multiple CMR exposures. Blue-collar workers, night-shift workers and workers with short-term employment contracts experienced higher exposure prevalence (p < 0. 01) and intensity (p < 0. 05). Blue-collar workers and shift workers experienced also longer exposure duration (p < 0. 001). Conversely, managers, workers of large companies, and women were less exposed to CMR agents (p < 0. 001). The presence of a Committee for Health, Safety, and Working Conditions, and intervention by Occupational Health and Safety officers were significantly associated with reduced exposure intensities (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05). Establishment of European CMR regulations and the existence of an applicable substitution principle reduced the exposure duration (p < 0. 001) and intensity (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Our results point out disparities in CMR exposure and identify high-priority targets for prevention measures to help reducing social health discrepancies...|$|R
