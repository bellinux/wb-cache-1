Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward <b>control</b> <b>model</b> B6-76 which was expected to become the next volume model.|$|E

The approach expresses access <b>control</b> <b>models</b> in the specification language of a model checker and expresses generic access control properties in the property language.

For example, when a bilingual switches from one language to another in translation, a change in the language schema corresponding to much take place.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{idea for}} {{realising}} K9 {{was to use}} a small actor inside a robotic Dobermann costume, but that was rejected in favour of a radio-controlled prop, designed by Tony Harding and made by the BBC Visual Effects Department. The Radio <b>Control</b> <b>Model</b> Centre in Harlington Middx owned by Derek Wales was commissioned to build the electronics into the first original basic shell and consequently the centre operated the dog on set for the BBC. The robot suffered from numerous technical problems during its time in the series, often malfunctioning because the radio controls interfered with the cameras and vice versa. On location, K9 also proved unable to traverse uneven terrain, and shots had to be conceived with this in mind. Workarounds included using a concealed piece of twine to pull the character along (this string can be clearly seen in a shot of K9 on Brighton Beach), or laying wooden planks on which it could roll.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC <b>control</b> <b>model</b> must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E
