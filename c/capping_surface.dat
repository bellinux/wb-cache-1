40|$|We {{present a}} study of growth of a novel system of CdTe {{nanoparticles}} embedded in sodium/lithium-mixed phosphate glass matrix in a strong quantum confinement regime. The prepared systems are characterized by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, TEM, optical absorption, infrared and Raman Spectroscopy. We have investigated the effect of glass matrix composition and annealing time on the growing of the CdTe semiconductor nanoparticles. We found that the decrease in Na 2 O content and addition of ZnO to the glass composition is strongly affecting the nanoparticles formation and <b>capping</b> <b>surface</b> of the nanoparticls. On the other hand, we have calculated the size of nanoparticles by effective mass approximation (EMA) and empirical method based on tight binding approximation {{and found that the}} calculation based on tight binding approximation are very plausible than that one calculated by EMA...|$|E

Four of the 8 patients with T-cell lymphoma were TdT+ including patients whose lymph nodes showed an undifferentiated or poorly differentiated appearance. The TdT- T-cell lymphomas included cases with diffuse histiocytic Sezary cell, diffuse, poorly differentiated and angio-immunoblastic histology. The tissues of 31 patients with B-cell lymphoma were invariably TdT-, whether the histology was poorly differentiated, well differentiated, nodular, diffuse, histiocytic or Burkitt type, and including cases with about equal proportions of T and B cells, and those whose cells showed non-capping and <b>capping</b> <b>surface</b> immunoglobulin.

40|$|Silicon {{nanoparticles}} (SiNPs) can be synthesized by {{a variety}} of methods. In many cases these routines are non-scalable with low product yields or employ toxic reagents. One way to overcome these drawbacks is to use one-pot synthesis based on the chemical reduction of micelles. In the following study trichloroalkylsilanes of differing chain lengths were used as a surfactant, and the level of <b>capping,</b> <b>surface</b> bonding and size of the nanoparticles formed has been investigated. FTIR results show that the degree of alkyl capping for SiNPs with different capping layers was constant, although SiNPs bound with shorter chains display a much higher level of Si-O owing to the reaction of the ethanol used in the method with uncapped sites on the particle. SiNPs with longer chain length capping show a sharp Si-H peak on the FTIR, these were heated at reflux with the corresponding 1 -alkene to fully cap these particles, resulting in a reduction/disappearance of this peak with a minimal change in the intensity of the Si-O peak. Other techniques used to analyze the surface bonding and composition, XPS, 1 H-NMR, and TEM/EDX, show that alkyl-capped SiNPs have been produced using this method.

40|$|With recent {{focus on}} {{sustainable}} construction practices and the ever-increasing transportation cost and scarcity of natural resources, use of unconventional aggregate materials, such as primary crusher run and concrete demolition waste, have become viable {{for the construction}} of pavement working platforms over very weak and often wet subgrade soils. To this end, a research study was undertaken at the Illinois Center for Transportation to evaluate the adequacy and field performances of such large-sized aggregate materials and validate new material specifications. A state-of-the-art image analysis technique was utilized to characterize the size and morphological properties, e. g. shape, texture and angularity of two large-sized aggregates, referred to herein as primary crusher run and crushed concrete. For the field evaluation, full-scale test sections were constructed with these large-sized aggregate materials over a very weak engineered subgrade and subjected to accelerated pavement testing. Construction quality control was achieved through in-place density and modulus measurements on conventional aggregate <b>capping</b> <b>surface</b> layers using nuclear gauge, lightweight deflectometer and soil stiffness gauge type devices. Periodic rut measurements were carried out on the pavement surface throughout the accelerated loading process using an Accelerated Transportation Loading Assembly (ATLAS). Contributions of the underlying pavement layers to the total rut accumulation was evaluated through innovative applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR), a light weight penetrometer device, known as the French Panda, as well as a geo-endoscopy probe. Layer intermixing and material migration at the aggregate subgrade and subgrade interface was found to improve the layer stiffness and pavement performance results significantly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Semi-arid {{ecosystems}} {{with annual}} mois-ture inputs dominated by snowmelt cover {{much of the}} western United States, and {{a better understanding of}} their seasonal drivers of soil respiration is needed to predict consequences of climatic change on soil CO 2 efflux. We assessed the relative importance of tem-perature, moisture, and plant phenology on soil respiration during seasonal shifts between cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers in a Rocky Mountain meadow over 3. 5 separate growing seasons. We found a consistent, unique pattern of seasonal hysteresis in the annual relationship between soil respiration and temperature, likely representative for this ecosystem type, and driven by (1) continued increase in soil T after summer senescence of vegetation, and (2) reduced soil respiration during cold, wet periods at the beginning versus end of the growing season. The timing of meadow senescence varied between years with amount of cold season precipitation, but on average occurred 45 days before soil temperature peaked in late-summer. Autumn soil respiration was greatest when substantial autumn precipitation events occurred early. Surface CO 2 efflux was temporarily decoupled from respiratory production during winter 2006 / 2007, due to effects of winter surface snow and ice on mediating the diffusion of CO 2 from deep soil horizons to the atmosphere. Upon melt of a <b>capping</b> <b>surface</b> ice layer, release of soil-stored CO 2 was determined to be 65 g C, or * 10 % of the total growing season soil respiration for that year. The shift between soil respiration sources arising from mois-ture-limited spring plant growth and autumn decom-position indicates that annual mineralization of soil carbon will be less dependent on projected changes in temperature than on future variations in amount and timing of precipitation for this site and similar semi-arid ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|NSF [DMR- 1215034]; DOE {{subcontract}} {{from the}} University of Wisconsin at Madion [DE-FG 02 - 05 ER 15731]; Georgia Institute of Technology; China Scholarship Council (CSC) This article describes a systematic {{study of the}} spatially confined growth of Rh atoms on Pd nanocrystal seeds, {{with a focus on}} the blocking effect of a surface capping agent and the surface diffusion of adatoms. We initially used Pd cuboctahedrons as the seeds to illustrate the concept and to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach. Because the Pd{ 100 } facets were selectively capped by a layer of chemisorbed Br- or I- ions, we were able to confine the nucleation and deposition of Rh atoms solely on the { 111 } facets of a Pd seed. When the synthesis was conducted at a relatively low temperature, the deposition of Rh atoms followed an island growth mode because of the high Rh-Rh interatomic binding energy. We also facilitated the surface diffusion of deposited Rh atoms by increasing the reaction temperature and decreasing the injection rate for the Rh precursor. Under these conditions, the deposition of Rh on the Pd{ 111 } facets was switched to a layered growth mode. We further successfully extended this approach to a variety of other types of Pd polyhedral seeds that contained Pd{ 111 } and Pd{ 100 } facets in different proportions on the surface. As expected, a series of Pd-Rh bimetallic nanocrystals with distinctive elemental distributions were obtained. We could remove the Pd cores through selective chemical etching to generate Rh hollow nanoframes with different types and degrees of porosity. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of facet <b>capping,</b> <b>surface</b> diffusion, and reaction kinetics in controlling the morphologies of bimetallic nanocrystals during a seed-mediated process. It also provides a new direction for the rational design and synthesis of nanocrystals with spatially controlled distributions of elements for a variety of applications...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{conventional}} myosin in nonmuscle cells, we determined the cytoskeletal organization and physiological responses of a Dictyostelium myosin-defective mutant. Dictyostelium hmm cells were created by insertional mutagenesis of the myosin heavy chain gene (De Lozanne, A., and J. A. Spudich. 1987. Science (Wash. DC). 236 : 1086 - 1091). Western blot analysis using different mAbs confirms that hmm cells express a truncated myosin fragment of 140 kD (HMM- 140 protein) instead of the normal 243 -kD myosin heavy chain (MHC). Spontaneous revertants appear at a frequency less than 4 x 10 (- 5), which synthesize normal myosin and are capable of forming thick filaments. In hmm cells, the HMM- 140 protein is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, indicating that it cannot assemble into thick filaments. The actin distribution in these mutant cells appears {{similar to that of}} wild-type cells. However, there is a significant abnormality in the organization of cytoplasmic microtubules, which penetrate into lamellipodial regions. The microtubule networks consist of approximately 13 microtubules on average and their pattern is abnormal. Although hmm cells can form mitotic spindles, mitosis is not coordinated with normal furrow formation. The hmm cells are clearly defective in the contractile events that lead to normal cytokinesis. The retraction of different regions of the cell can result in the occasional pinching off of part of the cell. This process is not coupled with formation of mitotic spindles. There is no specific accumulation of HMM- 140 in such constrictions, whereas 73 % of such cells show actin concentrated in these regions. The mutant hmm cells are also deficient in capping of Con-A-bound surface receptors, but instead internalize this complex into the cytoplasm. The hmm cells display active phagocytosis of bacteria. Whereas actin is concentrated in the phagocytic cups, HMM- 140 protein is not localized in these regions. cAMP, a chemoattractant that induces drastic rounding up and formation of surface blebs in wild type cells, does not induce rounding up in the hmm cells. A Triton- permeabilized cell model of the wild-type amebae contracts on reactivation with Mg-ATP, whereas a model of the hmm cell shows no detectable contraction. Our data demonstrate that the conventional myosin participates in the significant cortical motile activities of Dictyostelium cells, which include rounding up, constriction of cleavage furrows, <b>capping</b> <b>surface</b> receptors, and establishing cell polarity...|$|E
