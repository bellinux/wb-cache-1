50|$|In 1996, Goodenow Grove was {{dedicated}} as a State Nature Preserve for its diverse ecosystems, including forests, floodplain, seeps, savanna, prairies, meadows, and marshes. The nature preserve provides {{protection for the}} habitat of state-threatened or endangered species, including the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, the spotted <b>coral</b> <b>root</b> orchid, and more.|$|E
50|$|The hilly site {{is almost}} wholly wooded, {{and one of}} the floristically richest ancient woods in the London area. Its {{highlight}} is the abundance of flowers in spring, with a carpet of bluebells together with yellow archangel, lesser celandine, wood anemone and the rare <b>coral</b> <b>root</b> bittercress (cardamina bulbifera).|$|E

5000|$|... "Who's Gonna Find Me" [...] is {{the first}} single from the fourth {{full-length}} album by British band The <b>Coral,</b> <b>Roots</b> & Echoes, and was released on 30 July 2007. The single peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|R
50|$|Lobophyllia corymbosa, the lobed cactus <b>coral</b> or brain <b>root</b> <b>coral,</b> is {{a species}} of large polyp stony coral in the family Lobophylliidae. It occurs on reefs in shallow waters in the Red Sea, {{off the coast of}} East Africa, and {{in other parts of the}} {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Lobophyllia hemprichii, {{commonly}} called lobed brain coral, lobed cactus <b>coral</b> or largebrain <b>root</b> <b>coral,</b> is {{a species of}} large polyp stony coral in the family Lobophylliidae. It {{is found in the}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. In its specific name Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg honoured his late partner the Prussian naturalist Wilhelm Hemprich; they {{were among the first to}} study the marine life of the Red Sea.|$|R
50|$|Other {{diseases}} include Bacterial Wetwood, various viral and fungal diseases, cankers including <b>Coral</b> Spot, and <b>root</b> diseases {{caused by}} cinnamon fungus or honey fungus.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Bacillus velezensis was {{prepared}} as a suspension concentrate (SC) and sprayed {{on to the}} roots of 1 -month-old Lactuca sativa, grown in a hydroponic system. In the first experiment using Lactuca sativa (var. Red <b>Coral)</b> with <b>root</b> rot symptoms, a 1 % blank with no cells, a 1 % SC (1013 CFU/ml) and 1 % fresh bacterial cells (FC) (1014 CFU/ml) reduced the percentage of root tips colonized by the pathogen and increased the fresh shoot weight compared to plants that were not sprayed. In the second experiment with L. sativa (var. Green Oak) using healthy-looking roots, a 1 % blank, 10 % SC (1013 CFU/ml) and 1 % FC of the bacterium (1014 CFU/ml) reduced the percentage of root tips colonized by Pythium sp. The SC and FC of the bacterium increased the fresh shoot weight, while the blank, the SC and the FC of the bacterium increased the dried weight of the shoot...|$|R
5000|$|Saturday was headlined by Coldplay {{and also}} {{featured}} Sugababes, Badly Drawn Boy, Supergrass, Underworld, The Streets, The <b>Coral,</b> The <b>Roots,</b> Death in Vegas, The Complete Stone Roses, Röyksopp, Gemma Hayes, Mogwai, The Thrills, Appleton, Mull Historical Society, Ed Harcourt, The Rapture and many more. Sunday was headlined by David Gray and Manic Street Preachers and also featured The Cardigans, The Polyphonic Spree, Super Furry Animals, Beth Orton, The Music, The Flaming Lips, Tricky, The Datsuns, Keith Flint, Calexico, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, Kings of Leon and Har Mar Superstar. [...] Others to feature included Doves, The Thrills, Turin Brakes, Nightmares on Wax and Damien Rice. [...] The Flaming Lips were stepped up the {{bill on the}} Sunday to replace The White Stripes (cancelled due to frontman Jack White suffering a broken hand) and by all accounts delivered a well-received set which included a version of The White Stripes's hit [...] "Seven Nation Army".|$|R
60|$|The ramble over--a {{pleasant}} one it was--it {{resulted in}} a determination on my part to quit Odo. Yet not to go very far; only ten or twelve yards, to a little green tuft of an islet; one of many, which here and there, all round the island, nestled like birds' nests in the branching boughs of the <b>coral</b> grove, whose <b>roots</b> laid hold of {{the foundations of the}} deep. Between these islets and the shore, extended shelving ledges, with shallows above, just sufficient to float a canoe. One of these islets was wooded and wined; an arbor in the sea. And here, Media permitting, I decided to dwell.|$|R
50|$|About 2,150 {{species of}} {{tunicate}} {{exist in the}} world's oceans, living mostly in shallow water. The most numerous group is the ascidians; fewer than 100 species of these are found at depths greater than 200 m. Some are solitary animals leading a sessile existence attached to the seabed, but others are colonial and a few are pelagic. Some are supported by a stalk, but most are attached directly to a substrate, which may be a rock, shell, <b>coral,</b> seaweed, mangrove <b>root,</b> dock, piling, or ship's hull. They are found {{in a range of}} solid or translucent colours and may resemble seeds, grapes, peaches, barrels, or bottles. One of the largest is a stalked sea tulip, Pyura pachydermatina, which can grow to be over 1 m tall.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the presence of}} the bivalve Modiolarca lateralis (Say, 1822) in six tropical ascidians Ascidia curvata, A. sydneiensis, A. panamensis, A. interrupta, Herdmania pallida and Polycarpa spongiabilis collected at depths of 1 - 3 m on <b>coral</b> reefs, mangrove <b>roots</b> and dock supports in Almirante Bay, Bocas del Toro, Panama (9 ° 18 'N, 82 ° 13 'W) during June-July 2011. Bivalve prevalence varied between 9 - 30 % across species, but was mainly associated with A. panamensis, P. spongiabilis and A. interrupta. Prevalence seems to be influenced by tunic thickness rather than by the ascidian size. Bivalves varied in size (0. 6 - 11 mm shell length), with the smallest individual found in A. sydneiensis. There were only one or two bivalves per ascidians, although a maximum of 18 was found in one A. panamensis. M. lateralis seems to behave similarly to its temperate counterparts: it has a variety of hosts, occurs mainly in the anterior region of the ascidians, and has a variable abundance per host...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} aggradation rates supplemented for {{the first}} time by carbonate accumulation rates from Mediterranean cold-water coral sites considering three different regional and geomorphological settings: (i) a cold-water coral ridge (eastern Melilla coral province, Alboran Sea), (ii) a cold-water coral rubble talus deposit {{at the base of a}} submarine cliff (Urania Bank, Strait of Sicily) and (iii) a cold-water <b>coral</b> deposit <b>rooted</b> on a predefined topographic high overgrown by cold-water corals (Santa Maria di Leuca coral province, Ionian Sea). The mean aggradation rates of the respective cold-water coral deposits vary between 10 and 530 cm kyr- 1 and the mean carbonate accumulation rates range between 8 and 396 g cm- 2 kyr- 1 with a maximum of 503 g cm- 2 kyr- 1 reached in the eastern Melilla coral province. Compared to other deep-water depositional environments the Mediterranean cold-water coral sites reveal significantly higher carbonate accumulation rates that were even in the range of the highest productive shallow-water Mediterranean carbonate factories (e. g. Cladocora caespitosa coral reefs). Focusing exclusively on cold-water coral occurrences, the carbonate accumulation rates of the Mediterranean cold-water coral sites are in the lower range of those obtained for the prolific Norwegian coral occurrences, but exhibit much higher rates than the cold-water coral mounds off Ireland. This study clearly indicates that cold-water corals have the potential to act as important carbonate factories and regional carbonate sinks within the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the data highlight the potential of cold-water corals to store carbonate with rates in the range of tropical shallow-water reefs. In order to evaluate the contribution of the cold-water coral carbonate factory to the regional or global carbonate/carbon cycle, an improved understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in aggradation and carbonate accumulation rates and areal estimates of the respective regions is needed...|$|R
