Xerox has created the productive digital solution which is able to offer every facility to the remote users so as to have easy access to the digital database through common Web Browser, searching and retrieving of the documents, recalling user's transmission of the content in viewing the content in a workstation and printing submission of the recalled digital pages and its printing in a local printer or order for printing in a <b>central</b> <b>printing</b> <b>system</b> of the University. The solution offers great flexibility and easiness in creating and handling the digital database, disposing a powerful platform for the capturing of articles, magazines, studies, thesis, books, notes university material, collections, etc, the digital storage of the captured documents, and also the incorporation in the digital database, handing assortment, recalling and elaboration of a material of the digital databases. Moreover, the ability of immediate renewal of content of documents is provided, as well as the dispatch for printing and mostly the ability to compound different documents in paper or digital form for the creation of educational manuscript as far as the content is concerned, the so called coursepacks. As a result it can be observed that Xerox through the digital technology and know-how it can provide, is able to become a valuable partner of libraries in the effort to play a central role as a source of collection, storage and diffusion of knowledge. For those interested in further information on the Xerox solution Internet addresses are referred where they could visit digital databases which have been created through the use of Xerox technology.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how {{managers and}} leaders build {{consensus in the}} workplace through creating rhetorical myths. A three-year long ethnographic study of Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s Printing Services as it went through a change to its <b>central</b> <b>print</b> management <b>system</b> reveals a concentrated effort by leadership to create and maintain a rhetorical myth. This dissertation defines the three main elements of rhetorical myth: chronographia (or an interpretation of history), epideictic prediction (defining an action for the present by assigning praise and blame {{to the past and}} the future), and communal markers (using concepts of Burkean identification and rhetorically-defined boundary objects to create a unified community). It also documents the three stages of myth-building: Creation, Acceptance, and Re-creation. Through examples and discussion from meeting observations and interviews, this study shows how the rhetorical myth at Printing Services was created and accepted over several months and then re-created in response to missed deadlines and frustrated expectations. The dissertation concludes with a forecast of future directions to expand the study of rhetorical myth in workplace settings...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{feasibility}} of using ink-jet printing for the decoration of porcelain tiles has been explored, and significant advances have been made regarding the technologies underlying <b>printing</b> <b>system</b> and materials. An ink-jet <b>printing</b> <b>system</b> for porcelain tiles has many advantages compared with a conventional <b>printing</b> <b>system,</b> including the following: (1) it is a digital process; (2) it uses non-contact printing; (3) it allows random image generation; (4) it is a highly efficient process (reduced production cost); (5) it offers massive and continuous production; and (6) it uses inorganic pigment colorants.

Empirical studies were conducted in a survey with 256 participants. The number of significant determinants that affect an individual’s decision to adopt 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>systems</b> has been identified by applying a model that integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). A number of moderation effects of demographic variables (e. g. gender, design background) on the association between motivational variables and participants’ adoption have also been analysed with factor analysis, structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression. Our results {{shed some light on}} the characteristics of early adopters of home 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>systems</b> in China.
