30|$|We {{found that}} the {{characteristics}} of the hypocenter distribution differ between the eastern and western parts of the Tanzawa region. In the eastern part, the earthquakes appear to be distributed within a horizontal zone. (We defined this area as Region A, as indicated by the broken-line rectangles in Fig. 3). On the other hand, in the western part, the earthquakes are distributed in a volume of approximately 10 km × 10 km× 10 km. (We defined this block as Region B.) The feature of the scattered distribution appears clearly in depth sections <b>C–D</b> <b>and</b> <b>E–F</b> (Fig. 3). Note that the focal mechanisms of major earthquakes in the Tanzawa region are thrust or right-lateral reverse faulting type mechanisms (Fig. 2). The P -axes range from the NW-SE to NNW-SSE directions. One of the nodal planes of these focal mechanisms in Region A appears to be consistent with the horizontal alignment of the hypocenter distribution (Fig. 3).|$|E
40|$|Members of the lipocalin {{superfamily}} share {{a common}} structural fold, but differ from each other {{with respect to the}} molecules with which they interact. They all contain eight beta-strands (A-H) that fold to form a well-defined beta-barrel, which harbours a binding pocket for hydrophobic ligands. These strands are connected by loops that vary in size and structure and make up the closed and open ends of the pocket. In addition to binding ligands, some members of the family interact with other macromolecules, the specificity of which is thought {{to be associated with the}} variable loop regions. Here, we have investigated whether the macromolecular-recognition properties can be transferred from one member of the family to another. For this, we chose the prototypical lipocalin, the plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and its close structural homologue the epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein (ERABP). RBP exhibits three molecular-recognition properties: it binds to retinol, to transthyretin (TTR) and to a cell-surface receptor. ERABP binds retinoic acid, but whether it interacts with other macromolecules is not known. Here, we show that ERABP does not bind to TTR and the RBP receptor, but when the loops of RBP near the open end of the pocket (L- 1, L- 2 and L- 3, connecting beta-strands A-B, <b>C-D</b> <b>and</b> <b>E-F,</b> respectively) were substituted into the corresponding regions of ERABP, the resulting chimaera acquired the ability to bind TTR and the receptor. L- 2 and L- 3 were found to be the major determinants of the receptor- and TTR-binding specificities respectively. Thus we demonstrate that lipocalins serve as excellent scaffolds for engineering novel biological functions...|$|E
40|$|Retinol-binding protein (RBP) {{transports}} vitamin A in the plasma. It {{consists of}} eight anti-parallel beta-strands (A to H) that fold {{to form an}} orthogonal barrel. The loops connecting the strands A and B, C and D, and E and F form {{the entrance to the}} binding site in the barrel. The retinol molecule is found deep inside this barrel. Apart from its specific interaction with retinol, RBP is involved in two other molecular-recognition properties, that is it binds to transthyretin (TTR), another serum protein, and to a cell-surface receptor. Using site-directed mutagenesis, specific changes were made to the loop regions of human RBP and the resultant mutant proteins were tested for their ability to bind to retinol, to TTR and to the RBP receptor. While all the variants retained their ability to bind retinol, that in which residues 92 to 98 of the loop E-F were deleted completely lost its ability to interact with TTR, but retained some binding activity for the receptor. In contrast, the double mutant in which leucine residues at positions 63 and 64 of the loop C-D were changed to arginine and serine respectively partially retained its TTR-binding ability, but completely lost its affinity for the RBP receptor. Mutation of Leu- 35 of loop A-B to valine revealed no apparent effect on any of the binding activities of RBP. However, substitution of leucine for proline at position 35 markedly reduced the affinity of the protein for TTR, but showed no apparent change in its receptor-binding activity. These results demonstrate that RBP interacts with both TTR and the receptor via loops <b>C-D</b> <b>and</b> <b>E-F.</b> The binding sites, however, are overlapping rather than identical. RBP also appears to make an additional contact with TTR via its loop A-B. A further implication of these results is that RBP, when bound to TTR, cannot bind simultaneously to the receptor. This observation is consistent with our previously proposed mechanism for delivery of retinol to target tissues [Sivaprasadarao and Findlay (1988) Biochem. J. 255, 571 - 579], according to which retinol delivery involves specific binding of RBP to the cell-surface receptor, an interaction that triggers release of retinol from RBP to the bound cell rather than internalization of retinol-RBP complex...|$|E

The macromodel estimates the short and medium-term economic implications for internal policies and of changes in the international context. This new version of the Romanian macromodel incorporates the experience accumulated through the utilisation of its previous forms - either experimental (tested during 1991 - 1995) or operational (developed during 1996 - 2003).

These can be easily translated into classical three-sector classification: primary (a-b), secondary (<b>c-d),</b> <b>and</b> tertiary (<b>e-f).</b> Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transitional processes in Romania, the behavioural functions were accommodated - as much as possible - to the standard relationships. Unlike the versions that used the statistical series beginning with 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information concerning the period 1989 - 2004. Therefore, we have considered more adequate to name this variant the macromodel of the Romanian market (not transition, as before) economy. Since the input-output tables are defined yearly, the model contains only annual indicators. They are expressed in denominated local currency (RON). When there were several statistical sources for the same indicator, we preferred the data extracted or derived from national accounts. The statistical series are relatively short and often fractured (because of the transformation processes of transition). It is known that ADF test of stationarity does not offer sure results in the case of limited number of observations. Nevertheless, the series satisfying it were used, as a rule. The Granger causality test was computed for one, two, and three lags. The simplest methods of estimation were also preferred. The structural breaks in the evolution of some indicators were attenuated by the inclusion of dummies. Obviously, all these circumstances weaken the stability of the econometric coefficients that must be continuously updated. The main relationships are grouped in seven sections: input-output block; labour market, production function; domestic absorption, foreign trade, prices and exchange rate, and interest rate. * PHARE Programme RO 2003 / 005 - 551. 02. 03 "Strengthening the capacity for analysis, macroeconomic forecast and elaboration of economic policies within the National Commission of Prognosis, the Ministry of Economy and Trade and the Prime Minister's Cabinet” – Romanian Center for Economic Policies. ***** Source: Emilian DOBRESCU: “Macromodels of the Romanian Market Economy”, Editura Economica, Bucharest 2006 model, input-output analysis, econometric relationships, simulations...|$|R

Relative to source sugars in fermentation, C- 3 -derived ethanol had less <b>C-</b> 13 <b>and</b> <b>C-</b> 3 -derived CO 2 had more C- 13 than C- 4 -derived ethanol and CO 2. Both results agreed with intramolecular isotopic signatures in <b>C-</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>C-</b> 4 glucose. Isotopic shifts between plant compounds (e. g. lignin and cellulose) or tissues (e. g. leaves and roots) also differed in <b>C-</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>C-</b> 4 plants. Woody C- 3 plants allocated more carbon to C- 13 -depleted compounds such as lignin or lipids than herbaceous C- 3 or C- 4 plants. This allocation influenced C- 13 patterns among compounds and tissues. Photorespiration and isotopic fractionation at metabolic branch points, coupled to different allocation patterns during metabolism for C- 3 vs C- 4 plants, probably influence position-specific and compound-specific isotopic differences. Differing C- 13 content of mobile and immobile compounds (e. g. sugars vs lignin) may then create isotopic differences among plant pools and along transport pathways.
