40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} information scraps – personal information whose content has been scribbled on Post-it notes, scrawled on {{the corners of}} sheets of paper, stuck in our pockets, sent in e-mail messages to ourselves, and stashed into miscellaneous digital text files. Information scraps encode information ranging from ideas and sketches to notes, reminders, shipment tracking numbers, driving directions, and even poetry. I proceed by performing an in-depth ethnographic investigation {{of the nature and}} use of information scraps, and by designing and building two research systems designed for information scrap management. The first system, Jourknow, lowers the capture barrier for unstructured notes and structured information such as <b>calendar</b> <b>items</b> and to-dos, captures contextual information surrounding note creation such as location, documents viewed, and people corresponded with, and manages uncommon user-generated personal information such as restaurant reviews or this week’s shopping list.

An activity database that captures the relationships among projects, resources, and time can drive a variety of tools that save time and increase productivity. To maximize net time savings, we would prefer to build such a database automatically, or with as little user effort as possible. In this paper, we present several sets of features and algorithms for predicting the project associated with each action a user performs on the desktop. Key to our methods is salience, the notion that more recent activity is more informative. By developing novel features that represent salience, {{we were able to}} learn models that outperform both a simple benchmark and an expert system tuned specifically for this task on real-world data from five users...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{application}} platforms like {{cell phones}} are ubiquitous today. Even on limited devices, users expect well-performing applications that also respect {{the privacy of}} the user’s stored data, such as messages, addresses and <b>calendar</b> <b>items.</b> Existing techniques, however, do not provide an adequate solution: Dynamic algorithms incur a significant space and time overhead. Static approaches help a developer in creating secure programs, but previous work requires a whole-program verification. This paper proposes a novel intermediate representation that is designed to be easily analyzed and verified by clients as well as support incremental verification. The IR can be verified with a single-pass, linear time algorithm. The resulting reduction of memory requirements is particularly important for limited mobile devices. Metadata, including security properties, can be reliably transmitted through annotatable type systems, as demonstrated by the adoption of a practical securityenhanced programming language as an input for our intermediate representation. A simplified imperative language with incremental loading is formally proved safe as a foundation for the practical implementation. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "lifestream" [...] {{was coined}} by Eric Freeman and David Gelernter at Yale University {{in the mid-1990s}} to {{describe}} [...] "...a time-ordered stream of documents that functions as a diary of your electronic life; every document you create and every document other people send you is stored in your lifestream. The tail of your stream contains documents from the past (starting with your electronic birth certificate). Moving away from the tail and toward the present, your stream contains more recent documents—papers in progress or new electronic mail; other documents (pictures, correspondence, bills, movies, voice mail, software) are stored in between. Moving beyond the present and into the future, the stream contains documents you will need: reminders, <b>calendar</b> <b>items,</b> to-do lists. The point of lifestreams isn't to shift from one software structure to another but to shift the whole premise of computerized information: to stop building glorified file cabinets and start building (simplified, abstract) artificial minds; and to store our electronic lives inside" ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{indoor positioning}} results {{based on the}} 802. 11 WiFi system (WLAN). It uses the existing infrastructure of buildings and the available technologies in personal mobile devices to calculate an indoor position consisting of floor and building section. A list of known WLAN access points and their location is the only requirement of this simple positioning algorithm. This approach is cheap, does not require calibration work and gives a position resolution {{in the form of}} building section and floor. These features make this work novel compared to known approaches. The results of the position calculations reveal an accuracy of 88 % even in tricky building layouts. Real life position calculations during a person’s work day showed as well good results. The signal strength measurements give reasons to conduct further research to achieve a sub building section resolution. Integrating other mobile device data, like <b>calendar</b> <b>items</b> Bluetooth scan results and data from different kinds of sensors, promises to further enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning and is the subject of further research in our laboratory...|$|R
40|$|The project {{consisted}} of four subprojects which did improve the network {{infrastructure of the}} Belgium Campus. In order to increase flexibility in planning on the Belgium Campus, a new exchange server was installed. Users can now share contacts, <b>calendar</b> <b>items</b> and mailboxes. This makes the organization more transparent and {{a lot easier to}} control. To increase {{the number of students who}} will be able to get a proper education, the Belgium Campus has built a new classroom with 24 PCs. My second project was the configuration of these PCs and to fit the classroom with wiring (electrical and Ethernet). The third project required me to set up a few servers for AnaXis. These servers will help to secure and separate the AnaXis computers from the campus network. The three servers are performing a variety of tasks; Domain Controller, Windows Update Server, ISA, SQL Server and Oracle Server. As a part of his study program a student of the Belgium Campus is doing his work placement at the Flemish Government. My last project was to help that student to set up an exchange server. This server performs the same tasks as the server on the Belgium Campus. Users are able to share contacts, calendars and mailboxes. Whilst not working on a specific project I did a few minor jobs on the campus; repair broken PCs, install a wireless router...|$|R

The tension between short-term and long-term tasks in Dana’s work is well described in [6]. She deliberately distinguishes between tasks to do at the university and tasks she can better complete at home. Figure 5 (right) illustrates that her use of notes supports this separation and also a separation of work-related and other activities at home. In Dana’s case, most appointments are made by email or face-to-face, or they are specified by a schedule. Dana’s pocket calendar almost exclusively contains work-related items and she ‘misuses’ the kitchen wall calendar for her own dental appointments although this is not interesting for the family. On February 27, 2013, Dana reminds her group head of a meeting and they agree on March 7. She makes a note in her paper calendar and later gets an email invitation from the GCS which she confirms again. She knows now that the appointment is also in Alec’s calendar.|$|R
