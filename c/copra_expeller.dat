40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>copra</b> <b>expeller</b> pellet (CEP) supplementation on {{nutrient}} flow, {{the efficiency of}} microbial protein synthesis and degradability of CEP-nitrogen (N) in the rumen of sheep fed chopped pangola hay, were determined. Six sheep fitted with rumen and abomasal cannulae were given three diets; A (pangola hay ad libitum), B (A + CEP at 0. 5 % BW) and C (A + CEP at 1. 0 % BW) in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. CEP supplementation did not affect intake of pangola hay when given at 0. 5 % BW, but was reduced (P × 0. 05) when CEP supplementation was increased to 1. 0 % BW. Apparent DMD of the total diet was increased (P < 0. 05) with CEP supplementation. Intake and digestibility of OM, DOM intake (DOMI), OM apparently digested in the rumen (ADOMR), OM truly digested in the rumen (TDOMR) and OM flow to the small intestines of sheep were not significantly affected by CEP supplementation. However, CEP supplementation increased (P < 0. 01) total N intake, digestibility and flows of total non-ammonia N (NAN), microbial NAN and feed NAN to the small intestines of sheep. Degradabilities of CEP-N in the rumen of sheep fed CEP at 0. 5 % BW and 1. 0 % BW were 22 % and 19 %, respectively. Efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (g microbial NAN/kg ADOMR and TDOMR) in the rumen of sheep was increased (P < 0. 01) with each increase in level of CEP supplementation. Mean values were 20. 3, 29. 9 and 37. 1 g/kg ADOMR, 15. 7, 21. 3 and 26. 0 g/kg TDOMR for diets A, B and C, respectively. It was concluded that CEP could be a suitable supplement for ruminants consuming tropical pastures...|$|E
30|$|Feed {{ingredients}} {{used for}} screening study were three whole grain sources (barley, corn and wheat) and six protein supplements (canola meal, <b>copra</b> <b>expellers,</b> cottonseed meal, {{distillers dried grains}} with solubles, palm kernel expellers and soybean meal). Both IVID and IVTTD of DM for the prepared samples were determined.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of phosphorus (P) in <b>copra</b> <b>expellers</b> (CE), palm kernel expellers (PKE), and cassava root (CR). Eight barrows (initial BW of 40. 0 kg, SD = 4. 5) were individually housed in metabolism crates. A replicated 4 × 3 incomplete Latin square design was employed involving 4 dietary treatments, 3 periods, and 8 animals. Three experimental diets contained 40 % CE, PKE or CR as {{the only source of}} P. A P-free diet mainly based on corn starch, sucrose, and gelatin was also prepared to estimate the basal endogenous loss of P. The marker-to-marker method was used for fecal collection. Values for the ATTD of P in the CE and PKE were greater than in the CR (46. 0 and 39. 7 vs − 14. 0 %; p< 0. 05). However, the STTD of P did not differ greatly among the test ingredients (56. 5, 49. 0, and 43. 2 % in the CE, PKE, and CR, respectively). In conclusion, the ATTD of P values in CE and PKE were greater than that in CR, but the STTD of P did not differ greatly among CE, PKE, and CR...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of β-mannanase supplementation on digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) contents of <b>copra</b> <b>expellers</b> (CE) and palm kernel expellers (PKE) fed to pigs. Six barrows with an initial body weight of 38. 0 kg (standard deviation = 1. 5) were randomly allotted to a 6 × 6 Latin square design with 6 dietary treatments and 6 periods. Six experimental diets were prepared in a 3 × 2 factorial treatment arrangement with 3 diets of a corn-soybean meal-based diet, a CE 30 % diet, and a PKE 30 % diet and with 2 concentrations of supplemental β-mannanase at 0 or 2, 400 U/kg. All diets had the same proportion of corn:soybean meal ratio at 2. 88 : 1. The marker-to-marker procedure was used for fecal and urine collection with 4 -d adaptation and 5 -d collection periods. No interactive effects were observed between diet and β-mannanase on energy digestibility and DE and ME contents of experimental diets. However, diets containing CE or PKE had less (p< 0. 05) DE and ME contents compared with the corn-soybean meal-based diet. The DE and ME contents in CE and PKE were not affected by supplemental β-mannanase. Taken together, we failed to find the effect of β-mannanase supplementation on energy utilization in CE and PKE fed to pigs...|$|R
30|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of enzyme complex on in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility for feed ingredients. The objective of experiment 1 was to screen feed ingredients that can be effective substrates for an enzyme complex, mainly consisted of β-pentosanase, β-glucanase and α-amylase, using in vitro digestibility methods. In experiment 1, the test ingredients were three grain sources (barley, corn and wheat) and six protein supplements (canola meal, <b>copra</b> <b>expellers,</b> cottonseed meal, distillers dried grains with solubles, palm kernel expellers and soybean meal). In vitro ileal and total tract digestibility (IVID and IVTTD, respectively) of DM for test ingredients were determined. In vitro digestibility methods consisted of two- or three-step procedure simulating in vivo digestion in the pig gastrointestinal tracts with or without enzyme complex. As the enzyme complex added, the IVID of DM for corn and wheat increased (p <  0.05) by 5.0 and 2.6 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn increased (p <  0.05) by 3.1 percentage unit with enzyme complex addition. As the effect of enzyme complex was the greatest in corn digestibility, corn grains were selected to determine the in vitro digestibility of the fractions (starch, germ, hull and gluten) that maximally respond to the enzyme complex in experiment 2. The IVID of DM for corn starch, germ and hull increased (p <  0.05) by 16.0, 2.8 and 1.2 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn starch and hull also increased (p <  0.05) by 8.6 and 0.9 percentage unit, respectively, with enzyme complex addition. In conclusion, the enzyme complex increases in vitro DM digestibility of corn and wheat, and the digestibility increments of corn are mainly attributed to the increased digestibility of corn starch.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary protein sources on the {{utilisation}} of copra meal {{was investigated in}} Cobb broilers. A control finisher diet based on fish meal (FM), meat and bone meal (MBM) and full-fat soybean (FFSB) and four other diets containing <b>expeller</b> <b>copra</b> meal (ECM) with combinations of these traditional protein sources (FM+ MBM, FFSB+FM, FFSB+FM+MBM and FFSB+MBM) were fed each to 4 replicates of 5 birds each in a completely randomized design. Body weight gain was highest (P< 0. 05) in birds fed diets containing ECM with FM+MBM. There were no significant dietary effects on feed intake and feed conversion ratio. Dressing percentage was depressed (P< 0. 05) in the diet based on ECM with FFSB+FM+MBM. The relative weight of breast muscle reduced (P< 0. 05) in group offered ECM along with FFSB+FM and FFSB+FM+MBM. Furthermore, there were no dietary effects on the weight of thighs and drumsticks. Nevertheless, birds fed ECM with FM+MBM recorded the lowest (P< 0. 05) weights of digesta in the crop and small intestine. There were no significant dietary effects on weight of digesta in the gizzard and caeca. The highest (P< 0. 05) digesta weight in the proventriculus was observed in the birds fed on FFSB+FM+MBM. Total tract apparent digestibility of DM and CP improved (P< 0. 05) on FM+MBM. Total tract nitrogen retention was lower (P< 0. 05) with FFSB+FM and FFSB+MBM as compared to control. However, fat digestibility was depressed (P< 0. 05) in the control diet. It could be concluded that dietary protein sources exerted significant influence on the utilisation of copra meal by broilers and the combination of ECM with animal protein sources yielded the best results in terms of performance of Cobb broilers. ...|$|R
