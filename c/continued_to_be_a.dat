5|$|Ancient Slavs {{developed}} {{a method of}} obtaining red dye from the larvae of the Polish cochineal. Despite the labor-intensive process of harvesting the cochineal and a relatively modest yield, the dye <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> highly sought-after commodity and a popular alternative to kermes throughout the Middle Ages until it was superseded by Mexican cochineal in the 16th century.|$|E

She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major style {{into the}} nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the {{designer}} {{of many of}} Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, {{he turned away from}} the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the album's release in late August 1994, Edwards was hospitalised at the private Priory Hospital in Roehampton. He rejoined the band to tour during the autumn of 1994. Other band members felt that his {{drinking}} was under control at this point, but his eating <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem and he continued to self-harm. On 1 February 1995, he disappeared and is presumed to have committed suicide. His car was found close to the Severn Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{involvement}} in union business he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> busy working actor. He appeared in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) as a nobleman friend of the title character. His last television work was an episode of the ITV series The Professionals in 1978, the year of his death. The animated film version of The Lord of the Rings, in which he voiced the character of Elrond, was released the same year, but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death. This was as the judge in The First Great Train Robbery.|$|E
5|$|During India's {{independence}} struggle, Gandhi {{launched the}} Dandi March along India's west coast to {{protest against the}} sales tax levied on salt extraction. His close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become independent India's first Governor-General, carried out a salt march in parallel, {{on the east coast}} starting from Trichonopoly (modern day Tiruchirappalli) in Vedaranyam. His group, having people like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coast of the town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British. After India's independence, Vedaranyam <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of Thanjavur district until 1991, and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, Paris {{sometimes}} {{found itself}} on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed {{an agreement to}} share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed {{by the government of}} Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try to reach an agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{the town}} {{was known as a}} major centre for the {{production}} of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{a second}} Washington Park Race Track opened up in south {{suburban}} Homewood.

The relocated track <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> famous and popular attraction. The inaugural meeting of organizers was July 3, 1926. The new track was constructed amongst a construction boom of racetracks in the United States during the 1920s, which included fifteen new large racetracks constructed during the decade. Others constructed at this time were Arlington Park nearby in Chicago and Hialeah Park in Florida.|$|E
