40|$|Agricultural land {{devoted to}} {{vegetable}} crops in the Caribbean has strongly increased {{during the past}} twenty years, which raises major concerns regarding a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks because of lowC inputs and high SOC outputs fromthese cropping systems. The aimof this studywas {{to assess the impact}} of farming practices on SOC stocks at the farm type level. We designed a framework which encompasses a farm typology describing the diversity of farm practices applied to vegetable crops and a model of SOC dynamics to estimate the impact of these practices on SOC stocks. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the variability of Caribbean agriculture, in a context of transition from traditional sugarcane and banana monocultures for export to a more diversified agriculture including vegetable crops. A farm typology was developed from a survey of 71 farmers concerning their socio-economic characteristics and farming practices. The MorGwanik model of SOC dynamics was then used {{to assess the impact of}} farming practices on SOC at the farm type level, and to interpret the observed SOC changes. Five farm types were identified varying from traditional export agriculture with low diversification to monoculture of vegetable crops based on compost application and reduced soil tillage. The observed and simulated results indicated that systems with a fallow/vegetables <b>cycle</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>N</b> 2 and the monoculture of vegetables including compost applications at ≥ 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 presented C sequestration corresponding to SOC increases of 10 % and 3 % of the initial stock, respectively. The monoculture of vegetables with a compost rate b 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 and systems including vegetables in rotation with export crops and a short fallow cycle presented a reduction in SOC that ranged from 10 % to 18 %. Pedoclimatic conditions had a lower impact on SOC changes. Similar socio-economic profiles of farmers were observed for farm types including very different cropping systems. The model well described SOC changes for each farm type and offered valuable insights about the factors affecting SOC losses and C sequestration. The framework proposed in this study was helpful to identify improved managements that can maintain or increase SOC stocks under tropical conditions...|$|R

The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|R

40|$|Manganese {{borohydride}} (Mn(BH 4) 2) {{was successfully}} synthesized by a mechano-chemical activation synthesis (MCAS) from lithium borohydride (LiBH 4) and manganese chloride (MnCl 2) by applying high {{energy ball milling}} for 30 min. For the first time a wide range of molar <b>ratios</b> <b>n</b> = 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 23 in the (nLiBH 4 + MnCl 2) mixture was investigated. During ball milling for 30 min the mixtures release only a very small quantity of H 2 that increases with the molar <b>ratio</b> <b>n</b> but does not exceed ∼ 0. 2 wt. % for n = 23. However, longer milling duration leads to more H 2 released. For the equimolar <b>ratio</b> <b>n</b> = 1 the principal phases synthesized are Li 2 MnCl 4, an inverse cubic spinel phase, and the Mn(BH 4) 2 borohydride. For n = 2 a LiCl salt is formed which coexists with Mn(BH 4) 2. With the n increasing from 3 to 23 LiBH 4 is not completely reacted and its increasing amount is retained in the microstructure coexisting with LiCl and Mn(BH 4) 2. Gas mass spectrometry during Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) up to 450 °C shows the release of hydrogen as a principal gas with a maximum intensity around 130 - 150 °C accompanied by a miniscule quantity of borane B 2 H 6. The intensity of the B 2 H 6 peak is 200 - 600 times smaller than the intensity of the corresponding H 2 peak. In situ heating experiments using a continuous monitoring during heating show no evidence of melting of Mn(BH 4) 2 up to about 270 - 280 °C. At 100 °C under 1 bar H 2 pressure the ball milled n = 2 and 3 mixtures are capable of desorbing quite rapidly ∼ 4 wt. % H 2 which is a very large amount of H 2 considering that the mixture also contains 2 mol of LiCl salt. The H 2 quantities experimentally desorbed at 100 and 200 °C do not exceed the maximum theoretical quantities of H 2 expected to be desorbed from Mn(BH 4) 2 for various molar <b>ratios</b> <b>n.</b> It clearly confirms that the contribution from B 2 H 6 evolved is negligibly small (if any) when desorption occurs isothermally in the practical temperature range 100 - 200 °C. It is found that the ball milled mixture with the molar <b>ratio</b> <b>n</b> = 3 exhibits the highest rate constant k and the lowest apparent activation energy for dehydrogenation, E A ∼ 102 kJ/mol. Decreasing or increasing the molar <b>ratio</b> <b>n</b> below or above 3 increases the apparent activation energy. Ball milled mixtures with the molar <b>ratio</b> <b>n</b> = 2 and 3 discharge slowly H 2 during storage at room temperature and 40 °C. The addition of 5 wt. % nano-Ni with a specific surface area of 60. 5 m 2 /g substantially enhances the rate of discharge at 40 °C. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
