40|$|Pathogens {{transmitted}} by arthropod vectors {{are common in}} human populations, agricultural systems and natural <b>communities.</b> <b>Transmission</b> of these vector-borne pathogens depends on the population dynamics of the vector species {{as well as its}} interactions with other species within the community. In particular, predation may be sufficient to control pathogen prevalence indirectly via the vector. To examine the indirect effect of predators on vectored-pathogen dynamics, we developed a theoretical model that integrates predator–prey and host–pathogen theory. We used this model to determine whether predation can prevent pathogen persistence or alter the stability of host–pathogen dynamics. We found that, in the absence of predation, pathogen prevalence in the host increases with vector fecundity, whereas predation on the vector causes pathogen prevalence to decline, or even become extinct, with increasing vector fecundity. We also found that predation on a vector may drastically slow the initial spread of a pathogen. The predator can increase host abundance indirectly by reducing or eliminating infection in the host population. These results highlight the importance of studying interactions that, within the greater community, may alter our predictions when studying disease dynamics. From an applied perspective, these results also suggest situations where an introduced predator or the natural enemies of a vector may slow the rate of spread of an emerging vector-borne pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify risk factors for ongoing <b>community</b> <b>transmission</b> of tuberculosis (TB) in two densely populated urban communities with a high incidence rate of TB in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods Between 1993 and 1998 DNA fingerprints of mycobacterial isolates from TB patients were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Cases whose isolates shared identical fingerprint patterns were considered to belong to the same cluster and to be attributable to ongoing <b>community</b> <b>transmission.</b> Results The average annual notification rate of new smear positive TB was 238 / 100 000. In all, 1023 / 1526 reported patients were culture positive, and RFLP was available for 768 (75 %) of the isolates from these patients. Since some patients experienced more than one infection during the study period, 797 cases were included in the analysis. Of the cases, 575 / 797 (72 %) were clustered. Smear-positive cases and those who were retreated after default were more likely to be clustered than smear-negative and new cases, respectively. Patients from Uitsig were more often part of large clusters than were patients from Ravensmead. Age, sex, year of diagnosis, and outcome of disease were not risk factors for clustering, nor for being the first case in a cluster, although various analytical approaches were used. Conclusions The incidence and proportion of cases that are clustered in this area are higher than reported elsewhere. An overwhelming majority of TB cases in this area is attributed to ongoing <b>community</b> <b>transmission,</b> and only very few to reactiva-tion. This may explain the lack of demographic risk factors for clustering...|$|E

40|$|Intestinal infections with soil-transmitted helminths and {{protozoa}} {{are still}} prevalent in Indonesia, particularly in urban <b>communities.</b> <b>Transmission</b> of parasitic infections is effected {{directly or indirectly}} through objects contaminated with feces, including food, water, fingers and fingernails, indicating the importance of fecal-oral human-to-human transmission. Sidewalk food vendors (SFVs) preparing food for their customers are a potential source of infections with many intestinal helminths and protozoa. Compared {{to other parts of}} the hand, the area beneath fingernails harbors the most microorganisms and is most difficult to clean. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites in fingernail dirt of SFVs and to identify the associated factors. This study involved 112 SFVs in the vicinity of Hospital X in Central Jakarta, and used microscopic examination of SFV fingernail dirt for determining species prevalence of intestinal parasites. This study showed that 94 samples out of 112 (83. 9 %) were positive for intestinal parasites; 60 samples (63. 8 %) represented single infections and 34 (36. 2 %) mixed infections. Ascaris lumbricoides eggs were found in 30 (26. 8 %) samples and Giardia lamblia cysts in 12 (17. 89 %). The highest prevalence was found in subjects with primary school education, among whom 20 (30. 8 %) had single infections of A. lumbricoides and 16 (24. 6 %) mixed infections with A. lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura. In conclusion, prevalence of intestinal parasites in SFV fingernail dirt is extremely high, with the highest prevalence among less educated SFVs.
