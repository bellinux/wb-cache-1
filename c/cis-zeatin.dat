40|$|In {{transverse}} orientation, maize (Zea mays) {{roots are}} composed of a central stele that is embedded in multiple layers of cortical parenchyma. The stele functions in the transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates, while the cortical parenchyma fulfills metabolic functions that are not very well characterized. To better understand the molecular functions of these root tissues, protein- and phytohormone-profiling experiments were conducted. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry identified 59 proteins that were preferentially accumulated in the cortical parenchyma and 11 stele-specific proteins. Hormone profiling revealed preferential accumulation of indole acetic acid and its conjugate indole acetic acid-aspartate in the stele and predominant localization of the cytokinin <b>cis-zeatin,</b> its precursor <b>cis-zeatin</b> riboside, and its conjugate <b>cis-zeatin</b> O-glucoside in the cortical parenchyma. A root-specific β-glucosidase that functions in the hydrolysis of <b>cis-zeatin</b> O-glucoside was preferentially accumulated in the cortical parenchyma. Similarly, four enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation that are regulated by cytokinin were preferentially accumulated in the cortical parenchyma. The antagonistic distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the stele and cortical parenchyma, together with the cortical parenchyma-specific accumulation of cytokinin-regulated proteins, suggest a molecular framework that specifies the function of these root tissues that {{also play a role}} in the formation of lateral roots from pericycle and endodermis cells...|$|E
40|$|Zeatin is a {{naturally}} occurring cytokinin. Biosynthesis and metabolism studies of zeatin have been directed mostly at the trans isomer, although <b>cis-zeatin</b> and its riboside occur as major components in some plant species. It {{is not known}} whether parallel regulatory pathways exist for the two isomers. Based on the sequence of the gene ZOG 1 encoding a trans-zeatin O-glucosyltransferase from Phaseolus (EC 2. 4. 1. 203), a cis-zeatin-specific O-glucosyltransferase was isolated from maize. This gene, cisZOG 1, contains an ORF of 1, 401 nucleotides encoding a protein of 51. 1 kDa with 41 % identity to the Phaseolus ZOG 1 protein. Unexpectedly, the maize enzyme recognizes as substrates <b>cis-zeatin</b> and UDP-glucose but not cis-ribosylzeatin, trans-zeatin, or trans-ribosylzeatin.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Conversion of {{exogenous}} <b>cis-zeatin</b> to trans-zeatin in immature {{seeds of}} Phaseolus vulgaris L. {{led to the}} isolation of a cis-trans isomerase from the endosperm. The enzyme was purified over 2000 -fold by chromatography {{on a series of}} FPLC (anion exchange, gel filtration, and hydrophobic interaction) and Concanavalin A columns. Non-enzymatic isomerization occurred under standard assay conditions but the presence of the enzyme enhanced conversion significantly. The enzymatic reaction favors conversion from the cis to the trans form and requires flavin, blue light, and DTT. Optimal conditions for isomerization were identified using a Phenyl Superosepurified enzyme extract. Concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 316 mM FAD and 0. 5 mM DTT resulted in high conversion. The pH optimum for the reaction was 7. 5. Although the isomerase was heat stable, a temperature of 35 °C was chosen for the assay reaction in order to minimize non-enzymatic thermal isomerization. Retention on the Concanavalin A column as well as shifting in mobility of all visible protein bands on SDS-PAGE following N-glycosidase-F treatment indicated that the enzyme is a glycoprotein. The enzyme was stable for at least 8 weeks when stored at - 80 °C. The isomerase is capable of converting <b>cis-zeatin</b> riboside and trans-zeatin riboside. Changing the isoprenoid side chain location from N⁶ in zeatin to the 9 -position of the adenine ring in 9 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 - methylbut- 2 -enyl) adenine also resulted in isomerization. The occurrence of cis-trans isomerization suggests that <b>cis-zeatin</b> and <b>cis-zeatin</b> riboside formed by tRNA degradation could be precursors of biologically active cytokinins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Zeatin {{belongs to}} the {{derivation}} of purine, and the C=C {{is one of the}} functional groups in the zeatin structure. So, there are trans- and cis- structures for the zeatin molecule. Interestingly, the trans-zeatin has biological activities, but the <b>cis-zeatin</b> has no obvious biological activity. The trans-zeatin is the first separated cell cytokinins from the plant tissue. And the zeatin, especially trans-zeatin has important and extensive applications in many research fields. In this study, the Geometries of the trans-zeatin and <b>cis-zeatin</b> were optimized by using the density function Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr, DFT/B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G method. Additionally, FT-IR experiments were conducted for the trans-zeatin. The geometry structures and molecular vibrational property of the zeatin were simply discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of eight cytokinins in promoting callus growth {{were tested in}} two Phaseolus genotypes, P. vulgaris L. var. Great Northern, and P. lunatus L. var. Kingston. The structural feature which contributes to the major genotypic difference in cytokinin structure-activity relationships is {{the presence or absence}} of a double bond at the 2, 3 -position of the isoprenoid N 6 side chain. In Kingston, trans-zeatin was 3 -fold more active than dihydrozeatin and 30 -fold more active than <b>cis-zeatin.</b> The {{activities of}} N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenine and N 6 -isopentyladenine were nearly the same. In Great Northern, however, dihydrozeatin was at least 30 -fold more active than both trans-zeatin and <b>cis-zeatin,</b> and N 6 -isopentyladenine was 100 -fold more active than N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenine. The results suggest the possibility of employing cytokinin structure-activity relationships in distinguishing genotypic differences in cytokinin function and metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Geometric and {{position}} isomers of zeatin and of ribosylzeatin and other compounds {{closely related to}} zeatin have been tested in the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Wisconsin No. 38) bioassay. None was more active than zeatin itself. There was a much greater difference in activity (> 50 -fold) between trans- and <b>cis-zeatin</b> than between trans-isozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-trans- 2 -butenylamino) purine] and cis-isozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-cis- 2 -butenylamino) purine], the latter being less active than <b>cis-zeatin</b> and trans-isozeatin. Higher concentrations were required for equivalent callus growth stimulated by the 9 -ribosyl derivatives, which followed an order of decreasing activity: ribosyl-trans-zeatin > ribosyl-cis-zeatin > ribosyl-trans-isozeatin > ribosyl-cis-isozeatin, corresponding roughly {{to that of the}} bases. The effect of side chain, double bond saturation was to diminish the activity, and in the dihydro series the shift of the methyl group from the 3 - to the 2 -position in going from dihydrozeatin to dihydroisozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methylbutylamino) purine] resulted in a 70 -fold decrease in activity. cis-Norzeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy-cis- 2 -butenylamino) purine], which was less than one-fifth as active as <b>cis-zeatin,</b> showed the effect of complete removal of the side chain methyl group, and cyclic-norzeatin [6 -(3, 6 -dihydro- 1, 2 -oxazin- 2 -yl) purine] was about 1 / 100 as active as cis-norzeatin. These findings delineate completely the effect on the cytokinin activity of zeatin of variation in side chain geometry, presence {{and position}} of the methyl substituent, presence and geometry of hydroxyl substitution, presence of the double bond, and of side chain cyclization...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} and biochemical bases of seed dormancy in Lolium rigidum (annual ryegrass) are largely unknown, and {{study of this}} process is complicated by the outcrossing nature of the species and the strong influence of environment on seed dormancy. In order to identify heritable biochemical factors contributing to seed dormancy in L. rigidum, seeds from a field-collected population were used to select sub-populations with consistently low or high seed dormancy over four generations. Low-dormancy seeds showed constitutive a-amylase activity prior to imbibition, higher concentrations of polyphenols and <b>cis-zeatin,</b> and lower abscisic acid and <b>cis-zeatin</b> riboside concentrations than high-dormancy seeds. Selection for high dormancy was associated with a reduction in response to dark-stratification for 21 d at 20 degrees C (an effective means of releasing dormancy in the original, unselected population) over successive generations, but fluridone remained effective in breaking dormancy. Crossing of low- and high-dormancy populations indicated that dormancy level was not dependent upon the maternal genotype of the seed, and that the constitutive a-amylase activity and high seed anthocyanin concentrations characteristic of the low-dormancy populations were not correlated to high basal germination ability.

40|$|Glucosides of trans-zeatin occur {{widely in}} plant tissues, formed either by O-glucosylation of the {{hydroxylated}} side chain or N-glucosylation of the purine ring structure. O-Glucosylation is stereo-specific: the O-glucosyltransferase encoded by the Phaseolus lunatus ZOG 1 gene has high affinity for trans-zeatin as the substrate, whereas the enzyme encoded by the maize (Zea mays) cisZOG 1 gene prefers <b>cis-zeatin.</b> Here {{we show that}} hydroxylated derivatives of benzyladenine (topolins) are also substrates of ZOG 1 and cisZOG 1. The m-OH and o-OH derivatives are the preferred substrate of ZOG 1 and cisZOG 1, respectively. Among the hydroxylated derivatives of thidiazuron tested, the only enzyme/substrate combination resulting in conversion was cisZOG 1 /(o-OH) thidiazuron. The abilities of these cytokinins to serve as substrates to the glucosyltransferases were in a large part correlated with their biological activities in the P. lunatus callus bioassay, indicating {{that there may be}} similarities between cytokinin-binding sites on the enzymes and cytokinin receptors. Further support for this interpretation is provided by cytokinin recognition studies involving the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CRE 1 /WOL/AHK 4 and maize ZmHK 1 receptors. The AHK 4 receptor responded to trans-zeatin and m-topolin, while the ZmHK 1 receptor responded also to <b>cis-zeatin</b> and o-topolin.

Water deficit {{increased}} cytokinin oxidase and implied cytokinin degradation in Zea mays [24]. Plant responses with deficits of macronutrients or water showed some differences but also similarities, mostly involving hormonal long-distance signaling [25]. As previously described, water deficit induced formation of tracheid with small radial diameter in sugi trees [4]. If the results for tZ in Arabidopsis and Zea mays held true in sugi trees, deficit of water and macronutrient may affect degradation and inhibition of cytokinin synthesis, and the decreased amounts of cytokinins may affect tracheid differentiation in sugi trees. We hypothesize that tZ-type cytokinins may be the signal which transmits the information of water and macronutrients contents in the soil to the differentiating tracheid in sugi trees.|$|E

In the recombinant E. coli system, ZmHK 1 and ZmHK 3 a were more sensitive to free-base cytokinins than to the corresponding nucleosides; isopentenyladenine was most effective for ZmHK 1, while ZmHK 2 tended to be most sensitive to trans-zeatin and the riboside. In contrast to a known cytokinin receptor of Arabidopsis (AHK 4 /CRE 1 /WOL), all ZmHKs responded to <b>cis-zeatin</b> (cZ), which generally is believed to be inactive or only weakly active. In cultured maize cells, expression of ZmRR 1, a cytokinin-inducible response regulator, was induced by cZ as well as by trans-zeatin.

40|$|Cytokinins (CKs) are {{plant hormones}} that affect {{a wide range}} of {{developmental}} processes. The most important group of isoprenoid CKs represent zeatin and its derivatives occurring in two, cis and trans, positional isomers. Whereas trans-zeatin (transZ) was found to be a highly bioactive substance, <b>cis-zeatin</b> (cisZ) has been viewed for years as inactive or weakly active adjunct to its corresponding trans counterpart playing only an insignificant physiological role in plants.

All tested derivatives of cisZ, surprisingly including also zeatin-N 9 -glucoside, delayed dark-induced chlorophyll degradation in oat and wheat leaf segments. Additionally, cisZs effectively induced cell division in CK-dependent tobacco callus. The most pronounced activity was exhibited by cisZ riboside (cisZR) in the two types of CK bioassays. Metabolism of both zeatin isomers differed in short-term as well as in long-term experiments, which was supported also by various affinity of CK degrading enzyme, CK oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX), to individual cis and trans isomers.

40|$|Cytokinins (CKs) are an {{important}} group of phytohormones. Their tightly regulated and balanced levels are essential for proper cell division and plant organ development. Here we report precise quantification of CK metabolites and other phytohormones in maize reproductive organs {{in the course of}} pollination and kernel maturation. A novel enzymatic activity dependent on NADP(+) converting trans-zeatin (tZ) to 6 -(3 -methylpyrrol- 1 -yl) purine (MPP) was detected. MPP shows weak anticytokinin properties and inhibition of CK dehydrogenases due to their ability to bind to an active site in the opposite orientation than substrates. Although the physiological significance of tZ side-chain cyclization is not anticipated as the MPP occurrence in maize tissue is very low, properties of the novel CK metabolite indicate its potential for utilization in plant in vitro tissue culture. Furthermore, feeding experiments with different isoprenoid CKs revealed distinct preferences in glycosylation of tZ and <b>cis-zeatin</b> (cZ). While tZ is preferentially glucosylated at the N 9 position, cZ forms mainly O-glucosides. Since O-glucosides, in contrast to N 9 -glucosides, are resistant to irreversible cleavage catalyzed by CK dehydrogenases, the observed preference of maize CK glycosyltransferases to O-glycosylate zeatin in the cis-position might be a reason why cZ derivatives are over-accumulated in different maize tissues and organs...|$|E

The partially purified enzyme required an external addition of FAD and dithiothreitol for the conversion of <b>cis-zeatin</b> to its trans- isomer that occurred only under light. Although an existence of this important enzyme involved in the metabolism of plant hormones cytokinins was generally accepted by plant biologists, the corresponding protein and encoding gene have not been identified to date. Based on the original paper, we purified and identified an enzyme from maize, which shows the described zeatin cis–trans isomerase activity. The enzyme belongs to nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family, which is well characterized in mammals, but less known in plants. Further experiments with the recombinant maize enzyme obtained from yeast expression system showed that rather than the catalytic activity of the enzyme itself, a non-enzymatic flavin induced photoisomerization is responsible for the observed zeatin cis–trans interconversion in vitro. An overexpression of the maize nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase gene led to decreased FAD and increased FMN and riboflavin contents in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. However, neither contents nor the ratio of zeatin isomers was altered suggesting that the enzyme is unlikely to catalyze the interconversion of zeatin isomers in vivo.

Thus {{it was hypothesized that}} the IAA : CK model is the central control but that it must be considered within the relevant timeframe leading to lateral bud release and against a backdrop of interactions with other hormone groups. Therefore, IAA and a wide survey of cytokinins (CKs), were examined along with abscisic acid (ABA) and polyamines (PAs) in released buds, tissue surrounding buds and xylem sap at 1 and 4 h after apex removal, when lateral buds of chickpea are known to break dormancy. Three potential lateral bud growth inhibitors, IAA, ABA and <b>cis-zeatin</b> 9 -riboside (ZR), declined sharply in the released buds and xylem following decapitation. This is in contrast to potential dormancy breaking CKs like trans-ZR and trans-zeantin 9 -riboside 52 ̆ 7 phosphate (ZRMP), which represented the strongest correlative changes by increasing 3. 5 -fold in xylem sap and 22 -fold in buds. PAs had not changed significantly in buds or other tissues after 4 h, so they were not directly involved in the breaking of bud dormancy. Results from the xylem and surrounding tissues indicated that bud CK increases resulted from a combination synthesis in the bud and selective loading of CK nucleotides into the xylem from the root...|$|E
40|$|Decades ago, the {{importance}} of cytokinins (CKs) during Rhodococcus fascians pathology had been acknowledged, and an isopentenyltransferase gene had been characterized in the fas operon of the linear virulence plasmid, but hitherto, no specific CK(s) could be associated with virulence. We show that the CK receptors AHK 3 and AHK 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana are essential for symptom development, and that the CK perception machinery is induced upon infection, underlining its {{central role in the}} symptomatology. Three classical CKs [isopentenyladenine, trans-zeatin, and <b>cis-zeatin</b> (cZ) ] and their 2 -methylthio (2 MeS) -derivatives were identified by CK profiling of both the pathogenic R. fascians strain D 188 and its nonpathogenic derivative D 188 - 5. However, the much higher CK levels in strain D 188 suggest that the linear plasmid is responsible for the virulence-associated production. All R. fascians CKs were recognized by AHK 3 and AHK 4, and, although they individually provoked typical CK responses in several bioassays, the mixture of bacterial CKs exhibited clear synergistic effects. The cis- and 2 MeS-derivatives were poor substrates of the apoplastic CK oxidase/dehydrogenase enzymes and the latter were not cytotoxic at high concentrations. Consequently, the accumulating 2 MeScZ (and cZ) in infected Arabidopsis tissue contribute to the continuous stimulation of tissue proliferation. Based on these results, we postulate that the R. fascians pathology is based on the local and persistent secretion of an array of CKs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a N 6 -dimethylallyladenine (cytokinin) dehydrogenase-based microbiosensor for real-time determination {{of the family of}} hormones known as cytokinins. Cytokinin dehydrogenase from Zea mays (ZmCKX 1) was immobilised concurrently with electrodeposition of a silica gel film on the surface of a Pt microelectrode, which was further functionalized by free electron mediator 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) in supporting electrolyte to give a bioactive film capable of selective oxidative cleavage of the N 6 - side chain of cytokinins. The rapid electron shuffling between freely diffusible DCPIP and the FAD redox group in ZmCKX 1 endowed the microbiosensor with a fast response time of less than 10 s. The immobilised ZmCKX 1 retained a high affinity for its preferred substrate N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl) adenine (iP), and gave the miniaturized biosensor a large linear dynamic range from 10 nM to 10 mM, a detection limit of 3. 9 nM and a high sensitivity to iP of 603. 3 mAmM 21 cm 22 (n = 4, R 2 = 0. 9999). Excellent selectivity was displayed for several other aliphatic cytokinins and their ribosides, including N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl) adenine, N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine, <b>cis-zeatin,</b> trans-zeatin and trans-zeatin riboside. Aromatic cytokinins and metabolites such as cytokinin glucosides were generally poor substrates. The microbiosensors exhibited excellent stability in terms of pH and long-term storage and have been used successfully to determine low nanomolar cytokinin concentrations in tomato xylem sap exudates...|$|E
40|$|Plant hormones, cytokinins (CKs), {{have been}} {{for a long time}} {{considered}} to be involved in plant responses to stress. However, their exact roles in processes linked to stress signalization and acclimatization to adverse environmental conditions are unknown. In this study, expression profiles of the entire gene families of CK biosynthetic and degradation genes in maize (Zea mays) during development and stress responses are described. Transcript abundance of particular genes is discussed in relation to the levels of different CK metabolites. Salt and osmotic stresses induce expression of some CK biosynthetic genes in seedlings of maize, leading to a moderate increase of active forms of CKs lasting several days during acclimatization to stress. A direct effect of CKs to mediate activation of stress responses {{does not seem to be}} possible due to the slow changes in metabolite levels. However, expression of genes involved in cytokinin signal transduction is uniformly down-regulated within 0. 5 h of stress induction by an unknown mechanism. <b>cis-Zeatin</b> and its derivatives were found to be the most abundant CKs in young maize seedlings. We demonstrate that levels of this zeatin isomer are significantly enhanced during early stress response and that it originates independently from de novo biosynthesis in stressed tissues, possibly by elevated specific RNA degradation. By enhancing their CK levels, plants could perhaps undergo a reduction of growth rates maintained by abscisic acid accumulation in stressed tissues. A second role for cytokinin receptors in sensing turgor response is hypothesized besides their documented function in CK signaling...|$|E
40|$|Among phytohormones, cytokinins (CKs) play an {{important}} role in controlling crucial aspects of plant development. Not only plants but also diverse microorganisms are able to produce phytohormones, including CKs, though knowledge concerning their biosynthesis and metabolism is still limited. In this work we demonstrate that the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, a hemi-biotrophic pathogen of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), causing one of the most damaging diseases of this crop, is able to modify the CK profile in infected B. napus tissues, as well as produce a wide range of CKs in vitro, with the <b>cis-zeatin</b> derivatives predominating. The endogenous CK spectrum of L. maculans in vitro consists mainly of free CK bases, as opposed to plants, where other CK forms are mostly more abundant. Using functional genomics, enzymatic and feeding assays with CK bases supplied to culture media, we show that L. maculans contains a functional: (i) isopentenyltransferase (IPT) involved in cZ production; (ii) adenosine kinase (AK) involved in phosphorylation of CK ribosides to nucleotides; and (iii) CK-degradation enzyme cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX). Our data further indicate the presence of cis–trans isomerase, zeatin O-glucosyltransferase(s) and N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenine hydroxylating enzyme. Besides, we report on a crucial role of LmAK for L. maculans fitness and virulence. Altogether, in this study we characterize in detail the CK metabolism of the filamentous fungi L. maculans and report its two novel components, the CKX and CK-related AK activities, according to our knowledge for the first time in the fungal kingdom. Based on these findings, we propose a model illustrating CK metabolism pathways in L. maculans...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinin {{activity}} in the culture medium of four pathogenic strains of Corynebacterium fascians varied from 168 to 0. 4 μg of kinetin (6 -furfurylaminopurine) equivalents per liter, as compared to 0. 2 in an avirulent control. N 6 -Isopentenyladenine was the predominant cytokinin in the medium of all five strains, and its increased production was correlated with the degree of pathogenicity; however, the virulent strains also produced 8 - 13 times more <b>cis-zeatin</b> [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-cis- 2 -butenylamino) purine] than the avirulent strain. The three most virulent strains (with the higher cytokinin contents in the medium) contained a large (Mr ≈ 108) plasmid. The barely virulent strain contained a smaller plasmid. No plasmid was detected in the avirulent control. The total cytokinin content (mole%) and biological activity (μg of kinetin equivalent per mg of tRNA) in tRNA were about the same in all three virulent strains and in the avirulent control. Five cytokinins were isolated from each strain. Four were rigorously characterized as 6 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-cis- 2 -butenylamino) - 9 -β-D-ribofuranosylpurin e, 6 -(3 -methyl- 2 -butenylamino) - 9 -β-D-ribofuranosylpurine, and their 2 -methylthio derivatives. The fifth cytokinin was tentatively identified as 6 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-trans- 2 -butenylamino) - 9 -β-D-ribofuranosylpur ine. Ribosyl-cis-zeatin was 3 -fold higher and N 6 -isopentenyladenosine was correspondingly lower in the plasmid-containing strains than in the plasmidless control. Because the entire syndrome of fasciation caused by infection can be induced with synthetic cytokinins, the disease {{would appear to be}} caused by plasmid-induced high rates of cytokinin production by the bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinins (CKs) mediate {{cellular}} {{responses to}} drought stress and targeted control of CK metabolism {{can be used}} to develop drought-tolerant plants. Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve drought tolerance of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, GmIPT) and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, GmCKX) genes. Comparative analyses of GmIPTs and GmCKXs with Arabidopsis counterparts revealed their similar architecture. The average numbers of abiotic stress-inducible cis-elements per promoter were 0. 4 and 1. 2 for GmIPT and GmCKX genes, respectively, suggesting that upregulation of GmCKXs, thereby reduction of CK levels, maybe the major events under abiotic stresses. Indeed, the expression of 12 GmCKX genes was upregulated by dehydration in R 2 roots. Overall, the expressions of soybean CK metabolic genes in various tissues at various stages were highly responsive to drought. CK contents in various organs at the reproductive (R 2) stage were also determined under well-watered and drought stress conditions. Although tRNA-type GmIPT genes were highly expressed in soybean, <b>cis-zeatin</b> and its derivatives were found at low concentrations. Moreover, reduction of total CK content in R 2 leaves under drought was attributable to the decrease in dihydrozeatin levels, suggesting a role of this molecule in regulating soybean's responses to drought stress. Our systematic analysis of the GmIPT and GmCKX families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under drought stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinins, {{which are}} central {{regulators}} of cell division and differentiation in plants, are adenine derivatives carrying an isopentenyl side chain {{that may be}} hydroxylated. Plants have two classes of isopentenyltransferases (IPTs) acting on the adenine moiety: ATP/ADP isopentenyltransferases (in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtIPT 1, 3, 4 – 8) and tRNA IPTs (in Arabidopsis, AtIPT 2 and 9). ATP/ADP IPTs {{are likely to be}} responsible for the bulk of cytokinin synthesis, whereas it is thought that <b>cis-zeatin</b> (cZ) -type cytokinins are produced possibly by degradation of cis-hydroxy isopentenyl tRNAs, which are formed by tRNA IPTs. However, these routes are largely hypothetical because of lack of in vivo evidence, because the critical experiment necessary to verify these routes, namely the production and analysis of mutants lacking AtIPTs, has not yet been described. We isolated null mutants for all members of the ATP/ADP IPT and tRNA IPT gene families in Arabidopsis. Notably, our work demonstrates that the atipt 1 3 5 7 quadruple mutant possesses severely decreased levels of isopentenyladenine and trans-zeatin (tZ), and their corresponding ribosides, ribotides, and glucosides, and is retarded in its growth. In contrast, these mutants possessed increased levels of cZ-type cytokinins. The atipt 2 9 double mutant, on the other hand, lacked isopentenyl- and cis-hydroxy isopentenyl-tRNA, and cZ-type cytokinins. These results indicate that whereas ATP/ADP IPTs are responsible for the bulk of isopentenyladenine- and tZ-type cytokinin synthesis, tRNA IPTs are required for cZ-type cytokinin production. This work clarifies the long-standing questions of the biosynthetic routes for isopentenyladenine-, tZ-, and cZ-type cytokinin production...|$|E
