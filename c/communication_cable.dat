5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a <b>communication</b> <b>cable,</b> a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E

Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer. There may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, <b>communication</b> <b>cables</b> connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.|$|R
