5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions <b>could</b> <b>occur</b> and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to calculate that this process <b>could</b> <b>occur</b> in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} {{during this phase}} of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation <b>could</b> <b>occur.</b> Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.|$|E

5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure <b>could</b> <b>occur</b> and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the local}} protein {{synthesis}} hypothesis gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis <b>could</b> <b>occur</b> in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli {{emphasized that the}} external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone could save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms could be given separately; Spirit baptism <b>could</b> <b>occur</b> first or last in the sequence.|$|E

5000|$|HspQ is {{involved}} in the degradation of certain denaturated proteins, including DnaA, during Heat shock stress. HspQ (YccV like protein domain) is a hemimethylated DNA-binding protein. It has been thought to negatively regulate dnaA gene expression when its promoter region is either methylated or hemimethylated. This <b>could</b> <b>occurs</b> through binding of YccV itself to fully or hemimethylated DNA. [...] In addition, studies have identified the yccV gene as one of three insertion sites in mini-Tn10 which suppress dnaA46 thermosensitivity.|$|R

On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
