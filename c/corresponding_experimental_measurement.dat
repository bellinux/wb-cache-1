40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} {{theoretically}} and experimentally the optimization {{problem of the}} heat transfer occurring in two coupled thermoelectric devices. A simple experimental set up is used. The optimization parameters are the applied electric currents. When one thermoelectric is analysed, the temperature difference Δ T between the thermoelectric boundaries shows a parabolic profile {{with respect to the}} applied electric current. This behaviour agrees qualitatively with the <b>corresponding</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>measurement.</b> The global entropy generation shows a monotonous increase with the electric current. In the case of two coupled thermoelectric devices, elliptic isocontours for Δ T are obtained in applying an electric current through each of the thermoelectrics. The isocontours also fit well with measurements. Optimal figure of merit is found for a specific set of values of the applied electric currents. The entropy generation-thermal figure of merit relationship is studied. It is shown that, given a value of the thermal figure of merit, the device can be operated in a state of minimum entropy production...|$|E
40|$|Travelling Wave Tube (TWT) is an {{electronic}} vacuum microwave device, {{which is used}} as a high power microwave amplifier, mainly in telecommunication purposes and radar systems. TWT's seem to be an alternative and a more reliable solution than semiconductor devices when building high power and high frequency applications. Thermal behaviour of TWT {{is one of the key}} aspects influencing its reliability and working parameters. In fact, the standard TWT is treated as a high power device and the supplied power is dissipated mainly through conduction and convection phenomena. In practical applications, depending on a type of TWT, they can be cooled either by a forced liquid or air circulation. The main goal of the presented research was to perform analytical, experimental and numerical analysis of temperature distribution of a low band TWT in case of a typical working condition. Because theoretical analysis seems to be very complex, thus it was decided to support it with experimental measurements and numerical simulations as well as with the simplified analytical formulas. As a first step of the presented research, the analytical analysis and numerical modelling of the helix TWT was carried out. The objective of the thermal analysis was to assess the temperature distribution in different parts of the helix TWT assembly during extreme standard and working conditions. Afterwards, the obtained numerical results were validated by experimental measurements, which were carried out using a custom designed TWT test sample and <b>corresponding</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>measurement</b> tools...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Protein chains undergo {{conformational}} diffusion during folding and dynamics, experiencing both thermal kicks and viscous drag. Recent {{experiments have}} shown that the correspond-ing friction can be separated into wet friction, which is determined by the solvent viscosity, and dry friction, where frictional effects arise due to the interactions within the protein chain. Despite important advances, the molecular origins underlying dry friction in proteins have remained unclear.

Measurement of the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of energetic protons is used to investigate the transition from radiation pressure acceleration to transparency-driven processes. It is shown numerically that radiation pressure drives an increased expansion of the target ions within the spatial extent of the laser focal spot, which induces a radial deflection of relatively low energy sheath-accelerated protons to form an annular distribution. Through variation of the target foil thickness, the opening angle of the ring is shown to be correlated to the point in time transparency occurs during the interaction and is maximized when it occurs at the peak of the laser intensity profile. <b>Corresponding</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>measurements</b> of the ring size variation with target thickness exhibit the same trends and provide insight into the intra-pulse laser-plasma evolution...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in simulation of granular matter and computation hardware let the discrete element method (DEM) evolve {{into the field}} of dynamic simulation of soils, enabling to simulate physical effects of soil deformation at particle interaction-scale. However, DEM is still lacking a generally accepted method to determine material-specific but application-independent particle contact parameters. In this article a novel, system- atic method to directly determine the contact parameters of the particles is proposed. These parameters are divided into two groups: 1) independent parameters whose values are measurable, real soil properties and 2) dependent parameters whose values are set according to sufficient, modeling-intrinsic requirements. With the proposed parameter estimation strategy, the number of parameters which actually need to be chosen by look- up tables has been decreased to one single parameter. Additionally, the look-up table is only computed once and reused for every new type of soil. Thus the method is time efficient and does not repeatedly need preliminary calibration simulations and {{the time required to}} develop a mature and valid model is drastically reduced. In the article the pa- rameter setting method is validated for a quartz sand, used to simulate the impact-driven penetration of the HP 3 -Mole and its <b>corresponding</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

To this purpose, a random spatial variability of the elastic modulus {{as well as of}} the thickness of the shell is introduced in addition to the random initial geometric deviations of the shell structure from its perfect geometry. The main novelty of this paper compared to previous works is that a non-Gaussian assumption is made for the distribution of the two aforementioned uncertain parameters i. e. the modulus of elasticity and the shell thickness which are described by two-dimensional uni-variate (2 D- 1 V) homogeneous non-Gaussian stochastic fields. The initial geometric imperfections are described as a 2 D- 1 V Gaussian non-homogeneous stochastic field with properties derived from <b>corresponding</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>measurements.</b> Numerical examples are presented focusing on the influence of the non-Gaussian assumption on the variability of the buckling load, which is calculated by means of the Monte Carlo Simulation method. It is shown that the choice of the marginal probability distribution for the description of the material and thickness variability is crucial since it affects significantly the statistics of the buckling load of imperfection sensitive shell-type structures...|$|R
