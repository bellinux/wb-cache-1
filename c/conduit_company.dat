5000|$|While {{a variety}} of {{companies}} competed with Fiber <b>Conduit</b> <b>Company,</b> it was by {{far and away the}} largest producer of bitumenized fiber conduit piping throughout the early 20th century and demand for fiber conduit only increased during World War II with the need for electrical conduit for use in new airfields and military bases. In 1948, the name of the Fiber <b>Conduit</b> <b>Company</b> was changed to the Orangeburg Manufacturing Company. As World War II ended and gave rise to the post-war housing boom, the demand for cheap housing materials was at an all-time high and available drainage materials were scarce. Orangeburg Manufacturing produced a thicker-walled, sturdier, round version of fiber conduit, selling it as [...] "Orangeburg pipe" [...] for sewer and drain uses.|$|E
50|$|In 1893, Stephen Bradley, Sr. {{founded the}} Fiber <b>Conduit</b> <b>Company</b> in Orangeburg, New York. Bradley's {{neighboring}} Union Electric Company electric power plants used exhaust steam from their steam generators to dry the fiber conduit {{before they were}} sealed with pitch. In turn, the Fiber Conduit Company's conduits were used to run electrical wiring throughout numerous newly constructed buildings across {{the country for the}} next forty years. Bradley, along with several competitors, laid miles of the fiber electrical conduit in sky-scrapers, such as the Empire State Building.|$|E
5000|$|Orangeburg pipe (also {{known as}} [...] "fiber conduit", [...] "bituminous fiber pipe" [...] or [...] "Bermico") is bitumenized fiber pipe made from layers of wood pulp and pitch pressed together. It was used from the 1860s through the 1970s, {{when it was}} {{replaced}} by PVC pipe for water delivery and ABS pipe for drain-waste-vent (DWV) applications. The name comes from Orangeburg, New York, the town in which most Orangeburg pipe was manufactured. It was manufactured largely by the Fiber <b>Conduit</b> <b>Company,</b> which {{changed its name to}} the Orangeburg Manufacturing Company in 1948.|$|E

40|$|If {{interpreted}} in a strict legal sense, beneficial ownership rules in tax treaties {{would have no}} effect on <b>conduit</b> <b>companies</b> because companies at law own their property and income beneficially. Conversely, a company can never own anything in a substantive sense because economically a company {{is no more than a}} congeries of arrangements that represents the people behind it. Faced with these contradictory considerations, people have adopted surrogate tests that they attempt to employ in place of the treaty test of beneficial ownership. An example is that treaty benefits should be limited to companies that are both resident in the states that are parties to the treaty and that carry on substantive business activity. The test is inherently illogical. The origins of the substantive business activity test appear to lie in analogies drawn with straw company and base company cases. Because there is no necessary relationship between ownership and activity, the test of substantive business activity can never provide a coherent surrogate for the test of beneficial ownership.

Between 1895 and 1900, Hastings Pavement produced 10 million such blocks and shipped them throughout the United States and to cities in Canada, Brazil and England.

Labor strife between striking workers of the National Cable and <b>Conduit</b> <b>Company</b> in 1912 left four people dead. Two were striking workers; the remaining two were bystanders.

40|$|The fourth {{amendment}} to the Indonesian Income Tax Act (UU PPh) has inserted three new provisions encountering three newly-identified tax avoidance schemes. However, the previous regulations in respect of thin capitalization, CFC and interest stripping were not carefully be given attention and be made in conformity with their newest developments. As an illustration, the term “company” has never been defined in the Act. Instead, the Act introduces the same term in the <b>conduit</b> <b>company</b> rules. Another example involves the CFC rule which does not put additional provisions to define “control”. Another interesting development is the regulation of the International-hiring out of labor which instead of making it in conformity with the OECD MC, the rule empowers the country to increase the taxable income of an employee in respect of employment excercised abroad. This article attempts to demonstrate how the Indonesian anti-avoidance rules work out and prove how taxpayers may well, ironically, abuse those rules. </p...|$|E
40|$|Countries {{enter into}} double tax {{agreements}} with the economic objective of preventing double taxation of cross-border transactions. To achieve this objective, the contracting states agree reciprocally to restrict their substantive tax law. That is, a major policy of double tax agreements is to reduce double taxation of residents of states that are parties to the agreement. Residents of third states sometimes contrive to obtain treaty benefits typically by interposing a person or a conduit entity {{in one of the}} contracting states. In order to ensure that a resident of a contracting state who claims treaty benefits is entitled to them in substance, double tax agreements should be interpreted according to their substantive economic effect. Generally, double tax agreements follow the pattern of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD Model Convention addresses the double taxation of dividends, interest and royalties, commonly collectively known as "passive income", in Articles 10, 11 and 12 respectively. These provisions usually operate by reducing withholding tax imposed by a source state on passive income that flows from the source state to a resident state. In order to prevent a resident of a third state from obtaining a source state withholding tax reduction by interposing a person or a conduit entity in the resident state, the OECD Model Convention requires the immediate recipient of passive income to be the "beneficial owner" of that income. That is, the OECD Model Convention requires the immediate recipient to be an owner in a substantive economic sense. Courts and commentators have difficulty in interpreting and applying the concept of beneficial ownership to conduit entities that are corporations, commonly referred to as "conduit companies". They have attributed the cause of the difficulty to the absence of a definition of the term "beneficial owner" in the OECD Model Convention. This thesis argues that the difficulty in applying the beneficial ownership concept to conduit companies has arisen not because of the absence of the meaning of the concept, but because logically and from an economic perspective the concept cannot be applied to companies in general, not to conduit companies in particular. The beneficial ownership test {{was meant to be a}} test of economic substance. From an economic perspective, the benefit or the burden of a contract entered by a company is economically enjoyed or borne by its shareholders. That is, in substance a company cannot be considered as owning income beneficially. From this consideration, it follows that conduit companies can never be considered entitled to treaty benefits. Nevertheless, the OECD Model Convention applies the beneficial ownership test to conduit companies pursuant to an assumption that at least in some cases conduit companies can be the beneficial owners of passive income. The Model Convention's assumption is based on the legal perspective that courts conventionally adopt. According to this legal perspective, companies hold income beneficially because they exist as separate legal entities from their shareholders. Courts find themselves battling these opposing perspectives when applying the beneficial ownership test to conduit companies. In order to make income tax law work efficiently, courts that are obliged to determine whether to honour claims to treaty benefits made by conduit companies have preferred to employ the legal perspective. Courts have justified this approach by adopting surrogate tests for the actual beneficial ownership test. Most of the surrogate tests do not relate to the concept of ownership at all. This thesis categorises the surrogate tests as "substantive business activity" and "dominion". By analysing reported cases, the thesis identifies deficiencies in these tests. One of the proposed outcomes of the thesis is to suggest an alternative approach for deciding <b>conduit</b> <b>company</b> cases. The thesis suggests that courts should consider an arrangement as a whole and investigate reasons for the existence of an immediate recipient of passive income in the specific corporate structure. The thesis also recommends amendments in the official commentary on Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the OECD Model convention in order to address the conceptual shortcomings inherent in those Articles...|$|E

U. S.

For example, FCC officials expressed support for a federal requirement for evaluation of the feasibility and need for conduit during federal highway construction, and state and U. S. DOT officials expressed support for a federal role in facilitating discussion and best practice sharing among states implementing broadband deployment policies. ...|$|R

40|$|In early 2009, Shailesh Naik founded MatchMove, a Singapore-based online {{entertainment}} service provider. Naik and {{his business}} partner had identified {{a gap in the}} Asian online gaming market and their vision was to plug this gap with a company-specific platform that incorporated casual gaming, social networking and e-commerce capabilities. MatchMove signed up global technology giant Yahoo! as its first large client. The company also contracted with game developers to create its own store of quality games that it could offer to its clients. MatchMove’s key value proposition was to act as a <b>conduit</b> between game <b>companies</b> with a high content and low web traffic profile, as well as companies like Yahoo! and Microsoft with a high traffic and limited content profile. It eventually visualised itself as a closed e-commerce system to accept payments for services on its clients’ websites, as well as an open payments portal for all users for multiple merchants. By 2012, MatchMove had further ventured into ‘gamification’, a domain related to its core business. Fast-forwarding to January 2014, Naik sees an opportunity in the market to create the next technological disruption to e-commerce. His vision is that of an open network which taps into the current trend of catering to the ‘unbanked’ and ‘un-carded’. Will this work? Can he do it alone, or should he look for a partner? How should MatchMove evolve its business model to seize this next big opportunity? This case will take students through the various aspects of a business model, including a practical approach to designing the value proposition. The case may also be used to illustrate entrepreneurial traits and thinking in an entrepreneurship course, or in a course related to product development, innovation and/or business strategy, as it demonstrates how product development conceptualisation takes place hand in hand with strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) <b>conduits,</b> limited-purpose finance <b>companies,</b> structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network, which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the shadow banking system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks, shadow banks conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation, but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. The liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to the liquidity and capital shortfalls of shadow banks and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the shadow banking system or to traditional banks for the exposure to shadow banks. Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.
