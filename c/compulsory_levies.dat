40|$|Today, {{there are}} nine provincially legislated {{check-off}} programs in Saskatchewan. Check-off and research investment rates among these programs are typically low. Most check-off rates are below 0. 5 per cent {{of the value of}} the underlying commodity and agency research expenditures as a percentage {{of the value of the}} underlying commodity are, in most cases, less than 0. 1 per cent. Persistently low levels of investment combined with evidence from empirical studies suggest farmers chronically underinvest in crop research from a profit maximizing perspective. The refundable nature of Saskatchewan crop research check-offs may be one reason why farmers’ collective level of research investment has not increased in a material way. Of the nine provincially legislated crop check-off agencies, eight were established and continue to operate as Commissions which administer mandatory yet refundable check-offs. With refundable check-offs, producers may request and receive a full refund of their check-off contribution. It can be hypothesized that Commissions may set check-off rates below the optimal, farmer-profit-maximizing level to avoid excessive refund requests. Anecdotal evidence from the Saskatchewan Pulse Development Board and Australia’s Grains Research Development Corporation suggests that when check-offs are compulsory check-off rates are higher. Despite the apparent advantages of switching to <b>compulsory</b> <b>levies,</b> no Commission has attempted to switch. The findings of this thesis suggest Crop Development Commissions in Saskatchewan suffer from institutional lock-in which inhibits their ability to switch to non-refundable check-offs. Large set-up cost associated with establishing a Commission, coordination effects that occur both within a Commission and between Commissions, and the adaptive expectations of farmers and those directly involved with crop development check-offs have made the costs of switching from a Commission to a board prohibitively high. As a result, Commissions are entrenched and unable to adopt non-refundable check-offs...|$|E

40|$|The article aims {{to explain}} the redistributive {{character}} of taxes and social security contributions in Belgium, and to demonstrate the mechanisms behind that redistribution. Compared to the other EU- 15 countries, Belgium has less primary income inequality. Moreover, there is a relatively high degree of redistribution in Belgium, so that – after taxes, social benefits and social security contributions – the disparities are among the smallest in Europe. As in other countries, this income redistribution is effected primarily via social benefits. However, redistribution via taxation on income also plays a very important role. The most strongly redistributive tax in Belgium is personal income tax, which is highly progressive. That is due principally {{to the structure of}} the tax scales and the amount of the tax allowance, and to the reduction in taxes on replacement incomes. The influence of social security contributions on the redistribution of income is relatively slight, although it is greater than in the majority of the EU- 15 countries. VAT, which accounts for the bulk of indirect taxes, is slightly progressive in relation to expenditure, owing to the rate structure whereby the reduced rate and the zero rate apply to goods and services which are consumed to a proportionally greater extent by low-income households. Conversely, in relation to disposable income, VAT is degressive. That is because the savings ratio increases with each income decile. Excise duties are degressive, in relation to both household spending and household income. This study also illustrates the fact that tax measures are seldom neutral in their effect on income redistribution. However, this effect is clearly dependent on the practical aspects of this type of measures. The personal income tax reform approved in 2001 and the introduction of the work bonus increased the progressive effect of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>levies</b> on earned income and reduced the average rate of the levy. While the impact of increases in excise duties on fuel is more mixed in terms of redistribution, the recent increases in excise duty on tobacco have accentuated their degressive character. taxes and social contributions, income distribution, redistributive effects...|$|E
40|$|In 2001, $ 13 million were {{invested}} in various grape and wine R&D programs via the Australian Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Half {{of the funds}} come from <b>compulsory</b> <b>levies</b> from grape-growers and winemakers, {{and the other half}} from Commonwealth government matching grants. These funds are then allocated to research projects across broad areas such as grape production R&D, wine production R&D and grape and wine quality R&D. The benefit of R&D in one sector of an industry will be distributed across the production and consumption chain. On the other hand, when a levy is charged nominally to one producer group, the real burden of the cost will also be shared among all involved producer and consumer groups. In the case of the Australian grape and wine R&D investments, the net impact will be determined by the distribution of the benefits and costs across grape-growers, winemakers, marketers and retailers, and domestic and overseas consumers. In an ideal situation, if every dollar is invested at exactly the point where it is collected, the percentage distributions of costs and returns coincide. Under this system, presuming R&D projects are successful, all groups will gain in dollar terms, and they will receive benefits in exactly the same proportions as how the burdens of the R&D costs are shared. However, the distributions of costs and benefits will diverge if a levy collected at one point of the production is used to fund research at a different point of the chain. Indeed, in practice, producers often pool levies together to fund R&D programs at places that are not necessarily where the funds are raised. A significant amount of public funds are also {{invested in}} Australian agricultural industries that substantially involve foreign processors and consumers. In these situations {{it is important to note}} the real incidence of both costs and benefits. The objective of the paper is to examine the distributions of both costs and returns from the Australian grape and wine R&D investments, using results from a multi-sectoral equilibrium displacement model of the industry. The real shares of total R&D costs are estimated and compared with the nominal shares. Divergence between the distributions of costs and benefits is also studied for the three major areas of R&D. Grape-growers, winemakers and overseas consumers are shown to receive bigger proportions of the gains than their proportions of costs, but the Government and other domestic parties as a group bear a much higher proportion of costs than returns. The paper discusses implications of the results to the equity issue between premium and non-premium wine producers, the free-rider issue for overseas consumers, and the issue of justifying government funding of grape and wine R&D.
