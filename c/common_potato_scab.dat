40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> affects potato farmers {{worldwide}} and costs the Tasmanian potato farming industry approximately 5 {{million dollars a}} year. The disease is caused in white potatoes by the common soil bacterium streptomyces scabies, from which several secondary metabolites have been isolated; these are known as the thaxtomin class of phytotoxins. These compounds {{have been shown to}} cause scabs in potatoes in sterile conditions and are phytotoxic to cellulose based plants. Several approaches to the total synthesis of the thaxtomins have been investigated. The most successful proceeds via the synthesis of 4 -nitrotryptophan, followed by peptide coupling and cyclisation to give two of the three dehydroxy-thaxtomins. Other routes starting from glycine anhydride using condensation chemistry to build the three ring system have provided a series of analogues for structure activity testing. Toxicity of the analogues and synthetic thaxtomins has been analysed using Arabidopsis thaliana. Two analogues showed activity approaching thaxtomin A and show promise as potential new herbicides. Non-toxic analogues have been tested for their ability to ameliorate or negate the effects of thaxtomin A using a variety of models. These compounds provide a possible solution to the scab problem. Current methods for the synthesis of the pyrrolidine antibiotic anisomycin are complicated and rely on the preparation of a 3 -pyrroline intermediate. Two novel methods to target this advanced intermediate are discussed, firstly use of a Zn/HCI reduction of a a-ketopyrrole, and secondly the reduction of N-tosyl pyrroles with TFA/NaCNBH 3. The use of N-toysl protected 3 -pyrrolines as building blocks towards hydroxyl substituted pyrrolidines is also explored. Synthesis of gram quantities of the C 19 and C 21 triene sex pheromones of the autumn gum moth (Mnesampe/a private) has proved difficult because of the tendency of the trienes to decompose through auto oxidation. We present an approach to the synthesis of these compounds by spiking the starting material with the antioxidant BHT and carrying it through the reaction scheme.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> is {{a disease}} that results in a lower quality of potato tubers. Streptomyces scabies, a soil-borne actinomycete, is {{considered}} to be the principal causal agent of common scab. Pathogenicity of Streptomyces scabies appears to be positively correlated with thaxtomins production. Thaxtomins are a group of phytotoxins, first isolated by King's research group in 1989 from scab lesions on potato tubers. Thaxtomin A is the main thaxtomin produced by Streptomyces scabies. This pathogen was found to produce thaxtomin A in culture media containing potato suberin. Suberin is a specific plant cell wall polymer composed of polyaliphatic and polyphenolic domains. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify a suberin constituent that is responsible for the induction of thaxtomin A production in Streptomyces scabies. In Chapter 1, we first compared thaxtomin A production in culture media supplemented with different concentrations of suberin. This allowed us to determine the optimal concentration of suberin for thaxtomin A production. We found that the addition of 0. 2 % suberin in Streptomyces scabies minimal medium allowed a maximal production of thaxtomin A. We also developed a protocol to extract thaxtomin A from sandy soil. The method was especially efficient when thaxtomin A exceeded 100 [micro]g/ 10 g. Using this method, we were able to extract thaxtomin A from a sandy soil amended with suberin and inoculated with Streptomyces scabies spores or mycelium. In Chapter II, we determined thaxtomin A production in Streptomyces scabies culture medium containing the chemical degradation products of suberin. The aliphatic portion of suberin was obtained by the BF[indice inférieur 3]-methanol depolymerization method, whereas the phenolic portion was recovered by alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation (NBO). There was no thaxtomin A production in medium supplemented with the aliphatic portion of suberin. It was not possible to determine the effect of the phenolic portion on thaxtomin A production because this chemical fraction inhibited Streptomyces scabies growth...|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{ammonium}} sulphate (+ SO 4) fertilizer {{as a method}} of controlling <b>potato</b> <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> varies from field to field and from year to year. We examined the influence of two fertilizer regimes on the biodiversity and antibiosis activity (in vitro) of culturable rhizobacterial populations recovered from fields with a similar history of <b>potato</b> <b>common</b> <b>scab.</b> Root zone soils treated with + SO 4 fertilizers were colonized by significantly (P = 0. 05) more species-diverse communities of bacteria than those managed with ammonium nitrate fertilizers (+NO 3) In bioassays conducted on artificial media adjusted to pH 4. 9 (acid) or pH 6. 8 (base), in vitro antibiosis in bacterial strains against Streptomyces scabies was found to be dependent on fertilizer regime (P = 0. 023), with more isolates with antibiosis ability being recovered from + SO 4 compared to +NO 3 treated soils. Overall, bacterial species from the genera Bacillus (18 - 35 %) and Pseudomonas (15 - 18 %) were major components of those rhizoflora communities antagonistic to S. scabies. Under our field conditions, soil acidification with + SO 4 treatments stimulated the development of rhizobacterial communities that generated secondary metabolites with (in vitro) antibiosis ability, against S. scabies. This occurred both in the liquid and vapour phase (volatile gases); the latter most notably by Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Pseudomonas chlororaphis. We postulate that in hot, dry seasons, antibiosis against S. scabies mediated by +SO 4 treatments, and the competitive bacterial communities they engender, would be less effective in controlling <b>potato</b> <b>common</b> <b>scab,</b> as the active moieties would be rapidly volatilized into the atmosphere. In contrast, biocontrol would be more effective in wetter seasons, the active moieties being retained, in and around the potato root zone for greater biologically significant periods of time.

The purpose of this review is twofold:- firstly drawing attention to the beneficial and deleterious aspects of irrigation resulting from interactions with the microbial world; secondly, forming a basis for encouraging further research and development. Irrigation is for example, a valuable component in the control of some soil borne pathogens such as Streptomyces scabies, the cause of <b>potato</b> <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> and Fusarium cubense, a cause of banana wilt.

40|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> is an {{economically}} important crop disease that {{is characterized by}} the formation of superficial, raised or pitted lesions on the potato tuber surface. The most widely distributed causative agent of the disease is Streptomyces scabies, which produces the phytotoxic secondary metabolite thaxtomin A that serves as a key virulence factor for the organism. Recently, it was demonstrated that S. scabies can also produce the phytotoxic secondary metabolite coronafacoyl-L-isoleucine (CFA-L-Ile) as well as other related metabolites in minor amounts. The expression of the biosynthetic genes for CFA-L-Ile production is dependent on a PAS-LuxR family transcriptional regulator, CfaR, which is encoded within the phytotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. scabies. In this study, we show that CfaR activates coronafacoyl phytotoxin production by binding to a single site located immediately upstream of the putative - 35 hexanucleotide box within the promoter region for the biosynthetic genes. The binding activity of CfaR was shown to require both the LuxR and PAS domains, the latter of which is involved in protein homodimer formation. We also show that CFA-L-Ile production is greatly enhanced in S. scabies by overexpression of both cfaR and a downstream co-transcribed gene, orf 1. Our results provide important insight into the regulation of coronafacoyl phytotoxin production, which is thought to contribute to the virulence phenotype of S. scabies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that CfaR is a novel member of the PAS-LuxR family of regulators, members of which are widely distributed among actinomycete bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Evidence for the {{horizontal}} transfer of a pathogenicity island (PAI) carrying the virulence gene nec 1 and flanking sequences among Streptomyces strains in the Diastatochromogenes cluster is presented. Plant-pathogenic, thaxtomin-producing Streptomyces strains, previously classified as S. scabiei {{based on the}} conventionally used phenotypic characteristics, {{were found to be}} genetically distinct from the type strain of S. scabiei based on DNA relatedness and 16 S rDNA sequence analysis. Pairwise DNA-DNA hybridizations between some of these strains and the S. scabiei type strain were as low as 36 %, a value much below what is conventionally accepted for species identity (70 %). The sequence of the nec 1 gene, however, was identical in all the S. scabiei and S. scabiei-like strains tested, irrespective of their DNA relatedness to the type strain of S. scabiei, their geographic origin, or the isolation host. Furthermore, a 26 -kb DNA fragment including and flanking nec 1 was also conserved among these strains based on restriction and Southern analyses. These data indicate that the etiology of <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> is more complex than previously recognized; this result has important implications for <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> management strategies. Previous research has suggested that horizontal transfer of a PAI was the mechanism for evolution of pathogenicity in S. acidiscabies and S. turgidiscabies, species that lie outside of the Diastatochromogenes cluster. Data presented here support this model and indicate that PAI transfer also has occurred frequently in species closely related to S. scabiei...|$|R
40|$|Streptomyces roseoflavus Men-myco- 93 - 63 was {{isolated}} from <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> (S. scabies) decline soil as an antagonistic strain, which can effectively inhibit several phytopathogenic fungi and control important related plant diseases. In this study, cosynthesis and different expression protein analysis between seven antibiotic synthesized-blocked mutants of Men-myco- 93 - 63 were carried out. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis {{was used to}} compare proteins of cosynthesis and non-cosynthesis mutants. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, two different protein spots were isolated and identified to be homologous proteins of ectoine hydroxylase and transcriptional regulator (DeoR family protein), which could be related to the biosynthesis of antibiotics of S. roseoflavus Men-myco- 93 - 63...|$|R

40|$|Field and {{glasshouse}} {{trials were}} performed in 2000 and 2001 to estimate total polyphenol contents in 15 potato cultivars from two sites that differed {{in the level}} of scab incidence. Polyphenol content was determined spectrophotometrically by Folin-Ciocalteau reagent at a wavelength 765 nm in tuber peelings of cultivars less and more susceptible to common scab. The polyphenol content of tuber peeling was influenced by cultivar, site, year and age of tuber periderm and was not influenced by maturity. The highest polyphenol content was observed in potato cultivars less susceptible to the scab. Regression analysis showed that negative relation occurs between polyphenol content and <b>potato</b> <b>scab</b> incidence (P= 0, 006). The polyphenol content significantly decreased during vegetative period...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the sweet}} potato is not closely related botanically to the <b>common</b> <b>potato,</b> {{they have a}} shared etymology. The first Europeans to taste sweet {{potatoes}} were members of Christopher Columbus's expedition in 1492. Later explorers found many cultivars under an assortment of local names, but the name which stayed was the indigenous Taino name of batata. The Spanish combined this with the Quechua word for potato, papa, to create the word patata for the <b>common</b> <b>potato.</b>|$|R
