MLB umpires filed a grievance against MLB attempting to block them from being sent to umpire the game in Cuba, and refused to officiate the game in Baltimore. Rafael Palmeiro, an Oriole player of Cuban descent, also opposed the series and did not make the trip to Cuba.

The <b>Cuban</b> <b>American</b> <b>National</b> <b>Foundation</b> (CANF) states that should Cuba {{choose not to}} purchase from the U.S., it can purchase any medicine or medical equipment it needs from other countries. Such third-country transactions only cost an estimated 2%–3% more than purchases from the U.S. {{as a result of}} higher shipping costs. CANF also asserts the United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Cuba and much of this consists of medicines and medical equipment.|$|E

From the amendment's repeal in 1985 to 1992 the U.S. {{government}} gave Savimbi $60million per year, a total of $420million. A sizable amount of the aid went to Savimbi's personal expenses. Black, Manafort filed foreign lobbying records with the U.S. Justice Department showing Savimbi's expenses during his U.S. visits. During his December 1990 visit he spent $136,424 at the Park Hyatt hotel and $2,705 in tips. He spent almost $473,000 in October 1991 during his week-long visit to Washington and Manhattan. He spent $98,022 in hotel bills, at the Park Hyatt, $26,709 in limousine rides in Washington and another $5,293 in Manhattan. Paul Manafort, a partner in the firm, charged Savimbi $19,300 in consulting and additional $1,712 in expenses. He also bought $1,143 worth of [...] "survival kits" [...] from Motorola. When questioned in an interview in 1990 about human rights abuses under Savimbi, Black said, [...] "Now when you're in a war, trying to manage a war, when the enemy... is no more than a couple of hours away from you at any given time, you might not run your territory according to New Hampshire town meeting rules." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{favourable}} {{trade from}} the Soviet bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a [...] "Special Period in Time of Peace". Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began {{being used for}} cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might {{have to resort to}} subsistence farming. By 1992, Cuba's economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods. Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism–Leninism in the USSR, but refrained from backing the 1991 coup in that country. When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991. In December, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved as Boris Yeltsin abolished the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and introducing a capitalist multiparty democracy. Yeltsin despised Castro and developed links with the Miami-based <b>Cuban</b> <b>American</b> <b>National</b> <b>Foundation.</b> Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. He welcomed Western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended Manuel Fraga and took a particular interest in Margaret Thatcher's policies in the UK, believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative. He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising FARC on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the Zapatistas and Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.|$|E

[...] During the visit, Trump was met with supporters touting [...] "Trump 2000" [...] posters and shouting [...] "Viva Donald Trump!" [...] There, he delivered his first foreign policy speech, capped with the line, [...] "I'd have, personally, two words for : 'Adios, amigo!'" [...] Covering the event, columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that the fascination with Trump was the [...] "apotheosis of our Gilded Age," [...] where [...] "money, celebrity, polling, and crass behavior" [...] warp politics and the television show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire dominates the culture. [...] Following this theme, Saturday Night Live performed a sketch in which Darrell Hammond reprised his role as Trump, holding a press conference announcing Millionaire winner John Carpenter as his running mate. [...] Soon thereafter, the actual Trump floated possible running mates and members of his presidential cabinet during a November 28 episode of Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. He identified Senator John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, as a possible Secretary of Defense. [...] Trump said he would consider Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and mentioned retired General Colin Powell as a possible Secretary of State. [...] He praised General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and discussed him as either Secretary of Treasury or running mate. [...] He again mentioned Oprah Winfrey as a possible running mate. [...] During the interview, Trump expressed his willingness to spend $100 million to self-finance a full-scale campaign. [...] The Reform Party scheduled a debate of the candidates seeking the presidential nomination on December 3 in Portland, Oregon. [...] When a reporter asked a Trump aide whether Trump would appear, the aide {{was unaware of the}} debate. [...] Ultimately, Buchanan attended but Trump did not.|$|E

Kidney damage is defined as {{pathologic}} abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging tests. The staging of CKD according to GFR (ml/min/ 1.73  m 2) is as follows: Stage 1 —kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (GFR ≥ 90); Stage 2 —kidney damage with a mildly decreased GFR (GFR[*]=[*] 60 – 89); Stage 3 —moderate reduction in GFR (GFR[*]=[*] 30 – 59); Stage 4 —severe reduction in GFR (GFR[*]=[*] 15 – 29); and Stage 5 —kidney failure (GFR < 15 or dialysis) (<b>American</b> <b>National</b> Kidney <b>Foundation</b> 2002).
