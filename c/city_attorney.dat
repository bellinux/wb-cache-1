The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the <b>City</b> <b>Attorney</b> argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The <b>City</b> <b>Attorney</b> also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E
