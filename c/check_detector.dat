The work presented within this manuscript can be split in two different parts aiming to a common goal: reduce possible bias and systematic errors to provide a first precise W boson mass measurement at the LHC. On a technical aspect, an analysis has been done on the liquid argon in which lies calorimeters, in order to understand temperature fluctuation and quantify its effect on the electron energy scale. On the other hand, attention has been focused on polarization effects, by developing and proposing three new measurements : quantification of their influence on MW measurement at the LHC, helicity fractions measurement in 2010 data and a charge asymmetry measurement that decouples PDF and polarization effects, on 2010 data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To measure Qβs of neutron-rich nuclei {{far from}} the stability, the total-absorption-type Ge {{detector}} has been developed. The detector is composed of a large true-coaxial type HPGe detector and an annular BGO scintillation detector for the Compton suppression. To <b>check</b> the <b>detector</b> performance, nineteen nuclides having precisely measured Qβs are measured. The nuclei of interest were prepared by (n, γ) reactions and 235 U(n,f) reactions using the Kyoto University Reactor (KUR). The response functions of γ-rays and monoenergetic electrons were calculated {{by means of the}} Monte Carlo simulation code (EGS 4), and the folding method was used to deduce Qβs. The nuclei 147 − 149 La, 151 Ce, and 153 Pr, for which precise information of the decay schemes were not reported, were prepared by the on-line mass separator (KUR-ISOL) and were measured by the total-absorption type Ge detector. The deduced Qβs were consistent with preliminarily measured ones by a total absorption BGO detector. The evaluated values by Audi et al. were systematically smaller than the present ones. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of two caries detector dyes in the diagnosis of dental caries. Materials and Methods: Twenty extracted human posterior teeth without pulpal exposure were sectioned mesiodistally through the center of the lesions using a water-cooled disk. The tooth halves were randomly divided into two groups and treated with Caries Detector (CD) and Caries <b>Check</b> (CC) <b>detector</b> dyes. Access cavities were prepared followed by caries removal and dye application. All cavities were arbitrarily divided into two right and left sections and excavation of the stained areas was performed on the left parts, while the right sections remained untouched. Bacterial penetration into dentinal tubules was evaluated using Gram-stained decalcified sections under light microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of both dyes were calculated. Results: The sensitivity of CD and CC were 74 % and 71 %, respectively. The specificity obtained for both dyes was 100 %. Conclusion: Considering the low sensitivity of the dyes evaluated in the present study, it seems that they may not be reliable when used as the sole diagnostic technique for detection of carious lesions in posterior teeth...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{phenomena}} constitute one of {{the most}} complex and serious potential problems which could limit, or severely impair, the use of gaseous detectors in unprecedented harsh radiation environments. Long-term operation in high-intensity experiments of the LHC-era not only demands extraordinary radiation hardness of construction materials and gas mixtures but also very specific and appropriate assembly procedures and quality <b>checks</b> during <b>detector</b> construction and testing. Recent experimental data from hadron beams is discussed. It is shown that the initial stage of radiation tests, usually performed under isolated laboratory conditions, may not offer the full information needed to extrapolate to the long-term performance of real and full-size detectors at high energy physics facilities. Major factors, closely related to the capability of operating at large localized ionization densities, and which could lead to operation instabilities and subsequent aging phenomena in gaseous detectors, are summarized. Finally, an overview of aging experience with state-of-the-art gas detectors in experiments with low- and high-intensity radiation environments is given with a goal of providing a set of rules, along with some caveat, for the construction and operation of gaseous detectors in high luminosity experiments. 1...|$|R
