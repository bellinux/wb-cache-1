First, we design the evaluation index system, determine the subjective weights {{of the various}} technical indicators of the ticketing system with Fuzzy evaluation method, determine the index weight with the Entropy method, and analyze important factors affecting the system operation according to the health evaluation results of the ticketing system over the years...|$|E

As more and more peoples are going to be connected through the general network (INTERNET), the problem of security arises. Now a day, a number of security issues occur in networks which include Sniffing, Spoofing, Security Attacks, Malwares, Unauthorized Access, etc. This will create havoc for the users, who wants {{to communicate with each other}} through these networks. So, to make the communication between two users via the Computer Networks, we have to follow some securit...|$|R
