500|$|The Xbox {{version has}} {{competitive}} multiplayer {{for up to}} 16 players online, although system link is not possible. The PlayStation 2 version does not offer any online connectivity and competitive multiplayer is limited to two players (or four players while using an optional multitap device) via split screen gameplay. In multiplayer matches, the players <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Silver Bullet", [...] "Mystic Armor and [...] "Blood Frenzy" [...] powers as floating power-ups that activate immediately. The game's story mode is also available for split screen cooperative gameplay on the PlayStation 2, a feature absent from the Xbox version. In the co-op mode, both players play as a rank-and-file Darkwatch Regulators but cutscenes designed for the single-player mode and featuring Jericho Cross as the main character are left unchanged, causing a number of glaring continuity errors.|$|E
500|$|Differences {{were made}} between the {{original}} webisodes and the first episodes of the season. One example is the introduction of Druitt. In the webisodes, Druitt murders a prostitute after arriving in Old City, but in the pilot, writer Damian Kindler included dialogue between the two characters before Druitt murders her, {{as a way of}} proving to the audience how evil he is. Another is the ending of [...] "Fata Morgana", where the Morrígan leave the Sanctuary with the Cabal mercenaries; in the webisodes, the sisters escape. Druitt directly tells Ashley in one of the first webisodes that he is her father. In the first season, the producers decided that she would not be aware of this until midway through, and even then, they did not want Druitt to tell her directly, but rather hint it to her, so that Ashley <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pieces herself.|$|E

500|$|When hurricanes surge upon shore {{from the}} ocean, salt is {{introduced}} to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels {{too high for}} some habitats to withstand. Some are {{able to cope with}} the salt and recycle it back into the ocean, but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it. Because of this, some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt. In addition, hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall. The flood water <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over. [...] The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area, as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.|$|E

Ginsburg began, [...] "In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.... Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least {{when there is a}} 'less restrictive alternative.' And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tab." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 5 out of 10, arguing of the trust/fear system [...] "it {{is nowhere near}} {{as much of a}} neat {{gameplay}} innovation as the hype had some people believe [...] As a squad based game it would work far better if you ever had to care a great deal for anyone's survival. As it is, most of the team seem to split off once a level's over (or turn into aliens at pre-determined moments during it), so you're left merely using each NPC as a means of progression." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, which he argued [...] "look old school, with bad texturing, uninteresting particle effects, and vanilla architecture." [...] He concluded [...] "if you <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>The</b> Thing cheap you won't be too disappointed; it's by no means a bad game, but it's all the more disappointing thanks {{to the fact that it}} could and should have been brilliant." ...|$|E

'Well!' the young man said to himself, 'if the old fellow has many daughters like that I should not mind being his son-in-law. This one is just what I admire'; and he watched her lay the table, bring in the food, and take her seat by the fire as if she had never noticed that a strange man was present. Then she took out a needle and thread, and began to darn her stockings. The master sat at table alone, and invited neither his new servant nor the maid to eat with him. Neither was the old grandmother anywhere to be seen. His appetite was tremendous: he soon cleared all the dishes, and ate enough to satisfy a dozen men. When at last he could eat no more he said to the girl, 'Now you <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pieces, and take what is left in the iron pot for your own dinner, but give the bones to the dog.' ...|$|E

He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station, where he <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> train. He is a very good swordsman, and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it. But I can fence well too, and I think I can keep him in play, at any rate, until the train is lost. Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings. You understand? Very well then, let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine," [...] and leading them quickly across the parade, he presented them to the Marquis's seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not previously heard.|$|E

You can climb up that trellis, Thomas, and lift up that window-sash very carefully, so's not to make no noise, and get in. Then you'll be in a back room, with a door right in front of you which opens into Mr. and Mrs. Green's bedroom. There's always a little night lamp burning in it, by which you can see to get about. In the corner, on your right as you go into the room, is a table with my instrument-box standing on it. The box is pretty heavy, and there is a handle on top to carry it by. You needn't be afraid to go in, for by this time they are both sound asleep, and you <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> box and walk out as gingerly as a cat, having of course taken your shoes off before you went in.

60|$|This lover, we read, though “wonderfully similar” to her “in {{powers and}} capacity,” was “infinitely {{superior}} {{to her in}} faith and development,” and she saw in him “‘Agape’—so rare to find—of which she had read and admired the meaning in her Greek Testament; having, from her great facility in learning languages, read the Scriptures in their original tongues.” Of course! Greek and Hebrew are mere play to a heroine; Sanscrit {{is no more than}} a b c to her; and she can talk with perfect correctness in any language, except English. She is a polking polyglot, a Creuzer in crinoline. Poor men. There are so few of you who know even Hebrew; you think it something to boast of if, like Bolingbroke, you only “understand that sort of learning and what is writ about it;” and you are perhaps adoring women who can think slightingly of you in all the Semitic languages successively. But, then, as we are almost invariably told that a heroine has a “beautifully small head,” and as her intellect has probably been early invigorated by an attention to costume and deportment, we may conclude that she <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Oriental tongues, to say nothing of their dialects, with the same aërial facility that the butterfly sips nectar. Besides, there can be no difficulty in conceiving the depth of the heroine’s erudition when that of the authoress is so evident.|$|E

This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. 'Lady with a black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass. 'Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant. 'If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me. 'Every day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this: 'Be patient.

It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger. If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible." ...|$|E
