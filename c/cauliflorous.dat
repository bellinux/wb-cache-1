5000|$|Ficus sur, {{with the}} common names Cape fig and broom cluster fig, is a {{widespread}} Afrotropical species of <b>cauliflorous</b> fig.|$|E
5000|$|Inflorescences in racemiform, paniculate or thyrse with partial inflorescences in a capituliform cyme or pseudo-umbel, multifloral, rarely {{single or}} paired flowers, {{axillary}} or on sharp branches or <b>cauliflorous</b> trunks, females frequently less branched.|$|E
50|$|The {{range is}} from Townsville to the Iron Range from sea level to altitudes of 1200 m, with <b>cauliflorous</b> forms more common at higher {{elevations}} and ramiflorous at lower elevations. It {{is found in}} rainforest.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} not {{particularly}} palatable to humans. The southern cassowary eats the fruit and flowers. The odoriferous black ant (Anonychomyrma gilberti) makes extensive tunnels in the <b>cauliflorous</b> form, particularly at the bumps where flowers grow.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is found}} in {{tropical}} forests and grassy woodlands, and occurs in higher densities within well-watered, temperate upland habitats. [...] It is absent or outnumbered at lower, warmer climates by the similarly <b>cauliflorous</b> species, Ficus sycomorus. In cooler climates it is a coastal tree, and in warmer interior climates may be found up to 2500 m in elevation.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} members of the genus, A. lucyi {{produces}} large pinnate leaves. The species is <b>cauliflorous,</b> producing flowers directly from the trunk. The cream coloured filaments are 3-5 cm long and form the showiest part of the flowers. The flowers are followed by highly conspicuous red or orange seed pods, which split open when ripe to reveal black seeds.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that the <b>cauliflorous</b> species are pollinated by small bees, beetles or flies {{although}} there are no direct observations of this. Birds disperse the purple or black drupes, for example Sayornis phoebe (a Tyrant flycatcher) eats the fruit of Cocculus. In Tinospora cordifolia a lapse of 6-8 weeks has been observed between fertilization and the first zygotic cell division.|$|E
50|$|They {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, growing to 5-15 m tall. The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, broad lanceolate, very large, up to 1 m long, with an entire or waved margin. The flowers are creamy white to yellow, with four petals; they are <b>cauliflorous,</b> produced in clusters {{on the trunk}} and stouter branches. The fruit is 6-15 cm long, with a fleshy coat; it is edible in several species.|$|E
50|$|Cynometra cauliflora, {{known in}} Indonesia (Maluku and Manado) as namu-namu (due to the flattened, {{crescent}} shaped pods, which look {{similar to the}} Indonesian pastry, namu-namu), Ternate namo-namo, this tree {{is a native of}} Malaysia, found mainly in northern Peninsular Malaysia. A member of the family Fabaceae (legumes), it is a small, <b>cauliflorous</b> tree with a thick, heavily branched stem, and rather small flowers, about 1.2 cm across, that appear on the stem in clusters.|$|E
5000|$|The Knobbly fig (Ficus sansibarica) is an African {{species of}} <b>cauliflorous</b> fig. It {{is named after}} Zanzibar, where Franz Stuhlmann {{discovered}} it in 1889. They regularly reach 10 m, but may grow up to 40 m tall as forest stranglers. It occurs in the tropics and subtropics from coastal elevations to 900 m above sea level. They prefer deep sandy soil and often start life as a strangler. The pollinating wasp is Courtella armata.|$|E
50|$|The tree is a slow-growing {{evergreen}} {{that can}} reach {{a height of}} 15 meters if not pruned. It has salmon-colored leaves when they are young, which turn green as they mature. The tree prefers moist, rich, lightly acidic soil. It is widely adaptable, however, and grows satisfactorily even on alkaline beach-sand type soils, {{so long as they}} are tended and irrigated. Its flowers are white and grow directly from its trunk in a <b>cauliflorous</b> habit. In an uncultivated state, the tree may flower and fruit only once or twice a year, but when continuously irrigated it flowers frequently, and fresh fruit can be available year round in tropical regions.|$|E
50|$|D.falcata bears grey barks, thick coriaceous leaves {{variable}} in shape with stout flowers (Wealth of India. 2002). The flowering inflorescences in D.falcata was previously {{referred to as}} axillary or as one developing on the scars of fallen leaves, but Y.P.S Pundir (1996) verified it to be of strictly <b>cauliflorous</b> nature and also notified that it shares fundamental similarity to that of Ficus glomerata, F. pomifera and F. hispida. Two of its varieties are widespread in India namely, var. falcata (honey suckled mistletoe) and var. coccinea (red honey suckled mistletoe) distinguished by occurrence of white and red flowering, respectively (Flowers of India). To date, D.falcata represents the only known mistletoe with the largest global host range (Calvin and Wilson, 2009) which is continuously and rapidly widening.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{commonly}} borne in definite or indefinite axillary inflorescences, {{which are often}} reduced to a single flower, but may also be <b>cauliflorous,</b> oppositifolious, or terminal. They often bear supernumerary bracts. They can be unisexual or bisexual, and are generally actinomorphic, often associated with conspicuous bracts, forming an epicalyx. They generally have five valvate sepals, most frequently basally connate, with five imbricate petals. The stamens are five to numerous, and connate at least at their bases, but often forming a tube around the pistils. The pistils are composed of two to many connate carpels. The ovary is superior, with axial placentation, with capitate or lobed stigma. The flowers have nectaries made of many tightly packed glandular hairs, usually positioned on the sepals.|$|E
50|$|Tall {{evergreen}} {{trees with}} smooth greyish white bark, flaking in mature trees, with straight boles, frequently buttressed. The branches are horizontal often with series of knob-like tubercles (for <b>cauliflorous</b> attachment {{of flowers and}} fruits). The young branchlets and the underside of leaves are covered by golden brown peltate scales. Leaves are simple, alternate, glabrous, shiny green above and covered beneath with silvery or orangish peltate scales. The tubular, hermaphroditic flowers (also covered by golden brown scales) are about 4-5 cm long and cream or pinkish brown in colour. The flowers lack petals and are formed of tubular bracteoles and tube-like calyx, obscurely 5-lobed. The round fruits, about 10-13 cm in diameter and covered with spines, are clustered along the branches. The fruit is a capsule, 5-valved, containing many reddish brown seeds about 4-5 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. In the fruit, the seeds are covered by a fleshy, whitish aril. The fruit dehisces open when mature and dry to release seeds.|$|E

Some species abundant along the public walking tracks, often noticed and photographed by tourists, are as follows. The bright orange seasonally fruiting, small shrubs of chain fruits Alyxia ruscifolia and hairy red pittosporum Pittosporum rubiginosum occur commonly along the tracks. Many vine species grow up to the canopy, including the well known and conspicuous wait-a-while or rattan palm-vines Calamus australis and more related spp.. Many epiphytes grow on the trees’ branches and trunks, including the often noticed ferns, the birds-nest ferns Asplenium australasicum, basket ferns Drynaria rigidula and elkhorn ferns Platycerium hillii; large epiphyte and hemiepiphyte trees and shrubs, including commonly the many strangler figs Ficus spp., umbrella trees Schefflera actinophylla and the cape jitta Fagraea berteroana. Locally abundant and conspicuous large trees include the Daintree penda Lindsayomyrtus racemoides with wet season purple new foliage growth, abundant <b>cauliflorous</b> trees that have flowers and fruits on the trunk, for example, the cluster figs species Ficus spp. and the yellow mahogany trees Dysoxylum parasiticum.

30|$|In {{dioecious}} species, {{the necessity}} to maintain the pollinator biological cycle (Kjellberg et al. 1987) with a constant supply of figs shapes the spatial and temporal distributions of the figs over an individual male tree. The general pattern of <b>cauliflorous</b> male fig production in F. benguetensis (spring and autumn production peaks and higher male fig production) is consistent with that in other dioecious Ficus in Taiwan (Bain et al. 2014) or the Asian continent (Yu et al. 2006). Our analysis reveals several mechanisms maximizing the chances of survival of pollinating wasps despite their estimated lifespan of 12  h to 3  days (Dunn et al. 2008). As predicted, male trees optimize the survival of their obligate pollinators by maximizing the probability of fig localization. Investing most of the male fig production in cauliflory, a common strategy for tropical fig species (Berg and Corner 2005), allows retrieving {{a part of the}} nutrients invested in the fruits (Harrison and Yamamura 2003) and offers various selective advantages for male fig trees and insects. Heavy rains often result in most of the produced figs falling on the ground or remaining unpollinated (Lin S-Y, National Taiwan University, Taiwan, unpubl. res.). The foliar crown of a fig tree may protect its <b>cauliflorous</b> crops by shielding them from violent rainstorms. Additionally, the pollinators of dioecious fig trees seem to favour dispersal at short distances and through the understorey (Harrison and Rasplus 2006). Because pollinating fig wasps are sensitive to desiccation (Dunn et al. 2008) flying under the canopy could ensures higher survival rates for the following reasons. First, the understorey environment is more humid and has reduced thermal amplitude (Lebrija-trejos et al. 2011). Second, the <b>cauliflorous</b> figs of male trees are most abundant in the understorey; hence, {{they are more likely to}} be discovered by pollinating fig wasps. Third, because male trees are relatively more abundant than female trees, the flying distance between two male figs is often shorter than between a male fig and a female fig. Our sampling biased toward male trees could simply reflect a general trend observed in F. benguetensis and other dioecious Ficus trees in Taiwan: 352 observed F. benguetensis on Taiwan Island, 70 males, 47 females and 235 unidentified individuals (Bain A, National Taiwan University, Taiwan, unpubl. res.). Finally, intratree and intertree asynchronies maximize an extensive availability of receptive figs for pollinators. The relationship between intratree and intertree asynchronies for various densities of F. benguetensis populations or other fig species should be explored. We hypothesize both a higher intratree asynchrony [fig trees simultaneously presenting the fig receptive stages (B) and wasp-releasing stages (D)] and a male-biased sex ratio in pioneer Ficus populations (isolated trees or sparsely distributed fig populations) that perpetuate pollinator populations (Alvarez et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|Within {{the rain}} forests of New Guinea there are many small pachycaul treelets {{belonging}} to the Rubiaceae.

40|$|Fig {{trees are}} a {{ubiquitous}} component of tropical rain forests and exhibit an enormous diversity of ecologies. Focusing on Ficus subgenus Sycomorus, a phenotypically diverse and ecologically important Old World lineage, {{we examined the}} evolution of fruit traits using a molecular phylogeny constructed using 5 kilobases of DNA sequence data from 63 species (50 % of global diversity). In particular, we ask whether patterns of trait correlations are consistent with dispersal agents as the primary selective force shaping morphological diversity or if other ecological factors may provide a better explanation? Fig colour, size and placement (axial, <b>cauliflorous,</b> or geocarpic) were all highly evolutionarily liable, and the same fruit traits have evolved in different biogeographic regions with substantially different dispersal agents. After controlling for phylogenetic autocorrelation, we found that fig colour and size {{were significantly associated with}} fig placement and plant-life history traits (maximum plant height and leaf area, respectively). However, contrary to prevailing assumptions, fig placement correlated poorly with known dispersal agents and appears more likely determined by other factors, such as flowering phenology, nutrient economy, and habitat preference. Thus, plant life-history, both directly and through it...|$|E
40|$|Salviinae of the Lamiaceae (Harley et al. 2004). Chaunostoma {{is known}} as a {{monotypic}} genus and is restricted to South Mexico (Chiapas) and Guatemala. However, the generic delimitation of Chaunostoma has been questioned because of the close relationship with Lepechinia, which includes ca. 40 species and is mainly distributed from Argentina to Mexico and Northern California (Epling 1948). In fact, Chaunostoma differs from Lepechinia only by <b>cauliflorous</b> inflorescences and the arched stamens (Epling 1948, Harley et al. 2004). Nevertheless, since the arched stamens can also be found in Lepechinia (Epling 1948, Walker & Sytsma 2007), the generic status of Chaunostoma has become increasingly problematic within Salviinae. Following a recent phylogenetic study, Chaunostoma and Lepechinia are considered together as a monophyletic group within Salviinae (Drew & Sytsma 2011). The micromorphological characteristics of these two genera support the same conclusions as the molecular phylogeny. For example, Chaunostoma and Lepechinia produce perforate pollen grains while the other members of Salviinae possess bireticulate pollen grains (Moon et al. 2008). Moreover the areolate abscission scar of the nutlets is a synapomorphic condition for Chaunostoma and Lepechinia (Moon et al. 2009). Therefore, the new synonym and the necessar...|$|E
40|$|A fossil with Gnetum {{affinity}} {{was found}} in the Jianshangou Member (Barremian Age) of the Yixian Formation (Lower Cretaceous Epoch) of the Jehol Group in western Liaoning, northeastern China. The single fossil specimen is represented by both elongate-cylindrical male spike strobiles which borne within a nodal bract of <b>cauliflorous</b> branch. The spike strobiles have apparent nodes, invisible internodes, and numerous verticillate involucral collars. The microsporangiate units within involucral collars are not seen. The male spike strobiles with verticillate involucral collars occur exclusively in Gnetum; hence, the fossil strobiles are attributed to a new taxon, Khitania columnispicata gen. & sp. nov., being closely related to Gnetum. The general isotopic dating suggests an age of Barremian, ca. 125 – 122 million years (Myr) ago for the Jianshangou Member. The palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic inference based on the compositions of flora and fauna, and lithological characters of the fossil locality suggests that the fossil plants grew in a subtropical mesophytic forest and under a warmer climate. The remains of male spike strobiles are the first record of gnetalean macrofossil.

40|$|Invasive alien plants {{affect the}} {{functioning}} of ecosystems by altering plant–animal interactions, such as pollination, which may impede natural regeneration of native plant species. In Mauritius, we studied the reproductive traits and pollination ecology of the rare endemic <b>cauliflorous</b> tree Syzygium mamillatum in a restored forest (all alien plant species removed) and an adjacent unrestored area (degraded by alien plants). Flowers of S. mamillatum were only visited by generalist bird species. Although the initial number of flower buds per tree in the restored forest tended {{to be higher than}} that of trees in the unrestored area, final fruit set and the number of seeds per fruit were lower in the restored forest. This corresponded with lower bird visitation rates in the restored area. Additionally, during budding stage, most trees were severely attacked by lepidopteran larvae, and bud loss through herbivory was higher in the restored forest. Thus, the difference in reproductive performance of S. mamillatum between the two localities was caused by contrasting herbivore attack and bird visitation behavior in restored and unrestored areas. Our findings illustrate the importance of restoration efforts in mimicking the original physical structure of habitats and interaction structure of interspecific relationships, and the difficulty of doing so given the imperfect knowledge and the reality that many native species have become locally extinct and replaced by exotic species...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} a recent {{publication}} of eight new species of Planchonella (Sapotaceae) from New Caledonia, three additional novelties are here described and illustrated (P. cauliflora, P. ericiflora, and P. minutiflora). Planchonella cauliflora was discovered in 2006 near La Foa and is the first and sole member in the archipelago with a <b>cauliflorous</b> inflorescence, a genus otherwise having axillary flowers (rarely, ramiflorous). The other two were discovered among herbarium material but not earlier identified as new. A recent suggested hypothesis (Swenson et al. 2007 b) that fruit morphology indicates phylogenetic relationships within Planchonella is supported. A ridged fruit with acuminate apices and a short style place P. cauliflora in their Clade D 1, a clade confined to New Caledonia. Fruits of P. minutiflora are unknown, but based on ITS sequence data {{it belongs to the}} same clade as P. cauliflora and it is predicted that the fruit is similar. Molecular sequences of P. ericiflora are still missing, but based on a pear-shaped fruit, round apices and a fairly long style, we believe it is closely related to a different clade of Planchonella that is also restricted to New Caledonia. All three species have very narrow distributions and match the criteria of the IUCN red list as Critically Endangered.

30|$|Our {{study also}} {{revealed}} specific adaptations in female trees. Although present, cauliflory represented only 1  % {{of the estimated}} female fig production. This result was expected because seeds from fallen figs are unlikely to germinate if they are too close to their genitor. The change in resource allocation towards the twigs seems more linked to seed dispersal. Similar to other species of the Sycomorus subgenus, F. benguetensis is dispersed by fruit bats (Harrison et al. 2012). In contrast to F. racemosa and F. variegata (Patel et al. 1995), two tall and <b>cauliflorous</b> tree species dispersed by bats, F. benguetensis is a medium-sized tree, with its foliar crown often reaching the canopy in Taiwan forests. Producing female figs on the terminal twigs can facilitate the access and consumption of ripened figs by bats, and then increase the chances of effective seed dispersal. Additionally, the highest intratree asynchrony of female figs growing on twigs can further increase dispersal by ensuring repeated visits by frugivores. This extreme asynchrony seems directly linked to longer fig developmental stages. We estimated the total duration of development at 121 days for female figs and 71 days for male figs. Such extended prereceptive and maturation phases of the female figs are likely due to {{a greater number of}} ovaries in female figs and the necessity to be fleshier to attract seed dispersers (Patel and McKey 1998). Furthermore, a high intratree fig asynchrony ensures that female trees experience an extended and greater variety of environments for seed germination (Patel et al. 1993).|$|E

Flowers unisexual or bisexual, actinomorphic or very rarely (extra-Mal.) oblique, receptacle usually well developed (perigynous), rarely reduced (hypogynous), ± globose or urceolate to widely campanulate; tepals usually inconspicuous, sometimes larger and petaloid, rarely distinct sepals and petals (extra-Mal.), decussate, radial or spiral. — Male flowers with few to many stamens arranged in whorls or sometimes spirally or disposed irregularly; filaments usually strap-shaped, short, occasionally with 2 basal lobes; anthers 2 — 4 sporangiate, the loculi sometimes confluent above (or rarely below) opening by slits or valves. — Female flowers with or without staminodes; carpels few to many (rarely extra-Mal., only one), sessile or stipitate, free or immersed in the receptacle, outer carpels of female flowers sometimes sterile; ovule solitary, erect or pendulous, crassinucellar, bitegmic or (extra-Mal.) unitegmic. Fruits of separate drupes or achenes, sometimes plumose, frequently enclosed in the persistent receptacle or exposed by various modes of splitting of the receptacle; endosperm copious, oily; embryo straight, cotyledons appressed or divergent, sometimes with serrate margins. Distribution. About 33 genera with an estimated 320 species, mainly in the warmer parts of the southern hemisphere. There is a concentration of genera in Malesia (11 genera with 86 spp.) with extensions south and east into Australia and the SW. Pacific; further concentrations occur in the islands of the western Indian Ocean and in South America. The family is represented in Africa only by two small aberrant genera and occurs on the Eurasian mainland only in the Malay Peninsula, the Nicobar Islands and Peninsular Thailand...|$|E
40|$|Trees, shrubs, herbs, or armed climbers; roots not rarely tuberous. Indument {{consisting}} of simple hairs. Leaves simple, exstipulate, opposite or rarely in whorls or pseudowhorls, sometimes unequal in one pair. Inflorescence cymose, often thyrsoid, corymbose or umbellate terminal or axillary, sometimes <b>cauliflorous.</b> Bracts and bracteoles present, sometimes very small, not rarely early caducous. Flowers actinomorphic, bisexual or unisexual by reduction; pedicelled, with 1 - 3 bracteoles sometimes coloured, or sustained by an involucre. Perianth tubular, campanulate, funnel-shaped, or urceolate, sometimes articulated with the pedicel; the basal part persistent, enclosing the receptacle, tubular, club- or funnel-shaped, often accrescent; the apical, mostly circumscissile caducous part plicate or valvate in bud, with (4 —) 5 — 10 lobes, green or coloured. Stamens 1 - 40, rarely more, in 1 - 2 whorls, connate at the base, {{free from the}} perianth; anthers 2 -locular, latrorse, basifixed. Ovary (sub) sessile, superior, 1 -celled, with one erect, anatropous ovule. Style terminal, stigma capitate or fimbriate- to shortly lobed. Basal persistent part of the perianth accrescent in fruit and enveloping the fruit, the whole being known as anthocarp; anthocarp indehiscent, smooth, or with viscid ribs and glands, sometimes the glands accrescent into prickles; pericarp thin. Seed 1; embryo straight or folded; endosperm mealy or reduced to a gelatinous rest. Distribution. About 26 genera with 300 spp. in the New World, particularly in South America, with poor representations of mostly widespread (native or introduced) species in the warm parts of the Old World. Although the family is predominantly tropical, its area reaches to 38 ° SL in New Zealand and to 45 ° SL in Argentina. In Malesia there are 19 spp. in 4 genera, of which only Pisonia is undoubtedly native...|$|E
