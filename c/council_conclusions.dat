500|$|The summits {{were only}} formalised {{in the period}} between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, {{following}} a proposal from then-French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{it was agreed that}} more high level, political input was needed following the [...] "empty chair crisis" [...] and economic problems. The inaugural European Council, as it became known, was held in Dublin on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the Single European Act) and had a defined role {{for the first time in}} the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975-1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008-2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1½ years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official <b>Council</b> <b>conclusions,</b> as they instead end by more broad political Statements on some cherry picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official <b>Council</b> <b>conclusions</b> - but differs from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the 11 September attacks.|$|E

It is generally said that Tomislav was crowned in 924 or 925, however, this is not certain. It is not known when, where, or by whom he was crowned. The letters in which Tomislav was called a king were preserved in a version of Thomas the Archdeacon's History of Salona.

Moreover, a lack of funding and financial incentives exists, which together with market fragmentation in the EU and across the spectrum of services further impedes innovation.

40|$|The {{rule of law}} is a {{foundational}} {{principle of}} the EU’s identity. It implies inter alia that member states are required to comply with this principle in their respective national realm. In that regard, the paper argues that respect {{for the rule of law}} can be conceptualized as an erga omes partes obligation: its indivisible nature entails that each country owes it to the EU, the other member states, as well as individuals. Yet the EU institutional system reveals some shortcomings as to the oversight on systemic deficiencies of the rule of law at national level, since the Article 7 procedure is not a sound response to systemic threats to the rule of law. In the light of a Council’s invitation, the Commission has proposed a complementary mechanism, which provides for a political oversight aimed essentially at entering into a dialogue with the concerned member state. This paper, while challenging some critical remarks to the Commission’s Communication, advocates that it is consistent with the Treaties.
