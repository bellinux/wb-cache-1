25|$|Although not {{formally}} a quinolone, nalidixic acid {{is considered the}} first quinolone drug. It was introduced in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a distillate during an attempt at chloroquine synthesis. Nalidixic acid is thus {{considered to be the}} predecessor of all members of the quinolone family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. Since the introduction of nalidixic acid in 1962, more than 10,000 analogs have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice. The first generation also included other quinolone drugs, such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and <b>cinoxacin,</b> which were introduced in the 1970s.

5000|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> {{is one of}} the {{original}} quinolone drugs, which were introduced in the 1970s. Commonly referred to as the first generation quinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs such as pipemidic acid, and oxolinic acid, but this first generation proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid. <b>Cinoxacin</b> is similar chemically (and in antimicrobial activity) to oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. Relative to nalidixic acid, <b>cinoxacin</b> was found to have a slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity. <b>Cinoxacin</b> was patented in 1972 and assigned to Eli Lilly. [...] Eli Lilly obtained approval from the FDA to market <b>cinoxacin</b> in the United States as Cinobac on June 13, 1980. Prior to this cinobac was marketed in the U.K. and Switzerland in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|The {{safety profile}} of <b>cinoxacin</b> {{appears to be}} rather unremarkable. Adverse drug {{reactions}} appear {{to be limited to}} the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system. Hypersensitivity resulting in an anaphylactic reactions (as seen with all drugs found within this class) has also been reported in association with <b>cinoxacin.</b> Animal studies have shown that <b>Cinoxacin</b> is associated with renal damage. Such damage appears to be due to the physical trauma resulting from deposition of <b>cinoxacin</b> crystals in the urinary tract. [...] Such crystaluria has also been reported with other drugs in this class. [...] A review of the literature indicates that patients treated with <b>cinoxacin</b> reported fewer adverse drug reactions than those treated with nalidixic acid, furadantin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{following}} {{an overdose of}} <b>cinoxacin</b> may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea. The severity of the epigastric distress and the diarrhea are dose related. Patients who have ingested an overdose of <b>cinoxacin</b> should be kept well hydrated to prevent crystalluria. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of <b>cinoxacin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> was {{an older}} {{synthetic}} antimicrobial related to the quinolone class of antibiotics with activity similar to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. It was commonly used thirty years ago to treat urinary tract infections in adults. There are reports that <b>cinoxacin</b> had also been used to treat initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in dogs. however this veterinary use was never approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In complicated UTI, the older gyrase-inhibitors such as <b>cinoxacin</b> are no longer indicated.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> is a {{quinolone}} antibiotic {{that has}} been discontinued in the U.K. as well the United States, both as a branded drug or a generic.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the most}} recent package insert (circa 1999) Cinobac is listed as being {{contraindicated}} in patients {{with a history of}} hypersensitivity to <b>cinoxacin</b> or other quinolones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> mode {{of action}} {{involves}} the inhibiting of DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.|$|E
50|$|Biotransformation {{is mainly}} hepatic, with {{approximately}} 30-40% metabolized to inactive metabolites. Protein Binding ranges from 60 to 80%. <b>Cinoxacin</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The presence of food delays absorption {{but does not}} affect total absorption. The mean serum half-life is 1.5 hours. Half-life in patients with impaired renal function may exceed 10 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{phototoxicity}} and photoallergenicity is well demonstrated experimentally, phototoxicity {{does not}} appear to be an issue with <b>cinoxacin.</b> As a result of this safety profile the manufacturer, Eli Lilley states that [...] "cinoxacin perhaps should be reserved only for those patients with organisms resistant to usual first-line agents or those who fail to respond to therapy with these agents." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{acidification}} and alkalinization of the urine on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cinoxacin</b> was examined after single 500 -mg oral doses {{were administered to}} nine healthy male volunteers. Acidic and alkaline conditions were achieved by repeated oral doses of ammonium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, respectively. Plasma <b>cinoxacin</b> levels in all subjects were adequately {{described in terms of}} one-compartment-model kinetics with first-order absorption and elimination. Acidification and alkalinization treatment had no effect on <b>cinoxacin</b> absorption or distribution. The mean elimination half-life of <b>cinoxacin</b> in plasma was 1. 1, 2. 0, and 0. 6 h in control subjects and with acidification and alkalinization of urine, respectively. Recovery of intact <b>cinoxacin</b> in samples of urine collected 0 to 36 h after <b>cinoxacin</b> administration represented 65 % of the dose in control subjects and urine acidification and 80 % of the dose with alkalinization of urine. The mean renal clearance of <b>cinoxacin</b> was 76, 118, and 278 ml/min with acidification, control, and alkalinization, respectively, and renal clearance was highly correlated with urinary pH. Urine concentrations of <b>cinoxacin</b> were significantly higher with alkalinization compared with control values during the first 4 h after drug administration. Urine <b>cinoxacin</b> concentrations were reduced somewhat by acidification, but these tended not to be significantly different from control values. Changes in <b>cinoxacin</b> elimination owing to urine pH are less pronounced in humans than in dogs. The antibacterial activity of <b>cinoxacin</b> against some common urinary tract pathogens was pH dependent. A four- to eightfold reduction in <b>cinoxacin</b> activity was generally observed at pH 8 compared with lower pH values. However, in view of the high levels of <b>cinoxacin</b> which are obtained in both acidic and basic urine, the impact of urine pH on <b>cinoxacin</b> antibacterial efficacy would be of minor clinical importance...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{levels and}} urinary {{excretion}} of <b>cinoxacin</b> {{were examined in}} healthy individuals after a two-step intravenous infusion in the presence and absence of probenecid. After dosing <b>cinoxacin</b> alone, steady-state serum levels were approached in 1 h and were maintained for an additional 2 h with a reduced infusion rate. After probenecid pretreatment, serum levels of <b>cinoxacin</b> continued to increase during 3 h of infusion, reaching levels approximately double those obtained with <b>cinoxacin</b> alone. The mean elimination half-life of <b>cinoxacin</b> from serum was increased from 1. 3 to 3. 5 h {{in the presence of}} probenecid, and renal clearance was significantly reduced, with 46 % of dosed drug appearing in 7 -h urines of probenecid-treated subjects compared with 68 % in subjects receiving <b>cinoxacin</b> alone. Probenecid had no apparent influence on <b>cinoxacin</b> distribution in the body but caused a significant decrease in the rate of <b>cinoxacin</b> extrarenal elimination, possibly due to competition for a common metabolic pathway...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> (compound 64716) is a {{synthetic}} organic acid with antibacterial activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>cinoxacin</b> (agar-dilution method) were determined for 419 strains. Escherichia coli {{was the most}} susceptible group of organisms. The majority of Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., and Serratia marcescens were inhibited by 8 μg of <b>cinoxacin</b> per ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all gram-positive isolates tested were resistant to 64 μg or less of <b>cinoxacin</b> per ml. Zones of inhibition using a 30 -μg disk correlated well with agar-dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (r = − 0. 9). <b>Cinoxacin</b> was bactericidal when tested with inocula of 5 × 106 organisms per ml. Resistance to <b>cinoxacin</b> was readily developed in all three strains tested by serial passage on drug-containing agar. The in vitro properties of this agent {{were similar to those}} of nalidixic acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>cinoxacin</b> was {{compared with that}} of ampicillin and chloramphenicol against 26 strains of nontyphoid Salmonella and 44 strains of Shigella. <b>Cinoxacin</b> was found to have a lower minimal inhibitory concentration than ampicillin and chloramphenicol against all Salmonella and Shigella sonnei strains. <b>Cinoxacin</b> had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of chloramphenicol but lower than those of ampicillin against Shigella flexneri and S. boydii strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cinoxacin,</b> a new antibacterial compound {{related to}} nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid, were investigated in 22 patients {{with varying degrees}} of renal impairment. After oral administration of <b>cinoxacin</b> at 500 mg every 12 h for 7 days to all patients, the drug was found to be well tolerated. The urine concentrations of <b>cinoxacin</b> in all patients far exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentrations for susceptible organisms commonly found in urinary tract infections. The serum half-life of <b>cinoxacin</b> in patients with normal renal function was approximately 2. 7 h but increased to approximately 8. 5 h in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min. No undue drug accumulation was demonstrated in any patient group during the treatment. Highly significant correlations were found between the elimination rate constant and creatinine clearance and also between the elimination half-life and serum creatinine. The bioavailability of <b>cinoxacin</b> was independent of renal function...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} from urine specimens obtained from {{patients with chronic}} urinary tract diseases treated with various antibiotics and chemotherapeutics {{for long periods of}} time because of recurrent or relapsing urinary tract infections. The micro-organisms were studied for their in vitro susceptibility to <b>cinoxacin</b> and nalidixic acid. The Gram-negative bacteria investigated were usually more suscept-ible to <b>cinoxacin</b> than to nalidixic acid. Ninety-eight of 108 strains of Escherichia coli were inhibited by 32 ng/ml of <b>cinoxacin</b> and 61 by 32 ng/ml of nalidixic acid. The corresponding numbers for 27 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were 22 and 12, and for 25 strains of Proteus mirabilis 20 and 10, respectively. None of 16 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by <b>cinoxacin</b> in this concentration, nor were 24 strains of staphylococci and streptococci...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> {{is a new}} {{synthetic}} compound similar chemically and in antimicrobial {{activity to}} oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. It is most effective against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, but at concentrations expected in the urine it is inhibitory for all species of Enterobacteriaceae. Relative to nalidixic acid, <b>cinoxacin</b> has slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity, less inoculum effect probably due to less heterogeneity in the susceptibility of bacterial cells, and less inhibition by high concentrations of serum protein. Both drugs are more active in an acid than an alkaline medium. Glucose can specifically antagonize the inhibitory effect against P. mirabilis. In urine the bactericidal rate and effect are decreased. Resistance to <b>cinoxacin</b> can be developed quickly by serial transfers in vitro. Some nonresistant organisms remained viable in bactericidal drug concentrations. The in vivo importance of the favorable features of <b>cinoxacin</b> must be determined by clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} <b>cinoxacin,</b> 1 -ethyl- 4 (1 H) -oxo-[1, 3]dioxolo[4, 5 -g]cinnoline- 3 -carboxylic acid, previously reported as compound 64716, was determined and {{compared with other}} antimicrobial agents at a dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily in a descending pyelonephritis rat model with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis as infecting organisms. <b>Cinoxacin</b> was considerably more effective than either nalidixic acid or oxolinic acid when all three were administered orally at 3 mg/kg four times daily. The presence of demonstrable serum activity with a high recovery in urine indicates <b>cinoxacin</b> possesses highly desirable properties of an effective oral chemotherapeutic agent for urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|A spectrophotofluorimetric {{method for}} the {{determination}} of <b>cinoxacin</b> was evalu-ated. An almost linear relation was found between fluorescence and concentration of <b>cinoxacin</b> extracted from urine (r = 0 - 98), serum (r = 0 - 96), and renal and prostatic tissue homogenates (r = 0 - 94; r = 0 - 99). The minimal sensitivity of the spectro-photofluorimetric method was 0 - 10 |ig/ml when testing urine and serum. The corre-sponding figures for prostatic and renal tissue were 0 - 05 ng/mg and 0 - 10 ug/mg wet weight. The results of the determinations of <b>cinoxacin</b> concentrations in urine obtained by this method were compared with those found {{by means of an}} agar-well diffusion bioassay. A good correlation was found between the results obtained by the two methods.

40|$|<b>Cinoxacin,</b> a new {{synthetic}} {{antibacterial agent}} with in vitro activity against all species of Enterobacteriaceae, {{was used in}} the treatment of urinary tract infections in 20 patients. The dose of <b>cinoxacin</b> was 250 mg orally every 6 h for 10 days. The etiological agents were Escherichia coli in fifteen, Klebsiella-Enterobacter in five, Proteus mirabilis in two, and Providencia in one. The minimal inhibitory concentration for these organisms ranged from 2 to 64 μg/ml. Eleven of the 20 patients had renal involvement by defined criteria, whereas the remaining nine were considered to have bladder bacilluria. The initial strain was eradicated during and immediately after treatment in 19 of 20 cases. At 6 weeks, 65 % had sterile urine. Bactericidal urine levels of <b>cinoxacin</b> were obtained in all patients. No significant hematological, renal, hepatic, or gastroenterologic toxicity was noted. <b>Cinoxacin</b> appears to be a safe and useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae...|$|E
40|$|During 1981 to mid- 1988 {{three cases}} of anaphylactic shock after {{treatment}} with the quinolone derivative <b>cinoxacin</b> were {{reviewed by the}} Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs and 17 cases of an anaphylactic type of reaction notified to the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. In five out of six patients for whom data were available the reaction began shortly after taking a single capsule of a second or next course of treatment. <b>Cinoxacin</b> is related to nalidixic acid, and one patient previously treated with that agent subsequently had an anaphylactoid reaction to <b>cinoxacin</b> and later developed a skin reaction to nalidixic acid. There were no deaths, and patients treated as an emergency with plasma expanders or with adrenaline and corticosteroids generally recovered promptly and uneventfully.

40|$|<b>Cinoxacin</b> {{was almost}} {{completely}} absorbed when given orally {{and was found}} to be approximately 60 to 70 % protein bound. Peak serum concentrations were reached within 2 h, and detectable serum concentrations persisted up to 12 h after administration of 0. 25 -, 0. 5 -, and 1 -g multiple oral doses. Although food delayed the absorption and caused a 30 % reduction in mean peak serum concentrations, the overall 24 -h urinary recovery was not significantly altered. Approximately 50 to 55 % of the drug was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. At 12 h, urine concentrations were still above the minimal inhibitory concentration for most common gram-negative urinary pathogens. <b>Cinoxacin</b> was well tolerated when administered to 23 volunteers from 10 to 28 days.

40|$|Norfloxacin, a new {{quinoline}} derivative, was {{studied in}} vitro, and determinations of agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and broth dilution MICs and MBCs were made. Nalidixic acid and <b>cinoxacin</b> {{were used as}} comparative agents. Norfloxacin {{was found to be}} extremely active against all strains tested of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., with MICs normally below 1 microgram/ml. It also was found to be highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococci, which are all resistant to nalidixic acid and <b>cinoxacin.</b> The MICs for norfloxacin obtained by broth dilution were slightly higher than those obtained by agar dilution, whereas the reverse was true for nalidixic acid and <b>cinoxacin.</b> The MBCs of norfloxacin were only slightly higher than the MICs, even at high inocula. The in vitro activity of norfloxacin was not dependent on the inoculum size, whereas both the MICs and the MBCs of nalidixic acid increased markedly for many of the strains tested when the inoculum was increased in broth dilution from 10 (3) to 10 (6) colony-forming units per ml.
