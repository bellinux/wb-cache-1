He assigns monetary policy an outstanding impact on growth and employment and refuses its shortening on retaining price stability. He declares Monetarism to control inflation through money supply failed. It had been practised in the 1980s by some federal banks in response to the oil crisis and the stagflation going along with it in the 1970s. But it had led to drop of investments and high unemployment and therefore had been abandoned in the 1990s at latest. Flassbeck thereby emphasises the speciality of the German and European monetary policy, which, on the contrary to the majority of central banks, had kept a monetarism agenda. Flassbeck cites that the monetary policy of the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB) at controlling the money supply ever had geared to the potential output of the past. If economic growth would exceed money supply respectively Gross National Product the estimated potential output, the ECB, today as in past, would swivel in the Bundesbank already in advance to a restriction course, without a noteworthy endangering of price stability existing in the shape of exceedance of the target inflation rate. One could never set a potential output beforehand. Flassbeck also considers the target inflation rate of the ECB too low and refers to the height at other major central banks. According to Flassbeck, wage policy should work towards a macroeconomic [...] "distribution neutral" [...] wage adjustment. The optimal rate of wage increases would result from the addition of inflation rate and rise of labour productivity. Flassbeck views the labour agreement on national area as solution best compatible with market economy. This mechanism would accomplish the Law of one price, means the law of same prices for same goods, against the labour market's imperfections and information asymmetries.|$|E

40|$|International {{macroeconomic}} policy coordination {{is generally considered}} to be made less likely—and less profitable—by the presence of uncertainty about how the economy works. The present paper provides a counter-example, in which increased uncertainty about portfolio preference of investors makes <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> more beneficial. In particular, in the absence of coordination monetary authorities may respond to financial market uncertainty by not fully accommodating demands for increased liquidity, for fear of bringing about exchange rate depreciation. Coordinated monetary expansion would minimize this danger. A theoretical model incorporating an equity market is developed, and the stock market crash of October 1987 is discussed in the light of its implications for monetary policy coordination. ...|$|E

40|$|Coordnation of both {{policies}} allows {{to avoid}} crisis situations having destibilizing effect on economy. Cooperation between central bank and government is quite difficult due to preclusive aims of fiscal and monetary policies. Financial crisis in 2008 {{had a profound}} impact on many changes in governance of monetary and fiscal policies in the euro area. It revealed significant economic decline and problems related to public finances (increase in debt obligations) in the euro area. In reaction to the crisis in the euro area, the monetary authorities introduced many changes. An increase in expansionary monetary policy speaks volumes about an attempt to utilize the transmission channel of the monetary policy to improve economy. This paper focuses on highliting the changes ocurred in monetary policy and fiscal policies that were the consequence of the financial crisis in the euro area. The article verifies the hypothesis that the increased level of the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and fiscal polices caused by the financial crisis contributed to deepening the crisis in its early stage in the euro area (in the period of 2008 - 2009).

The financial crisis started in 2008 has contributed to many changes in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy in the euro area.

There was also performed some evaluation of the effectiveness <b>of</b> this <b>coordination.</b> In particular. It was pointed out that it was easiest to coordinate the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> within the EEC. The <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> at the IMF level prevented monetary crises and it was contributing to a bigger order in the International monetary relations.

The probability of the regime switch is endogenous and changes over time together {{with the state of}} the economy. The regime switch is preceded by a sharp increase in interest rates and causes a jump in the exchange rate.

40|$|When {{countries}} {{of different sizes}} participate in a cooperative agreement, the potential gain from deviation determines the minimum power that each country requires in the common decision-making.

With a common currency, this is equivalent to a transfer of seigniorage revenues in its favour. With national currencies such transfer would not occur, and without additional unconstrained fiscal instruments it would be impossible to sustain coordination with fixed exchange rates. When the number of potential countries in the union is large, it is not generally possible to prevent deviations from individual countries or from coalitions. The probability of deviation rises sharply with the number of countries and of possible coalitions. Cooperation; Currency Union; Seigniorage...|$|R

When we use our empirical results to help to explain the strong correlation observed between Australian and US output growth, we conclude that trade between the two countries is not sufficiently important to account for much of the correlation.

40|$|Research in {{the early}} 1980 s with {{empirical}} multi-country monetary models found that the gains from international <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> were quantitatively small compared to simply getting domestic policy right. 1 To be precise, if each central bank in a flexible exchange rate system followed a policy rule which optimized its own country’s domestic macroeconomic performance—under the assumption that other countries would do the same—then {{there would be little}} additional gain from the central banks ’ jointly optimizing policies. In game theory terminology, macroeconomic performance under a Nash non-cooperative monetary policy is nearly as good as the under the optimal cooperative monetary policy, and far superior to a policy which is suboptimal on purely domestic grounds. That prediction turned out, in my view, to be a pretty good description of monetary policy in the 1980 s, 1990 s, and until recently.

40|$|The current {{international}} monetary system (IMS) is fragile because the dollar standard is rapidly deteriorating. The dual role of the dollar as the dominant international money and national money cannot easily be reconciled because the US monetary authorities face a conflict between pursuing domestic objectives of employment and inflation, and maintaining the international public good of stable money. To strengthen the IMS, China has advocated the revitalisation of the special drawing rights (SDRs), but SDRs are neither money nor a claim on any international institution; are issued exogenously without any consideration for countries’ external imbalances; and can activate international monies only though bilateral transactions. The historical record of SDRs as international reserves is altogether unimpressive. We propose instead {{the creation of a}} supernational bank money (SBM) within the institutional setting of a clearing union.
