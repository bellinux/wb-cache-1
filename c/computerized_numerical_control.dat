50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} tooling processes that digital manufacturing utilizes. However, every digital manufacturing process {{involves the use of}} <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines (CNC). This technology is crucial in digital manufacturing as it not only enables mass production and flexibility, but it also provides a link between a CAD model and production. The two primary categories of CNC tooling are additive and subtractive. Major strides in additive manufacturing have come about recently and are at the forefront of digital manufacturing. These processes allow machines to address every element of a part no matter the complexity of its shape.|$|R
40|$|Multi-core {{processors}} offer {{a performance}} increment compared to single-core platforms. This leap in performance is desired to be ported to <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controls.</b> However, {{in order to}} profit of the benefits multi-core processors can bring, the software has to be tailored to real parallel execution. In this paper a concept is proposed for partitioning <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> software functions for being concurrently executed on multi-core systems. Specifically, the interpreter and the cutter radius compensation modules have been analyzed for devising a feasible parallel architecture. The parser algorithm has been implemented following the proposed scheme in a thread-based approach. Experiments were conducted under a real time Linux kernel extension utilizing the PREEMPTULRT patch. The results were compared against its serial version in terms of execution times to validate the concept...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{crushing}} behavior of circular aluminum thin-walled tubes with functionally graded thickness (FGT) are investigated experimentally. To this aim, three different thickness grading patterns {{are introduced to}} the longitudinal direction of tubes using a grading function, and then specimens are tested by universal testing machine under quasi-static axial compression loading. In addition, to show the efficiency of FGT tubes, the quasi-static axial crushing performance of FGT tubes are compared with their uniform thickness (UT) counterparts at the same weight. The test specimens have been made of commercial quality 6060 aluminum alloy and manufactured with <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> (CNC) machining workbench. Initial crush force (ICF), total energy absorption (EA), specific energy absorption (SEA) and mean crush force (MCF) values are measured from the tests to infer the quasi-static axial crushing performance of the tubes. The test {{results showed that the}} energy absorption characteristics of FGT tubes are better than the UT counterparts and FGT tubes allow effective control of the energy absorption parameters when compared with the UT tubes due to their varying stiffness along their longitudinal direction...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{embedded}} system such as line trace machine is adopted as project based learning (PBL) exercise in department of electronics and information engineering. Students are educated intensively on system control and programming. However, {{the design and}} manufacturing of controlled machine have not been focused and the environment for them has not been built. Therefore, the PBL does not give a full effect for cultivating students problem-solving skills. Moreover, design and manufacturing of machine system have been automated by nformation technology such as CAD (Computer Aided Design) / CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software and CNC (<b>Computerized</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled)</b> machine tools. They are useful for students majoring information engineering who want to acquire technique for system development and to understand Factory Automation (FA). We have built the environment by which tudents majoring information engineering can design and manufacture the machine system easily. The system that students can learn at home is realized by softwares that are easily available from web sites. Then an exercise that aims understanding FA system is given. At first, we aim that students understand the structure of CNC milling machine through assembling it. Secondly, students created control code both manually and automatically using of CAD/CAM software to understand CNC technique.

40|$|Economic {{pressures}} {{and the increasing}} importance of resource efficiency make the streamlining of production processes necessary. In this context, the reduction of non-productive times, i. e. of the part of machine tools’ total run time which, contrary to productive times, does not create value, represents an important lever. The percentage of non-productive times of many modern production processes is just below or even above that of productive times. However, streamlining non-productive times is extremely complicated. <b>Computerized</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controls</b> (CNC) are very comprehensive {{in terms of their}} usage, specification language and parameter settings. Only very few people possess the specialised knowledge required for streamlining non-productive times. In order to counter this situation, a new method to reduce non-productive times will be covered in this thesis. For this purpose eight different processes to analyse the potential of non-productive times will be presented first. Following on from that, the actual method for reducing non-productive times is introduced. It consists of eight groups organised by topic, each representing a different streamlining process. Three of these groups will be the focus of this thesis. The eight groups will be covered and compared to one another. At the same time specific benefits and disadvantages are also detailed. However, due to the complexity of manual operation of a large part of processes computer programmes have been developed to automate certain parts of usage and thus facilitating their use. In {{order to be able to}} assess both the processes for an analysis of potential and the method to reduce non-productive times these processes were applied to three selected, real production processes of high-volume production of automotive powertrain components. Rising potentials, and/ or potentials to rise will be covered and explained in detail. The evaluation of the processes to analyse and reduce non-productive times will be conducted using both the potentials identified and additional assessment criteria...|$|R

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{mechanized}} {{power generated}} by water wheels or steam engines was {{transmitted to the}} lathe via line shafting, allowing faster and easier work. Metalworking lathes evolved into heavier machines with thicker, more rigid parts. Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, individual electric motors at each lathe replaced line shafting as the power source. Beginning in the 1950s, servomechanisms were applied to the control of lathes and other machine tools via numerical control, which often was coupled with computers to yield <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC). Today manually controlled and CNC lathes coexist in the manufacturing industries.|$|E
50|$|Machine tools can be {{operated}} manually, or under automatic control. Early machines used flywheels to stabilize their motion and had complex systems of gears and levers {{to control the}} machine and the piece being worked on. Soon after World War II, the numerical control (NC) machine was developed. NC machines used a series of numbers punched on paper tape or punched cards to control their motion. In the 1960s, computers were added to give even more flexibility to the process. Such machines became known as <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC) machines. NC and CNC machines could precisely repeat sequences over and over, and could produce much more complex pieces than even the most skilled tool operators.|$|E

5000|$|Tedious {{mathematical}} work on {{fast neutron}} calculations, relativity, complex hydrodynamics and quantum mechanics {{were conducted by}} the TPG led by Salam until 1974 when he left Pakistan in protest, though he kept close contact with TPG. No such endeavours of the kind {{had taken place in}} the country and <b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC) and basic computing facilities were non-existent at that time (though later acquired). For this purpose, the calculations on the high-performance computing and numerical analysis were performed by Dr. Tufail Naseem, a PhD graduate in mathematics from Cambridge University, assisted by other members of Mathematics Division- the division of pure mathematics at PAEC under Dr. Raziuddin Siddiqui and Asghar Qadir. About the lack of CNC facilities, Munir Ahmad Khan famously marked: [...] "If the Americans could do it without CNC machines in the 1940s, why can't we do the same now.". With Abdus Salam departing, Munir Ahmad eventually led the TPG and assisted in the calculations. Two types of weapon design were analyzed: the Gun-type fission weapon and the implosion nuclear weapon. The program turned to the more technically difficult implosion-type weapon design, contrary to the relatively simple 'gun-type' weapon.|$|E
5000|$|In Forces of Production: A Social History of Industrial Automation (1984) Noble {{recounts the}} history of machine tool {{automation}} in the United States. He argues that CNC (<b>computerized</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control)</b> machines were introduced both to increase efficiency and to discipline unions which were stronger in the USA in the period immediately following World War II. Forces of Production argues that management {{wanted to take the}} programming of machine tools, which as [...] "machines for making machines" [...] are a critical industrial product, {{out of the hands of}} union members and transfer their control, by means of primitive programming, to non-union, college-educated white-collar employees working physically separate from the shop floor. Noble's research argues that, in practical terms, the separation was a failure. The practice angered and alienated union machinists, who felt that their practical and night-school knowledge of applied science was being disregarded. In response, they sat back while watching the programmed machines produce what Noble described as [...] "scrap at high speed." [...] Noble then went on to argue that management compromised with the unions, in a minor violation of the USA's 1948 Taft-Hartley Act (which reserved all issues except pay and benefits to management discretion), to allow the union men to [...] "patch" [...] and even write the CNC programs. Although Noble focuses strictly, in Forces of Production, on the narrow and specialist area of machine tools, his work may be generalized to issues in MIS software where the end users are restive when told to accept the product of analysts ignorant of the real needs of the business or the employee.|$|E
