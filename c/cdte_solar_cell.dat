40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the abundant, non-polluting {{renewable}} energy options in our planet. During the last three decades considerable progress has been achieved in developing technologies to produce electricity from solar radiation, but producing electricity with low cost and low pollution is of concern. The <b>CdTe</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are the leading source for the production of cost effective <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> The main issue of concern in these <b>CdTe</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is degradation observed when stressed at elevated temperatures.

Previous research works are reviewed while the successes, potentials, and problems of such technology are highlighted. Flexible <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> offer several advantages in terms of production, cost, and application over glass-based types. Of all the metals studied as substrates for <b>CdTe</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells,</b> molybdenum appears the most favorable candidate, while close spaced sublimation (CSS), electrodeposition (ED), magnetic sputtering (MS), and high vacuum thermal evaporation (HVE) {{have been found to}} be most common deposition technologies used for CdTe on metal foils. The advantages of these techniques include large grain size (CSS), ease of constituent control (ED), high material incorporation (MS), and low temperature process (MS, HVE, ED). These invert-structured thin film <b>CdTe</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells,</b> like their superstrate counterparts, suffer from problems of poor ohmic contact at the back electrode. Thus similar strategies are applied to minimize this problem. Despite the challenges faced by flexible structures, efficiencies of up to 13. 8 % and 7. 8 % have been achieved in superstrate and substrate cell, respectively.
