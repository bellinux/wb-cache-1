40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} {{a survey of the}} labor market {{experience}} of the 2001 - 02 class of Ph. D. economists. We estimate that 850 economics Ph. D. s were awarded by U. S. universities in 2001 - 02, down about 100 from five years earlier. Of these, 28 percent were women, and 37 percent U. S. citizens and permanent residents. On average, the graduates took 5. 4 years to earn their Ph. D. s. Over 97 percent of the graduates secured a full-time job; 82 percent held permanent jobs; 59 percent were in academe. Ninety-four percent of respondents reported that they like their job. Those who do less research {{are more likely to be}} dissatisfied. The median salary of those holding full-time jobs in the U. S. is $ 74, 000, up from $ 54, 000 five years earlier, a <b>compounded</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increase</b> of 6. 5 percent. Salaries of starting assistant professors are now significantly larger than the average of incumbent assistant professors at similar category institutions. Salary compression has progressed to salary inversion. A two-tier job market is emerging in academe, as the gap between the median annual nine-month salary of permanent (tenure-track) and temporary (visiting) academics has widened to $ 21, 500. Nevertheless, 86 percent of the doctorates report that had they known at matriculation what they know now, they still would have pursued a Ph. D. in economics. Labor markets for Ph. D. economists, economists' salaries, time-to-degree for economics Ph. D. ...|$|R
