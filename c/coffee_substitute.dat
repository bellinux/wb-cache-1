25|$|Around the Mediterranean, {{such as in}} Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, the midveins of the rosette {{leaves of}} S. hispanicus, known in Spain as cardillo, are used as a popular wild food. It is {{generally}} gathered in April and May. These midveins are preboiled and lightly fried with garlic in olive oil. These serve as garnish for cocido. Fried cardillo is further combined with garlic, cured ham and hard-boiled or scrambled eggs. Midveins are also used raw in salads. The roots are cooked and eaten, and compare in taste to salsify. Roasted roots {{have been used as}} a <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute.</b> Florets have been used as imitation saffron.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>substitutes</b> are non-coffee products, usually without caffeine, {{that are}} used to imitate <b>coffee.</b> <b>Coffee</b> <b>substitutes</b> can be used for medical, {{economic}} and religious reasons, or simply because coffee is not readily available.

2500|$|In Italy, barley is also {{sometimes}} used as <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute,</b> caffè d'orzo (coffee of barley). This drink is obtained from ground, roasted barley {{and it is}} prepared as an espresso (it can be prepared using percolators, filter machines or cafetieres). It became widely used during the [...] Fascist period and WWII, as Italy was affected by embargo and struggled to import coffee. It was also a cheaper option for poor families (often grown and roasted at home) in the period. Afterwards, it was promoted and sold as a <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute</b> for children. Nowadays, it is experiencing a revival {{and it can be}} considered some Italians' favourite alternative to coffee when, for health reasons, caffeine drinks are not recommended.|$|E
2500|$|Postum [...] is a {{powdered}} roasted-grain beverage once {{popular as}} a <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute.</b> The caffeine-free beverage {{was created by}} Post Cereal Company founder C. W.

Post was a student of John Harvey Kellogg, who believed that caffeine was unhealthy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the train}} reached Bergen-Belsen on Sunday, 9 July, the {{passengers}} {{were taken to}} a special section, what would {{be known as the}} Ungarnlager (Hungarian camp), where they were held for weeks, and in some cases months. Löb writes that their daily diet consisted of 330 grams of a grey, dense bread, 15 grams of margarine, 25 grams of jam, 1 litre of vegetable (mostly turnip) soup, 1.5 litres of <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute,</b> and sometimes cheese or sausage, with milk and extra rations for children under 14. The group was allowed to organize itself and its activities. As they settled in, the men elected Józef Fischer to be president, and run daily activities. With so many intellectuals among the passengers, there were regular poetry readings, and lectures in history, philosophy and religious education. The living arrangements were primitive, with 130–160 people crammed into each room. Ladislaus Löb describes a typical night, based on a diary kept by Szidonia Devecseri, another passenger: ...|$|E

2500|$|The chiffonniers (sometimes {{translated}} [...] "rag-pickers" [...] in English) {{were the}} lowest class of Paris workers; they sifted through trash and garbage on the Paris streets {{for anything that}} could be salvaged. [...] They numbered about twelve thousand {{at the end of the}} Second Empire. [...] Before the arrival of the poubelle, or rubbish bin, during the Third Republic, trash and garbage were simply dumped onto the street. [...] The lowest level of chiffoniers searched through the common refuse; they had to work very quickly, because there was great competition, and they feared that their competitors would find the best objects first. [...] The placier was a higher class of chiffonier, who took trash from the houses of the upper classes, usually in arrangement with the concierge. [...] The placier provided certain services, such as beating carpets or cleaning doorways, and in exchange was able to get more valuable items, from silk and satin to old clothing and shoes to leftovers from banquets. [...] Six houses on the Champs-Elysees were enough to provide for the family of a placier. The next level up was the chineur, a merchant who bought and resold trash, such as old bottles and corks from taverns, old clothes and bits of iron. At the top of the hierarchy were the maître-chiffoniers, who had large sheds where trash was sorted and then resold. Almost everything was re-used: old corks were sold to wine-merchants; orange peels were sold to distillers; bones were used to make dominoes, buttons and knife handles; cigar butts were resold; and stale bread was burned and used to make a cheap <b>coffee</b> <b>substitute.</b> Human hair was collected, carefully sorted by colour, length and texture and used to make wigs and hair extensions.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} amount and {{estimated}} daily mineral intake of nine elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, Fe, Mn, Cr and Ni) in commercial instant <b>coffees</b> and <b>coffee</b> <b>substitutes</b> (n = 49). Elements were quantified by high-resolution continuum source flame (HR-CS-FAAS) and graphite furnace (HR-CS-GFAAS) atomic absorption spectrometry, while phosphorous was evaluated by a standard vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method. Instant <b>coffees</b> and <b>coffee</b> <b>substitutes</b> are rich in K, Mg and P (> 100 mg/ 100 g dw), contain Na, Ca and Fe in moderate amounts (> 1 mg/ 100 g), and trace levels of Cr and Ni. Among the samples analysed, plain instant coffees are richer in minerals (p < 0. 001), except for Na and Cr. Blends of <b>coffee</b> <b>substitutes</b> (barley, malt, chicory and rye) with coffee (20 – 66 %) present intermediate amounts, while lower quantities are found in <b>substitutes</b> without <b>coffee,</b> particularly in barley. From a nutritional point of view {{the results indicate that}} the mean ingestion of two instant beverages per day (total of 4 g instant powder), either with or without coffee, cannot be regarded as important sources of minerals to the human diet, although providing a supplementation of some minerals, particularly Mg and Mn in instant coffees. Additionally, and for authentication purposes, the correlations observed between some elements and the coffee percentage in the blends, with particular significance for Mg amounts, provides a potential tool for the estimation of <b>coffee</b> in <b>substitute</b> blends...|$|R
