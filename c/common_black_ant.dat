50|$|The black {{garden ant}} (Lasius niger), {{also known as the}} <b>common</b> <b>black</b> <b>ant,</b> is a {{formicine}} ant, the type species of the subgenus Lasius, found all over Europe and in some parts of North America, South America and Asia. The European species was split into two species; L. niger is found in open areas, while L. platythorax is found in forest habitats. It is monogynous, meaning colonies have a single queen.|$|E
50|$|While {{other black}} ants such as Lasius niger, the smaller {{but much more}} common (in the UK) species, a queen founds its own nest by laying eggs and then feeding the new larvae with a fluid {{produced}} by breaking down its own muscles; a process that leaves her terrible weak as she cannot tend the larvae and forage for food at the same time. A post-nuptial queen of Lasius fuliginosus cannot found her own nests, but establishes a nest through social parasitism in another species of the same genus - Lasius umbratus, a rare yellow ant with an underground habit (unlike the common yellow ant Lasius flavus which makes small mounds in grass and lawns). She kills or ousts the existing queen and lays eggs, which the existing workers tend. Her offspring workers then slowly take over the nest. Lasius umbratis also establishes its nest in a similar way, by taking over the nest of Lasius niger, the <b>common</b> <b>black</b> <b>ant,</b> so Lasius fuliginosus is {{sometimes referred to as}} a hyperparasite.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{applications}} of hydrophobic kaolin particle film in apple orchards suppressed numbers of blossom weevil (Anthonomus pomorum), {{brown leaf weevil}} (Phyllobius oblongus), attelabid weevil (Caenorhinus pauxillus), leafhoppers (Empoasca vitis and Zygina flammigera) and green apple aphid (Aphis pomi) colonies. The kaolin treatments reduced the apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) fruit infestation on cultivar J. Grieve, and the fruit damage caused by oyster scale (Quadraspidiotus ostreaeformis), mussel scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi), early caterpillars, leaf rolling moths (Tortricidae), fruitlet-mining tortrix moth (Pammene rhediella) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella). There was {{no effect on the}} number of colonies of rosy leaf curling aphid (Dysaphis devecta), nor on the fruit damage caused by common earwig (Forficula auricularia) and apple sawfly on cv. G. Delicious. The level of infestation of rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), leaf miner moths (Phyllonorycter blancardella, Lyonetia clerkella), and agromyzid flies (Phytomyza heringiana) increased in the kaolin-treated plots. Kaolin treatments promoted woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) infestation, which became severe, while it reduced the abundance of polyphagous predators like F. auricularia, predaceous Heteroptera and Coleoptera, the red velvet mite (Allothrombium fuliginosum), spiders (Araneae) and the abundance of <b>common</b> <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger). The treatments also reduced parasitism of the apple sawfly by the ichneumonid Lathrolestes ensator. Many weeks after ending the kaolin treatments, the number of predaceous Coleoptera and especially the number of spiders remained low in the kaolin-treated plots...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{initially}} {{focuses on}} the chemical ecology of two species of ant which are common in the United Kingdom; Lasius flavus, the yellow meadow ant and Lasius niger, the <b>common</b> <b>black</b> <b>ant.</b> The first data chapter explores the constituent chemicals present in 3 major exocrine glands located in the gaster of L. flavus and discusses their potential functions. The work presented here also highlights {{the need for the}} comparative study of the chemical composition of glands. The second data chapter investigates how chemicals present in hindgut extractions of Lasius niger vary with the temporal caste they belong to (nurse or forager), and subsequently looks at how those chemicals may be suited to the tasks performed by that caste. The third data chapter describes the development of a highly sensitive methodology to identify low-concentration pheromones that uses a combination of analytical chemistry and behavioural bioassays. This methodology was used to identify two attractive pheromones of L. flavus, one is a trail pheromone used during foraging while the other is an alarm pheromone used to warn nest-mates of danger. The trail pheromone is the lowest concentration pheromone to be successfully identified in ants to date. This chapter also highlights the need to perform comparative behavioural bioassays to demonstrate the true function of putative pheromones. The final data chapter then investigates the source of alarm signals in Nasutitermes corniger termites and assesses the differential responses of workers and soldiers. This chapter then goes on to elucidate the colony-level effects of alarm on the regularity of repairs made to experimentally manipulated foraging galleries...|$|E

To effectively prevent C. cramerella infestation, high population of <b>black</b> <b>ants</b> are required. Population growth of <b>black</b> <b>ants</b> in three types of permanent nests and non permanent nest were observed during 3 months. Every month, five nests of each type were taken at random and then all stadia were calculated. The permanent nests will support ant population for some years and the <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> population per nest is higher when compared to nest made of dried cocoa leaves only. Permanent nests are made of 75 pieces of dried cocoa leaves which are placed in plastic bags with ventilation holes. In the longer term permanent <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> nests are more cost effective then ant nests which have been made from only dried leaves because frequent replacement is not required. Permanent ant nests will also ensure a stable <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> population is maintained...|$|R

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>ant</b> (Dolichoderus thoracicus) is the {{efficient}} {{biological control agent}} in suppressing main cocoa pests. It was reported that besides controlling the cocoa mirids, Helopeltisspp., this agent {{also can be used}} for biological control of cocoa pod borer (Conopomorpha cramerella) and rodents pest. Nevertheles, establishment of <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> in cocoa plantation is difficult. The objectives of research were to obtain the best method of <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> establisment and to know its effect on suppressing population and infestation of Helopeltis spp. The experiment was conducted on two cocoa ecosystems, namely cocoa plantation with coconut shading trees and with Gliricidia sepium shading trees. There were six methods of <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> establisment tried using a combination between <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> nest types and innoculation of mealybug (Cataenococcus hispidus). A control plot also added on these trial, therefore seven treatments were tried in this experiment and each treatmentwasreplicated three times. The results revealedthat on cocoa shaded by coconuts, ant establishment by the nests of coconut leaves combined with mealybug(Cataenococcus hispidus) inoculation on husk wedges were the best method and could effectively control Helopeltis infestation. Good results of ant establishment also occurred on cocoa shaded by Gliricidia but its effect on Helopeltis infestation has not been significant. Four months after establishment of <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> on cocoa with coconut shading trees, Helopeltisspp. population on the plots treated by coconut leaves nest combined with innoculation of mealybug using husk wedges were very low, namely only one Helopeltisper 36 cocoa trees, whereas on control plot reaches of 85 Helopeltis. Infestation of Helopeltis measured by percentage of trees occupied by Helopeltisper 36 cocoa trees in the same period and treatment plot revealed also very low, namely 1. 04 % compared to 27. 86 % on that of the control plot.
