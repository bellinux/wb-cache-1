Mahatma Gandhi professed monism of Advaita Vedanta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism. Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedanta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a <b>counter</b> <b>weight</b> to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League, to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions.|$|E

After Aju asked Kublai, the Emperor of the Mongol Empire, the powerful siege machines of the Ilkhanate, Ismail and Al-aud-Din from Iraq arrived South China to construct a new type of trebuchet which used explosive shells. These Muslim engineers built mangonels and trebuchets for the siege. Explosive shells had been in use in China for centuries but what was new was the counterweight type of trebuchet as opposed to the torsion type giving greater range and accuracy as it was easier to judge the weight of the <b>counter</b> <b>weight</b> than the torsion generated by repeated windings.|$|E

50|$|Tilting {{the polar}} axis adds {{a level of}} {{complexity}} to the mount. Mechanical systems have to be engineered to support one or both ends of this axis (such as in fork or yoke mounts). Designs such as German equatorial or cross axis mounts also need large <b>counter</b> <b>weights</b> to counterbalance {{the mass of the}} telescope. Larger domes and other structures are also needed to cover the increased mechanical size and range of movement of equatorial mounts. Because of this, equatorial mounts become less viable in very large telescopes and have been pretty much replaced by altazimuth mounts for those applications.|$|R
5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of counterbalance weights. They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient <b>counter</b> <b>weights</b> and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the counterbalance weights. To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big end journals. For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the rotating couple due to crank throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the balance mass is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank <b>counter</b> <b>weights</b> to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|R

40|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of heavy duty vehicles are continually developing their engines {{in order to}} meet regulations and customer demands. Up until recently the primary focus has been on development of the design of the engines to meet government emission regulations and is now shifting more towards the improvement of the overall engine efficiency. These engines might demand new engine design architectures and balancing of these can however become an issue for such novel engine designs. Truck engines develop high inertial forces which make it more essential that the engine is well balanced. As the new concept designs deviate more from the conventional designs, the existing methods of balancing become unusable due to software limitations. This study was conducted with the Tribology and Mechanics research group, at the Advanced Technology and Research department at Volvo Group Trucks Technology to investigate a new generic approach to analyse vibrations and to develop balancing solutions for novel engine designs using the multi body simulation software Adams/View. The approach has been validated to give a preface towards understanding of vibrations of new complex engine design and their ability to be balanced. It facilitates the understanding of those new designs as the forces and acting moments due to various motions can be distinguished and also derived from the respective vibrational orders. The balancing approach has also been utilized to investigate different crankshaft configurations in order to find the optimal design for the cause of balancing. The analysis investigated different amounts of <b>counter</b> <b>weights</b> on a six cylinder engine and showed that twelve <b>counter</b> <b>weights</b> are beneficial from a balancing standpoint. The different concepts that were studied have been proven to be in balance, although with different amount of additional balance shafts for some designs...|$|R
