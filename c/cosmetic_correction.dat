50|$|Septoplasty sep′tō·plas′tē(Etymology: L, saeptum, septum; Gk, πλάσσειν plassein - to shape), or {{alternatively}} submucous septal resection and septal reconstruction, is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten the nasal septum, the partition {{between the two}} nasal cavities. Ideally, the septum should run {{down the center of}} the nose. When it deviates into one of the cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow. Deviated nasal septum or “crooked” internal nose can occur at childbirth or as the result of an injury or other trauma. If the wall that functions as a separator of both sides of the nose is tilted towards one side at a degree greater than 50%, it might cause difficulty breathing. Often the inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed compensatory hypertrophy. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal obstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, while the recovery time could be up to several weeks. Septoplasty is sometimes done with rhinoplasty for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>correction</b> of the deformities of the external nasal framework.|$|E

Many of these treatments although not life-threatening are seen to some as enhancing the animals quality of life, therefore warrant surgical correction. In the realms of animal showing such as Show dogs, <b>cosmetic</b> <b>correction</b> is common to ensure the animal conform to the strict guidelines of breed specific characteristics.

40|$|Context. Radial {{velocity}} and transit methods are effective {{for the study}} of short orbital period exoplanets but they hardly probe objects at large separations for which direct imaging can be used. Aims. We carried out the international deep planet survey of 292 young nearby stars to search for giant exoplanets and determine their frequency. Methods. We developed a pipeline for a uniform processing of all the data that we have recorded with NIRC 2 /Keck II, NIRI/Gemini North, NICI/Gemini South, and NACO/VLT for 14 yr. The pipeline first applies <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrections</b> and then reduces the speckle intensity to enhance the contrast in the images. Results. The main result of the international deep planet survey is the discovery of the HR 8799 exoplanets. We also detected 59 visual multiple systems including 16 new binary stars and 2 new triple stellar systems, as well as 2279 point-like sources. We used Monte Carlo simulations and the Bayesian theorem to determine that 1. 05 (- 0. 70) (+ 2. 80) % of stars harbor at least one giant planet between 0. 5 and 14 MJ and between 20 and 300 AU. This result is obtained assuming uniform distributions of planet masses and semi-major axes. If we consider power law distributions as measured for close-in planets instead, the derived frequency is 2. 30 (- 1. 55) (+ 5. 95) %, recalling the strong impact of assumptions on Monte Carlo output distributions. We also find no evidence that the derived frequency depends on the mass of the hosting star, whereas it does for close-in planets. Conclusions. The international deep planet survey provides a database of confirmed background sources that may be useful for other exoplanet direct imaging surveys. It also puts new constraints on the number of stars with at least one giant planet reducing by a factor of two the frequencies derived by almost all previous works...|$|R

The formulation we discover through this systematic approach is both simpler and stronger than what has been reported previously.

It is the most common and distressing sign of human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy. Injectable polyacrylamide hydrogel (Aquamid) is a synthetic nonbiodegradable polymer consisting of a minor backbone of 2. 5 percent cross-linked polyacrylamide and 97. 5 percent nonpyrogenic water and is used for <b>cosmetic</b> facial contour <b>correction.</b> Favorable results with maximum aesthetic gains with the use of polyacrylamide hydrogel for reconstruction of facial lipoatrophy on the face in significantly immunocompromised individuals are being reported. These results are attributable to its use in limited volume injected at multiple sites and in multiple sittings. METHODS: Aquamid has been used for the correction of severe nasolabial folds and mid and lower facial volume loss in patients affected by human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy. Fifty patients were enrolled and treated, with a mean follow-up of 13. 1 months. Results were evaluated clinically, by standardized ultrasonography, and by psychological tests (visual analogue scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Assessment of Body Change and Distress questionnaire) to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: No significant side effects or issues such as swelling, infections, allergies, or nodule formation were noted over the follow-up period.

Three independent observers verified radiographic and cosmetic parameters for inter/interobserver variability analysis. Average pre-op Cobb angle and instrumented correction were 54 ° (SD 12. 5) and 59 % (SD 25) respectively. The average number of vertebrae fused was 10 (SD 1. 9). The total cost of spinal instrumentation ranged from $ 6, 769 to $ 21, 274 (Mean $ 12, 662, SD $ 3, 858). There was a weak positive and statistically significant correlation between Cobb angle correction and cost density (r =  0. 33, p =  0. 01), and no correlation between Cobb angle correction of the uninstrumented lumbar spine and cost density (r =  0. 15, p =  0. 26). There was no significant correlation between all sagittal X-ray measurements or any of the photo parameters and cost density. There was good to excellent inter/intraobserver variability of all photographic parameters based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 0. 74 – 0. 98). Our method used to measure cosmesis had good to excellent inter/intraobserver variability, and may be an effective tool to objectively assess cosmesis from photographs. Since increasing cost density only improves mildly the Cobb angle correction of the main thoracic curve and not the correction of the uninstrumented spine or any of the cosmetic parameters, one should consider the cost of increasing implant density in Lenke 1 A and B curves. In the area of rationalization of health care expenses, this study demonstrates that increasing the number of implants does not improve any relevant cosmetic or radiographic outcomes...|$|E
