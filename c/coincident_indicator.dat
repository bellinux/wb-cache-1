An application to a <b>coincident</b> <b>indicator</b> model for the Portuguese economy is presented.

By using the available data for the monthly indicators and for quarterly real GDP, it becomes possible to produce simultaneously a monthly composite index of coincident indicators and an estimate of the latest quarter real GDP growth well ahead of the release of the first official figures.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the capacity of}} a variety of macroeconomic indicators to forecast a one-quarter decline in U. S. real GDP in a given quarter using a standard probit model. We find the U. S Conference Board index of <b>coincident</b> <b>indicators</b> of U. S. economic activity to be the best single coincident predictor of a one-quarter decline in U. S. real GDP. The index has much more information content than employment, industrial production, and the NAPM overall index. The predictive power of the index of <b>coincident</b> <b>indicators</b> is enhanced when used in combination with the change in the U. S. Fed funds rate lagged two quarters. One- and two-quarters ahead, the best single leading predictors are Finance Canada’s index of leading indicators of U. S. economic activity and the U. S. yield curve. The change in the U.

40|$|We aim {{to assess}} the ability of two {{alternative}} forecasting procedures to predict quarterly national account (QNA) aggregates.
