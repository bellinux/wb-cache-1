50|$|<b>Cashmere</b> <b>yarn</b> used {{is machine}} spun for such shawls on power looms as 13 {{micrometre}} diameter wool is too fragile for such machines. A handloom weaver easily weaves the shamina without compromising on quality of shawl. It is popularly made in small diamond and large diamond weave, herringbone weave and multiple color embroideries. One can differentiate the commercial aspect by putting it towards light and observe a symmetric weave without any flaw. The purest shamina, {{which is made}} on handlooms, {{does not have a}} consistent weave and may have flaws which are characteristic of the fabric.|$|E

To the short of the high-count <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn</b> production and the difficult of spinning,From raw material selection, technological process, equipment transformation, parameter optimization, temperature and humidity control and other aspects,we analysised the high-count <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn</b> production process and quality control system,The development of the woolen 48 Nm <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn</b> has been done,it is of first class...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{range of}} {{carefully}} selected wool and <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarns</b> {{as well as their}} blends were used {{to examine the effects of}} fiber curvature and blend ratio on yarn hairiness. The results indicate that yarns spun from wool fibers with a higher curvature have lower yarn hairiness than yarns spun from similar wool of a lower curvature. For blend yarns made from wool and cashmere of similar diameter, yarn hairiness increases with the increase in the cashmere content in the yarn. This is probably due to the presence of increased proportion of the shorter cashmere fibers in the surface regions of the yarn, leading to increased yarn hairiness. A modified hairiness composition model is used to explain these results and the likely origin of leading and trailing hairs. This model highlights the importance of yarn surface composition on yarn hairiness. <br /...|$|R
50|$|The city {{is known}} as the premier wool textile center in the country, specializing in thread and <b>yarn,</b> <b>cashmeres,</b> blankets, as well as {{embroidered}} blouses and skirts During the pre-Hispanic era, this area produced cotton textiles, especially in the mountain areas of Huehuetla and Tenango. These were part of the tribute items collected by the Aztecs. Textile production continued into the colonial period, especially to mining communities in the Real del Monte and Pachuca areas. Sometime during this period, the fabric produced switched to mostly wool. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the textile industry here and in the rest of Mexico was modernized and the first train station was opened to ship products. The Mexican Revolution disrupted train service and the textile industry here suffered but came back after the war was over led by the La Esperanza and Santiago Textil factories, and with about 21% of the wool fabric of the country produced here. The textile industry continued to develop with the production of dairy products becoming important as well.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere exist many {{problems}} {{in the process of}} <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn</b> dyeing such as great difficulty in dyeing, large damage to yarn, low strength, and lack of brightness in color. Currently the technologies of hank yarn dyeing in foreign countries are very advanced, but most of them aim for hank yarn dyeing of cotton and silk with few reports on the research about hank dyeing of cashmere. In this paper, we will use reactive dyes to dye <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn,</b> do comparative experiment on pre-treatment lotion Kierlon OL and Da ai wen, and add a smooth anti-creasing agent Primasol JET and cashmere protective agent WSM in the dyeing process and analyze their impact on the performance of cashmere hank yarn dyeing to determine a reasonable dose of accessory ingredient. This dyeing program can be applied to guide the actual production, achieving the effects of improving the performance of cashmere hank yarn dyeing and enhancing the quality of dyed yar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a research of women clothing style, pattern design, and fabric by developing origami culture and double faced jacquard weaving. Four kinds of clothing styles are researched by folding fabric according some origami concept. Based on the developed folded garment structures, some positioned patterns are studied for modern advanced fashion design purposes. In the technology aspect, jacquard technology {{is used in}} this study. Jacquard technology uses double stitching structure which face and back patterns are not the same. The face fabric is colorful with pure silk while the back fabric is composite of twill and eight weft satin pattern with silk and <b>cashmere</b> <b>yarn.</b> The final example {{presents a}} combination creation of garment and fabric. The method and design {{of this type of}} creation requires a high integration of aesthetic and technical aspects, therefore a high added value would be achieved...|$|E
