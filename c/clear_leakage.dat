40|$|AbstractWe have newly made a {{specific}} biomolecule microsensor measuring leakage current and impedance with minute liposome solution that interacts with biomolecules such as protein. The microsensor was fabricated with a Si surface-bulk-micromachining process. K 4 [Fe(CN) 6] solution was entrapped inside of liposome of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholline (DPPC) and Carbonic Anhydrase from Bovine (CAB) {{was used as}} added protein for the interaction. A <b>clear</b> <b>leakage</b> in nA order was observed for the CAB, indicating the microsensor detects the CAB through the liposome-protein interaction. The detectivity increased by about 7 times and the volume of solution was decreased by about 10, 000 from the previous result...|$|E
40|$|Transferring data between {{mutually}} asynchronous clock domains requires safe synchronization. However, {{the exact}} nature of synchronization sometimes eludes designers, and as a result synchronization circuits get “optimized ” {{to the point where they}} do no longer operate correctly. This paper reviews a number of such cases, analyzes the causes of the errors, and offers a correct synchronizer circuit for each case. A correct two-flop synchronizer is presented. After discussing cases that avoid synchronization, the following synchronizers are reviewed: one flop, sneaky path, greedy path, wrong protocol, global reset, async <b>clear,</b> DFT <b>leakage,</b> pulse, slow-to-fast, metastability blocker, parallel and shared flop synchronizers. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} note monopolisation on the {{amplitude}} {{of money and}} credit cycles are studied. Note monopolisation trades <b>clearing</b> for <b>leakage.</b> If the central bank's reserve ratio is larger {{than that of the}} commercial banks, and if the currency-deposit ratio is sufficiently large, the leakage effect could domi-nate the loss-of-clearing effect (base expansion), such that the credit capacity of the banking system decreases. This was the case when the Bank of Sweden gained a note monopoly in 1904. Money and credit cycles should therefore have become smaller. Swedish bank data for 1871 – 1938 reveal that money cycles became smaller, but credit cycles larger. The latter is attributed to an increasing time-demand deposit ratio, which increases the credit capacity of the banking system.

40|$|Vertical Schottky diodes {{have been}} {{fabricated}} on low C content Si 1 -xCx and 3 C-SiC epilayers epitaxially grown on Si(001) substrates. Significant leakage current {{was observed in}} 3 C-SiC diodes under reverse bias, masking any rectifying behavior. This issue is far less pronounced in Si 1 -xCx based Schottky diodes which demonstrate a <b>clear</b> critical breakdown. <b>Leakage</b> current is shown to be greater in relaxed Si 1 -xCx layers. While crystalline Si 1 -xCx is not currently a viable material for high power electronics it is useful for assessing the impact lattice mismatch and crystalline quality has {{on the behavior of}} rectifiers. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the finite-size Dicke model with photon leakage. It is {{shown that the}} symmetry breaking states, which correspond to the ground states in the superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit, are stable, while the eigenstates of the isolated finite-size Dicke Hamiltonian conserve parity symmetry and are non-superradiant states. We introduce and analyze an effective master equation that describes the low-energy dynamics with photon <b>leakage.</b> It becomes <b>clear</b> that photon <b>leakage</b> is essential to stabilize the symmetry breaking states and to realize the superradiant phase in the finite-size Dicke model. Our theoretical analysis clarifies results from cold atomic experiments showing superradiance in an optical cavity. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} leak detection in a single pipe where the behaviour of the system frequency response diagram (FRD) is used {{as an indicator of}} the pipe integrity. The presence of a leak in a pipe imposes a pattern on the resonance peaks of the FRD that {{can be used as a}} <b>clear</b> indication of <b>leakage.</b> Analytical expressions describing the pattern of the resonance peaks are derived. Illustrations of how this pattern can be used to individually locate and size multiple leaks within the system are presented. Practical issues with the technique, such as the procedure for frequency response extraction, the impact of measurement position, noise- and frequency-dependent friction are also discussed. Pedro J.

40|$|In chapter 1 the {{integrity}} of root apices of cadaver and extracted teeth after ultrasonic root-end cavity preparation at medium and low intensity was evaluated. The frequency of cracks and chipping caused by ultrasonic root-end preparation was greater on extracted than on cadaver teeth. Therefore investigation on root-end preparation should preferably be conducted in situ. As it does not result in fewer side effects, lowering the ultrasonic power from medium to low intensity is not recommended. In chapter 2 the root-end sealing ability of IRM, Fuji IX and MTA in small cavities was compared and research on leakage study methodology by means of comparison of the fluid transport method (FTM) and capillary flow porometry (CFP) was performed. The conventionally-setting glass ionomer (GIC) Fuji IX showed least leakage. CFP demonstrated through pores in all teeth, whereas FTM did not. CFP {{appeared to be a}} useful method for leakage evaluation. In chapter 3 and 4 the long term sealing ability of root-end filling materials was evaluated in large cavities. Standardized bovine root sections were filled with Gutta Percha, Ketac Fil, Fuji IX, MTA, IRM, Ketac Fil with conditioner (C) or Fuji IX (C) and submitted to CFP at 48 hours, 1 month and 6 months. All materials were associated with capillary flow. The maximum pore diameters will be indicative of the eventual leakage or otherwise of bacteria and their metabolites. IRM root-end fillings had through pores that were smaller than those associated with other materials. GICs had the largest pores, although dentine conditioning improved their performance. The seal of all materials improved after 6 months. In chapter 5 the apical seal of MTA and Fuji IX (C) in root-end cavities with and without cracks and their obturation efficiency were evaluated. The teeth were immersed in Indian ink and <b>cleared.</b> Apical <b>leakage</b> was measured and obturation efficiency was scored. The presence of cracks, originating from the root canal, negatively influenced the seal and seemed to be of more importance than the root-end filling material being used. MTA and Fuji IX showed equal sealing capacity, but MTA showed better obturation efficiency than Fuji IX...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of cancer}} is a multistep process where an {{accumulation}} of genetic alterations drives normal cells to malignancy. In most cancer cells genetic changes can be observed both {{at the level of}} point mutations and as gains and losses of chromosomes. The eukaryotic cell has a complex protection system to recognize genetic alterations and, in the case of oncogene activation or severe DNA damage, direct the cell to undergo apoptosis. One of the morphological attributes initially used to define apoptosis is the fragmentation of DNA and the formation of apoptotic bodies. In healthy tissues apoptotic cells are rapidly phagocytosed by neighboring cells. Dying cells can thereby be <b>cleared</b> without <b>leakage</b> of harmful enzymes or eliciting an inflammatory response. The fragmentation of DNA that occurs in apoptotic cells is complemented by DNases in the phagocytosing cell, which ensure the destruction of potentially harmful DNA. However, it has been recently demonstrated that genes from apoptotic cells can avoid fragmentation and be salvaged and reutilized by the phagocytosing cell. This newly recognized mechanism of introducing foreign DNA is efficient since 15 percent of bovine aortic endothelial cells have been demonstrated to display uptake of apoptotic DNA and express this DNA. Furthermore, normal cells have been reported to be protected from propagation of DNA recovered from dying cells by the p 53 -p 21 signaling pathway. This thesis demonstrates that DNA from apoptotic cells can enter the nucleus of phagocytosing cells by a previously undescribed mechanism of nuclear fusion named Pirinosis as an acronym of the Greek words Pirinas (nucleus) and Enosis (union). The degree of DNA fragmentation after phagocytosis is demonstrated to be crucial for signaling via the Chk 2 -p 53 -p 21 pathway. Furthermore, DNA fragments within the nucleus of phagocytes are demonstrated to co-localize with early markers of the DNA damage pathway. Others have shown that endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment display genetic alterations and aneuploidy and hence the dogma that diploid cells of the blood vessel wall are stable is challenged. This turned our focus to horizontal gene transfer between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. Tumor associated endothelial cells isolated from rat tumors grown in mice displayed the same karyotype and inter-species chromosome fusions as detected after uptake of DNA from apoptotic cells in vitro. The hybrid tumor associated endothelial cells are shown to be functional in forming blood vessels that anastamose with the host circulatory system. We argue that phagocytosis of dying tumor cells by endothelial cells may create viable hybrid cells that are capable of creating functional vessels in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In the {{ten years}} since {{publication}} of the IPCC Special Report on CCS, there has been considerable progress in monitoring and verification (M&V). Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully monitored {{to the satisfaction of}} regulatory agencies, and technologies have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment, conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider M&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly {{on the nature of the}} verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface: however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve <b>clearer</b> articulation of <b>leakage</b> scenarios, with this specificity making it possible to demonstrate “no leakage” in a more objective way than is currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO 2 -EOR, and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO 2; the issues lie largely in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise...|$|R
40|$|Context. Star-forming dwarf galaxies may {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the reionization of the Universe, provided that some fraction of their ionizing radiation were able to escape into the intergalactic medium.  Local galaxies exhibiting such Lyman-continuum(LyC) leakage could potentially shed light on the escape mechanisms involved, but only two low-redshift cases of LyC leakage have been identified so far. Here, we argue that this meager harvest may be caused by unsuitable selection criteria.  Candidates for LyC leakage are normally selected by indicators of starburst activity, one of which is a high equivalent width in H alpha. Such a criterion will guarantee a high production of LyC photons but will also bias the selection in favour of a high column density in the neutral gas, effectively ruling out LyC escape.  Aims. In this work we want to investigate whether the lack of local LyC emitters can be caused in part by biased selection criteria, and we present a novel method of selecting targets with high escape fractions. By applying these criteria, we assemble a sample of observation targets to study their basic properties.  Methods. We introduce a new selection strategy here where the potential LyC leakers are selected by their blue colours and weak emission lines. The selection is based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We also take a closer look at the properties of 8 LyCleaking candidates at z similar to 0. 03 which we have observed with ESO/NTT in broadband B and H alpha.  Results. We find that 7 of the 8 target galaxies are involved in interaction with neighbours or show signs of mergers. In 7 cases the young stellar population is clearly displaced relative to the main body of these galaxies, often directly bordering the halo region. In about half of our targets the absorption spectra show young post-starburst signatures. Comparing the scale lengths in H alpha with those of the stellar continua shows that the scale lengths in H alpha typically are 30 % smaller, which is characteristic of galaxies influenced by ram pressure stripping. We tentatively identify a few mechanisms that could improve the conditions for leakage: 1) the combined effects of ram pressure stripping with supernova winds from young stars formed in the front, 2) merger events that increase the star formation rate and displace stars from gas, 3) starbursts in the centres of post-starburst galaxies, whose previous activity has <b>cleared</b> channels for <b>leakage</b> into the intergalactic medium, and 4) a low dust content. Although our target galaxies are rare species in the local universe, we argue that related types could have played a major role in producing ionizing radiation at high redshifts...|$|R
