5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other <b>cable-operated</b> systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{three-wheeled}} Kabinenrollers, {{which had}} <b>cable-operated</b> mechanical brakes, the Tg500 had hydraulic brakes.|$|E
25|$|Both {{variants}} {{feature a}} parasol wing constructed from wood {{and covered with}} aircraft fabric. The wing has full-span ailerons or, {{in the case of}} the two-seater, optional electrically-actuated flaperons. All controls are <b>cable-operated.</b> The elevator and rudder are conventional.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{television}} service (analog), previously {{available from}} Longview Communication, was terminated in 2006. Hamilton County Communications (a wholly controlled {{subsidiary of the}} Hamilton County Telephone Cooperative) purchased the <b>cable-operating</b> rights from Longview in 2006 although {{it is unclear whether}} {{they will be able to}} operate a cable system under current FCC rules.

5000|$|In 1977, Lamb {{submitted}} to cable television executives {{a proposal for}} a nonprofit channel that would broadcast official proceedings of Congress. He later said, [...] "The risks weren't very significant. No one knew who I was. If I failed, so what?" [...] The idea was approved in December 1977 and the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network was created as a private nonprofit business with a board of <b>cable-operating</b> company executives, funded by affiliate fees from cable companies. At its launch the network had a staff of four employees, including Lamb, and an annual budget of US$450,000. The first broadcast occurred on March 19, 1979, with live coverage of the first televised House of Representatives floor debate.|$|R
25|$|Lambretta {{introduced}} the first high-volume production {{use of a}} single, floating, front disc brake, enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175, followed by the range-topping GT200 in 1964. The 1969 Honda CB750 introduced hydraulic disc brakes {{on a large scale}} to the wide motorcycle public, following the lesser known 1965 MV Agusta 600, which had <b>cable-operated</b> mechanical actuation.|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s {{the island}} was {{fortified}} with ten 7-inch rifled muzzle loaders {{as one of the}} Palmerston Forts for the coastal defence of the Bristol Channel until it was abandoned in 1898. The infrastructure was reused in World War I and II when MarkVII6-inch breech-loading guns [...] and search lights were installed. To enable the movement of materials, soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps initially used mules and then installed a <b>cable-operated</b> winched switchback railway.|$|E
500|$|These {{facilities}} were updated in both World War I and World War II. From 1915 to 1919 {{the island was}} requisitioned by the Admiralty as a coastguard station. After the war the Sleemans returned to carry out farming and fishing and played host to occasional tourists. In World War II, search light batteries were built on Steep Holm. In 1940 the island's warden, Harry Cox, who had developed the island into a bird sanctuary since 1931, was appointed as a coastguard and was supported by Local Defence Volunteers from Weston-super-Mare. In 1940 and 1941 the battery was refortified by soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps using mules to transport guns and equipment up the steep cliffs. The armament included MarkVII6-inch breech-loading guns taken from World War I naval vessels which had been scrapped, and also included Lewis automatic machine guns against air attack. The Garden Battery was built over two Victorian stone gun emplacements. Engineers from the Royal Pioneer Corps improved the infrastructure including importing sheep to feed the soldiers and, after a case of typhoid fever, shipping drinking water from south Wales. To enable the movement of equipment, the engineers built a new jetty. This {{was linked to the}} plateau with a <b>cable-operated</b> winched switchback railway using prefabricated [...] gauge lines which had been captured from the Germans in World War I. The Steep Holm batteries were also connected, by underwater telegraph cable, to the Brean Down Fort batteries, but parts of the cable were stolen for scrap after the end of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|A roller brake is a modular <b>cable-operated</b> {{drum brake}} {{manufactured}} by Shimano {{for use on}} specially splined front and rear hubs. [...] Unlike a traditional drum brake, the Roller Brake can be easily removed from the hub. [...] Some models contain a torque-limiting device called a power modulator designed to {{make it difficult to}} skid the wheel. [...] In practice this can reduce its effectiveness on bicycles with adult-sized wheels.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} part of the year a {{deputation}} from Nottingham Corporation visited the <b>cable-operated</b> tramway system at Edinburgh and the overhead electric systems at Bristol and Dover, with the result that on 28 March the Tramways Committee recommended to the City Council that the proposed electric tramways should be operated on the overhead electric system. At an estimated cost of £425,000 (...) ,, electric tramways were proposed as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{successful}} <b>cable-operated</b> street railway was the Clay Street Hill Railroad, which opened on August 2, 1873. The promoter {{of the line}} was Hallidie, and the engineer was William Eppelsheimer. The line involved the use of grip cars, which carried the grip that engaged with the cable, towing trailer cars; the design {{was the first to}} use grips. The term [...] "grip" [...] became synonymous with the operator.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year later}} on 2 August 1860, the pier opened at {{a length of}} [...] to a grand procession, as the second longest and first iron-constructed {{pleasure}} pier in the country. Within its {{first few years of}} operation, waiting rooms for boat passengers had been added and a <b>cable-operated</b> tramway was installed by 1865. In 1868, it was extended to [...] and was used by various steamer ships, including Blackpool, Lytham and Southport Steam Packet Company with services operating from the pier to resorts including Fleetwood and Llandudno.|$|E
2500|$|The front brakes feature fixed Brembo 8-piston {{monoblock}} brake calipers, {{working with}} radially vented and cross-drilled brake discs, sized at [...] in diameter, by [...] thick. [...] The rear features single-piston floating ATE calipers with integrated <b>cable-operated</b> parking brake mechanism, mated to radially vented disc and cross-drilled, sized [...] by [...] [...] Front and rear brake calipers are finished in a high-gloss black paint, with the fronts incorporating the Audi [...] "RS" [...] logo. [...] Both {{front and rear}} discs are held in by metal pins to the lightweight disc hub, and allow [...] of lateral thermal expansion from the hub centre.|$|E
2500|$|The Audi V8 came {{equipped}} with {{rack and pinion}} power assisted steering (PAS) as standard. An electronically controlled variable assisted 'servotronic' version was also available. It was fitted with a high-performance brake system, which included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. [...] The fronts were rather unusual – designed by Continental AG and sized at [...] in diameter by [...] thick, but the caliper was mounted inside the disc. The fronts also incorporated electronic brake pad wear sensors. [...] The rears were [...] by , and incorporated a <b>cable-operated</b> parking brake. [...] A Bosch anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also standard.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the coming}} of the railways, the Trent and Mersey Company canals were sold to the North Staffordshire Railway, with the formal {{takeover}} occurring on 15 January 1845. They were keen to promote the canals and railways as mutual feeders, and so maintained the canals, {{with the exception of the}} Uttoxeter branch, which was closed by an Act of Parliament obtained in July 1847, so that the Churnet Valley Railway could be built along its course. The tramway from Froghall to Cauldon Quarries was replaced by a new <b>cable-operated</b> railway in 1849. It included inclined planes at Froghall, Oldridge and Cotton, and was built to a gauge of [...] Trains consisted of up to nine waggons, each capable of holding 6 tons of limestone, and around 1000 tons a day were moved from the quarries to the canal.|$|E

50|$|Euclid {{trucks were}} usually loaded by <b>cable-operated</b> crawler shovels and {{draglines}} of other manufacturers, but Euclid also developed mobile belt loaders to load its bottom dump trucks.|$|E
50|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{transportation}} across the river was a <b>cable-operated</b> scow type of ferry that began operating in 1786. Two rowboats were often available for use as well.|$|E
5000|$|The car had a {{wheelbase}} of 94 inches (2388 mm) and a {{track of}} 42 inches (1067 mm). [...] The brakes, {{which were the}} same as in the J2, were <b>cable-operated,</b> with 12 in drums all round.|$|E
50|$|It rode on a 3302 mm {{wheelbase}} {{and had a}} 1349 mm wide track. Road-going versions weighed about 950 kg. Hydraulic brakes {{replaced the}} <b>cable-operated</b> units in 1938, a modification Ettore Bugatti hotly contested. 630 examples were produced.|$|E
50|$|Pilot {{controls}} {{include a}} side-stick {{on the right}} and a throttle on the left. Rudder pedals are linked to the steerable tailwheel. The rather crude <b>cable-operated</b> brake comprises a cockpit lever operating steel tire-scrubbers on each main wheel.|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} was first built, a siding ran from the Upwey end of Portesham {{on the north side}} of the line, curving north to serve a quarry. It {{connected}} with a <b>cable-operated</b> incline to the quarry itself.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{locomotive}} plant in Nordhausen went idle. Under the German Democratic Republic, O&K changed its name to the VEB Company, and resumed heavy mechanical manufacturing at Nordhausen, producing <b>cable-operated</b> excavator shovels, among other things.|$|E
50|$|The front {{disc brakes}} were 260 mm {{diameter}} and ventilated. The rear disc brakes were 273 mm mm in diameter. Both sets were servo assisted with front/rear split dual circuits. There was a <b>cable-operated</b> hand brake for the rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|Stopping {{the car was}} {{achieved}} using mechanical (cable operated) drum brakes: with the Citroën Traction already featuring hydraulic brakes, <b>cable-operated</b> brakes were beginning {{to be regarded as}} an old technology which compromised the innovative image presented by other aspects of the 402.|$|E
50|$|A {{recurrent}} complaint from Apollo owners was {{the usage}} of steel rod-operated gear shift instead of the commonly used <b>cable-operated</b> gear shift. Both Verona and Apollo had cambering issues as well, partially due to rear suspension's project that was not adequately designed for a saloon.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1907 by William Henry Insley (born 1870). The company holds many patents for <b>cable-operated</b> digging {{equipment}} such as Dragline excavators and power shovels. Insley lost its independence in 1975 when purchased by United Dominion Industries; the name is currently held by Badger Equipment Co.|$|E
