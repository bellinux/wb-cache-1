40|$|A {{series of}} {{previously}} synthesized chiral derivatives of <b>clofibric</b> and phenylacetic <b>acids,</b> acting as dual agonists towards the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and gamma, {{was taken into}} account, and the efficacy of these compounds was analyzed by means of 2 D-, 3 D-QSAR and docking studies with the goal to gain deeper insights into the three-dimensional determinants governing ligands selectivity for PPARs. By multiregressional analysis a correlation between the lipophilicity and PPARalpha activity was found, whereas for PPARgamma the correlation was achieved once efficacy {{was related to the}} presence of polar groups on agonists scaffold. Docking of these compounds further corroborated this hypothesis, and then provided a valid support for subsequent chemometric analysis and pharmacophore models development for both receptors subtypes.

40|$|Tertiary sulfonamidomethyl esters of {{benzylpenicillin}} (4) were synthesised {{and evaluated}} {{as a new}} class of potential prodrugs for beta-lactam antibiotics. Their hydrolysis in aqueous buffers was studied by HPLC and reveal a U-shaped pH-rate profile with a pH-independent process extending from ca. pH 2 to ca. pH 10. This pathway is characterised by kinetic data that are consistent with a unimolecular mechanism involving rate-limiting iminium ion Formation and penicillinoate expulsion. Benzylpenicillin and the corresponding sulfonamide are the ultimate products detected and isolated, indicating that beta-lactam ring opening is much slower than ester hydrolysis. As expected from the high reactivity, benzylpenicillin esters (4) displayed similar in vitro antibacterial activity to benzylpenicillin itself. Compared to the benzylpenicillin derivatives, sulfonamidomethyl esters of benzoic, <b>clofibric</b> and valproic <b>acids</b> display a much higher stability, giving rise to a Bronsted beta(Ig) value of - 0. 96 and suggesting that tertiary sulfonamidomethyl esters may be useful prodrugs for carboxylic acid drugs with pK(a) 4.

Widespread concern about and research into the effect of PPCPs largely started in the early 1990s.

In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on steroid hormones and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as endocrine disruptors. Some research suggests that concentrations of ethinylestradiol, an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1ng/L.|$|R

No change in mass of liver BCODC was detected by immunoblot analysis in response to dietary <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> No changes in abundance of mRNAs for the BCODC E 1 alpha, E 1 beta and E 2 subunits were detected by Northern-blot analysis. Likewise, dietary <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> {{had no effect on}} the activity state of liver BCODC (percentage of enzyme in the dephosphorylated, active, form) of rats fed on a chow diet. However, dietary <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> greatly increased the activity state of liver BCODC of rats fed on a diet deficient in protein. No stable change in liver BCODC kinase activity was found in response to <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> in either chow-fed or low-protein-fed rats. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> had a biphasic effect on flux through BCODC in hepatocytes prepared from low-protein-fed rats. Stimulation of BCODC flux at low concentrations was due to <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> inhibition of BCODC kinase, which in turn allowed activation of BCODC by BCODC phosphatase. Inhibition of BCODC flux at high concentrations was due to direct inhibition of BCODC by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> The results suggest that the effects of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> in vivo on branched-chain amino acid metabolism {{can be explained by the}} inhibitory effects of this drug on BCODC kinase...|$|E

40|$|<b>Clofibric</b> and ethacrynic <b>acids</b> are prototypical {{pharmacological}} agents administered {{in the treatment}} of hypertrigliceridemia and as a diuretic agent, respectively. They share with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (the widely used herbicide known as 2, 4 -D) a chlorinated phenoxy structural moiety. These aryloxoalcanoic agents (AOAs) are mainly excreted by the renal route as unaltered or conjugated active compounds. The relatedness of these agents at the structural level and their potential effect on therapeutically treated or occupationally exposed individuals who are simultaneously undergoing a bacterial urinary tract infection led us to analyze their action on uropathogenic, clinically isolated Escherichia coli strains. We found that exposure to these compounds increases the bacterial resistance to an ample variety of antibiotics in clinical isolates of both uropathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains. We demonstrate that the AOAs induce an alteration of the bacterial outer membrane permeability properties by the repression of the major porin OmpF in a micF-dependent process. Furthermore, we establish that the antibiotic resistance phenotype is primarily due to the induction of the MarRAB regulatory system by the AOAs, while other regulatory pathways that also converge into micF modulation (OmpR/EnvZ, SoxRS, and Lrp) remained unaltered. The fact that AOAs give rise to uropathogenic strains with a diminished susceptibility to antimicrobials highlights the impact of frequently underestimated or ignored collateral effects of chemical agents...|$|R
40|$|In humans, umami taste can {{increase}} the palatability of foods rich in the amino acids glutamate and aspartate and the 5 '-ribonucleotides IMP and GMP. Umami taste is transduced, in part, by T 1 R 1 -T 1 R 3, a heteromeric G-protein coupled receptor. Umami perception is inhibited by sodium lactisole, which binds to the T 1 R 3 subunit in vitro. Lactisole is structurally similar to the fibrate drugs. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> a lipid lowering drug, also binds the T 1 R 3 subunit in vitro. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits the umami taste of glutamate in human subjects. Ten participants rated the umami taste intensity elicited by 20 mM monosodium glutamate (MSG) mixed with varying concentrations of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> (0 to 16 mM). In addition, fourteen participants rated the effect of 1. 4 mM <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> on umami enhancement by 5 ' ribonucleotides. Participants were instructed to rate perceived intensity using a general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS). Each participant was tested in triplicate. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited umami taste intensity from 20 mM MSG in a dose dependent manner. Whereas MSG neat elicited "moderate" umami taste intensity, the addition of 16 mM <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> elicited only "weak" umami intensity on average, and in some subjects no umami taste was elicited. We further show that 1. 4 mM <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> suppressed umami enhancement from GMP, but not from IMP. This study provides in vivo evidence that <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits glutamate taste perception, presumably via T 1 R 1 -T 1 R 3 inhibition, and lends further evidence that the T 1 R 1 -T 1 R 3 receptor is the principal umami receptor in humans. T 1 R receptors are expressed extra-orally throughout the alimentary tract and in regulatory organs and are known to influence glucose and lipid metabolism. Whether <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> as a lipid-lowering drug affects human metabolism, in part, through T 1 R inhibition warrants further examination...|$|E
40|$|Nonenzymatic {{modification}} of proteins by acyl glucuronides is well documented; however, {{little is known}} about their potential to damage DNA. We have previously reported that <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> undergoes glucuronidation-dependent bioactivation to DNA-damaging species in cultured mouse hepatocytes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanisms underlying such DNA damage, and to screen chemically diverse carboxylic acid drugs for their DNA-damaging potential in glucuronidation proficient murine hepatocytes. Cells were incubated with each aglycone for 18 h, followed by assessment of compound cytotoxicity using the MTT assay and evaluation of DNA damage using the Comet assay. Relative cytotoxic potencies were ketoprofen > diclofenac, benoxaprofen, nafenopin >> gemfibrozil, probenecid > bezafibrate > <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> At a noncytotoxic (0. 1 mM) concentration, only benoxaprofen, nafenopin, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> and probenecid significantly increased Comet moments (P < 0. 05 Kruskal-Wallis). <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and probenecid exhibited the greatest DNA-damaging potency, producing significant DNA damage at 0. 01 mM concentrations. The two drugs produced maximal increases in Comet moment of 4. 51 x and 2. 57 x control, respectively. The glucuronidation inhibitor borneol (1 mM) abolished the induction of DNA damage by 0. 5 mM concentrations of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and probenecid. In an in vitro cell-free system, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> glucuronide was 10 x more potent than glucuronic acid in causing DNA strand-nicking, although both compounds showed similar rates of autoxidation to generate hydroxyl radicals. In cultured hepatocytes, the glycation inhibitor, aminoguanidine, and the iron chelator, desferrioxamine mesylate, inhibited DNA damage by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas the free radical scavengers Trolox and butylated hydroxytoluene, and the superoxide dismutase mimetic bis- 3, 5 -diisopropylsalicylate had no effect. In conclusion, clinically relevant concentrations of two structurally unrelated carboxylic acids, probenecid and <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> induced DNA damage in isolated hepatocytes via glucuronidation- dependent pathways. These findings suggest acyl glucuronides are able to access and damage nuclear DNA via iron-catalyzed glycation/glycoxidative processes.

40|$|Clofibrate {{and many}} of its {{structural}} analogues induce proliferation of peroxisomes in the hepatic parenchymal cells of rodents and certain nonrodent species including primates. This induction is tissue specific, occurring mainly in the liver parenchymal cells {{and to a lesser extent}} in the kidney cortical epithelium. The induction of peroxisomes is associated with a predictable pleiotropic response, characterized by hepatomegaly, and increased activities and mRNA levels of certain peroxisomal enzymes. Using affinity chromatography, we had previously isolated a protein that binds to <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> We now show that this protein is homologous with the heat shock protein HSP 70 family by analysis of amino acid sequences of isolated peptides from trypsin-treated <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> binding protein and by cross-reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against the conserved region of the 70 -kDa heat shock proteins. The clofibric acid-Sepharose column could bind HSP 70 proteins isolated from various species, which could then be eluted with either <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> or ATP.

However, contrary to whole body experiments, gemfibrozil decreased the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis from [14 C]acetate. At 1 mM, gemfibrozil decreased not only the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis, but also the protein conetnt of the cells and peroxisomal enzyme activity, indicating nonspecific inhibition at this concentration. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 25 and 1 mM) increased the activity of peroxisomal enzymes, but decreased the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis. With respect to the direct effect on HMG-CoA reductase in the cell homogenate, gemfibrozil at 0. 25 mM did not affect the activity, but it clearly inhibited the activity at 2 mM and above. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> at 2 mM hardly affected the activity, but it clearly decreased the activity at 5 mM and over.

To determine if such a DNA damage occurs within a cellular environment, the comet assay (i. e. single-cell gel electrophoresis) was used to detect DNA lesions in the nuclear genome of isolated mouse hepatocytes cultured with <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> Overnight exposure to 50 microM and higher concentrations of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> produced concentration-dependent increases in the comet areas of hepatocyte nuclei, with 1 mM clofibrate producing a 3. 6 -fold elevation over controls. These effects closely coincided with culture medium concentrations of the glucuronide metabolite formed from <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> 1 -O-beta-clofibryl glucuronide. Consistent with a role for glucuronidation in the DNA damage observed, the glucuronidation inhibitor borneol diminished glucuronide formation from 100 microM clofibrate by 98 % and returned comet areas to baseline levels. Collectively, these results suggest that the acyl glucuronide formed from <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> is capable of migrating from its site of formation within the endoplasmic reticulum to generate strand nicks in nuclear DNA.

The hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis) activity of peroxisomes and microsomes was greatly increased by in vivo treatment with gemfibrozil, but was decreased by addition of the agent to the assay mixture of the enzyme.

40|$|Using {{morphological}} and biochemical (Western blot {{and cell}} fractionation) methods, we investigated whether peroxisomes {{are present in}} human extravillous trophoblast cells. Immortalized extravillous trophoblast cells (TCL- 1) were incubated in {{the presence or absence}} of 0. 5 mM <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> for 3 d. In immunofluorescence staining of trophoblast cells with antibodies anti-catalase and anti-acyl-CoA oxidase (marker enzymes of peroxisomes), electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, peroxisomes were detected in the cells. The size and number of peroxisomes in the trophoblast cells were smaller than those in rat liver. The number of peroxisomes was increased by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> In Western blot experiment with antibodies anti-peroxisomal enzymes of β-oxidation system, densitometric analysis revealed approximately two fold increase in staining by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> When we performed cell fractionation experiment using catalase as one of the peroxisomal marker enzymes, the highest activity of catalase was found in the light mitochondrial fraction. Specific activity of catalase in the light mitochondrial fraction was significantly increased to about 1. 3 times higher than the control value by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> treatment. Upon Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation, the catalase activity was concentrated in the density fraction around 1. 14 ? 1. 15. These findings suggest that microperoxisomes, which have a density smaller than those of rat hepatic peroxisomes, do exist in human extravillous trophoblast cells. It may also be possible to proliferate human peroxisomes in limited quantities using peroxisome proliferator of rodents...|$|E

R-(+) propionic and butyric acid enantiomers, unlike achiral <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and the S-(-) isomers, did not inhibit chloride conductance in rat extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers in vitro but, like <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and the S-(-) isomers, retained the serum cholesterol lowering activity in a cholesterol-fed rat model.

40|$|In recent years, the {{occurrence}} and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the aquatic environment {{has been recognized}} as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> ibuprofen and carbamazepine are some of the most frequently found PhACs in environmental monitoring studies. Some xenobiotics have already been successfully removed from contaminated waters using constructed wetlands (CW). Depuration of wastewaters in CWs is achieved by the concerted action between plant rhizomes, microorganisms and matrix component. CWs efficiency can be significantly improved by careful selection of the matrix, plants and microorganism used. Among several physico-chemical phenomena, sorption by the matrix plays an important role in the PhACs removal mechanism. It is important to select a matrix with a high sorption capacity, which depends on the physico-chemical properties of the material chosen. Previous studies carried out by the authors showed that expanded clay (LECA) presents a high sorptive affinity by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> [1]. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the capacity of LECA to remove other PhACs, namely ibuprofen and carbamazepine, and compare the results obtained with these pharmaceuticals with those obtained previously with <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, other materials were tested for the removal of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and the results were compared with those obtained with LECA. The ultimate objective of this work will be to optimize the performance of this component in the overall performance of a constructed wetlands system designed for the removal of PhACs from wastewaters...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of the hepatic {{level of}} fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) by hormones and p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (<b>clofibric</b> <b>acid)</b> was studied. The hepatic level of FABP, {{measured}} as the oleic acid-binding {{capacity of the}} cytosolic FABP fraction, was decreased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. The level of FABP was markedly increased in adrenalectomized rats, and the elevation was prevented by the administration of dexamethasone. Hypothyroidism decreased the level of FABP and hyperthyroidism increased it. A high correlation between the incorporation of [14 C]oleic acid in vivo into hepatic triacylglycerol {{and the level of}} FABP was found for normal, diabetic and adrenalectomized rats. The level of FABP was increased by administration of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> to rats in any altered hormonal states, as was microsomal 1 -acylglycerophosphocholine (1 -acyl-GPC) acyltransferase, a peroxisome-proliferator-responsive parameter. These results suggest that the hepatic level of FABP is under regulation by multiple hormones and that <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> induces FABP and 1 -acyl-GPC acyltransferase by a mechanism which may be distinct from that by which hormones regulate the level of FABP...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of hyperlipidemia reduces glomerular {{injury in}} obese Zucker rats. Hyperlipidemic obese Zucker rats develop {{albuminuria}} and spontaneous focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) {{at an early}} age, despite normal glomerular capillary pressures and nephron plasma flows. To investigate the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of FGS, pharmacologic agents were used to reduce serum lipids in male, obese Zucker rats. Eight rats were treated from 8 to 40 weeks of age with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, mevinolin (group I). A separate group of seven obese rats was treated with the structurally-unrelated lipid lowering agent, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> (group II). Results from these two groups were compared to controls injected with vehicle only (group III). Body weight and food intake were similar in all three groups. Mevinolin reduced both serum cholesterol and fasting triglyceride levels while <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> lowered only serum cholesterol. Urine albumin excretion was reduced in groups I and II compared to group III. Mesangial matrix expansion and cellularity were both reduced by mevinolin and <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, the percent of glomeruli with focal glomerulosclerosis was much less in groups I (0. 4 ± 0. 1 %) and II (1. 3 ± 0. 7 %) compared to group III (4. 6 ± 0. 7 %, P < 0. 05). Micropuncture studies, carried out in separate groups of obese rats, demonstrated that mevinolin and <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> did not affect glomerular hemodynamic function. Although the precise mechanism remains to be defined, {{these results suggest that}} abnormal lipid metabolism may be important in the pathogenesis of FGS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> (CLF), {{the main}} {{pharmacologically}} active metabolite of blood lipid regulating pharmaceutical clofibrat, etofibrat, etofyllinclofibrat {{is one of the}} most widely reported drugs found in water. It is hardly or not degraded by the conventional technology used in wastewater treatment plants. RESULTS Sixteen new filamentous bacteria belonging to genus Streptomyces spp. isolated from different Romanian soil samples and three strains from a collection of microorganisms (MIUG) were morphologically characterized, tested based on their resistance against <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> toxicity and then investigated as bioremediation agents. Only five Streptomyces spp. isolates coded MIUG 4. 88, MIUG 4. 89, LP 1, LP 2, SNA, showed high CLF tolerance at most of the concentrations tested (0. 2, 0. 5, 1, 5, 8 [*]mg[*]L− 1). CONCLUSION The data obtained showed that only the strain Streptomyces MIUG 4. 89 presents promising potential for <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> biodegradation, with an elimination yield of 35 %, which was not reported for this class of bacteria to date. However, further research is needed for optimization of the CLF biodegradation conditions to enhance its bioremediation yield especially in polluted aquatic systems. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Fibrates {{have been}} {{reported}} to elevate the hepatic proportion of oleic acid (18 : 1 n- 9) through inducing stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Despite abundant studies on the regulation of SCD in the liver, little is known about this issue in the small intestine. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> on the fatty acid profile, particularly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and the SCD expression in intestinal mucosa. Treatment of rats with a diet containing 0. 5 % (w/w) <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> for 7 days changed the MUFA profile of total lipids in intestinal mucosa; the proportion of 18 : 1 n- 9 was significantly increased, whereas those of palmitoleic (16 : 1 n- 7) and cis-vaccenic (18 : 1 n- 7) acids were not changed. Upon the treatment with <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> SCD was induced and the gene expression of SCD 1, SCD 2, and fatty acid elongase (Elovl) 6 was up-regulated, but that of Elovl 5 was unaffected. Fat-free diet feeding for 28 days increased the proportions of 16 : 1 n- 7 and 18 : 1 n- 7, but did not effectively change that of 18 : 1 n- 9, in intestinal mucosa. Fat-free diet feeding up-regulated the gene expression of SCD 1, but not that of SCD 2, Elovl 6, or Elovl 5. These results indicate that intestinal mucosa significantly changes its MUFA profile in response to challenges by <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and a fat-free diet and suggest that up-regulation of the gene expression of SCD along with Elovl 6 is indispensable to elevate the proportion of 18 : 1 n- 9 in intestinal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} found to inhibit the gelling of sickle cell hemoglobin. We have tried to correlate the antigelling activity of such compounds with the stereo-chemistry of their binding sites in the hemoglobin molecule. This approach led to the discovery that two known antilipoproteinemia drugs, clofibrate and gemfibrozil, have antigelling activity. X-ray analysis showed that three pairs of molecules of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> the active metabolite of clofibrate, bound to the walls of the internal cavity of deoxyhemoglobin A; only one pair bound to a quite different site, between helices A, E, and H of the alpha chains of carbon monoxide hemoglobin A.

40|$|Ozonation is {{particularly}} {{suited for the}} treatment of recalcitrant soil contaminants. <b>Clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> an active metabolite of some blood lipid regulators, was used as a model organic contaminant, and quartzite as a model soil. The measurements performed at different pHs, both in slurries of contaminated soil and in <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> aqueous solutions, indicate that a markedly higher TOC removal can be obtained in the slurry mode. It has been demonstrated that <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> can be effectively removed from contaminated soils by a direct treatment with ozone in a slurry system. In terms of TOC removal degree, this treatment appears to be more effective than a two-stage process, which consists of washing the contaminated solid with water and subsequently ozonating the liquid solution obtained. The enhanced reactivity of the contaminated slurry was also evident when measuring the time evolution of the CA-quartzite sandwater system. A simplified model of the slurry system was developed and interesting results were obtained by using {{at the same time the}} data collected in three runs at a fixed pH. Work is in progress to improve the results obtained in this investigation by separately studying the release of CA from contaminated quartzite sand to the liquid phase and the ozonation of aqueous CA solutions...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{pollutants}} {{inherent in}} reclaimed municipal wastewater, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and {{personal care products}} (PPCPs), often have cast uncertainties on the safety of water reuse. We examined the fate and transport behavior of several PPCP and EDC compounds through observations made at experimental turf fields irrigated with naproxen, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, estrone, 4 -tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A, 4 -n-nonylphenol, and triclosan latent irrigation water. The potential of the compounds to contaminate underlying groundwater was assessed using three screening protocols that employed the attributes of soils, chemicals, and water fluxes as the estimators. No compound was detected in the leachate draining through the 89 -cm profile of a loamy sand soil and a sandy loam soil turf grass field during four months of irrigation according to operations typical of golf courses in southern California (USA). Ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, bisphenol A, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> and estrone were detected in the surface to 30 -cm soil profiles. Higher irrigation rate and coarser textural soil enhanced the downward movement of chemicals in both soils. The pollution risk screenings identified the same six compounds as having the potential to contaminate groundwater, and under conditions of turf grass irrigation, <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and ibuprofen would be most prone to cause the pollution...|$|E
40|$|Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) {{adsorption}} was {{studied in}} order to determine the influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the adsorption of two acidic pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> and ketoprofen. Suwannee River humic acids (SRHAs) was used as substitute of NOM in natural water. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to obtain the single compound adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm with and without SRHAs in the system. Three main findings resulted from this study. First, the adsorption isotherms showed that the adsorption of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> was not significantly affected in the presence of SRHAs (5 ppm); however, the adsorption of ketoprofen markedly decreased with SRHAs in the solutions. Higher initial concentrations of <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> than ketoprofen together with the compressed double layer theory helped explain the different behaviors that were observed. Furthermore, the more hydrophobic ketoprofen molecules may increase the possibility that this compound would adsorb less on the surface area which was covered by the more hydrophilic humic acids. Second, the adsorption kinetics of both compounds were not affected by the SRHAs, although more research may be needed, as it is possible that slight differences exist during the initial adsorption phase. Lastly, possible intermolecular forces were discussed and a sequence of importance is proposed for their role in the adsorption process as A). electrostatic forces; B). electron donor-acceptor interaction; C & D). H-bond and London Dispersion forces. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Clinical use of fibrate hypolipidaemic agents {{has been}} {{associated}} with an increased incidence of hepatobiliary dysfunction including increased bile lithogenicity, gallstone formation, and cholestasis. The hepatic transport of bile acids {{plays an important role in}} bile formation and flow, and interference with the hepatocellular transport of bile acids may result in hepatobiliary dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gemfibrozil and <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> on the uptake of taurocholate by rat isolated hepatocytes. In control hepatocyte preparations (N = 5) at 37 degrees, the uptake of taurocholate was described by saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a mean (+/-SD) Km of 44. 1 +/- 10. 2 microM and Vmax of 62. 0 +/- 23. 0 nmol/ 10 (6) cells/min. In the presence of 200 microM <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid,</b> there was no significant change in the kinetics of taurocholate uptake. However, in the presence of 200 microM gemfibrozil there was a statistically significant (P 0. 05) in Km (48. 5 +/- 29. 5 microM, N = 5). Gemfibrozil behaved as a non-competitive inhibitor of taurocholate uptake, with a Ki of 144 microM, which is approximately 50 times higher than the unbound gemfibrozil concentrations achieved clinically in humans. Thus, gemfibrozil and <b>clofibric</b> <b>acid</b> did not appear to directly alter the hepatic uptake of taurocholate at clinically relevant concentrations...|$|E
