5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech.

40|$|Often, {{discussions of}} {{wrongful}} <b>convictions</b> focus {{almost entirely on}} the wrongfully convicted and ignore two important constituencies: prosecutors and crime victims. Both constituencies have unique connections to wrongful <b>convictions</b> and should be recognized as potentially powerful allies for change. Prosecutors are deeply committed to justice and to the outcomes of their cases; they can help identify and correct wrongful <b>convictions</b> and introduce policies to avoid wrongful <b>convictions</b> in the first place. Wrongful <b>convictions</b> matter to crime victims because convicting the wrong person leaves the real perpetrator free to commit more crimes, creates a new, innocent victim, and drains resources that could be devoted to victim services. The authors argue for a broader recognition of the strong interest prosecutors and crime victims have in avoiding wrongful <b>convictions</b> and a more robust role for both stakeholders in the discussion...|$|R
40|$|Although no {{one knows}} {{precisely}} how many wrongful <b>convictions</b> occur each year, a study examining DNAexoneration cases estimated that in 3. 3 % to 5 % of the capital rape-murder <b>convictions</b> in the U.

If this percentage of wrongful <b>convictions</b> applied to other types of crimes, there would be 33, 000 to 50, 000 wrongful felony <b>convictions</b> {{per year in the}} U. S. Eyewitness error {{is the leading cause of}} wrongful <b>convictions.</b> In fact, Professor Gary Wells and other prominent eyewitness researchers stated that “cases of proven wrongful <b>convictions</b> of innocent people have consistently shown that mistaken eyewitness identification is responsible for more of these wrongful <b>convictions</b> than all the other causes combined. ” For example, in the first 271 DNA-exoneration cases, eyewitness error occurred in 75 % of the cases.
