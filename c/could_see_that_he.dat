25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was already there.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Hand {{concedes that}} this was perhaps a mistake and that perhaps he should have re-negotiated the offer. In the foreword, Sather {{expressed}} his disappointment that [...] "he didn't accept my deal because he could have advanced in North America. His progress would have been celebrated." [...] Indeed, Sather also says [...] "At the training camp I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a great ability to read the ice {{and he was the}} smartest player there other than Wayne Gretzky. He skated well: his intelligence on the ice stood out. He was a real prospect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To think," [...] said Maryann, {{with a quiet}} laugh, as {{she handed}} {{a cup of tea}} to Bunco--"to think that I should ever come for to sit at tea with a live red Indian from Ameriky--not <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> red either, for I'm sure that hany one with eyes in their 'ead <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> only brown." ...|$|R
60|$|From the baffled {{look upon}} Holmes's face, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|R
60|$|Lucy, or {{any other}} girl, <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> was evading the truth. She flashed a look from Slone to her father.|$|R
2500|$|Britannicus was cremated and his ashes {{placed with}} those of his father in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Nero held his funeral {{the very next day}} in the rain and gave no eulogy, saying it was [...] "a {{tradition}} in the case of untimely deaths not to oppress the public with eulogies and processions." [...] Dio says that Nero had the corpse covered in gypsum to cover the effects of the poison on the skin. While he was being carried through the Forum, the rain had uncovered the body making plain to all who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been poisoned. Author and historian Beacham considers Dio's account to be [...] "theatrical".|$|E
2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves. In the opening game he writes that [...] "Sherwin slid the rook with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move." [...] In another game he recalls that [...] "Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this point. Petrosian made a wry face which {{looked to me like}} 'Can Black do this and live?'." [...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move as though it was the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37). [...] "From the glint in his eye I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had come prepared for my King's Indian" [...] (on the game against Botvinnik).|$|E
2500|$|Nechayev {{began to}} tell me his plans for {{carrying}} out a revolution in Russia in the near future. I felt terrible: it was really painful {{for me to say}} [...] "That's unlikely," [...] "I don't know about that". I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act â€“ wasn't he the ringleader of the students? ... I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me... And what did I know of [...] "the people"? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her on this with {{conscious}} inconsistency, and she <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had changed colour. But he was always easy.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was staggered; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>he</b> was sly {{enough at}} the same time to hold his tongue and wait till I said {{something}} more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Read this, Bertie!" [...] I <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was waving}} a letter or {{something}} equally foul in my face. [...] "Wake up and read this!" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the unfortunate}} {{individual}} came in sight. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was completely exhausted.|$|E
60|$|Miller was shaken. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> sat {{like one}} who has been dealt a {{stunning}} blow.|$|E
60|$|Later {{in the day}} {{he came to me}} again. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had made}} no fresh discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, don't go down!" [...] cried Richard in alarm. [...] "I <b>could</b> plainly <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was in a}} bad temper, and you'll {{only get}} {{yourself}} into trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|The hired man had reloaded {{the shotgun}} and also brought some {{additional}} ammunition with him. He was nervous {{and the boys}} <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not relish continuing the pursuit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fifteen years!" [...] responded the other. He {{cast his}} eyes upwards {{and his lips}} twitched. The most casual {{observer}} <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was engaged in calculations of an abstruse and elusive nature.|$|R
60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not very much pleased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! Me, of {{all people}} in the world!" [...] he {{repeated}} portentously. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was frightened. Such want of tact! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Palliser!" [...] said she;--and {{though she}} made no scene, though she merely glanced upon him once, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wrong.|$|E
6000|$|Joe {{spoke in}} a matter-of-fact tone; but it <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was laboring under no less {{excitement}} than the sailor; and the latter, beginning to realize the weakness of their position, asked hoarsely: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my lady," [...] said he, ere {{she could}} speak, [...] "I heard that this good fellow was here, {{and came home}} as fast as I <b>could,</b> to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> told you as few lies as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'But {{you were}} {{regularly}} hiding, Mr. Crow!' I cried, {{and do you}} know, that mixed him up so much that if there hadn't been feathers on his head I really believe you <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was blushing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} George doubtfully. Harold {{looking down}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was holding the}} lantern above his head and staring at something very hard.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|E
60|$|His {{face grew}} a trifle more animated; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was recovering. The dumb stupor which had held his {{features}} rigid was passing away.|$|E
60|$|For the Japanese and {{all that}} they had done in two short generations, he {{went so far as}} to express real admiration, a very rare thing with Oro, who was by nature critical. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> mentally <b>he</b> put a white mark against their name.|$|R
60|$|Master Plummer made no reply; but his {{companion}} <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suffering severely from such unusual exertions. His fat face {{was of a}} deep crimson hue; tiny streams of perspiration ran down his cheeks, and he breathed like one affected with the asthma.|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. I did {{n't answer}} him, of course. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn't telling the truth.|$|R
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was relieved. I {{think he}} had expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed the}} lantern upon an upright sack of mealies, and {{carefully}} balanced {{it before he}} answered. Jess <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was taking time to consider.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was interested, and I {{knew that}} as I spoke {{he had looked}} {{through the window and}} seen the man writing the letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not {{inclination}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted, Elinor; I <b>could</b> plainly <b>see</b> <b>THAT.</b> <b>He</b> had not {{the power}} of accepting it. I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me {{as well as to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{walked a}} few steps away, and stood with his face hidden from me, {{thinking}} again. All I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{took off his hat}} and passed his handkerchief over his forehead. All I could hear was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> talked to himself excitedly in his own language.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> already <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should be}} able to extract no consent from her; he felt rather sick. [...] "It's {{extraordinary}} to me that you should n't be more afraid of being found out," [...] he said after a moment's reflection. [...] "There are two or three possible accidents." ...|$|R
