40|$|The risk of {{developing}} colorectal cancer has been compared in two identically selected cohorts of patients with extensive Crohn's colitis (n = 125) and extensive ulcerative colitis (n = 486). In both groups the effects of selection bias have been reduced wherever possible. There was an 18 -fold increase in the risk {{of developing}} colorectal cancer in extensive Crohn's colitis and a 19 -fold increase in risk in extensive ulcerative colitis when compared with the general population, matched for age, sex, and years at risk. The <b>absolute</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>frequency</b> of risk for developing colorectal cancer in extensive colitis was 8 % at 22 years from onset of symptoms in the Crohn's disease group and 7 % at 20 years from onset in the ulcerative colitis group. The relative risk of colorectal cancer was increased in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease among those patients whose colitis started before the age of 25 years. Whether the absolute risk is greater in the younger age group or merely reflects that the expected number of carcinomas increases with age is uncertain. While there is an increased {{risk of developing}} colorectal cancer in extensive colitis the number of patients with Crohn's disease who actually develop colorectal cancer is small because many patients with extensive Crohn's colitis undergo colectomy early {{in the course of their}} disease to relieve persistent symptoms unresponsive to medical treatment...|$|R

In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in {{the first few years of}} the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> have different profile depending on the average annual <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning.

40|$|Increasingly, {{reliable}} <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> {{and orientation}} maps are needed, e. g. for image enhancement. Less studied is however the mutual dependence of both maps, {{and how to}} estimate them when none is known initially. We introduce a logarithmic scale space generated by the trace of Structure Tensor to study the relationship. The scale space is non-linear and <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation is reduced to an orientation estimation in it. We show that this offers significant advantages, including construction of efficient estimation methods, using Structure Tensor yielding dense maps of <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> as well as orientation. In fingerprints, both maps can successively improve each other, combined in an image enhancement scheme via Gabor filtering. We verify that the suggested method compares favorably with state of the art, using forensic fingerprints recognition as test bed, and using test images where the ground truth is known. Furthermore, we suggest a novel continuous ridge counting method, relying only on dense <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> and orientation maps, without ridge detection, thinning, etc. We present new evidence that the neighborhoods of the <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> map are useful attributes of minutiae.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> {{measurements}} of a commercial high power CW diode-pumped solid-state laser (Coherent Verdi-V 5). This kind of lasers usually presents large frequency jitter (up to 50 MHz) both {{in the short term}} (1 ms time scale) and in the long term (> 10 s time scale). A precise measurement of <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> deviations in both temporal scales should require a set of different devices (optical cavities, optical wave-meters), each suited for measurements only at a specific integration time. Here we demonstrate how a frequency comb can be used to overcome this difficulty, allowing in a single step a full characterization of both short (103 s) <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> jitter with a resolution better than 1 MHz. We demonstrate in this way the flexibility of optical <b>frequency</b> combs for <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements not only of ultra-stable lasers but also of relatively unstable lasers. The <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> calibration of the Verdi laser that we have obtained have been used in order to improve the accuracy of the measurements of the local gravitational acceleration value with 88 Sr atoms trapped in 1 D vertical lattices...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} empirical question regarding {{judgments about}} events is whether experienced <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> or relative. frequencies are relied {{on when the}} likelihood of a particular occurrence is judged. The present research explicates the conditions under which people rely on remembered raw <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies</b> versus on inferred relative frequencies or proportions when making predictions. Participants saw opinion poll results for candidates prior to an election and, on the basis of these, made judgments concerning the likelihood of each candidate's winning this election. Certain candidates demonstrated a high <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> of winning in the polls, whereas other candidates had high relative win frequencies. The results indicated that adults are cognitively flexible with regard to the inputs used in this judgment. Certain stimulus event configurations induced reasoning by way of <b>absolute</b> <b>frequencies,</b> whereas other configurations elicited judgments based on relative frequencies. More specifically, as the relational complexity of the event structure increased and more inferences were required to make predictions, the tendency to rely on absolute, as opposed to relative, frequencies also increased...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many women develop {{breast cancer}} after {{treatment}} for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) {{at a young}} age. We estimated this future risk, taking into account age and calendar year of HL diagnosis, HL treatment information, population breast cancer incidence rates, and competing causes of death. METHODS: Relative risks of breast cancer for categories defined by radiation dose to the chest (0, 20 - or = 40 Gy) and use of alkylating agents (yes or no) were estimated from a case-control study conducted within an international population-based cohort of 3817 female 1 -year survivors of HL diagnosed at age 30 years or younger from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1994. To compute <b>cumulative</b> <b>absolute</b> risks of breast cancer, we used modified standardized incidence ratios to relate cohort breast cancer risks {{to those in the}} general population, enabling application of population-based breast cancer rates, and we allowed for competing risks by using population-based mortality rates in female HL survivors. RESULTS: <b>Cumulative</b> <b>absolute</b> risks of breast cancer increased with age at end of follow-up, time since HL diagnosis, and radiation dose. For an HL survivor who was treated at age 25 years with a chest radiation dose of at least 40 Gy without alkylating agents, estimated <b>cumulative</b> <b>absolute</b> risks of breast cancer by age 35, 45, and 55 years were 1. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 9 % to 2. 1 %), 11. 1 % (95 % CI = 7. 4 % to 16. 3 %), and 29. 0 % (95 % CI = 20. 2 % to 40. 1 %), respectively. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>absolute</b> risks were lower in women treated with alkylating agents. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer projections varied considerably by type of HL therapy, time since HL diagnosis, and age at end of follow-up. These estimates are applicable to HL survivors treated with regimens of the past and can be used to counsel such patients and plan management and preventive strategies. Projections should be used with caution, however, in patients treated with more recent approaches, including limited-field radiotherapy and/or ovary-sparing chemotherap...|$|R

Its density, called the absolute risk aversion density, is a generalization of the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, and it is well defined almost everywhere. A strictly increasing and risk averse utility function has decreasing absolute risk aversion if, and only if, it has a decreasing absolute risk aversion density and if, and only if, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absolute</b> risk aversion function is increasing and concave. This leads to a convenient characterization of all such utility functions. Analogues of all the results also hold for increasing absolute risk aversion, as well as for increasing and decreasing relative risk aversion. Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion; Risk Aversion...|$|R
