5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can <b>code</b> <b>for</b> several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA <b>code</b> <b>for</b> a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E

40|$|We present new {{constructions of}} <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> {{asymmetric}} channels for both binary and nonbinary alphabets, based on methods of generalized <b>code</b> concatenation. <b>For</b> the binary asymmetric channel, our methods construct nonlinear single-error-correcting codes from ternary outer codes. We show {{that some of}} the Varshamov-Tenengol'ts-Constantin-Rao codes, a class of binary nonlinear <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> this channel, have a nice structure when viewed as ternary codes. In many cases, our ternary construction yields even better <b>codes.</b> <b>For</b> the nonbinary asymmetric channel, our methods construct linear <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> many lengths and distances which are superior to the linear codes of the same length capable of correcting the same number of symmetric errors. In the binary case, Varshamov has shown that almost all good linear <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> the asymmetric channel are also good for the symmetric channel. Our results indicate that Varshamov's argument does not extend to the nonbinary case, i. e., one can find better linear <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> asymmetric channels than for symmetric ones.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{construct}} systematic error-correcting <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> permutations and multi permutations in the Kendall’s τ-metric.

In particular, for a given t and for sufficiently large k we can obtain r = t+ 1.

5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole the source <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with <b>code</b> <b>for</b> the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E
