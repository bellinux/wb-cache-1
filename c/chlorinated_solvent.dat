40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the potential applications of stable isotope ratio measurements in characterization of the source terms, the transport, and the fate of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> in groundwater aquifers. The approach to this research was threefold: to develop methods for the sampling and isotopic analysis of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> in groundwaters; to perform laboratory experiments to measure equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects associated with biological and physical transformation processes of chlorinated solvents; and to perform field investigations at well-characterized, contaminated aquifer sites to demonstrate the applicability of the isotopic approach in real-world situations. New methods were developed for the extraction and isotopic analysis of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> in water samples. The new methods were applied to a series of laboratory experiments assessing the isotope effects associated with biological and physical transformation processes. The authors found that a large kinetic isotope effect was caused by microbial degradation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents,</b> under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The evaporation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> also caused a large isotope effect, but in that case the carbon isotopic fractionation was in the reverse sense. Isotopic fractionation associated with adsorption and chemical exchange of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> was negligible. The authors performed field investigations at five present and former industrial sites undergoing various stages of remediation. These investigations were collaborative with Lockeed-Martin Energy Systems, Inc., and ENSR, Inc., the companies responsible for the remedial work at these sites. Application of the new sampling and analytical methods at these sites showed that stable isotopic measurements yield powerful insights into underground processes. In particular, they found positive evidence for in-situ microbial degradation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> at all five sites, evidence for volatilization of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> at three sites, and evidence for multiple sources of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> at two sites. At a site where six-phase heating was applied, they found evidence for increased solubilization of pure phase <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents</b> during heating. The general conclusion of the field investigations is that stable isotope measurements should become an essential component in site characterization and remediation of sites contaminated with <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvents...</b>|$|R

World leaders have instituted a production ban of certain ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) by 1996.

In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined nearly all solvent-based cleaners as 'hazardous'.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} associated with remediation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> groundwater contamination {{is the presence of}} NAPLs in the source zone. NAPLs are often better treated through solvent extraction, surfactant washing, or vapor extraction than through bioremediation. Removal of NAPL through solvent extraction would likely leave a substantial residual of both the extraction solvent and the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent.</b> We hypothesized that utilization of the remaining extraction solvent as an electron donor could be exploited to clean up the remaining <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> following source zone remediation. The main question is whether a suitable extraction solvent could work as an electron donor to drive reductive dechlorination. Many different compounds have been used as electron donors to stimulate reductive dechlorination, including volatile fatty acids (VFAs), sugars, hydrogen, and polymeric compounds. Generally, it is regarded that fermentation of compounds yields hydrogen, the true electron donor for reductive dechlorination. Compounds with high hydrogen yields generally are thought to be the best electron donors for bioremediation. After looking at several potential candidate solvents that might serve as electron donors for reductive dechlorination, we decided t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{containment}} {{has several}} advantages for managing <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> plumes, {{but is not}} considered at many sites because of the perception {{that it does not}} remove or destroy contaminant mass. Because of this perception, other remediation approaches that do remove mass are often favored, even if they remove it slowly (such as natural attenuation) or are expensive (long-term pumping). Our biodegradation research indicates that barrier systems will result in increased contaminant destruction at many <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> sites. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> biodegradation occurs when electron donors (carbon substrates that form dissolved hydrogen) are utilized by naturally-occurring dechlorinating bacteria in the subsurface to consume electron acceptors (the chlorinated solvents). This process occurs naturally at many sites (when source materials contain both solvents and electron donors), and can be enhanced by supplementing the electron donor supply. However, our research shows that the efficiency of naturally-occurring and enhanced biodegradation is compromised by the transport of competing electron acceptors (i. e., dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate) to solvent biodegradation zones via the flow of clean upgradient groundwater through the source...|$|E
