50|$|Due to the {{importance}} of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with <b>company</b> <b>standards,</b> than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.|$|E

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with its Self-help Center, ILD {{has launched a}} blog on its website to keep merchants and consumers informed of its business activities.

Though ILD processes over 120 million transactions each year for buyers and merchants—over a half of a billion dollars in purchases—only a small fraction result in disputes and chargebacks, much like credit cards. When there are disputes, ILD investigates these with its merchants and makes sure that credits are applied back to the phone bill, just like credit card <b>company</b> <b>standards.</b> ILD continually monitors complaint levels against the merchant who the bills through us, and if it finds a merchant in violation of ILD policies, it has and will terminate their billing agreement.|$|E
