5|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) {{held the}} first major chess tournament for computers, the North American <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship, in September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won the championship. Nowadays, chess {{programs}} compete in the World <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship, held annually since 1974. At first considered only a curiosity, the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws). In 2009, a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. The best chess programs {{are now able to}} consistently beat the strongest human players, to the extent that human-computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media.|$|E

In July 2013, a previously unpublished review of the film <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> appeared on Ebert's website. The review had been written in March but had remained unpublished until the film's wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor for Ebert's website, confirmed {{that there were other}} unpublished reviews that would be eventually uploaded to the website. A second posthumously published review, for The Spectacular Now, was published in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|Chess Engines Grand Tournament (CEGT) tests <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> engines {{by playing}} them against each other, with time {{controls}} of 40 moves in 120 minutes per player (40/120), and also 40/20 and 40/4, {{and uses the}} results of those games to compile a rating list for each time control. At the slowest time control (40/120), White has scored 55.4% (W34.7 D41.3 L24.0) in games played among 38 of the strongest chess engines (as of May 27, 2009). At 40/20, White has scored 54.6% (W37.0 D35.2 L27.8) in games played among 284 engines (as of May 24, 2009). At the fastest time control (40/4), White has scored 54.8% (W39.6 D30.5 L30.0), in games played among 128 programs (as of May 28, 2009).|$|E

5|$|The team {{travels to}} Mogadishu, Somalia, and acquires the {{targeting}} device from pirate Ellyas Abshir (Kevin Daniels). They then {{travel to the}} Swiss Alps to obtain the killing agent, thorium. Volkoff manages to access the vault by winning a game of <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> before a timer expires and triggers several turrets. Outside, Sarah and Casey detect Russian chatter and rush to Chuck's aid, only to become trapped by Vivian, who is not injured. When Volkoff asks his daughter to release him, she refuses, feeling deceived and abandoned by him. She takes the thorium and leaves everyone in the vault with armed plasma bombs which Volkoff deactivates with a portable EMP generator. At Castle, Volkoff says goodbye to Mary before being returned to custody.|$|E
25|$|The first chess engine (a chess playing {{computer}} program) to beat {{a person}} in tournament play was the Mac Hack Six, in 1967. Soon after, tournaments were created just for chess computers. In 1970, the first North American <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship (NACCC) was held in New York City, and in 1974, the first World <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship (WCCC) was held in Stockholm. Kaissa, a chess program of the Soviet Union was named the world's first <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> champion. In 1995, the first World Computer Speed Chess Championship was held in Paderborn, Germany for blitz chess. For a time, computers competed in human tournaments as well, but computers have become so strong that humans are {{no longer able to}} compete with them; players now tend to treat them as analysis tools rather than as opponents. Interest remains in <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> tournaments, especially the World <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship and Top Chess Engine Championship. As of 2016, the World <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> champion is Komodo.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the optimal}} {{strategy}} {{of a game}} may not (yet) be known, a game-playing computer might still benefit from solutions of the game from certain endgame positions (in the form of endgame tablebases), which will allow it to play perfectly after {{some point in the}} game. <b>Computer</b> <b>chess</b> programs are well known for doing this.|$|E
25|$|With {{the recent}} growth of <b>computer</b> <b>chess,</b> an {{interesting}} {{development has been}} the creation of endgame databases which are tables of stored positions calculated by retrograde analysis (such a database is called an endgame tablebase).

The Vogelback Computing Center was the first building to open on the Lakefill campus in October 1964.

There are also faster time limit events, the World Rapid Chess Championship and the World Blitz Chess Championship. There is also a World <b>Computer</b> <b>Chess</b> Championship.|$|E
25|$|Handicaps {{were quite}} {{popular in the}} 18th and 19th centuries, when chess was often played for money stakes, in order to induce weaker players to play for wagers. Today, except for time odds, handicaps are rarely seen. Rybka, however, a top-rated <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> engine, played a {{successful}} series of handicap matches in 2007 and 2008 against human chess masters. Considering top engines increase in playing strength each year, human players need considerable odds to have practical chances against strong engines.|$|E
25|$|Research in AI is {{concerned}} with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language, speech and facial recognition. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, knowledge mining, software applications, strategy games like <b>computer</b> <b>chess</b> and other video games. One of the biggest limitations of AI is {{in the domain of}} actual machine comprehension. Consequentially natural language understanding and connectionism (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.|$|E
