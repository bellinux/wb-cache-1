5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E

25|$|Compression of air creates heat; {{the air is}} warmer after compression. Expansion removes heat. If {{no extra}} heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat {{generated}} during compression can be stored and used during expansion, {{the efficiency of the}} storage improves considerably. There are three ways in which a CAES system <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heat. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, or isothermal.|$|E

25|$|Parrots have {{fluorescent}} plumage {{that may}} be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulates) found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. This study suggests that the fluorescent plumage of parrots is not simply a by-product of pigmentation, but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> associated costs.|$|E
500|$|On December 3, 2006, Bayh {{announced}} that he would form an exploratory committee in order for him to travel and raise funds more effectively for a presidential run. Upon this declaration, the candidate appeared on This Week, articulating that Americans [...] "need someone who <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dysfunction here in this city (Washington D.C.) so that our government begins to empower our people to fulfill their potential...if I can be that individual, so be it." [...] His spokesman remarked that the committee would help [...] "to put an infrastructure in place" [...] for the campaign. Bayh immediately returned to the campaign trail following his announcement, traveling back to Iowa on December 4 with approximately $10.6 million to continue spreading his message. The next weekend, Bayh visited New Hampshire to discuss his views on energy independence, global warming and the war in Iraq. But due to the two sold out appearances to the state by Barack Obama, who was recently named a potential candidate, Bayh's trip did not garner much media attention.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: [...] "a guy {{who does not have}} a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life." [...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E

Some in South Korea and abroad believe that dog meat should be expressly legalized so that only authorized preparers <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meat in more humane and sanitary ways, while others think that the practice should be banned by law.|$|E
