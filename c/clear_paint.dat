50|$|Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a {{thermoplastic}} urethane film {{applied to}} painted surfaces {{of a new}} or used car {{in order to protect}} the paint from stone chips, bug splatters, and minor abrasions. This film is also used on airplanes, RVs, cell phones, electronics, screens, motorcycles and many other areas. Paint Protection Film is OEM approved by virtually all car manufacturers. Paint protection film is commonly referred to as clear bra, clear film, <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> film, PPF and other names.|$|E
50|$|The blue, clear (or white), red-brown, {{and green}} paints of the {{manuscript}} have been analyzed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The blue paint proved to be ground azurite with minor traces of the copper oxide cuprite. The <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> is likely a mixture of eggwhite and calcium carbonate, while the green paint is tentatively characterized by copper and copper-chlorine resinate; the crystalline material might be atacamite or another copper-chlorine compound. Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red ochre with the crystal phases hematite and iron sulfide. Minor amounts of lead sulfide and palmierite were possibly present in the red-brown paint. The pigments were considered inexpensive.|$|E
5000|$|During its design, High Speed was jokingly called [...] "High Cost" [...] by some rival Williams {{designers}} {{due to its}} then-high production cost. The {{advances in}} the mechanical design that went into High Speed, coupled with the machine's popularity, led to many machines being kept in service much longer than was previously the norm. The play surfaces of the machine were not initially given as much attention, leading to many High Speed machines seeing service to this day in extremely worn condition. Williams rapidly addressed this issue by making mylar playfield covers available and later adding hard <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> coats to their playfields. Canadian specialist Classic Playfield Reproductions produced an officially licensed High Speed 13-color Reproduction Playfield, which shipped as limited edition in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the daily}} duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or {{flashing}} {{light and the}} word [...] "POLITI" [...] painted on the side in a reflective and <b>clear</b> <b>paint.</b> The most commonly used patrol vehicles are Ford Mondeo, Volkswagen Passat and Opel Vectra, with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre Škoda Superb {{was added to the}} fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litre. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like Peugeot 307, Opel Astra, Ford Focus and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The Peugeot 607 is used as a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. Toyota Landcruiser and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use VW Transporters, while VW LTs and Ford Transit mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the MB Vario is used. It is generally known as the Dutchman's vehicle (in Danish Hollændervogn). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are fitted in the Netherlands as light APC's with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and fire-resistant coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of arrestees. Other vehicles in use are the Mercedes-Benz Vito (used by both Central Turnout Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and Nissan Patrols used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "candy apple red" [...] is {{not just}} the name of a color, it is also implies a {{specific}} paint process for cars and other objects:The phrase candy apple red, describes a very specific paint process first used on custom cars and hot rods sometime in the early 1950s (date not specified, per audio interview with Joe Bailon, candy apple red, inventor,http://www.legends.thewwbc.net/gpage187.html In the candy apple red paint process, the body of the car or other object to be painted must be finished as perfectly as possible to avoid easily visible problems in the finished paint. After the body is properly prepared, primer is applied as usual. Then a highly reflective metallic paint is applied first. This is usually highly reflective silver paint, but the color effect can be modified by using metallic gold or other tinted metallic paint. The key with this first metallic color layer is to reflect as much light as possible. The candy apple red paint is applied on top of the reflective metallic paint. This candy apple red paint is transparent. Many coats are required to achieve the proper appearance-of-depth and richness-of-color. Once the candy apple red color reaches the proper appearance of depth and color intensity, multiple coats of <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> are applied to protect the paint job and add to the feeling of depth of the paint. Candy Apple Red appears so intense, because light passes through the paint, reflects off of the metallic base color, and passes through the paint a second time before we see the color. This causes real candy apple red paint to look far more intense and attractive than conventional paints that happen to use the name [...] "candy apple red" [...] without actually being real candy apple red paint. Candy apple red" [...] paint has been used on many objects other than cars or trucks. Electric guitars, home decor items, loudspeakers, {{and a variety of other}} items have been available (or their owner's had custom paint applied) with candy apple red finish. An early use of candy apple red by an automobile manufacturer was Ford's 1963 Thunderbird Italien concept car that appeared in North American auto shows (including Autorama shows) in 1963 and in the New York Worlds Fair in 1964 in Ford's pavilion. But because of the complexity and time (and cost) required to apply real candy apple red paint to a car, no production cars have been factory-painted with true candy apple red paint unless the car (or truck) came from a smaller specialty manufacturer willing to customize paint to customer's request/sample. Candy apple red paint with silver metallic reflective undercoat looks quite different from candy apple red with gold metallic reflective undercoat. The gold gives the color a warmer look while the silver undercoat gives an intensely red appearance to the paint without the extra warmth of the gold. A more neutral/pure red is the result when silver reflective undercoat is used. Because light reflects in different directions from objects like cars, as you move around the vehicle and see direct and reflected light from different angles, the appearance of the candy apple red paint changes as the light getting to the car and reflecting off of the car changes. This gives real [...] "candy apple red" [...] paint more [...] "life" [...] than more conventional solid red or metallic red paints used on cars, trucks and other vehicles. The original candy apple red car paint had no metallic (tiny flakes of silver metal or plastic) or pearl (tiny flakes of plastic or possibly real particles of the reflective surfaces from seashells). When you viewed the original candy apple red paint, it was simply transparent red paint with no [...] "add ins". More recently, painters have mixed-in metallic, pearl, or metal flake with candy apple red to produce different effects in the finished paint job. Candy apple red has expanded to a whole range of [...] "candy" [...] colors in every shade imaginable. All follow same process of superior body preparation, primer, multiple coats of highly reflective metallic undercoat, many coats of the candy color, and multiple coats of <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> on top. There is a big difference between real candy apple red paint and some car or locomotive color that just happened to be named candy apple red without being real candy apple red paint.|$|E
40|$|The female subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis, {{provisions}} its nymphs by foraging on {{the ground}} in the forest during the Japanese rainy season, and the bug uses homing navigation to drag a drupe back to its burrow by the shortest route during the day. To study whether or not this bug performs this provisioning behaviour under different photic conditions, we observed the homing behaviour and homing direction of bugs in the field around the clock and/or under various weather conditions. The bugs foraged the whole day during the busiest provisioning period, and the number of walking bugs was not affected by the different weather conditions. Such navigational behaviour, regardless of the time of the day and the weather conditions, is rare in insect navigation. To test whether the bug uses visual cues, we covered the compound eyes and ocelli with opaque or <b>clear</b> <b>paint</b> just before homing began. During the day and at night, and in all weather conditions, the homing direction of blind bugs, but not those with clear-painted eyes was disoriented, indicating that this species uses visual cues dominantly under all photic conditions...|$|E
