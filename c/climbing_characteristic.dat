40|$|Hungry rice (Digitaria exilis) {{has been}} largely {{neglected}} by scientists and plant breeders in the past, but it is now being reappraised. Now that consumers have shown that they value it as a food crop, plant breeders are making use of genetic mutation techniques {{in order to improve}} its performance. Always difficult to process, the potential for hungry, rice may be further improved by a Senegalese invention of a decorticator which avoids the need for pounding. Hungry rice, known also as fonio, fundi, ocha and kabuga, grows only in West Africa in a region of some 300, 000 hectares. Annual production is estimated to be about 100, 000 tonnes. It {{can be used as a}} porridge or added to other cereals as meal. It can also be used as fodder and its stems can be used as a roofing material. Hungry rice will tolerate marginal land and, on poor soil, will grow better than any other crop. In fact farmers say that if nothing else will survive on a particular piece of land, then that is the place to sow hungry rice. Although this plant is one of the most hardy in Africa, it possesses a number of drawbacks. One single grain of hungry rice produces a multitude of stems or tillers and while this could be an advantage in terms of density of seedlings, it presents a problem when it comes to weeding because the stems are so fragile. Further more, the rampant, <b>climbing</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the plant makes harvesting difficult and, in any case, yields are very low indeed. It takes between 1. 6 and 2. 5 million hungry rice grains to make one kilo. At the present time, production is no greater than 150 to 600 kg per hectare. Nevertheless, hungry rice is much sought after. In Mali its price is triple that c>f millet and it is sold at double the price of rice or millet flour. Moreover it's consumption is expanding rapidly in towns, in particular for feast days or ceremonies such as the end of Ramadan. Even though research into this cereal has hardly begun, experts acknowledge that it has exceptional nutritional qualities. In contrast to other cereals where the germ, which is rich in fats, never disappears completely when hulled, the hulled grains of hungry rice contain practically no lipids. This is another reason why interest in this crop is growing among agriculturalists and in June 1994 the Programme for the Promotion of Indigenous Cereals of the Sahel in Bamako, Mali dedicated an international workshop to hungry rice. Improving productivity and processing Scientists have started to improve the plant by subjecting it to the now well-proven technique of irradiation in order to stimulate genetic mutations. The project for domesticating hungry rice is being undertaken by M. Sansan Da at the agricultural research station of Farakoba in the west of Burkina Faso and has been assisted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based in Vienna. Although the project has only just begun it is already showing great promise. In order to domesticate such an unimproved plant, it is necessary to modify its genetic characteristics in order to obtain seeds that are more productive and easier to decorticate. This is where irradiation has proved to be important stimulating major disruptions within the chromosomes of the plant and providing plant breeders with a diverse range of new characteristics from which to select the most useful traits. Field trials have been conducted over four years and yields of 2 to 2. 5 tonnes per hectare have been achieved at the agricultural field station at Farakoba. This is a three to four-fold increase over traditional varieties. It seems that despite its reputation for low yields, hungry rice could now achieve the same level of performance as little millet (Panicum sumatrense). Another useful characteristic of the new variety of hungry rice that has been developed by Sansan Da is that it is dehiscent. This means that the husk of the grain has the distinctive characteristic of being slightly open at the top and this tiny detail, visible only with a magnifying glass, is a big step towards the domestication of hungry rice. Unlike other indigenous cereals, traditional landraces of hungry rice have a protective husk to the grain which sticks to it and surrounds it completely. This makes extraction of the germ very difficult and experts think that it is the difficulty of processing hungry rice that makes it so expensive at the market place. With a dehiscent husk, much less energy is required for post-harvest treatment. With a combination of higher yields, improved processing and an already-proven market demand, hungry rice could have a more significant future than might once have been expected.

50|$|As {{understanding}} of thermal soaring {{grew in the}} 1930s, glider pilots and designers became aware of two conflicting requirements for cross country flights. The aircraft needed good <b>climb</b> <b>characteristics</b> and low stalling speeds to enable tight turns within thermals but high speeds in the sinking air between them. These respectively called for low and high wing loadings on wings with high and low camber. Several designs, e.g. the 1938 Akaflieg Hannover AFH-4 and the later LET L-13 Blaník and Beatty-Johl BJ-2, had added large area slotted Fowler flaps on the inner part of the wing to increase camber and add area when extended. These satisfactorily reduced stall speed {{and with it the}} turn radius, but disappointed hopes of improving climb rates because of vortex generation (induced drag) at the tips of the flaps, seriously decreasing the lift to drag ratio. A solution to this problem was to extend the whole trailing edge, including the ailerons, and this route was taken by both the disappointing, heavy and complicated Operation Sigma Sigma, the more successful but still heavy and complex Akaflieg München Mü27 and the World Championship winning 15 m class Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-11.|$|R

I was enabled to observe the spontaneous movements of the petioles better in this than in the two preceding species: one petiole described three small vertical ellipses in the course of 11 hrs., whilst another moved in an irregular spire. Some little time after a stem has twined round an upright stick, and is securely fastened to it by the clasping petioles and tendrils, it emits aerial roots from the bases of its leaves; and these roots curve partly round and adhere to the stick. This species of Bignonia, therefore, combines four different methods of <b>climbing</b> generally <b>characteristic</b> of distinct plants, namely, twining, leaf-climbing, tendril-climbing, and root-climbing.|$|R

40|$|The National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), {{based in}} Fort Collins, CO, is the {{research}} arm for the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service’s Wildlife Services Program. Its {{mission is to}} resolve conflicts between wildlife and humans. The NWRC established a GIS (Geographic Information System) function in 1996. The relevance of GIS to two projects are featured in this poster. Project 1 was conducted in 1996 and was a joint effort between the NWRC and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). In this project, 60 Chinese ring-necked pheasants were radio-instrumented and their movements studied. The main goal {{of the project was}} to determine if there were primary hazards to pheasants {{as a result of the}} application of the rodenticide zinc phosphide in dormant alfalfa for vole management in the northern Sacramento Valley. Through the use of telemetry and GIS, pheasant habitat preferences emerged, and the absence of these birds in dormant alfalfa contributed to the reregistration of zinc phosphide to control voles in this crop. Project 2 was conducted in 2000 under a contract with the Anchorage International Airport Authority. The NWRC was asked to determine bird strike risks to commercial aircraft from waterfowl moving within the Anchorage Basin. Preferred habitats were selected, along with the flight paths of commercial aircraft, to create an area matrix of possible waterfowl-aircraft intersections within which conflict could occur. The potential rehydration of Klatt Bog was a key focus. If the bog was rehydrated, would the airspace around Klatt Bog create a greater risk to aircraft? GIS was used to build a model that represented the conflicted three dimensional airspace at risk, with and without Klatt Bog rehydrated. Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft were selected to represent the upper and lower altitude boundaries during take-off and landing of commercial aircraft. These aircraft were selected after discussion with flight engineers because most other fixed wing commercial and general aviation aircraft fall between the <b>climb</b> <b>characteristics</b> of these two aircraft. Assuming the rehydration of Klatt Bog would increase its suitability as a bird habitat, the conflicted airspace between 501 - 3090 feet in elevation was calculated at 27, 972. 1 x 106 m 3 without inclusion of Klatt Bog and 31, 814. 1 x 106 m 3 with the inclusion of Klatt Bog.

40|$|Rock {{climbing}} {{is undergoing}} unexpectedly rapid growth across the United States {{and around the}} world. Industry estimations in the late 1990 ’s put the number of recreational rock climbers in the United States in the 400, 000 range. In 2013, estimates placed the rock climbing population as larger than eleven million active climbers, an apparent expansion of two orders of magnitude in about twenty years. As the number of rock climbers utilizing protected areas to further their recreation goals increases, so goes the associated impacts those recreationists can have on the resources. From {{what is known about}} recreation impacts to soil and vegetative cover, these impacts grow non-linearly with the amount of use, but asymptotically compared to the number of users. In an era of difficult resource management budgeting and staffing, this use-impact dynamic can grow unchecked. Therefore, this thesis seeks to map existing climbs in a developed climbing area and combine those spatial data with user attribute data towards generating a predictive suitability map for climbs. As climbing grows in popularity, land managers and climbing advocacy organizations both stand to benefit from clearer understanding of the processes driving climb site location selection and ultimately the characteristics observed about the climbing routes created. Resource management is comparatively slow and hemmed in by regulation and planning requirements. What makes a particular area suitable for rock climbing route development is the end result of an extended career as a technical rock climber. A skilled rock climber would be able to explain why a particular site might be better or less suited for climbing development. However most land managers are not experienced rock climbers, requiring the investigation for indicators that would be discernable by a novice. Therefore, the need to link managers and activity participants is great, considering this knowledge gap we ask the question: “To what extent can onsite and user-defined <b>climb</b> <b>characteristics</b> be used to model location and extent of climbing routes’ development by climbers?” Distances (2 -dimensional centroid-to-centroid) between climb sites’ areas of impact, associated approach trail, and ingress/egress points of the canyon area were computed to subsequently determine correlative relationships between number of bolts, as well as horizontal 2 -dimensional linear distance between adjacent climbs. Non-spatial attributes of each climb were also assessed for correlations with the above spatial <b>characteristics</b> of each <b>climb.</b> There were statistical correlations found between the difference in climb quality ratings and the distance to nearest climbs as well as correlations between clustering of climbs and their quality rating. This combined with a willingness to travel the farthest distance possible in the area to reach high quality climbs has many resource management implications both for land managers and users...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in sensing, actuating and communication tecnologies and in theory for control and navigation; mobile robotic platforms are seen more promising than ever. This is so for many fields ranging from search and rescue in earthquake sites to military applications. Autonomous or teleoperated land vehicles make a major class of these mobile platforms. Legged robots, with their potential virtues in obstacle avoidance and cross-country capabilities stand out for applications on rugged terrain. In the nature, {{there are a lot}} of examples where four-legged anatomy embraces both speed and <b>climbing</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This thesis is on the locomotion reference generation of quadruped robots. Reference generation plays a vital role for the success of the locomotion controller. It involves the timing of the steps and the selection of various spatial parameters. The generated references should be suitable to be followed. They should not be over-demanding to cause the robot fall by loosing its balance. Nature tells that the pattern of the steps, that is, the gait, also changes with the speed of locomotion. A well-planned reference generation algorithm should take gait transitions into account. Central Pattern Generators (CPG) are biologically-inspired tools for legged-robot locomotion reference generation. They represent one of the main stream quadruped robot locomotion synthesis approaches, along with Zero Moment Point (ZMP) based techniques and trial–and–error methods. CPGs stand out with their natural convenience for gait transitions. This is so because of the stable limit cycle behavior inhertent in their structure. However, the parameter selection and tuning of this type of reference generators is difficult. Often, trial–and–error iterations are employed to obtain suitable parameters. The background of complicated dynamics and difficulties in reference generation makes automatic tuning of CPGs an interesting area of research. A natural command for a legged robot is the speed of its locomotion. When considered from kinematics point of view, there is no unique set of walking parameters which yield a given desired speed. However, some of the solutions can be more suitable for a stable walk, whereas others may lead to instability and cause robot to fall. This thesis proposes a quadruped gait tuning method based on evolutionary methods. A velocity command is given as the input to the system. A CPG based reference generation method is employed. 3 D full-dynamics locomotion simulations with a 16 -degrees-of-freedom (DOF) quadruped robot model are performed to assess the fitness of artificial populations. The fitness is measured by three different cost functions. The first cost function measures the amount of support the simulated quadruped receives from torsional virtual springs and dampers opposing the changes in body orientation, whereas the second one is a measure of energy efficiency in the locomotion. The third cost function is a combination of the firs two. Tuning results with the three cost functions are obtained and compared. Cross-over and mutation mechanisms generate new populations. Simulation results verify the merits of the proposed reference generation and tuning method...|$|R

40|$|Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are {{an annual}} legume used for human consumption. While many cultivars/genotypes {{have long been}} a feature of New Zealand home gardens and the frozen food market, there has {{recently}} been {{an interest in the}} production of new genotypes of this crop legume suitable for use particularly in fresh and canned salads, as well as for other commercial purposes. In New Zealand, little is known of the growth and performance of many genotypes of this plant as the agro-climatological conditions are different from the original native South American habitat. Therefore this study covered an evaluation of five unnamed but different seed coloured bean genotypes obtained originally from the CIAT collection by New Zealand Seed Bank Ltd. The objectives of this research were to: determine plant growth habit of the genotypes; describe plant growth habit of the genotypes; and assess the effect of plant density on vegetative and reproductive growth, seed yield and cooking quality. To facilitate the recognition of each genotype, they were named white, mottled brown, mottled black, black and brown according to their seed colour, after a visual selection of seeds {{at the beginning of this}} study. Plant morphological characteristics were assessed in a trial conducted in a glasshouse at the Seed Technology Centre, Massey University, from September to November 1994. A field trial from November 1994 to March 1995 was aimed at determining the effects of plant density and genotype on seed production and quality for sowing and eating purposes. The minimum and maximum temperatures in the glasshouse were 16 °C and 25 °C respectively. The daylength in September was around 11 h and gradually increased to about 14. 5 h at the end of November. No supplementary illumination and no pesticides and insecticides were used in this trial. For this study, five plants of each colour group were used to determine plant morphological characteristics which included: leaf length and width for the 1 st, 3 rd and 8 th trifoliolate leaves, recorded from the terminal leaf; length of pedicellate bracts; flower (standard and wing) colour; pod colour, length and width; plant height and branch number; main stem internode number and internode length; pods per plant; and seeds per pod. Trifoliolate leaf length was around 22 cm for all genotypes irrespective of leaf position, but leaf width increased from the 1 st to the 8 th trifoliolate leaf and differed with genotype. For example the 8 th trifoliolate leaf width ranged from 11. 0 cm in the mottled brown genotype to 14. 6 cm in the brown genotype. Pedicellate bract length, main stem internode number and maximum internode length all varied with genotype, with the result that average plant height ranged from 166 cm for the brown genotype to 362 cm for the white genotype. None of the genotypes produced branches in the glasshouse. Flower colour was assessed using the Dictionary of Colour Standards and the Horticultural Colour Chart from the British Colour Council. The standard and wing were white in the white, mottled brown and brown genotypes, mauve in the mottled black genotype, and were either white or mauve to rose purple in the black genotype. The colour of the wing was mauve in the mottled black genotype and was either white or mauve in the black genotype. Pod colour for the white genotype was mimosa yellow to naples yellow, or mottled with either aster violet or hyacinth blue, while in the mottled brown genotype pod colour was predominantly naples yellow, mottled with china rose or also with chrysanthemum crimson. Pods from the mottled black genotype were mimosa yellow to amber yellow in colour, and sometimes mottled with purple brown. Pods from the black genotype were mimosa yellow or naples yellow and were either slightly mottled with lilac purple or with pansy violet, while pod colour from the brown genotype was erythrite red. Dried pod length varied from 9. 3 to 12. 1 cm in the brown and white genotypes respectively, while dried pod width ranged from 11. 8 mm in the mottled black to 12. 8 mm in the white genotype. The number of pods per plant varied from 13 in the mottled brown to 16 in the brown genotype, while seeds per pod varied from 4. 4 in the brown genotype to 5. 8 in the while genotype. Daylength for the field trial ranged from 14. 5 h (November) to around 12. 3 h (March), with a maximum daylength of about 15 h in December. Seeds from the same seed colour groups used for the glasshouse studies were used in the field trial which was located at the Frewen's block, Massey University. Seeds were sown at three different rates (2. 8, 5. 6 and 8. 4 g/m 2) by cone seeder on 28 November 1994 to obtain densities of 6. 6, 13. 3 and 20. 0 plants/m 2 at row spacings of 60, 30 and 20 cm respectively. Within the rows a uniform space of 25 cm was maintained. Each treatment (plant density x genotype) was replicated four times in a split plot design. For seed development studies, a total of 450 - 460 flowers per genotype (from the 13. 3 plants/m 2 density) were randomly selected and labelled at anthesis, and 60 pods per individual genotype were harvested manually at 14, 20, 26, 32, 40 and 50 days after labelling for the determination of seed moisture content, fresh weight, dry weight and percentage seed germination. Seed yield and seed yield components (number of pods per plant and seeds per pod) were recorded after hand harvesting of 10 sample plants/plot. The quality of seed for sowing purposes was assessed by germination, conductivity and accelerated ageing (AA) tests, while for cooking quality, seeds were assessed for their imbibition rate, seed texture and seed integrity after cooking. All the data acquired from this study were analyzed with the statistical analysis system of SAS with least significant differences at the 5 % level. The white and black bean genotypes produced 11 and 17 % plants with indeterminate <b>climbing</b> <b>characteristics</b> respectively, while the other genotypes each produced 1 - 3 % of plants with indeterminate <b>climbing</b> <b>characteristics.</b> All other plants were bush-indeterminate. Plant height in all bean genotypes at all the densities measured between 50 - 60 cm with a min. /max. height of 40 / 85 cm. The onset, peak and duration of flowering in all genotypes were not affected by plant density. The typical three phase sequence of seed development was recorded and physiological maturity, or the attainment of maximum dry weight, occurred at around 40 days after anthesis (d. a. a.) at more or less the same time for all genotypes. Seed germination started around 20 d. a. a. and reached a maximum (of 100 %) about the same time as the attainment of maximum seed dry weight at 40 d. a. a. However differences in seed coat permeability influenced the rate of seed desiccation and caused differences in seed moisture content (smc) among genotypes. The number of branches per plant differed significantly from 4. 6 in the brown genotype to 5. 2 - 5. 8 in other genotypes. At the 6. 6 plants/m 2 density the number of branches per plant was 7. 0 and decreased to 3. 8 at the 20. 0 plants/m 2 density. Flowers per plant varied from 46. 9 to 63. 9 in the brown and mottled brown genotypes respectively but did not differ with density. Pods per plant were similar for all genotypes, and reached 32. 2 at the 6. 6 plants/m 2 density but decreased to 19. 0 at the 20. 0 plants/m 2 density. Seeds per pod varied slightly from 4. 1 in the brown genotype to 4. 6 in the mottled black genotype, but did not differ with density. Seed weight/ 100 seeds varied from 35. 7 g in the mottled black genotype to 45. 2 g in the black genotype, and was similar for all densities. The black genotype produced an average seed yield of 5, 705 kg/ha (the highest), while the brown genotype had an average of 4, 723 kg/ha (the lowest) at 10 % smc. The average seed yield from the white, mottled brown and mottled black genotypes did not differ from that of the black genotype. There was no genotype x density interaction and the average seed yield for all genotypes was 3, 800 kg/ha at the 6. 6 plants/m 2 density, 5, 366 kg/ha at the 13. 3 plams/m 2 density and 6, 715 kg/ha at the 20. 0 plants/m 2 density. The conductivity test result varied from 4. 7 μS cm- 1 g- 1 in the brown genotype to 15. 5 μS cm- 1 g- 1 in the white genotype, which demonstrated the differences in seed coat characteristics among genotypes. The germination before AA was 100 % for all genotypes, and did not differ after AA (between 97 and 99 %). The conductivity test result, as well as the percentage germination before and after AA did not differ with density. The brown genotype produced an average of 53. 5 % of seeds with 'delayed permeable' seed coats, while this property varied from 3. 5 to 10. 0 % in the white and mottled brown genotypes respectively. Seeds from all genotypes became soft after cooking for 20 min. However the force required to cut the seeds after cooking varied from 6. 83 Newton in the white genotype to 15. 23 Newton in the brown genotype. The high seed coat permeability in the white genotype caused 19. 3 % seed coat/cotyledonary damage, while the brown genotype had only 8. 9 %. The white, mottled brown, mottled black and black genotypes produced a high yield (between 5, 136 and 5, 705 kg/ha) of good quality seed for both sowing and eating purposes. The brown genotype had a lower seed yield (4, 723 kg/ha), but the seed was also of good quality for sowing and eating purposes. Differences in the seed coat characteristic of different bean genotypes may mean a requirement for different lengths of cooking time to attain the same level of seed softness without seed coat splitting as required for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is a major}} supraspinal center {{involved in}} the coordination of movement. The principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells, receive excitatory synaptic input from two sources: the parallel and climbing fibers. These pathways have markedly different effects: the parallel fibers control the rate of simple sodium spikes, while the <b>climbing</b> fibers induce <b>characteristic</b> complex spike bursts, which are accompanied by dendritic calcium transients and {{play a key role}} in regulating synaptic plasticity. While many studies using a variety of species, behaviors, and cerebellar regions have documented modulation in Purkinje cell activity during movement, few have attempted to record from these neurons in unrestrained rodents. In this dissertation, we use chronic, multi-tetrode recording in freely-behaving rats to study simple and complex spike firing patterns during locomotion and sleep. Purkinje cells discharge rhythmically during stepping, but this activity is highly variable across steps. We show that behavioral variables systematically influence the step-locked firing rate in a step-phase-dependent way, revealing a functional clustering of Purkinje cells. Furthermore, we find a pronounced disassociation between patterns of variability driven by the parallel and climbing fibers, as well as functional differences between cerebellar lobules. These results suggest that Purkinje cell activity not only represents step phase within each cycle, but is also shaped by behavior across steps, facilitating control of movement under dynamic conditions. During sleep, we observe an attenuation of both simple and complex spiking, relative to awake behavior. Although firing rates during slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) are similar, simple spike activity is highly regular in SWS, while REM is characterized by phasic increases and pauses in simple spiking. This phasic activity in REM is associated with pontine waves, which propagate into the cerebellar cortex and modulate both simple and complex spiking. Such a temporal coincidence between parallel and climbing fiber activity is known to drive plasticity at parallel fiber synapses; consequently, pontocerebellar waves may provide a mechanism for tuning synaptic weights in the cerebellum during active sleep...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of knowing one's {{position in a}} precise and reliable way, at any time, with and without reception of satellite signals, represents an area fairly explored for the navigation of vehicles. To widen this service to the pedestrians requires a different approach that adapts to the dynamics, to the speed and especially to the total freedom of movement of the people. The traditional approach implements a triad of accelerometers and gyroscopes, which signals are integrated to obtain the relative displacement. This concept is unfortunately not judicious for a low-cost system. The principal {{reason is that the}} speed of displacement of a person is lost in the sensor noise level. In order to take into account all these specificities, an occurential approach was developed, based upon a subset of sensors as well as physiological and biomechanical parameters of the walk. This research is divided into three main directions. The first area of interest consists in the determination of the physiological parameters necessary to quantify the speed of walk and the step length. While the agitation of the accelerometer signals is a good speedometer, the frequency of the steps improves the robustness of the models. The influence of the gender added to the great human diversity imply the normalisation of the various relations deduced. Many tests carried out under conditions of everyday life reveal that the variation of the stride length, especially with the slope, strongly depends on the physical training of the person {{as well as on the}} duration of the <b>climb</b> or descent. <b>Characteristic</b> pattern were identified to differentiate between the forward, backward and lateral movements. The various suggested models were then favourably tested with some blind people, whose walking rhythm strongly varies according to the degree of confidence they have towards the course. The second part directly relates to the multiple technologies integrated to build an autonomous three-dimensional Pedestrian Navigation Module (PNM). The knowledge of the terrestrial magnetic field and its orientation makes it possible to determine the azimuth of displacement of a person. The use of a gyroscope improves the reliability of the system and facilitates the detection of magnetic disturbances. More stable in the short term than the compass, it is therefore the optimal complement under such circumstances. The altimetric information is obtained by barometric measurements which, according to the required precision, can be differential. The implementation of a GPS receiver allows the absolute positioning simultaneously to the calibration of the different sensor parameters and physiological models. The third part describes the integration of the models and measurements as well as the characteristics and treatments specific to pedestrian navigation. An initialisation phase is presented to individualize the parameters of the walk and adapt them from the general model. Hence, thanks to the compass-gyroscope integration together with the detection of any movement, this allows an optimal determination and filtering of the azimuth that has little or no temporal degradation. The consideration of several phenomena specific to the displacements of the humans brings artificial intelligence in pedestrian navigation. The coupling of the various sources of measurements, the influence of their precision on the computed position as well as their implication on the PNM reliability are described and illustrated. More than 550 km covered in various circumstances by 31 people allowed to validate the presented approach while fixing its limits...|$|R
