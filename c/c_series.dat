The cremasteric reflex or a nontender testicle usually excludes testicular torsion, but case reports {{have noted the}} opposite to be true (SOR: <b>C,</b> case <b>series).</b> An abnormal testicular lie can help establish the diagnosis, but occurs in fewer than 50 % of cases (SOR: <b>C,</b> case <b>series).</b> Other findings are less reliable (SOR: <b>C,</b> case <b>series).</b> The standard of care for diagnosing testicular torsion relies on studies beyond the physical examination (SOR: C, expert opinion) ...|$|R

25|$|Trailers and caravans Prior to 1951, {{trailers}} used standard general series plates. From 1951 until 1981, trailers used black-on-white {{plates in}} the format aa-nnnn, starting as T, R then A, B, <b>C</b> <b>series</b> until these {{were no longer}} generally issued. This aa-nnnn format was reallocated to personalised plates for cars and later, trailers. Prior to full use, these combinations in the 2000 to 4999 blocks were reserved for personalised use. From August 1981 until December 2014, trailer plates used the one-letter, five-number (a-nnnnn) format excluding the I, O and T letters. The final block, H-00000 to H-19999, was issued after Z-99999. Since 11 December 2014, black-on-yellow trailer plates in the TA-nn-aa format were released with embossed legend NSW – TRAILER.

500|$|The first prototype, He 111 V1 (W.Nr. 713, D-ADAP), {{flew from}} Rostock-Marienehe on 24 February 1935. It was {{followed}} by the civilian-equipped V2 and V4 in May 1935. The V2 (W.Nr. 715, D-ALIX) used the bomb bay as a four-seat [...] "smoking compartment", with another six seats behind it in the rear fuselage. V2 entered service with Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1936, along with six other newly built versions known as the He 111C. The He 111 V4 was unveiled to the foreign press on 10 January 1936. Nazi propaganda inflated the performance of the He 111C, announcing its maximum speed as 400km/h (249mph); in reality its performance stood at 360km/h (224mph). The He 111C-0 was a commercial version and took the form of the V4 prototype design. The first machine was designated D-AHAO [...] "Dresden". It was powered by the BMW VI engine and could manage a range (depending on the fuel capacity) of 1,000km (621mi) to 2,200km (1,367mi) and a maximum speed of 310km/h (193mph). The wing span on the <b>C</b> <b>series</b> was 22.6m (74ft 1¾in). The fuselage dimensions were 17.1m (56ft 1¾in) in the He 111 V1, but changed in the C to 17.5m (57ft 5 in). The Jumo 205 diesel powerplant replaced the BMW VI. Nevertheless, the maximum speed remained in the 220–240km/h (137–149mph) bracket. This was increased slightly when the BMW 132 engines were introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>C</b> <b>series</b> formats are {{geometric}} means {{between the}} B series and A series formats {{with the same}} number (e.g., C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2). The width to height ratio is as in the A and B series. The <b>C</b> <b>series</b> formats are used mainly for envelopes. An A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope. <b>C</b> <b>series</b> envelopes follow the same ratio principle as the A series pages. For example, if an A4 page is folded in half {{so that it is}} A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half).
