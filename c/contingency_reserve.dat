40|$|AbstractDetermining {{the budget}} is a {{fundamental}} process {{for the development of}} infrastructure projects for three main reasons: a) it establishes a cost baseline that integrates project scope and quality requirements along with sponsor's funding limits, b) it constitutes a performance measure during the whole project's life-cycle, and c) it affects the competitiveness of the bid. Budgeting and cost estimation methods vary in terms of complexity and accuracy, but, most important, in the way they address <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> in the total budget. The aim of this research is to explore the most applicable budgeting methods for infrastructure projects with regard to the inclusion of risks related costs to the overall budget and demonstrate the capacity of stochastic processes for optimizing overall budgets. Case- based reasoning, multiple regression analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic methods are briefly presented in terms of theoretical approach, requirements, accuracy and integration of risks. Two prevailing budgeting methods, namely the deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation are applied on a real case of reinforced concrete works for a building project; the comparison of the results highlights the two major findings of this research: a) stochastic processes provide more accurate justification of the <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> required for inclusion of risks in budgets of infrastructure projects, and b) stochastic processes are optimum for the definition of realistic <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> that, in turn, results to more competitive bids. The research concludes with the suggestion that stochastic processes should be used for risk based budgeting of infrastructure projects...|$|R

50|$|In addition, the {{increased}} presence of variable renewable generation drives a greater need for authorities to procure more ancillary services (AS) for grid balance. One {{of these services}} is <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> (CR), {{which is used to}} regulate the grid frequency in contingencies.

The available capacity of the generators can be used more efficiently for power production which they were designed for and not CR; cutting costs, and reducing pollution. As the ratio of inverter-based generation compared to conventional generation increases, the mechanical inertia used to stabilize frequency decreases. When coupled with the sensitivity of inverter-based generation to transient frequencies, the provision of ancillary services from other sources than generators becomes increasingly important.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the sources of revenue, revenue variability, program and personnel changes, and the fiscal soundness of six Latino nonprofit organizations (LNPOs) in three major cities in Western Massachusetts, for the period 1989 to 1992. Income variability was assessed for the period 1985 to 1992. Contingency or adaptive theory formed the basis of the study, with emphasis on organizational uncertainty, and the concepts of complexity and chaos. Contingency theory holds that there is no best way to organize, and that any way of organizing is not equally effective. ^ The review of the literature was exhaustive and presented an analysis of the history, economic impact, and relationship of both LNPOs and non-LNPOs with the modern welfare state. ^ IRS Form 990 and Form PC, filed by the six LNPOs with the Public Charities Division of the Massachusetts Attorney General, was the source of the data for this study. ^ The study concluded that the aggregate reliance of LNPOs on government sources of revenue was 79. 5 percent. Diversity of the funding base of these LNPOs was very limited. The average rate of revenue increase for 67 percent of these LNPOs ranged from 14 percent to 72. 3 percent. The influence of revenue variability on the program mix and primary personnel was not as conclusive. Revenue increases correlated more with salary increases of primary personnel than with increases in the number of programs. Revenue increases correlated with salary increases of the rank and file for four of the six LNPOs. Fifty percent of the LNPOs in the study were rated as fiscally sound. None of the six LNPOs had <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> and endowment funds. ^ The most compelling recommendations for improving the infrastructures of these LNPOs include: the expansion of their funding base; the establishment of <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> and endowment funds; effect changes in management and in governance; improve technology; and develop partnership with area colleges and universities for developing degree programs for managers of NPOs, and programs and workshops aimed at providing technological assistance to LNPOs. ...|$|R

50|$|Although the 30 - 60 cm {{which fell}} across Greater Vancouver and the Lower Mainland in a 24‑hour period in November 2006 {{was out of}} the ordinary, snow has in fact {{accumulated}} at sea level in all months except for June, July, and August.

The City budgets $400,000 per year for the maintenance of snow removal equipment, for the purchasing of deicing salt, and for the training of staff, but the costs of actual snow removal are funded separately from <b>contingency</b> <b>reserve</b> funds, and vary widely from season to season.

40|$|Utilisation of {{flexible}} demand to provide <b>contingency</b> <b>reserves</b> {{is generally considered}} beneficial to power systems, and can be a key enabler for ambitious renewable energy penetrations. Detailed techno-economic analysis of reserve provision from flexible demand is considered in this paper. A unit commitment/economic dispatch problem is set up that recognises demand side response (DSR) {{as a source of}} primary operating reserve (POR). Dispatch schedules are then verified with frequency stability assessments to quantify any changes in system performance. It has been demonstrated that while generally beneficial, utilization of DSR does not always improve system performance. Factors such as changes in plant dispatch (largest in-feed contingency can be greater) and flexible demand resource variability have been shown to limit the benefits of DSR under certain conditions. Actual activation of DSR for POR is also shown to compromise network integrity in some cases. All results are demonstrated using the Irish power system. ...|$|R

Traditionally, these critical services had been procured only from the generation side, yet the current perception has begun to rec-ognize the demand side as an important asset that can improve the reliability of a power system, offering notable advantages. In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming model, repre-senting the day-ahead market clearing procedure on an hourly basis and the actual minute-to-minute operation of the power sys-tem, is developed comprising different services that specifically address various disturbance sources of the normal operation of a power system, namely intra-hour load variation, intra-hour wind variation, as well as generating unit and transmission line outages.

A stochastic model of a typical South African defined benefit fund is constructed with simulations run to determine the impact of the PF 117 requirements. Findings show that a best-estimate funding basis, coupled with the no-deficit clause, results in significant risk under both contribution rate and solvency risk measures, particularly in the short-term. To mitigate these risks, alternative ways of introducing conservatism into the funding basis are required, with possible options including incorporating margins into investment return assumptions or the removal of the no-deficit clause...|$|R
