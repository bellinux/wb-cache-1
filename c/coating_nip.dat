40|$|The {{long-term}} {{preservation of}} paper with the same qualities of brightness and color {{is one of the}} important requirements for certain paper products. A major problem limiting the wider use of mechanical pulp is the sensitivity of lignin-containing pulps to yellowing induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. One of the yellowing inhibitor systems contains an Ultra Violet Absorber (UVA) and a Radical Scavenger (RS). The application of this inhibitor system to paper made of mechanical pulps requires the addition of two components, UVA and RS. To Properly understand the use of a paper yellowing inhibition system; it is important to reveal the effect of adding the inhibitors on the global properties of the resulting coating mixture. We need to optimize the input factors to achieve the longest in time inhibition effect. It is essential to study the rheological properties of the resulting system and the effects provoked by each of the ingredients. Studying the microstructure of the materials sheds more light on the interaction of the additional components with the original formulation. The coating formulation and the inhibition ingredients undergo mixing and transport processes. A study of the effect of pre-shear adds {{to the understanding of the}} system. Numerical simulation of 3 D hydrodynamics with non-Newtonian rheology in the vicinity of the coating head creates a powerful tool for investigation of the coating system under these conditions. Among the operating parameters, the total concentration of inhibitors or total charge proved to have the largest effect of brightness stability or longer in time yellowing inhibition. The rheology of RS is Newtonian. The Ultra-violet absorber (tin 1130) is an extremely viscous shear-thinning thixotropic material. Water-retention studies show that inhibitors increase water loss, with more water penetrating the paper web. Zeta potential measurements revealed the repulsive forces between pigment and inhibitor particles. RS adsorbs on ground calcium carbonate GCC and disrupts interactions between kaolinite particles. UVA adsorbs on particles of kaolinite and GCC. The inhibitors increase the viscosity, thixotropy, and elasticity of the original coating formulation. A study of pre-shear reveals decrease in viscosity, while inhibitors concentration under pre-shear increases viscosity and elasticity. Transmission Electron Microscopy shows the microstructure of increasing agglomerations with added inhibitors.

30|$|The spatial {{wavelength}} {{and depth}} of turning marks have only minor impact {{on the degree of}} surface roughness reduction.

The surface roughness of diamond turned NiP drops exponentially with processing steps under experimented conditions. Using up to five IBP steps, the surface roughness can be reduced up to one order of magnitude (from Rq ~ 6.5  nm to Rq ~ 0.7  nm).|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents nondestructive {{optical characterization}} methods developed for thin films and bulk materials. These methods {{can be used}} to accurately measure polarization rotation and ellipticity, the reflection and transmission coefficients, the wavelength dependence of birefringence, Kerr rotation and ellipticity; the dielectric tensor of magneto-optical (MO) media, as well as the optical constants and thickness of thin film stacks. A series of optical, magneto-optical and magnetic recording media have been studied. A variable angle, multi-wavelength ellipsometer, and a MO Kerr spectrometer were used for these measurements. A general-purpose computer program has been used to analyze the experimental data. The in-plane and vertical birefringence of polycarbonate plastic substrates of optical disks have been measured for wavelengths between 360 nm and 860 nm, which covers the full range of interest for blue {{as well as for the}} current red and infrared recording. A dielectric tensor database for MO thin film materials of (BiDy) ₃(FeGa) ₅O₁₂ garnet, MnBi, multilayered Co/Pt, amorphous TbFeCoTa, fcc cobalt, and Heusler alloy PtMnSb has been established in the wavelength range of 400 - 780 nm. These materials are then evaluated based on the intrinsic MO figure of merit. In the area of hard disk magnetic recording, the optical constants of nickel phosphorous (<b>NiP)</b> <b>coated</b> substrate, CoNi/NiP magnetic film on <b>NiP</b> <b>coated</b> substrate, and the carbon overcoating layer have been obtained at several wavelengths. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment has shown that this nondestructive method is a sensitive tool for the characterization of optical thin film stacks...|$|R

30|$|In optical fabrication, {{single-crystal}} diamond turning {{is effectively}} used to cut metal surfaces to obtain smooth and highly accurate surfaces relevant for {{different types of}} optics. The final surface roughness is mainly caused by the tool marks forming along the tool paths, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} mid spatial frequency (1  μm ~ 1  mm) [1]. The turning marks will increase the scattering and deteriorate the performance of optics, in particular for those used at very short wavelength like extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) and X-ray optics. Hence the turning marks must be eliminated or mitigated in the subsequent steps. Ion beam machining is a much deterministic process for final modification to surface of optics. However, on some occasions, ion beam machining alone is incapable of improving surface roughness. Hence ion beam planarization (IBP) was proposed that combines coating and ion beam machining to smooth the surface of optics [2].Within the IBP technique, smoothing results from removal of a planarizing sacrificial layer. A layer of coating (sacrificial layer), e.g. photoresist, is first applied onto the surface of optics to be smoothed. The surface gets much smooth after being coated and subsequently the sacrificial layer is removed by ion beam machining at the planarization angle (i.e., at an angle where the removal rates of the resist and the underlying substrate are nearly identical) [2 – 6]. Thus, the smooth surface of the sacrificial layer is transferred to the substrate [5]. This way, the workpiece can be readily planarized which it is otherwise difficult to planarize directly with ion beam. Frost et al. have successfully smoothed diamond turned copper and electroless plated NiP surface using IBP technique [4 – 6]. Although {{it has been shown that}} IBP can smooth diamond turned surfaces, many factors affect the results of smoothing effects of turning marks. Thereby the smoothing effectiveness of IBP technique on the diamond turned surface was investigated in detail. Our previous results have shown that the surface roughness can be reduced to ~ 1 / 3 of roughness of diamond turned surface, regardless of the spatial wavelength and depth of turning marks [7]. Long time processing with ion beam has marginal effect on the surface roughness of diamond turned surface once the resist is removed. In this paper, the potential influence of thickness of resist and multi-step processing using IBP on surface roughness of diamond turned surface was experimentally studied. It turns out that thicker resist will yield smoother surface after <b>coating</b> diamond turned <b>NiP</b> and the roughness decreases exponentially with repeating IBP processes (from Rq ~ 6.5  nm to Rq ~ 0.7  nm after repeating IBP processing 5 times).|$|R
40|$|Two key {{technologies}} used by {{the electronics}} industry are chip technology and packaging technology. Solder {{plays a crucial role}} in both of them. During the last decade, there has been a strong worldwide environmental movement towards lead-free electronic products. The Sn-Zn solder system has been presented as a promising lead-free candidate, recommended mainly for its low melting temperature, around 200 °C, which is close to the melting temperature of the traditional binary Sn-Pb alloy, 183 °C. The alloy composition chosen to be studied in this work was the ternary Sn- 8 Zn- 3 Bi. The low cycle fatigue behavior of this alloy was investigated using single lap shear samples. Finite element modeling was performed and the Coffin-Manson equation was given based on results from experiment and simulation both: N f = 0. 0294 (Δγ) - 2. 833 Another important issue relating to the reliability of solder joints also investigated in this work, is the intermetallic compounds (IMCs). During soldering and the build-up of solder joints, IMCs are formed at the interface between the solder and the pad metallization. The reliability of the whole package is typically affected by the integrity of the solder joints, and the integrity of the solder joints is greatly affected by the IMCs mainly due to their inherent brittle nature and tendency to generate structural defects. The interfacial reactions between the eutectic Sn- 0. 4 Co- 0. 7 Cu alloy and electroless nickel, immersion gold (ENIG) metallization was investigated after reflow soldering. Common Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu and eutectic Sn- 0. 7 Cu solders were used as reference. Two types of IMCs were found in the solder matrix of the Sn- 0. 4 Co- 0. 7 Cu alloy, namely coarser CoSn 2 and finer Cu 6 Sn 5 particles, while only one ternary (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 interfacial compound was detected between the solder alloy and the ENIG coated substrate. It was noted that the thickness of the interfacial IMC layers in the Sn-Co-Cu solder joint were thinner than both Sn-Ag-Cu and Sn-Cu IMC layers. The interfacial reaction of Sn- 3. 5 Ag and Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solders on ENIG metallization after high temperature storage (HTS) testing was investigated from a metallurgical point of view. It was noticed that only Ni 3 Sn 4 IMCs were found in the Sn-Ag system, while two kinds of interfacial products, (Ni,Cu) 3 Sn 4 and (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 existed in the Sn-Ag-Cu system. The interfacial layer between the Sn-Ag-Cu solder and electroless <b>Ni(P)</b> <b>coating</b> showed better thermal stability than eutectic Sn-Ag solder since no spalling was observed. Furthermore, the coupling effect in both Sn- 3. 5 Ag- 3. 0 Bi and Sn- 8. 0 Zn- 3. 0 Bi solder joints in sandwiched structure was studied as a function of reflow time. The coupling effect between the ENIG metallization and the Cu substrate was confirmed since the type of IMCs on Ni(P) layer changed from being a Ni-Sn phase to a Cu-Sn phase, apparently {{as a result of the}} diffusion of Cu atoms from the opposite Cu substrate. Furthermore, the ternary (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 compounds were formed at the interface between Sn-Ag-Bi solder and Ni(P) substrate. One complex alloy Sn-Ni-Cu-Zn was formed at the Sn-Zn-Bi/Ni(P) interface; however the growth of this complex alloy on the ENIG coated substrate was suppressed...|$|R
