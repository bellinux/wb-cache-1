40|$|Abstract Many {{real world}} {{problems}} {{can be described as}} complex optimization problems. Some of them can be easily formalized and are amenable to an automated solution using some (usually heuristic) optimization algorithm. Other complex problems <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> solved satisfactory by automated algorithms. The reason is that the problems and the corre-sponding optimization goals <b>can</b> either <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> formalized or that they vary depending on the user and the task at hand. In both cases, there is no chance to obtain a fully automatic solution of the problem. The only possibility is to make the user {{an integral part of the}} process. In this article, we therefore propose an interactive optimization system based on visualization techniques to guide the optimization process of heuristic optimization algorithms. To show the usefulness of our ideas, we provide two example applications: First, we apply the idea in the framework of similarity search in multimedia databases. Since it is diffi-cult to specify the search task, we use visualization techniques to allo...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that in deeply localized quasi- 1 D systems, the single dominant transmission eigenchannel is formed by an individual Anderson localized mode or by a "necklace state". In this single-channel regime, the disordered sample can be treated as an effective 1 D system with a renormalized localization length, coupled through all the external modes to its surroundings. Using statistical criteria of the single-channel regime and pulsed excitations of the disordered samples allows us to identify long-lived localized modes and short-lived necklace states at long and short time delays, respectively...|$|R

As a result, CY-1 remains on board submarine chasers where rocket propelled ASW torpedoes (or ASW rockets) are deployed, while CY-2 is often deployed on larger warships.

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to imagine the intellectual concern of late 19th and early 20th Century over the collective drift in Western Civilization away from old-guard monarchial and hierarchical societal structures (i.e., one's station in life being determined primarily by birth), toward the relative uncertainty and instability embodied in such Enlightenment Era ideals such as democracy, nationhood, class struggle (Karl Marx), human equality, humanism, egalitarianism, utilitarianism and the like. As such, Ressentiment, as a phenomenon, was first viewed as a pseudo-ethically based political force enabling the lower classes of society to rise in their situation in life at the (perceived) expense of the higher, or more inherently [...] "noble" [...] classes. Hence, Ressentiment first emerged as, what some might view, a reactionary and elitist concept by today's democratic standards; while others of a more conservative mind-set might view Ressentiment as liberalism disguised as a socialist attempt at usurping the role of individual responsibility and self-determination.
