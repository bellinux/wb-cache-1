50|$|Meanwhile, Brome and Felldoh {{washed up}} somewhere else, meeting the Rosehip Players, a {{traveling}} circus {{who agreed to}} help them free the slaves of Marshank.

50|$|The {{artefact}} assemblage {{is similar}} to that at the nearby <b>Cloggs</b> Cave in Buchan, and in conjunction with Birrigai in the ACT they represent a general signature of human occupation and resource exploitation of the southeastern uplands during the Pleistocene. This reveals a non-intensive use of caves and shelters and consumption of local fauna. In comparison, southwestern Tasmanian Pleistocene sites appear to have a different signature of cave occupation and the primacy of a single vertebrate resource.|$|R

50|$|The Snowy River was {{initially}} utilised sustainably {{as a food}} and water resource by Indigenous Australians for around 30,000-40,000 years prior to European settlement. Evidence of human occupation at <b>Cloggs</b> Cave, near the Snowy River, near Buchan, was dated at up to 17,000 years. Despite the cold climate in the river's higher reaches, the Ngarigo nation held territory around the Australian Alps and the Snowy Mountains in modern-day New South Wales. As the river flowed southwards into modern day Victoria, it flowed in the Gunai nation's territory, particularly, the Krauatungalung clan's territory.|$|R
50|$|While rock shelters {{are often}} the sites of cave {{painting}} and other art, they also provide deeply steratified occupation deposits because they are protected from erosion. New Guinea II cave on the Snowy River near Buchan has deposits more than 10 000 years old along with delicate cave paintings and engravings. Rock shelters were occupied in the Cape Bridgewater area about 12,000 years ago. <b>Cloggs</b> Cave rock shelter near Buchan, Victoria was occupied about 18,000 years ago, where bone tools and animal remains were found. At the Keilor Archaeological Site a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years BP, making Keilor {{one of the earliest}} sites of human habitation in Australia, while at Box Gully on Lake Tyrrell, emu eggs and other artefacts have been dated to 27,000 years ago.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} mines were opened {{as early as}} 1869 {{including}} silver, gold and lead. Some of the bigger mines were profitable but most were short-lived. Some commercial quarries operated in the early 1900s and marble from the quarries was used to build the Shrine and State Library in Melbourne and buildings in London and throughout the state. From the 1950s a quarry also produced crushed lime for agriculture, paper manufacture and other uses. Wattle bark stripping was an important industry and small spot mills worked in the surrounding bush. Following World War 2, two large sawmills and several smaller mills operated in Buchan providing employment. The last mill ceased operation this year. There were small groups of Aborigines in the area but their numbers declined following European settlement. At <b>Cloggs</b> Cave near Buchan, evidence has been found of Aboriginal occupation in prehistoric times.|$|R
50|$|Whilst most {{evidence}} of Aboriginal settlement {{is derived from}} camp sites where fireplaces, remains of stone tool making and sometimes structures such as mounds and huts can be found, and these sites are almost always located close to reliable water sources, the distribution of Aboriginal archaeological sites demonstrates occupation of all the climatic zones in Victoria, even during the extreme global climatic conditions {{at the peak of}} the Last Glacial Maximum when temperatures were colder, vast amounts of surface water were frozen in glaciers and sea levels were lower. Around 18,000 BP sea levels were about 65 metres below present day levels, while archaeological evidence has shown that people were present in south‐eastern Australia throughout all of the climatic changes of at least the last 30,000 years ranging from the deep gorges and highlands of East Gippsland such as at <b>Clogg’s</b> Cave, and New Guinea II cave, the riverine plains at Keilor, the inland plains and swamps such as Kow Swamp, and the eastern ranges at the Grampians.|$|R

[...] "I loved the sin, not that which I obtained by the same, but I loved the sin itself." [...] There lay the sting of it! They were not even unusually excellent pears. [...] "A Peare tree ther was, neere our vineyard, heavy loaden with fruite, which tempted not greatly either the sight or tast. To the shaking and robbing thereof, certaine most wicked youthes (whereof I was one) went late at night.

5000|$|The cave was {{discovered}} by Josephine Flood, when driving to another site in eastern Victoria. Her subsequent excavations within the dry floor of the rock shelter revealed extensive evidence of stone tool making from the Australian Small Tool Tradition, with the basal layer dated to the last 1,000 years. Further inside the cave dates from the excavation showed the site was probably first occupied around 17,000 years ago, but {{appears to have been}} abandoned by 1,000 years when the outer area was occupied. Based on the relatively small quantities of discarded stone tools, the site has been interpreted as an intermittently occupied hunting site rather than a permanent campsite, with deeply stratified layers containing both stone and bone tools along with ochre and a rich faunal assemblage. The artefact assemblage is from what is described as the Australian Core Tool and Scraper Tradition. [...] <b>Cloggs</b> Cave was the first Pleistocene occupation site to be found with intact bone. Evidence of bones from megafauna and extinct marsupials was found to be dated between 27,500 and 24,500 years old, but were not associated with the human occupation layers.|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Pygmy-possum Cercartetus nanus has a {{variable}} status throughout its current geographic range. Investigating its prehistoric range may provide some perspective into its current distribution and abundance. We reviewed available {{information from the}} published literature and museum databases to document the fossil and sub-fossil sites in Victoria where bones of the species have been reported. This revealed 17 sites of late Pleistocene and Holocene age ranging from ca. 780 ± 100 to 3 ̆e 33 000 years. The fossils from five sites (Bridgewater Caves South; <b>Clogg’s</b> Cave; McEachern’s Cave; McEachern’s Deathtrap Cave and Pyramids Cave) are dated at 3 ̆e 10 000 years, and extend from the far south-west {{to the far east}} of Victoria. The Steiglitz Cave (3 ̆c 6 0003 ̆eyears), located in south-central Victoria, provides evidence that Eastern Pygmy-possums were also present in that area in the mid-Holocene. The apparent prehistoric distribution of the species is likely to be an artifact of the availability of fossil sites. The fossil localities for the Eastern Pygmy-possum appear to be within the distribution of extant populations, and the available evidence does not suggest a contraction of geographic range. This may suggest that the available habitat for Eastern Pygmy-possums has not changed to any great extent during the last 10 000 years. Thus, this study provides a preliminary basis for examining modern contractions in the range of the Eastern Pygmy-possum, whether due to climate change, proximate anthropogenic disturbances, or other factors...|$|R
