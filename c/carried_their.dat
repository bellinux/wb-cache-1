5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} format {{was used}} for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6. The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.|$|E
5|$|In August 1987, the {{encouraged}} Chadians <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> offensive {{into the}} disputed Aouzou Strip, occupying {{the town of}} Aouzou following another battle in which the Libyans suffered severe losses in troops and abandoned equipment. In retaliation, Libya intensified its air bombardments of towns in the north, usually from altitudes beyond the range of FANT's shoulder-fired missiles. Appeals by Habré for French air missions to defend the area against the bombing were rejected, as Aouzou had been retaken against the wishes of French President François Mitterrand. Instead, Mitterrand called for international mediation to settle competing claims to the disputed territory.|$|E

5|$|Temporary {{space was}} {{needed in the}} interim, and the school {{relocated}} its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in Roselawn, the epicenter of Cincinnati's Jewish Community. The school was divided between two buildings, the Yavneh Day School building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center. The Yavneh Day school, founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children, moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility. The school had no lockers; students <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> belongings between buildings. Lunches were delivered from another school and served at a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|The format {{used in the}} 2007 World Cup {{involved}} 16 teams allocated {{into four}} groups of four. Within each group, the teams played {{each other in a}} round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points {{in the same way as}} the group stage, but <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E

5|$|After Caracalla {{concluded}} {{his campaign}} against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with the Greek-Macedonian general and conqueror Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to equip 16,000 of his men with Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic who <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD. As a consequence, the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica {{may not have been}} pikemen, but rather standard battle line troops or possibly Triarii. Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be with their new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E
5|$|In Tests, South African Bernard Tancred was {{the first}} cricketer to carry the bat; he made 26 runs in his team's total of 47 against England in 1889. The {{following}} year, Jack Barrett of Australia became {{the first player to}} carry the bat on debut. In the 1892 tour of Australia, England's Bobby Abel scored 132 and became the first player to score a century while carrying the bat. The following year, Bill Woodfull of Australia set a new record by becoming the first player to perform this feat twice in Tests; he scored 73 not out during the third test of England's 1933 tour. Apart from Woodfull, four other cricketers have performed this feat more than once in their in Test careers—while Bill Lawry (Australia), Glenn Turner (New Zealand) and Len Hutton (England), have done it twice, West Indies cricketer Desmond Haynes has performed this feat on three occasions. , Turner's 223, against the West Indies in 1972, is the highest score by a player while carrying the bat. Kraigg Brathwaite of the West Indies is the most recent cricketer to carry the bat in Tests; he made 142 against Pakistan in November 2016. The Australian players have performed this feat more than any other, followed by England. In all, 45 cricketers have <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> bats on 51 occasions in Test cricket.|$|E

5|$|Nelson <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> {{good form}} into March; Bottrill scored {{for the first}} time in over two months to help the team defeat New Brighton by five clear goals. This seventh {{straight}} win closed the gap between Nelson and Darlington to five points, with the league leaders having played three more matches. In an attempt to push for the title the Nelson directors invested in two new players in March; inside forward John Stevenson arrived from Second Division side Bury for a fee of £500, while Fred Laycock joined Nelson from Barrow. However, the team suffered their first loss of 1925 in of the following match away at Grimsby Town as goals from Joe Cooper and Frank McKenna gave the home side a 2–0 win. This was followed by another defeat four days later; a goal on debut for Stevenson could not prevent Lincoln City winning by two goals to one. On 21 March Nelson returned to winning ways with a 2–0 defeat of Hartlepools United at Seedhill, and later the same week Eddleston scored his second hat-trick of the campaign as struggling Hartlepools were beaten 4–2 in the reverse fixture. A first goal in Nelson colours for Laycock secured a third successive win away at Rochdale on 28 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E
