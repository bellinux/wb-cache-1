40|$|PowerCom is a {{prototype}} {{application for a}} Personal Digital Assistant featuring an information visualisation technique called Flip Zooming. The purpose is to give both an overview and a detailed view of information presented on a small touch sensitive screen. Quick retrieval of related objects is enabled by information integration, where advanced <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> is included. The usability of PowerCom was compared to two other devices in a controlled experiment using 18 subjects that were exposed to four information handling tasks and three typical <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> tasks. Effectiveness, efficiency, mental workload and subjective satisfaction were measured. Major differences regarding effectiveness and efficiency, disfavouring PowerCom, were found for one information and one <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> task. The <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> task included both {{the creation of a}} conference call and creating a private call with one of the conference members. The problems can be explained in terms of using drag and drop and its effect on the breadth of actions available at each navigation step. Previous studies have argued that the breadth should be increased rather than the navigation depth. The results here imply {{that this is not the}} case for <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> tasks...|$|R

Among the most important technical aspects of emergency <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> are recognition and treatment of emergency call by originating network, routing of such call to the appropriate public safety answering point (PSAP), delivering call-related information to the PSAP as well as architecture and organization of PSAPs. From the legal point of view, of importance are the obligations for the Member States and stakeholders involved in the E 112 project included in the EU directives, actions of European Commission related to providing access to the location information as well as obligations concerning emergency <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> included in Polish national law.

40|$|Abstract—Speed {{and size}} are two {{important}} factors while designing the electronic system. It’s Speed of operation and flexibility to modify, measures {{the performance of}} the system operation. Microprocessor/microcontroller (MPMC) system can handle sequential operations with high flexibility and use of Complex Programmable Devices (CPLD) can handle concurrent operations with high speed in small size area. So combined features of both these systems can enhance {{the performance of the}} system. High performance Hybrid Telephone Switching System (HTSS) is designed using combination of stored program control (SPC) and VLSI technology. <b>Call</b> <b>handling</b> operations are handled by concurrent operations using CPLD and complicated sequential operations like service handling are handled by MPMC. VHDL codes are designed and tested for different <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> operations. The test benches are designed to act as MPMC for the testing of services like Do Not Disturb (DND), Call Forwarding (CF), Outgoing Bar (OGB) and STD Bar (STDB) facilities. <b>Call</b> <b>handling</b> speed of available system designed with MPMC and proposed system designed with CPLD is compared...|$|R

Despite this, it also found 45% of UK consumers are happy to hold longer than a minute during calls to businesses and only 6% are not willing to wait at all.

In the specification language SDL such concurrently operating processes can easily be specified by independent instances of a single process type for <b>call</b> <b>handling.</b> In this paper we suggest a method that first simplifies each instance of such a <b>call</b> <b>handling</b> process by reducing it to a single-state process, and then refines it by reducing multiple instances of such a process into a single process, thereby reducing both the interleaving freedom and required resources. The method is illustrated for a realistic telephone exchange example. The whole SDL design for the telephone exchange is reviewed...|$|R
