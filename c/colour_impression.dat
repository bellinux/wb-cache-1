5000|$|... § 7 Doppler {{argues that}} his theory applies mainly to binary stars. In his opinion the fixed stars are {{immobile}} and white. In a binary star high speeds could be possible due to orbital motion, and binaries {{appear to be}} colourful. Doppler divides the binaries in two groups: (1) binary stars of unequal brightness; and (2) binary stars of equal brightness. His interpretation is: in case (1) the brighter star is the heavier one, the weaker star revolves around him; in case (2) both stars revolve around a center of mass in the middle, or around a dark third star. In case (2) the colours are usually complementary. Doppler rules out that the rich complementary colours of binaries are contrast illusions, because an astronomer said he had observed that covering one star {{does not change the}} <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> of the other star. Doppler claims that his theory is supported by the fact that for many binary stars the colour indication in Struve's catalogue is different from that in Herschel's older catalogue, attributing the difference to progress of the orbital motion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} the {{fundamental}} six-colour (cyclic) sequence on human <b>colour</b> <b>impression.</b> The different effects of two spatial sequences are investigated under the consideration of a hexagonal diagram that is a projection of RGB colour space from white to black. The hexagonal diagram corresponds roughly to the hue circle indicated by both hue and saturation in an HLS system. The projected route area indicates the magnitude of naturalness (as in rainbows) for colour sequences. The minimum sequence is similar to the order of colours in rainbows, whereas the non-minimum sequence is completely different. Therefore, a human <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> model is proposed using the projected route area indicated by both hue and saturation. It is clarified that the majority of subjects of nearly all ages has a natural impression when the minimum route area is large. In addition, the human <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> is compared with the human <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> model. This model is intended to be employed in order to design commodities, goods, buildings, and towns to have the most effective colour sequence...|$|E

40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of multicolour printing has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the <b>colour</b> <b>impression,</b> the halftone dot-size and ink density. <b>Colour</b> <b>impression</b> values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. <b>Colour</b> <b>impression</b> values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a reference print or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for off-line print quality monitoring and ink feed control, or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.

40|$|Effect {{pigments}} {{with their}} angular dependent <b>colour</b> <b>impression</b> entering {{more and more}} the portfolio of commercial products. Caused by the goniochromatic behaviour of the appearance of such objects, the spectral reflection properties in three- dimensional space must be determined in order to describe these objects appropriately. For this purpose a gonioreflectometer is needed {{with the ability to}} perform measurements of the spectral radiance factor respectively the BRDF within the full half-space (2 π sr) above the device under test. At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the National Metrology Institute (NMI) of Germany, such a facility for measuring appearance-related quantities has been built up. The system is named ARGon 3 which stands for " 3 D Appearance Robot-based Gonioreflectometer". The main features within the set-up are a photometric luminance camera with a spatial resolution of 28 µm on the device under test and a line-scan camera mounted to a spectrograph, which provides measurements of spectral resolved reflection in full V(λ) -range with arbitrary angles of irradiation and detection relative to the surface normal. Within this publication goniometric measurements of reflection within 3 D-space and subsequent colorimetric representation of the obtained data of a special effect pigment called Viola Fantasy from MERCK KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany are presented.

40|$|The aim was {{to design}} a multi-chromatic {{phosphor}} based on the colour mixing principle, whereby white light can be produced from an appropriate mixture of blue, green, and red emissions by a single phosphor. In this perspective, Tm 2 O 3, Tb 4 O 7, and Eu 2 O 3 were simultaneously doped in single host glass matrix. A series of Tm 2 O 3 single- as well as Tm/Tb/Eu triple-doped glasses were synthesised. The photoluminescence behaviour and luminescence quenching were investigated for Tm 2 O 3 single-doped glasses. Keeping Tm 2 O 3 constant at the saturation concentration in the Tm/Tb/Eu triple-doped glasses and varying the doping ratio of the two other lanthanides (Tb 4 O 7 and Eu 2 O 3) in the host glass allow to some extent {{the control of the}} spectral composition and consequently the generation of tunable <b>colour</b> <b>impressions.</b> The latter can also be adjusted by keeping the concentration ratio of the three lanthanides constant and varying the excitation wavelength. Upon 358 -nm excitation of the Tm/Tb/Eu triple-doped glasses, white light emission is achieved and the corresponding correlated colour temperatures are also determined. The different energy transfers occurring in between the three lanthanides are investigated and possible energy transfer routes are proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince 1 st July 1978 the 4400 spectators of {{the famous}} Karl May festival have been sitting under a fabric roof. After the Olympic {{structure}} in Munich the membrane roof in Elspe {{was one of the}} biggest, winter proof covers in Europe. Continuous on site tests over the past years had already shown that the fabric was not in danger of coming down. Tensile strength was still considerably high and the fabric would certainly have lasted even another dozen years. In the end it was a decision for optical reasons: the festival company wanted to have a bright new <b>colour</b> <b>impression.</b> They made a material decision on save grounds: they wanted to use the same material that had shown an outstanding performance over the last 37 years. Given that today's material science is even farther in terms of choosing the right chemicals for a long lasting and sustainable coating, the actual project might be charged off even more easily. Mehler Texnologies developed an individual membrane: {{as close as possible to}} the original material from 1978, bearing the same green colour. The experts of Koch Membranes say: “Altogether the classical membrane roof in Elspe is a good example for maintaining and developing a sustainable construction. A well done fabric construction is more than ever a fast, reliable and economic way of construction with a high degree of publicity. ”For Mehler Texnologies the supply of the new fabric was a unique opportunity: the dismounted fabric gave an excellent proof under real life conditions. Better than any artificial weathering tests this makes clear that the fabric material lasts 37 years and more – even under heavy snow loads during winter time which are very common in the Sauerland region where the festival tent is located...|$|E
40|$|A 3 x 3 {{factorial}} design {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} dietary lipid and astaxanthin levels on the pigmentation of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Different groups of charr with mean initial weight of 70. 16 ± 2. 18 g were fed with diets containing 10, 18 or 26 % dietary lipid together with 40, 60 or 80 ppm synthetic astaxanthin for 24 weeks. The proximate composition of flesh, total carotenoid concentration in flesh and belly skin, and the Hunter colour values of filets, homogenized flesh and belly skin were determined at 4 -week intervals. The apparent digestibility coefficient of carotenoid and specific growth rate (SGR) of the experimental fish at different dietary lipid and carotenoid levels were also investigated. Results indicated that: [...] (1). The moisture content of flesh was inversely related to the level of dietary lipid, while there was a significant direct relationship between the content of flesh and dietary lipid. The protein and mineral content of flesh were not significantly influenced by the level of dietary lipid. [...] (2). The total carotenoid concentration in flesh and belly skin of charr increased with time. The concentration of carotenoids in the flesh generally reached or exceeded 4 mg/kg wet tissue on week- 16, 20 and 24 for the fish receiving 26, 18 and 10 % dietary lipid, respectively. This amount is considered as being sufficient for providing a satisfactory <b>colour</b> <b>impression.</b> The carotenoid concentration in the flesh and belly skin of fish was directly correlated with both dietary lipid and carotenoid levels. There was a significant interaction between dietary lipid and carotenoid levels on the total carotenoid concentration in flesh and belly skin of charr. A high correlation also existed between the carotenoid concentration and total lipid content in flesh. [...] (3). The intensity of redness (Hunter a) and yellowness (Hunter b) of filet, homogenized flesh, and belly skin for all treatments increased with time on pigmented diets while their lightness (Hunter L) decreased. The Hunter L values of filet, homogenized flesh, and belly skin were inversely correlated with their carotenoid contents, whereas their Hunter a and b values correlated directly with the total carotenoid concentration. No significant relationship existed between any of the Hunter colour values and the lipid content in the flesh of charr. [...] (4). The retention of carotenoids in charr flesh varied significantly among treatments, ranged from 4. 13 to 10. 66 %. The total amount of carotenoids retained in flesh was directly related to the content of dietary lipid, but inversely related to dietary carotenoid levels. There was a significant interaction of dietary lipid and carotenoid levels on the retention of carotenoids in flesh. [...] (5). The apparent digestibility coefficient of carotenoids, ranging from 47. 99 to 73. 62 %, correlated directly with the content of dietary lipid, but inversely with dietary carotenoid levels. There was a high correlation between the amount of carotenoids retained in flesh and their digestibility. No interaction of dietary lipid and carotenoid on the carotenoid digestibility was observed. [...] (6). The dietary lipid and carotenoid levels used in this study did not result in any abnormal growth of fish. The specific growth rate (SGR) of the fish fed 18 and 26 % dietary lipid were significantly higher than that of the groups receiving 10 % dietary lipid. In addition, at the same level of dietary lipid (18 %), the weight gains of fish on dietary carotenoids were faster than that of fish receiving no dietary carotenoids. However, these differences were not statistically significant. [...] In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study demonstrated that an increase in both lipid and carotenoid levels in charr diet enhances deposition of carotenoids in the fish flesh and skin. There was a significant interaction of dietary lipid and carotenoids on the pigmentation of Arctic charr. Thus, an increase in dietary lipid within a certain range may improve the pigmentation efficacy of charr...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stocking}} density on performance, proximate composition and pigmentation of cultured Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) were studied. Results indicated that specific growth rate (SGR), {{feed conversion ratio}} (FCR), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of fish were significantly (p 0. 05) effects were evident in the hepatosomatic index (HSI) of fish. These performance parameters of fish correlated inversely with stocking density at 40, 50 and 75 kg/m³ (r = - 0. 9522 for SGR, - 0. 9696 for FCR, - 0. 9886 for PER, and - 0. 9059 for HSI). Although SGR, FCR and PER of fish from different stocking densities varied significantly (p< 0. 05), their final weights did not. [...] Results also indicated that while the moisture content decreased, protein and lipid content increased as fish grew; the mineral content remained relatively unchanged over this period. Analyses indicated that moisture, protein and lipid content varied significantly (p< 0. 05) among density groups while ash content did not. Regression analysis showed that moisture and ash content were directly related to stocking density (r = 0. 9440 and 0. 9994, respectively), whereas protein and lipid content were not (r = - 0. 5394 and - 0. 7030, respectively). [...] The total amino acid content of fish varied significantly (p< 0. 05) according to stocking density and sampling dates. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine and lysine were the most abundant amino acids present, whereas hydroxyproline was the least abundant. The free amino acid content of the fish also varied significantly (p< 0. 05) and inversely with stocking density (r = - 0. 9441) and sampling dates. The major free amino acids were anserine, taurine, glycine and alanine. [...] Lipid fatty acid composition of charr flesh was relatively unchanged {{over the course of}} the experiments. Among density groups, fatty acid contents of fish flesh were also relatively similar. Unsaturated fatty acids were the dominant fatty acids, accounting for up to 75 % of the total lipids. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids correlated inversely with stocking density (r = - 0. 9914 and - 0. 9963, respectively), whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids correlated directly with stocking density (r = 0. 9984). [...] The Hunter L*. a*, b* values varied significantly (p< 0. 05) among density groups. For belly skin, these colour parameters decreased with increasing stocking density. No correlation was observed between the total carotenoid contents of fish skin and these colour parameters. On the other hand, the Hunter L* values of fillets and homogenized tissues were inversely correlated with their carotenoid contents (r = - 0. 9245 to - 0. 9844, respectively), whereas their Hunter a* and b* values were directly correlated with total carotenoid contents (r = 0. 9040 to 0. 9824 for a* values and 0. 9527 to 0. 9924 for b* values, respectively). [...] The content of carotenoid pigments in flesh and skin of charr increased with duration of feeding on pigmented diets. After 11 to 16 weeks of feeding on a canthaxanthin-pigmented diet, fish flesh attained the required level of carotenoids (3 - 4 mg/kg wet tissue) considered sufficient for providing a satisfactory <b>colour</b> <b>impression.</b> However, stocking density did not correlate with flesh carotenoid concentration (r = - 0. 6034). Canthaxanthin, echinenone, 4 '-hydroxyechinenone, lutein and its esters, isocryptoxanthin and β-carotene were identified in different organs of charr. Canthaxanthin was the main carotenoid in charr flesh, whereas β-carotene, lutein esters and 4 '-hydroxyechinenone, and echinenone were the dominant carotenoids in charr skin, gonads and liver, respectively. Canthaxanthin was not detected in the liver of fish. Therefore, dietary carotenoids may be deposited in different organs as such or may undergo reductive changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Townscape colours {{have been}} a main factor in urban development. For {{townscape}} colours, keeping colour harmony within the environment is a common goal. Expressing characteristics and impressions of the town in townscape colours are other meaningful goals. The colour planning support system proposed here is intended to improve townscapes. The system offers some colour combination proposals based on three elements: <b>colour</b> harmony, <b>impressions</b> of the townscape, and cost for the change of colours. The objective of the present paper is to construct the colour harmony and Kansei evaluation models that evaluate colour combinations in the colour planning support system. The colour harmony equations by Moon and Spencer are employed {{for the construction of}} the colour harmony model. The Kansei model, which quantifies the impressions of the townscape, is constructed from the approach of Kansei engineering with neural networks. After the construction, evaluation experiments are conducted for 20 subjects to test the performance of both models.

Nevertheless, further research along these lines has been found desirable, chiefly for two reasons. First, since the publication of the papers referred to a number of new varieties has appeared with shades of colour very different from those known hitherto.

There are reports of keloid management with pulsed dye laser (PDL), fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser individually and also in combination of CO 2 with PDL and CO 2 with Nd:YAG. Here, we discuss a combination of all the 3 lasers as a therapy for keloids. Aim: This study aims to assess the efficacy of fractional CO 2 laser, long pulse Nd:YAG laser and PDL in the management of keloids.

6000|$|Everything, as {{he passed}} through the place, went on--all the offices of life, the whole bustle of the market, and withal, surprisingly, scarce less that of the nursery and the playground; the whole sprawl in especial of the great gregarious fireside: it was a {{complete}} social scene in itself, on which types might figure and passions rage and plots thicken and dramas develop, without reference to any other sphere, or perhaps even to anything at all outside. The signs of this met him at every turn as he threaded the labyrinth, passing from one extraordinary masquerade of expensive objects, one portentous [...] "period" [...] of decoration, one violent phase of publicity, to another: the heavy heat, the luxuriance, the extravagance, the quantity, the <b>colour,</b> gave the <b>impression</b> of some wondrous tropical forest, where vociferous, bright-eyed, and feathered creatures, of every variety of size and hue, were half smothered between undergrowths of velvet and tapestry and ramifications of marble and bronze. The fauna and the flora startled him alike, and among them his bruised spirit drew in and folded its wings. But he roamed and rested, exploring and in a manner enjoying the vast rankness--in the depth of which he suddenly encountered Mrs. Folliott, whom he had last seen, six months before, in London, and who had spoken to him then, precisely, of Phil Bloodgood, for several years previous her confidential American agent and factotum too, as she might say, {{but at that time}} so little in her good books, for the extraordinary things he seemed to be doing, that she was just hurrying home, she had made no scruple of mentioning, to take everything out of his hands.|$|R
40|$|Children’s {{drawings}} are graphic visual {{records of}} learning experiences (e. g. a zoo outing) often {{displayed on the}} walls of Singapore preschools to celebrate children’s learning and teachers’ teaching. At best, drawings are pictures to report to parents (e. g. child’s <b>colouring</b> skills or <b>impressions</b> of learning). Drawings are under utilized as representations of learning and thinking to inform teachers’ practices in lesson planning. First of all, a questionnaire survey with 325 teachers was collated to understand factors that influence teaching decisions. While face-to-face interviews with 61 children (5 - 6 years) had provided factors that influence their learning from children’s perspectives. The study aimed to explore with the goal of developing a strategy to teach teachers to read children’s drawings for information to support learning. As a result, the Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives (TEO) : cognitive processes (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) with a focus on learning and cognition was the framework for the “children’s drawing evaluation checklist” designed to deduce information of content-knowledge and cognitive processes. About 140 teacher-respondents evaluated 50 pre-and post-lesson drawings on wild animals and the water cycle by 25 children (5 – 6 years old) from two preschools. The findings showed children’s cognitive processes were directed at Bloom’s “Remember,” “Understand,” “Apply,” and “Analyze,” capturing alongside rich information of children’s spontaneous knowledge. The checklist was later revised and integrated with Biggs and Collis (1982) the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy to reflect the amount of information represented. The revised checklist was tested with 18 mainstream teachers to evaluate wild animals and the water cycle drawings. To test for generalizability, the checklist was tested with 22 special needs teachers to evaluate 17 high functioning special needs children’s (5 - 6 years old) drawings. Consequently, implications of the use of information in children’s drawings in this study are discussed. ...|$|R
60|$|Lastly, I made an Instrument XY {{in fashion}} of a Comb, whose Teeth being in number sixteen, were about an Inch {{and a half}} broad, and the Intervals of the Teeth about two Inches wide. Then by {{interposing}} successively the Teeth of this Instrument near the Lens, I intercepted Part of the Colours by the interposed Tooth, whilst {{the rest of them}} went on through the Interval of the Teeth to the Paper DE, and there painted a round Solar Image. But the Paper I had first placed so, that the Image might appear white as often as the Comb was taken away; and then the Comb being as was said interposed, that Whiteness by reason of the intercepted Part of the Colours at the Lens did always change into the Colour compounded of those Colours which were not intercepted, and that Colour was by the Motion of the Comb perpetually varied so, that in the passing of every Tooth over the Lens all these Colours, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, did always succeed one another. I caused therefore all the Teeth to pass successively over the Lens, and when the Motion was slow, there appeared a perpetual Succession of the Colours upon the Paper: But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the Colours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished from one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer, but from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour. Of the Light which now by the Mixture of all the Colours appeared white, there was no Part really white. One Part was red, another yellow, a third green, a fourth blue, a fifth purple, and every Part retains its proper Colour till it strike the Sensorium. If the Impressions follow one another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived, there is made a distinct Sensation of all the Colours one after another in a continual Succession. But if the Impressions follow one another so quickly, that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of them all one common Sensation, which is neither of this Colour alone nor of that alone, but hath it self indifferently to 'em all, and this is a Sensation of Whiteness. By the Quickness of the Successions, the Impressions of the several Colours are confounded in the Sensorium, and out of that Confusion ariseth a mix'd Sensation. If a burning Coal be nimbly moved round in a Circle with Gyrations continually repeated, the whole Circle will appear like Fire; the reason of which is, that the Sensation of the Coal in the several Places of that Circle remains impress'd on the Sensorium, until the Coal return again to the same Place. And so in a quick Consecution of the <b>Colours</b> the <b>Impression</b> of every <b>Colour</b> remains in the Sensorium, until a Revolution of all the Colours be compleated, and that first Colour return again. The Impressions therefore of all the successive Colours are at once in the Sensorium, and jointly stir up a Sensation of them all; and so it is manifest by this Experiment, that the commix'd Impressions of all the Colours do stir up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that Whiteness is compounded of all the Colours.|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Background Aventure AB {{has created}} a "between-meal beverage" with high protein and energy content aimed at older and/or {{physically}} active individuals. Aventure AB wished to transform this high energy drink to a plant-based product, because of the growing trend of plant-based diets. Aim The aim of this project was to replace the protein source in the beverage ”Skaka & smaka - strawberry taste”, while maintaining good flavour and texture. The original beverage contains whey protein, {{which was to be}} replaced with a vegetable source. Materials and methods A new plant-based beverage was developed from the original recipe. Four different alternative protein sources were added and evaluated with regard to taste, visual look, pH, dry matter, viscosity, brix, protein and energy content. To beverages based on different protein sources, four different juice concentrates were added in varying combinations and concentrations. Aromas were also added and a change of the fruit-purée recipe was made. The salt concentration was modified. The final product was evaluated through a consumer sensory analysis at a sports centre in Lund. The participants were asked to judge it by first <b>impression,</b> <b>colour,</b> odour, flavour, texture and overall impression on a 9 -point hedonic scale. 76 individuals participated and compared the original beverage with the new plant-based one. Results and Discussion A beverage containing pea protein with a combination of a new fruit purée with a reduced amount of strawberries but an increased amount of bananas was selected as the most promising candidate. Further improvement of this beverage included addition of a juice concentrate mixture (6 mL/ 100 g), containing 50 % apple concentrate + 50 % lime concentrate. The salt content in the beverage was 0. 03 g salt/ 100 g beverage. The sensory analysis revealed a significant difference regarding the first impression and flavour in favour of the original beverage, while a significant difference in colour appeared in favour of the new one containing pea protein. 19. 6 % of the participating women, and 22. 5 % of the men claimed that they would buy the new plant-based beverage. Conclusion A plant-based version of Skaka & smaka has been developed, and the sensory analysis indicates that the new product has potential on today's market. However, the beverage requires further development to satisfy all the needs within the target group...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{one and the same}} {{interior}} colouring will appear different in rooms with windows facing north or facing south, but it is not known how natural daylight from these two compass points affects perceived colour {{and the ways in which}} colour is experienced. The objective is to describe the perceived colours to be expected in rooms with sunlight and diffused light, and thus develop a tool for colour design. Two empirical investigations provide the basis for six attached papers. The model is exploratory with a qualitative character. One hundred and ninety-one studies were carried out with 79 observers in full-scale rooms, with double-glazed transparent room windows facing north or south. The NCS colour sample collection and colour terminology were used, with three yellow, red, blue and green hues in two nuances: whitish 1010 and more chromatic 1030. The walls were painted in a total of 23 selected inherent colours with each colour observed in up to 10 studies. Colour matching was achieved using a colour reference box and results were analysed with the aid of the terms inherent colour and identity colour. The colour reference box was tested in a separate study to investigate any methodological problems. Room character was described using semantic differentials, and data was processed using the SPSS statistics program. Verbal description using own words was applied in a descriptive and reflecting method to find sensory differences and precise, yet ordinary descriptions. Colour differences between rooms were assessed using verbal description of hue and nuance, and a supplementary method with specified <b>colour</b> samples. Emotional <b>impressions</b> of <b>colour</b> and rooms were assessed using a method describing primary emotions and the results were compared with results from another study using small colour samples. The colouring that enhanced or neutralised room light situation was compared as regards emotional impression and thereafter compared with results from another study. Daylight from the different compass points caused a clear shift in hue and nuance. The perceived colour was consistently more chromatic and more blackish than the inherent colour used. Nuance 1010 shifted more in chromaticness than nuance, while 1030 instead increased most in chromaticness. Even minor colour differences resulted in major differences in colour experience. The north-facing room in yellowish colours shifted towards reduced yellowishness in both hue and chromaticness. Indications were that north-facing rooms in reddish blue become more reddish than south-facing rooms. QC 2010071...|$|R
