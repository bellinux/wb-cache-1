40|$|Abstract—One task of <b>content</b> {{management}} is {{the publication of}} <b>content.</b> The necessary means to render <b>content</b> into documents are usually developed alongside other aspects of <b>content</b> management systems, in particular the <b>content’s</b> schema. There are <b>content</b> management applications, however, that require open and dynamic <b>content</b> modeling and management. These concept-oriented <b>content</b> management (CCM) systems have been studied carefully. As a consequence, <b>content</b> visualization {{in this kind of}} applications has to be adaptive and cannot be statically tailored to one given <b>content</b> structure alone. This paper gives a roundup of CCM, discusses means to abstractly define <b>content</b> visualizations, and presents an approach to adaptive visualization. The paper is an extended version of [1].

5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals. Enriched lower crust and upper mantle might also contribute. Finally, the mixing of magma chamber <b>contents</b> with new and more mafic magma shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified magma chamber, with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper <b>contents</b> and hotter and denser lower <b>contents.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the <b>contents</b> of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the <b>contents</b> {{and the nature of the}} <b>contents</b> of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the <b>contents</b> of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E

40|$|With {{file based}} workflows, the <b>content</b> {{lifecycle}} {{has become much}} more complex and demanding. <b>Content</b> supply has also evolved introducing new models, such as user generated <b>content.</b> The technology evolution in these areas has led to a significant proliferation of digital media formats for supply and distribution. This has led to complex IT infrastructure and workflows for <b>content</b> life cycle management. Interestingly, as more <b>content</b> transformation is added to the workflow, more <b>content</b> quality issues arise. <b>Content</b> quality issues directly impact the operational efficiencies in terms of human productivity, improvement in <b>content</b> throughput, quality, management, and monetization throughout the <b>content</b> lifecycle. In addition, the tight time-to-delivery limits <b>content</b> scrutiny and hence leads to more <b>content</b> quality issues. There is a critical need for automated QC as a multi-point process to ensure not only <b>content</b> quality but <b>content</b> readiness at all stages. <b>Content</b> readiness goes beyond the generally known quality issues to regulatory issues, workflow issues, and others. The resulting <b>content</b> readiness would have direct impact on operational efficiencies across the entire <b>content</b> lifecycle...|$|R

5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the <b>contents</b> of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of <b>contents</b> was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their <b>contents.</b> Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
