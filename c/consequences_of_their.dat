5|$|In these {{compliance}} models {{the possibility}} of entities breaking a law has both a likelihood of occurrence and a consequence of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'. Considering entities' likelihood of not complying and the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> not complying usually provides a 'power distribution' of a few large consequence or higher likelihood clients and many more lower consequence/likelihood ones.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} bad things from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
5|$|The fifth Volume begins {{three months}} later. The family's rocketship has set {{down in a}} frozen region of a planet, where Dengo meets with members of The Last Revolution, a radical anti-war group, who wish to use Hazel as a pawn in their {{campaign}} against Landfall and Wreath. Meanwhile, as Marko and Prince Robot IV struggle to maintain their alliance while in pursuit of their kidnapped loved ones, Alana and Yuma both deal with the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> use of the drug Fadeway. By {{the end of the}} arc, Dengo has turned on the revolutionaries, but is himself killed by Prince Robot IV, who is united with his son. Marko and Alana are reunited, but Hazel and Klara are relegated to a Landfallian prison. The Brand, Gwendolyn and Sophie have acquired the elixir, but the Brand is killed in the process.|$|E

5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E

25|$|Berkshire Hathaway, {{the holding}} company managed by Warren Buffett, does not {{purchase}} D insurance for its directors, unlike most similar companies. Warren Buffett believes that the directors should face <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mistakes the way that other shareholders do. Notably, however, this statement overlooks the holding-company structure of Berkshire Hathaway, auxiliary indemnification agreements with Buffett, and the individual operating companies may still purchase such insurance.|$|E
25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} misdirection and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually come out on top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|These loan {{conditions}} {{ensure that}} the borrowing country {{will be able to}} repay the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems {{in a way that would}} negatively impact the international economy. The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.|$|E
25|$|Moral hazard is the {{prospect}} that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that {{they are responsible for}} the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.|$|E

25|$|Something of Hampden's fame {{no doubt}} is {{owing to the}} {{position}} which he took up as the opponent of ship money. But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others {{as far as possible}} from the evil <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition {{conflict}} is a cognitive function that arises in people and {{allows them to}} {{make decisions based on}} immediate stimuli and stimuli that require a higher level of processing. In sober individuals, situations that produce an inhibition conflict would consist of one set of salient cues (external stimuli) that stimulate a certain response and other cues (internal stimuli such as possible negative consequences or societal standards and norms) that would inhibit the salient cues and therefore prevent rash action. Those influenced by alcohol myopia are unable to comprehend this second set of cues, as the condition narrows an individual’s ability for higher-level cognitive functioning. Therefore, these individuals tend to act rashly without consideration for the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the number}} of {{children}} with parents meeting the DSM-V criteria for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, in 1996 there were an estimated 26.8 million children of alcoholics (COAs) in the United States of which 11 million were under the age of 18. As of 1988, it was estimated that 76 million Americans, about 43% of the U.S. adult population, have been exposed to alcoholism or problem drinking in the family, either having grown up with an alcoholic, having an alcoholic blood relative, or marrying an alcoholic. While growing up, nearly one in five adult Americans (18%) lived with an alcoholic. In 1992, it was estimated that one in eight adult American drinkers were alcoholics or experienced problems as <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> alcohol use.|$|E

25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may {{make it easier to}} get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E
25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E
