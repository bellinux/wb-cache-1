5000|$|In 1997, {{anthropologist}} Thomas W. Murphy located {{an active}} Third <b>Conventionist</b> community in Ozumba, Mexico, despite the widespread understanding among scholars that such groups had disappeared. It was situated in Colonia Industrial, founded in 1947 as {{the community of}} Margarito Bautista, a prominent Third <b>Conventionist.</b> According to a local leader, there were 700 adherents going as [...] "Mormons" [...] with the institutional name of El Reino de Dios en su Plenitud (The Kingdom of God in its Fulness). The group practiced plural marriage and communal principles {{of the law of}} consecration, and seemed to be moderately affluent. They were affiliated with the Apostolic United Brethren Mormon fundamentalist church, and saw Owen Allred as a prophet. Murphy also learned about another Third <b>Conventionist</b> group of about 300 strong, existing in San Gabriel Ometotztla, Puebla, called La Iglesia de los Santos de la Plenitud de los Tiempos (The Church of the Saints of the Fullness of Times).|$|E
5000|$|As {{for those}} left behind, on 20 March 1791 the electors of 'Aube' met and elected as their Bishop Fr. Augustin Sibille, {{who had been}} curé of the parish of Saint-Pantaleon in Troyes for thirty years. He was consecrated in Paris on 3 April by Constitutional Bishops Jean Baptiste Gobel (Paris), Miroudot and Gouttes. [...] The consecration was valid, but it was illicit and schismatic; no bulls of consecration had been issued by Pope Pius VI. Bishop Sibille took {{possession}} of his cathedral in Troyes on Palm Sunday, 17 April 1791. At the end of 1793, however, the closing of all churches and the abolition of religion was decreed by the <b>Conventionist</b> Alexandre Rousselin. Sibille resigned the priesthood on 18 November 1793, which saved him from certain death {{at the hands of}} the Terror. He died on 11 February 1798.|$|E
5000|$|By 1850 {{the former}} {{governor}} general's residence had {{become known as the}} Imperial Palace, since it was the residence of Emperor Faustin I of Haiti and his wife, Empress Adélina. John Bigelow, an editor at the New York Evening Post, visited the palace in 1850 and described it as [...] "only one story, raised {{a few feet from the}} ground, and approached by four or five steps, which extend all around the edifice." [...] He also noted aspects of the interior decoration: [...] "The floor one waiting room is white marble, the furniture in black hair-cloth and straw. On a richly carved table appeared a beautiful bronze clock, representing the arms of Haiti—namely, a palm-tree surrounded with fascines of pikes and surmounted with the Phrygian cap. The walls were decorated with two fine portraits ... One represents the celebrated French <b>conventionist,</b> the Abbé Grégoire, and the other the reigning Emperor of Haiti .... The latter does honor to the talent of a mulatto artist, the Baron Colbert." [...] An adjoining salon, where [...] "grand receptions are given," [...] displayed [...] "portraits of all the great men of Haiti".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Conventionists</b> {{called for}} more radical, {{immediate}} land reform which Carranza’s government did not agree with. They also wanted to implement the Plan of Ayala (1911), written by Emiliano Zapata calling for the redistribution of land. In addition, Villa and Zapata wanted a decentralized federal government with more state autonomy. With this, the <b>Conventionists</b> garnered {{the support of the}} countryside.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Constitionalist and <b>Conventionists,</b> the two groups worked together to defeat General Victoriano Huerta. Huerta had overthrown President Francisco Madero and taken over the government in 1913. Opposition to Huerta was led by Venustiano Carranza, along with generals, Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón. They were loosely allied with Emiliano Zapata. Together, they defeated Huerta in 1914. At The Convention of Aguascalientes in the fall of 1914, the winning revolutionary factions were unable to agree and a civil war ensued between the Constitutionalists and <b>Conventionists.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even when Villa was retreating, {{having lost}} the Battle of Celaya in 1915 and Obregón took the capital from the <b>Conventionists</b> who retreated to Toluca, Zapata did not open a second front.|$|R
5000|$|Eulalio Gutiérrez Ortiz (February 4, 1881 - August 12, 1939) was {{a general}} in the Mexican Revolution from state of Coahuila. He is most notable for his {{election}} as provisional president of Mexico during the Aguascalientes Convention and led {{the country for a}} few months between November 6, 1914, and January 16, 1915. The Convention was convened by revolutionaries who had successfully ousted the regime of Victoriano Huerta {{after more than a year}} of conflict. Gutiérrez rather than [...] "First Chief" [...] (Primer Jefe) Venustiano Carranza was chosen president of Mexico and a new round of violence broke out as revolutionary factions previously united turned against each other. [...] "The high point of Gutiérrez's career occurred when he moved with the <b>Conventionist</b> army to shoulder the responsibilities of his new office president." [...] Gutiérrez's government was weak and he could not control the two main generals of the Army of the Convention, Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Gutiérrez moved the capital of his government from Mexico City to San Luis Potosí. He resigned as president and made peace with Carranza. He went into exile in the United States, but later returned to Mexico. He died in 1939, outliving many other major figures of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Conventionists</b> were a faction led by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata {{which grew}} in {{opposition}} to the Constitutionalists of Venustiano Carranza and Álvaro Obregón during the Mexican Revolution. It was named for the Convention of Aguascalientes of October to November 1914.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the civil war, the <b>Conventionists</b> {{captured}} Mexico City in late 1914. There were approximately 150,000 soldiers in both factions in 1915. By spring of 1915, Obregón began to defeat the <b>Conventionists.</b> Zapata retreated to his home state, occasionally sending troops to Villa. Villa was defeated at the Battle of Celaya, followed by losses at León, Santa Ana, Aguascalientes, and Agua Prieta. By 1917, Carranza was elected president and the civil war was over. Guerilla skirmishes would continue separately by the armies of Zapata and Villa near their home states. In 1919, Zapata was killed by Carranza’s government. Villa signed a peace treaty with Carranza’s successor, Adolfo de la Huerta in 1920 but died in an ambush three years later in 1923.|$|R
50|$|Several {{members of}} the Third Convention were {{temporarily}} excommunicated by the LDS Church during {{the period in which}} it was active, although most of these were changed to the lesser punishment of disfellowshipment by President George Albert Smith in 1946, signaling a compromise. Rapprochement continued with President Smith's visit to Mexico that year, resulting in most Third <b>Conventionists</b> returning to the fellowship of the LDS Church.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the final}} months of 1914, Blanco {{was one of}} the most {{powerful}} generals in Mexico City. [...] However, both Carranza and Obregón began to doubt his loyalty, and suspected that he would defect with his army and join Pancho Villa’s forces, and he fell out of favor. [...] This was the beginning of Blanco’s decline. [...] Soon, Carranza considered him untrustworthy, and Blanco’s disagreements with Obregón escalated, especially as a result of his actions during the Convention of Aguascalientes in October. [...] The Convention attempted to establish a new government and asked Carranza to step down. [...] When Carranza refused, the Convention participants split into two factions: the Constitutionalists headed by Carranza and Obregón, and the <b>Conventionists,</b> nominally headed by Eulalio Gutiérrez, but actually under the control of Villa and Zapata. [...] Blanco elected not to follow Carranza and Obregón and instead aligned himself with the <b>Conventionists</b> and Eulalio Gutiérrez. [...] Gutiérrez, however, could not control Villa and Zapata, and so he attempted to force both of them out of his government. [...] Blanco supported Gutiérrez, and Gutiérrez lost. [...] Then in late January 1915, Blanco lost the support of Zapata because he refused to attack Pablo González at Querétaro. [...] Zapata asked Villa to arrest and hold him for execution.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the cleavages that structured {{the debates}} within the Convention on the Future of Europe. Taking the {{positions on the}} institutional rules governing EU social policy as an empirical example, it addresses {{the question of whether}} these positions were determined by party politics or by national interests. The article also examines how the delegates’ different institutional backgrounds affected their positions. A statistical analysis of a new data set on the positions of <b>conventionists</b> towards EU social policy expansion shows that, overall, delegates’ positions were determined by a mixture of party politics and national interests. At the same time, there are institutional effects separating representatives of government parties, who tended to stress national interests, from actors representing opposition parties, who acted more according to a party political logic. cleavages; EU Convention; national interests; party politics; social policy...|$|R
5000|$|Following the Glorious Revolution and the {{overthrow}} of James II, the Duke held Edinburgh Castle against the Protestant <b>Conventionists.</b> However, he is remembered as being [...] "vacillating in his defence" [...] and eventually surrendered the Castle on 14 June 1689. As {{a result of his}} actions in Edinburgh, he was received somewhat coldly by King James at his residence in exile, the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. On his return to Scotland he was confined on parole. Shortly after this, his Duchess left him and retired to a convent in Flanders. The Duke temporarily regained favour with the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 and was recognised by her as a Knight of the Thistle when she revived the Order on 31 December 1703. However, the Duke, being a true Gordon, could not stay out of trouble for very long.|$|R
