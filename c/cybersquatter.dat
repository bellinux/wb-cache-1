40|$|Websites have {{provided}} a very strong platform for businesses to reach their customers. They surpass the regular billboards by providing portals through which transactions are conducted without any physical contacts between a seller and a buyer. This usefulness {{underscores the importance of}} domain names through which websites are navigated. <b>Cybersquatters</b> have in bad faith targeted or hijacked domain names of famous and reputable businesses exploiting the goodwill of these names and misleading customers and other internet users. This paper explores the construction of bad faith under both the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy and the US Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. The paper argues that, despite some inconsistencies, â€œbad faithâ€ elements have been broadly interpreted to embrace various activities of <b>cybersquatters.</b> It cautions that an overzealous application of the instruments may stifle freedom of speech...|$|R
2500|$|Most courts {{particularly}} frowned on cybersquatting, {{and found}} that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., [...] "trafficking" [...] in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement. [...] Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against <b>cybersquatters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), {{trademark}} holders {{can file}} a case at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) against typosquatters (as with <b>cybersquatters</b> in general).

50|$|Domain names used {{in works}} of fiction have often been {{registered}} in the DNS, either by their creators or by <b>cybersquatters</b> attempting to profit from it. This phenomenon prompted NBC to purchase the domain name Hornymanatee.com after talk-show host Conan O'Brien spoke the name while ad-libbing on his show. O'Brien subsequently created a website based on the concept and {{used it as a}} running gag on the show.|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} measure against fast flux {{is to take}} down the domain name it uses. Registrars are, however, reluctant to do so because domain owners are legitimate customers for them and there's no worldwide-enforced policy of what constitutes an abuse. In addition to this, <b>cybersquatters,</b> including fast flux operators (who typically register new names on demand), are their main source of income. Security experts keep working on measures to ease this process.|$|R

Schlereth originally chose the name Rock Hoover, however after <b>cybersquatters</b> took several domain names pertaining to that name he dropped the k from Rock and became Roc Hoover. He announced on May 4, 2007, that he was cast as Detective Roc Hoover, a recurring role, on the soap opera, Guiding Light.|$|R

5000|$|Neither the UDRP nor the ACPA {{provides}} much {{deterrent to}} curb trademark owners’ abuse of their rights. To abate reverse domain name hijacking practices, some legal professionals believe Congress should enact {{laws that are}} specifically designed to facilitate litigation against reverse <b>cybersquatters.</b> [...] Similarly, some advocates argue for stronger penalties to deter the unlawful deprivation of validly registered domain names, such as fines and precluding offending trademark owners from filing cybersquatting claims for a designated period of time.|$|R
50|$|The tie-in website http://www.tedmosbyisajerk.com was {{initially}} bought {{to prevent it}} being exploited by <b>cybersquatters,</b> then a simple website was added. Associate producer Carl MacLaren had the idea to do a song for the website, which sprawled into a much longer 20-minute work. The song syncs up slightly with the episode a la the alleged The Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz sync, which {{can be seen on}} the season 3 DVD. The vocals were performed by Charlene Amoia (Wendy the Waitress).|$|R
50|$|A UDRP {{proceeding}} can {{be faster}} and cheaper for trademark owners than an ACPA lawsuit. Also, UDRP outcomes {{tend to be}} pro-plaintiff because many UDRP arbitrators are trademark lawyers. However, some trademark owners prefer to bring ACPA claims because they offer more remedies than the cancellation or transfer of the domain name (the only remedies available under UDRP proceedings) and a court ruling {{can lead to a}} final resolution of the matter. Also, a suit under the ACPA may deter future <b>cybersquatters</b> more effectively than a UDRP proceeding.|$|R

25|$|After {{venture capital}} {{was no longer}} available, the {{operational}} mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A money-losing company's lifespan was measured by its burn rate, {{the rate at which}} a non-profitable company lacking a viable business model spent its existing capital. Many dot-coms ran out of capital and were acquired or went through liquidation; the domain names were purchased by old-economy competitors, speculators or <b>cybersquatters.</b> Several companies and their executives were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined top investment firms including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch millions of dollars for misleading investors. Various supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for their services fell.|$|R
5000|$|In Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008), the domainer lost {{under the}} ACPA. One of the defendants, Basic Fusion, Inc. {{argued that they}} were not <b>cybersquatters,</b> but as an Internet {{registrar}} accredited by ICANN they could register domain names on behalf of its customers and it specialized in [...] "bulk registration". Navigation Catalyst Systems, another defendant and a customer of Basic Fusion, used their [...] "proprietary automated tool" [...] to find domain names that were not already registered and then registered them using Basic Fusion. Navigation used the five days following the registration (the [...] "advertisement grace period") to put advertisements on the websites making money from the advertisements even when they dropped the domain name registration before the five-day window closed. Plaintiff Verizon argued that defendants [...] "registered" [...] 1,392 domain names that were confusingly similar to plaintiff's trademarks. The Court found that defendants used the confusingly similar domain names with a bad faith intent to profit.|$|R
40|$|In 1999, Congress {{passed the}} Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) to combat “cybersquatters” who profited by {{registering}} domain names that were confusingly similar to established trademarks. Under the ACPA, trademark owners {{have a specific}} cause of action against domain name registrants accused of cybersquatting. Moreover, the law gives U. S. courts in rem jurisdiction over trademark infringing domain names registered to parties that {{are not subject to}} personal jurisdiction. Over the past decade, proceeding in rem against domain names has proven to be an effective strategy for trademark owners. While many companies have used the ACPA against <b>cybersquatters,</b> others have relied on the in rem provision to secure domain names registered to foreign companies that happen to use a similar mark for their goods or services. From a policy perspective, this latter practice is troubling because it allows district courts to determine whether foreign companies can use their marks as domain names, even if these companies lack minimum contacts with the court’s forum. To prevent such overreach, courts should limit the ACPA’s in rem jurisdiction to domain names that were registered in a bad faith attempt to profit from another’s trademark...|$|R
50|$|Typosquatting, {{also called}} URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, {{is a form}} of cybersquatting, and {{possibly}} brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a <b>cybersquatter).</b>|$|E
50|$|Cybersquatting (also {{known as}} domain squatting), {{according}} to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent {{to profit from the}} goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The <b>cybersquatter</b> then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.|$|E

Even though Love did not register her trademarked name until 2008, the World Intellectual Property Organization ruled that Love had established a common law trademark to her name.|$|E
40|$|In the lead-up to {{the next}} presidential election, it will be {{important}} for candidates both to maintain an online presence and to exercise control over bad faith uses of domain names and web content related to their campaigns. What are the legal implications for the domain name system? This Article examines the large gaps and inconsistencies in current domain name law and policy as to domain name use in the political context. Current domain name policy focuses on protecting trademark uses of domain names against bad faith commercial 2 ̆ 2 <b>cybersquatters.</b> 2 ̆ 2 It does not deal with protecting important uses of domain names as part of the political process. This Article identifies the current problems with Internet domain name policy in the political context and makes recommendations for developing clearer guidelines for uses of political domain names. In so doing, it creates a new categorization system for different problems confronting the political process in cyberspace, including: (a) socially and economically wasteftil political 2 ̆ 2 cybersquatting 2 ̆ 2; (b) political 2 ̆ 2 cyberfraud, 2 ̆ 2 which might involve conduct such as registering a politician 2 ̆ 7 s name as a domain name to promulgate a misleading message about the politician; and (c) competition between politicians 2 ̆ 7 names and competing trademark interests...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between trade marks and domain names {{has been a}} major subject of legal debate over the past few years. The issues arising from the relationship between trade marks and domain names reveal the difficulties associated with attempts to establish mechanisms to address the problems existing between them. Trade mark laws have been adopted to resolve the trade mark and domain name conflict, resulting in more conflict. Domain name registers have to date been constructed on the basis of first come first served. Given that the generic indicators are very general, it has been inevitable that problems would arise, particularly once the commercial potential of the Internet began to be realised. Unlike domain names, trade marks are protected in ways which are more precise. Trade marks may not be imitated either exactly or in a manner so similar that it is likely to confuse {{a significant portion of the}} public. It is possible for more than one enterprise to use the same trade mark in respect of different goods, although this is not possible with domain names. This disparity in objectives leads to two core problems. The first problem relates to <b>cybersquatters</b> who deliberately secure Top Level Domains (TLDs) containing the names or marks of well known enterprises in order to sell them later. The second problem relates to the rival claims between parties who have genuine reasons for wanting particular TLDs, and problems associated with the resolution of such claims. The disputes between parties with legitimate conflicting interests in domain names are often not equitably and effectively resolved, thus compromising the rights of domain name holders. There is great activity in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) to provide a more substantial system of governing and regulating the Internet. There is a strong movement to provide methods of arbitrating conflicts between honest claims to TLDs which conflict either in Internet terms or in trade mark law. However, these difficult policies remain to be settled. South Africa's progress towards the establishment of an effective mechanism to govern and regulate the Internet has been hindered by the absence of a policy to resolve domain related trade mark disputes. South Africa only recently drafted the South African Regulations for Alternative Domain Name Dispute Resolution (zaADRR), although the regulations have not yet been adopted. Therefore South African parties to domain name disputes continue to find solutions to their problems through the court system or foreign dispute resolution policies. The purpose of this study is firstly to examine and to comment on the basic issues of trade mark law and domain names in this area, with particular reference to South Africa, and secondly to examine the mechanisms in place for the resolution of trade mark and domain name disputes and to highlight the issues that flow from that. An additional purpose of this study is to discuss the policies of the dispute resolution mechanisms and to suggest how these policies can be improved...|$|R
40|$|In an {{information}} society, {{wealth and power}} are increasingly linked to access to knowledge and control over telecommunications media. Struggles over access to digital media in particular are presenting uniquely contentious First Amendment problems. The creation of about 200 million blogs worldwide has triggered legal action and legislative reform aimed at alleged trademark infringement by bloggers and <b>cybersquatters.</b> Authors and publishers seek expanded rights to curtail unauthorized digital uses {{for which they are}} not being compensated, and have sued Google for digitizing and indexing tens of millions of the world 2 ̆ 7 s books and periodicals. Finally, Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and other Internet and e-commerce firms are trying to beat back plans by the nation 2 ̆ 7 s cable and telephone companies to finance upgrades to their networks by levying discriminatory fees on search engines, as well as on Internet content providers and aggregators. Internet users have often been on the losing side of these controversies, as the economic model increasingly adopted by the Supreme Court is that in order to reward corporations for collecting or disseminating information, its free flow in print and electronic form must often be impeded, and its cost to the user increased. This model threatens to empower broadband companies, copyright holders, and trademark owners to restrict the right of the public to utilize digital media for purposes of free speech. This Article argues that digital media such as the broadband Internet, the World Wide Web, and the blogosphere should be at least as free as the press was {{at the time that the}} First Amendment was ratified in 1791. In other words, bloggers could not be enjoined or fined for tarnishing the trademarks or goodwill of their employers or other corporations, for trademark law did not prohibit trademark dilution or other non-competitive uses in 1791. Similarly, Web sites and search engines such as Google could not be restrained from digitizing, indexing, andproviding short previews of books and periodicals, for copyright law in 1791 permitted abridgements, adaptations, reviews, and other value-added uses of copyrighted work. Finally, the cable and telephone companies would not be at liberty to levy discriminatory access fees upondigital media outlets, for their ability to monopolize local telecommunications networks is a legacy of anticompetitive state and federal exclusion of new entrants over the past century in violation of the First Amendment. The framers of the First Amendment would no more have countenanced an attempt by Congress and the federal courts to allow private entities enjoying the fruits of past official monopolies to restrain the freedom of speech over an essential facility such as the Internet than they would have endorsed the creation of a series of local book publishing or newspaper monopolies. The framers presumed that information would flow freely and cheaply to citizens and consumers, enabling them to ascertain their true interests without difficulty, and to make decisions accordingly. As Congress considered ratifying the FirstAmendment, Madison declared that by it the liberty of the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of this Government. The Supreme Court has construed most of the other amendments in the Bill of Rights to provide at least as much protection against infringement asexisted under the common law in 1791. Opponents of net neutrality requirements have opined that the First Amendment rights of corporate owners of telecommunications infrastructure should trump the First Amendment rights of individual speakers and users of telecommunications media. Under this view, the foremost free speech interests on the Internet are those of broadband infrastructure owners, rather than the senders and recipients of Internet speech such as Web content, blogs, eBooks, or online videos. This line of argument misconceives both the distinctive character of the Internet andthe purposes for which the First Amendment was enacted. The Internet and its principal applications such as the World Wide Web grew as rapidly as they did because they were designed to be open, flexible, and uninhibited by gatekeeper control. The high degree of concentration in the broadband market, the inability of many consumers to switch broadband carriers, and plans by broadband providers to discriminate among different sources of Internet content combine to threaten the Internet as an open, decentralized, low-cost communications platform. TheFirst Amendment is not offended by regulations designed to ensure that firms awarded local telecommunications monopolies by the government exercise their power to restrict mass communication in a manner consistent with the public interest. The overriding purpose of the FirstAmendment is to ensure that readers, listeners, and viewers of public debates obtain access to a wide variety of facts and opinions so as to be able to discern the truth as best they can. Even privileging the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, surely the First Amendment interests of the creators, editors, and aggregators of Web sites, blogs, and online videos - rather than the supposed speech interests of the owners of the wires along which content travels - should prevail in the event of a conflict...|$|R
