To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white <b>crystalline</b> <b>salt</b> deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E

6000|$|Here I {{proceeded}} to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, {{but not with}} the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll's private manufacture: and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple <b>crystalline</b> <b>salt</b> of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: [...] "double" [...] occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, [...] "total failure!!!" [...] All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll's investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Salt {{formation}} {{is a widely}} used approach to improve the physicochemical and solid state properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In order {{to better understand the}} relationships between the active drug, the selected counterion and the resultant <b>salt</b> form, <b>crystalline</b> <b>salts</b> were formed using four different carboxylic acid drugs and a closely related series of amine counterions. Thirty-six related <b>crystalline</b> <b>salts</b> were prepared, characterized and the relationship between solubility and dissolution behaviour and other properties of the salt and the counterion studied. Methods: Salts of four model acid drugs, gemfibrozil, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and etodolac were prepared using the counterions butylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, benzylamine, cyclohexylamine, tert-butylamine, 2 -amino- 2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol, 2 -amino- 2 -methylpropan- 1, 3 -diol andtris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane. Salt formation was confirmed, the salts were characterized and their corresponding solubilities determined and rationalized with respect to the counterions' properties. Results and conclusion: The properties of the salt highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} counterion and, although there is considerable variation, some general conclusion can be drawn. For the alkyl amines series, increasing chain length leads to a reduction in solubility across all the acidic drugs studied and a reduction in melting point, thus contradicting simplistic relationships between solubility and melting point. Small, compact counterions consistently produce <b>crystalline</b> <b>salts</b> with high melting point accompanied with a modest improvement in solubility and the nature of hydrogen bonding between the ions has a major impact on the solubility...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{sustainable}} {{elimination of}} iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), {{it is necessary}} to consume adequately iodized salt on a regular basis and optimal iodine nutrition can be achieved through universal salt iodization. Objective: To assess the extent of use of adequately iodized salt in the urban slums of Cuttack. Materials and Methods: Using a stratified random multi-stage cluster sampling design, a cross-sectional study involving 336 households and 33 retail shops selected randomly from 11 slums of Cuttack was conducted in 2005. A predesigned pretested schedule was used to obtain relevant information and salt iodine was estimated qualitatively by using a spot testing kit and quantitatively using the iodometric titration method. Statistical Analysis: Proportion, Chi-square test. Results: Only 60. 1 &#x 0025; of the households in urban slums of Cuttack were using adequately iodized salt i. e., the iodine level in the salt was &# 8805; 15 ppm. Iodine deficiency was significantly marked in sample salts collected from katcha houses as compared with salts collected from pucca houses. Households with low financial status were using noniodized/inadequately-iodized <b>salt.</b> Both <b>crystalline</b> and refined <b>salts</b> were sold at all retail shops. <b>Crystalline</b> <b>salts</b> collected from all retailers had an iodine content &# 60; 15 ppm and refined salts collected from one retailer had iodine content &# 60; 15 ppm. About 48. 5 &#x 0025; of salt samples collected from retail shops were adequately iodized. Conclusion: In the urban slums of Cuttack, retailers were selling <b>crystalline</b> <b>salts,</b> which were inadequately iodized- this would be a setback in the progress towards eliminating IDD...|$|R
