50|$|There {{are more}} than 1,600 species and {{subspecies}} {{are at risk of}} disappearing from BC, mostly due to human-caused degradation of habitat. From peregrine falcons and monarch butterflies to grizzly bears and spotted owls, endangered species such as these are left to fend for themselves against climate change, toxic <b>contamination,</b> urban sprawl, <b>logging</b> and industrial development as there is no stand-alone endangered species law in BC. The Wilderness Committee is calling on the provincial government to enact a law that will protect the habitat of endangered species and identify, protect and establish effective recovery plans for all endangered species across BC.|$|R
40|$|Vegetables are an {{important}} source of nutrients, but they can host a large microbial population, particularly bacteria. Vegetables are {{an important}} source of nutrients, but they can host a large microbial population, particularly bacteria. Foodborne pathogens can contaminate raw vegetables at any stage of their production process with a potential for human infection. Appropriate washing can mitigate the risk of foodborne illness consequent to vegetable consumption by reducing pathogen levels, but few data are available to assess the efficacy of different practices. In the present work, six different washing methods, in {{the presence or absence of}} sanitisers (peracetic acid and percitric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hypochlorite) and vinegar, were tested for their effectiveness in reducing Salmonella and Listeria counts after artificial contamination of raw rocket (Eruca vescicaria). Results showed that washing with sodium hypochlorite (200 mg/L) was the only method able to produce a significant 2 Log reduction of Salmonella counts, but only in the case of high initial <b>contamination</b> (7 <b>Log</b> CFU/g), suggesting potential harmful effects for consumers could occur. In the case of Listeria monocytogenes, all the examined washing methods were effective, with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite solution and a solution of peracetic and percitric acids displaying the best performances (2 and 1. 5 Log reductions, respectively). This highlights the importance of targeting consumers on fit for purpose and safe washing practices to circumvent vegetable contamination by foodborne pathogens...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the towns of Dracena, Junquciropolis, Mirandopolis, Aliancas, Ilha Solteira, Castilho, Aracatuba, Birigui and Guararapes, São Paulo State, by {{surveying}} 17 Shiitake growers through a questionnaire. Data pertaining to the stages of log-Shiitake growing, recording and characterization of growers and growing systems were entered into Microsoft Excel for Windows. The results showed that Shiitake cultivation is recent and increasing in this region, and that growers have a high education level. Shiitake cultivation is mainly located in rural areas, with both Brazilians of Japanese descent and native Brazilians growing it. The most commonly used trees are eucalyptus and mango. The high level of <b>log</b> <b>contamination</b> is perhaps due to growing without temperature or moisture control and to the inappropriate growing system [...] In 2004, there were 45, 000 Shiitake-inoculated logs in this region, and the yield stood around 200 g of fresh mushroom/log. The mushrooms are picked in boxes of 200 g, and are sold mainly to Ceasa in open markets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{market for}} {{dehydrated}} vegetables {{it is important}} for most countries worldwide. Many conventional thermal methods, including airflow, vacuum, and freeze-drying, result in the falling rate period of drying. Minimal processing of vegetables includes methods for preserving of products while minimizing changes of freshness characteristics. A digital microwave oven (Samsung M 9 G 45) and IR digital moisture balance model AD- 4714 at 185 W were used for drying of parsley, pig weed and garden sorrel at 2, 4 and 6 minutes. The vitamin C content in the fresh and dried samples was determined by 2. 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol method. Microbiological investigations were carried out by plate counting method. In infrared drying, for the garden sorrel leaves, the moisture content (in db) was highest with 71. 63 % after 2 minutes and with 54. 81 % after 6 minutes comparative with microwave drying. Ascorbic acid values gave the lowest results (7. 98 mg⋅ 100 - 1 ⋅g- 1 db, respectively 3. 01 mg⋅ 100 - 1 ⋅g- 1 db for infrared and microwave dried garden sorrel) after 6 minutes. For MW, the <b>contamination</b> reduction (4 <b>log)</b> was obtained in the case of pig weed after 6 minutes of drying. The results showed that {{in a short period of}} time the leaf’s can be dried in rapidly conditions...|$|R

These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142 : 56 %), gram-positive cocci (n = 43 : 17 %), yeast cells (n = 43 : 17 %), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26 : 10 %). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48. 32 %) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55 : 61 %), gram-positive cocci (n = 21 : 23 %), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8 : 9 %) and yeast cells (n = 6 : 7 %). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes...|$|R
40|$|The multfactorial {{nature of}} bone {{injuries}} in modern warfare and emergency trauma patients warrants enhancement of existing models. To {{develop a more}} appropriate model, rat tibiae (n = 195) were mechanically injured, divided into 2 groups (with or without thermal injury), and contaminated {{with a range of}} Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan 1) inocula. In some experiments, S. aureus inocula also contained Escherichia coli or foreign bodies (sand or soil). The primary outcome measure was the amount of S. aureus remaining in the tibia (tibial bacterial load) 24 h after <b>contamination,</b> reported as <b>log</b> 10 cfu/g bone. S. aureus showed ID 50 and ID 95 values of 72 and 977 cfu, respectively. Values were lower than seen previously by using S. aureus strain SMH. S. aureus tibial bacterial loads were higher in tibiae with mechanical and thermal injury (log 10 4. 15 ± 0. 27 cfu/g) versus mechanical injury alone (log 10 3. 1 ± 0. 47 cfu/g, P = 0. 028). The addition of E. coli to the S. aureus inoculum had no effect on tibial bacterial loads (S. aureus only, log 10 4. 24 ± 0. 92 cfu/g; S. aureus + E. coli, log 10 4. 1 ± 1. 0 cfu/g, P = 0. 74). Sand, added as a foreign body, increased tibial bacterial load. Combined mechanical and thermal trauma of the tibia is associated with increased S. aureus tibial bacterial loads, increasing the risk of acute osteomyelitis. Understanding the interplay of mechanical and thermal injuries, bimicrobial contamination, and foreign bodies may improve our understanding of traumatic bone injuries and the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis...|$|R

30|$|The third {{approach}} {{in this project}} examined another potential means of <b>log</b> <b>contamination,</b> namely the possibility of colonisation of the inner bark (phloem) or outer xylem before or after felling. This aspect was reviewed by Ahumada et al. ([2012]), who investigated the risk of spreading Phytophthora pinifolia from Chile in sawn green Pinus radiata timber. A number of foliage-infecting Phytophthora species, including Phytophthora pseudosyringae T. Jung & Delatour (phylogenetically closely related to Phytophthora pluvialis) and Phytophthora kernoviae, are known to produce stem cankers on some hardwood hosts but apart from Phytophthora ramorum, Phytophthora pinifolia and Phytophthora lateralis Tucker & Milbrath there are no reports of these species from conifers (Green et al. [2013]; Robin et al. [2011]; Webber et al. [2012]; Scanu et al. [2012]; Brasier et al. [2005]; Brown and Brasier [2007]; Parke et al. [2007]; Durán et al. [2008]; Wickland et al. [2008]; Collins et al. [2009]; EPPO [2013]). If such colonisation were to occur, it could also lead {{to the production of}} oospores within the bark. In New Zealand Phytophthora-associated cankers or resin bleeding have not been recorded in Pinus radiata. Isolations from symptomatic needles and associated shoots have indicated that infection is limited to needle tissues with no occurrence of twig or branch colonisation (Dick et al. [2014]). Although successful inoculations have been conducted using detached needles and needles on potted plants (Dick et al. [2014]), attempts to inoculate bark and sapwood in the work reported here were unsuccessful. This was true despite the fact that treatments were applied under different conditions (high or ambient humidity) using a variety of propagules (mycelium, zoospores, oospores). If these species were able to colonise the bark or sapwood, {{at least one of these}} sets of circumstances should have revealed this. For instance, the ability to isolate Phytophthora kernoviae periodically after spraying oospores across the bark surface during Study 1 suggests that had colonisation taken place it should have been possible to recover this species adjacent to a single bark or sapwood inoculation point. Ahumada et al. ([2012]) were also unable to demonstrate the survival of Phytophthora pinifolia in wood of Pinus radiata after artificial inoculation (50, 000 zoospores mL- 1) or exposure to natural inoculum in diseased plantations, even though this species is able to move from infected needles into the succulent cambial tissue in young branches (Ahumada et al. [2012, 2013]). The outcomes from our studies with Phytophthora pluvialis and Phytophthora kernoviae imply that the conclusions of Ahumada et al. ([2012]) are also applicable to green radiata pine timber exported from New Zealand.|$|R
