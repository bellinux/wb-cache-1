5000|$|The {{wooden box}} does not only feature {{prominently}} {{in the name of}} the theatre, but also inspired the trade mark of the Puppenkiste: the representation of the two top <b>cover</b> <b>flaps</b> of a wooden box. Across the top covers, the name [...] "Augsburger Puppenkiste" [...] is printed, along with the addition [...] "Oehmichens marionette theatre". These box lids have long since become the official trade mark of the Puppenkiste. Every single film or theatre-production starts with a small sequence of the top covers being opened. In the actual theatre, the stage is covered by two enormous box lids (0,90x 2 metres). For the TV productions, special <b>cover</b> <b>flaps</b> were produced: they are smaller and modeled to fit the screen format with the aspect ratio 4:3. These very box tops were used mostly unchanged since the end of the 1950s in almost all TV productions of the Puppenkiste. For the production of [...] "Der Raub der Mitternachtssonne" [...] (The theft of the midnight sun) (1994), a so-called [...] "Insertkasten" [...] (insert box) was designed to fit the screen aspect ratio of 16:9, which is respectively longer than the usual 4:3 format.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: P ost {{electric}} burn defects {{are difficult to}} manage due to deep injury involving all the structures up to bony level. A good vascularized flap is required to resurface the defect for preventing the complication and for reconstruction of involved structures. AIM: Resurfacing the post {{electric burn}} defect with different flaps according to need of the defect. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All patients of electric burn hand and fore arm defect admitted to burn, p lastic and reconstructi ve department of SCB Medical College &hospital, Cuttack between January 2012 to December 2012 {{were included in the}} study. During this period the patients were followed up at weekly interval for first 2 month, then at 1 monthly interv al for next 6 - 8 month. OBSERVATION: Out of 40 cases of post electric burn forearm and hand reconstruction, 10 cases underwent groin <b>flap</b> <b>cover,</b> 6 cases underwent abdominal <b>flap</b> <b>cover,</b> 5 cases underwent cross finger <b>flap</b> <b>cover</b> 5 cases underwent free antero lateral thigh <b>flap</b> <b>cover,</b> 4 cases underwent free latissimus dorsi <b>flap</b> <b>cover,</b> 5 cases underwent first dorsal metacarpal artery <b>flap</b> <b>cover,</b> 5 cases reverse radial forearm <b>flap</b> <b>cover.</b> All the defects were resurfaced successfully with flaps. Four had marginal necrosis and six had wound infection. Eventually all flaps settled well without further intervention. Due to involvement of all important tendons & nerves, functional outcome is guarded. DISCUSSION: Hand and forearm are most commonly and most severely aff ected in electric burn injury because they are mostly first part of body to come in contact with electric circuit. Even though at initial part the injury appears to be superficial, deepe r structures like bone, tendon and neurovascular bundles are affected requiring <b>flap</b> <b>cover</b> for future reconstruction of these structures to get functional and sensate hand. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of post electric burn defect of distal forearm and hand represents great challenge due to depth of injury involving full thickness of skin and other structures like neurovascular bundle and bones and tendons. Choice depends on size of defect, availability of local or regional tissue, patient’s acceptance and cooperatio...|$|R

50|$|Concern {{was also}} raised over the {{possibility}} of loss of gas through the valves, which were of an innovative design by Michael Rope. Airship valves are intended primarily to vent gas automatically if pressure in the bag rises {{to the point that}} the bag might rupture; they are also used to adjust lift for handling. Some concern was expressed over the valves opening because of either the airship rolling heavily or localised low pressure caused by the outer <b>cover</b> <b>flapping,</b> but after an examination of their operation F. W. McWade, the Air Inspectorate Department inspector at Cardington, concluded that their operation was satisfactory and they were not likely to have been the cause of any significant loss of gas.|$|R
50|$|The Mü13s were {{constructed}} with welded steel tube fuselages faired and covered using wooden longerons with fabric and conventional wooden wings with plywood skinning {{back to the}} main spar and fabric aft. In the prototypes the trailing edge of the wings were taken up by steel-framed fabric <b>covered</b> <b>flaps</b> and ailerons, all deflectable to improve thermalling and approach control, but later production aircraft had the flaps eliminated, upper surface spoilers fitted for approach control, with the Mü13D-3 gaining increased span wings, a lengthened fuselage and an enlarged fin and rudder. This arrangement from Egon Scheibe became known as the Schüle München - Munich School. The pilot sat just forward of the main-spar with his head flanked by the wing leading-edges, severely restricting sideways vision.|$|R

Besides altering the stitching pattern to include crosses, altering the length of the longstitches to have their own patterns, and other patterns, artists have also used multiple colored thread. There are also a number of different ways to close a longstitch book. Though some longstitch bound book covers are just trimmed {{to the edge of the}} book block, there are a variety of ways to fold over one side of the cover and fasten it. Buttons can be stitched into the binding and a thread attached to the <b>cover</b> <b>flap.</b> A slit can also be cut into the front cover and a strip from the back cover can be slipped through the slit.

Genital organ {{and a pair of}} setae were observed bellow the coxal base. The <b>cover</b> <b>flap</b> of the genital organ had 12 muscles on its surface. The tubercle of the flagellate ventral seta was cone-shaped and had a length of 15 μ m. The first and second legs were six segmented where the tarsus had a single claw and a branched feathered claw.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{challenges}} of managing Gustilo IIIB tibial fractures in children are unique. A multi-disciplinary, evidence based approach is needed. We aimed {{to evaluate the}} evidence for the ortho-plastic management of Gustilo grade IIIB open tibial shaft fractures in children based on a review of all published data in order to rationalise the orthopaedic and plastic surgical approach to these complex injuries. METHOD: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was performed. Gustilo grade IIIB tibial shaft fractures in pre-adolescent and adolescent children were identified and evaluated with regard to both the skeletal and soft tissue management, and the outcome. RESULTS: Of 54 children with grade IIIB tibial fractures, a mean union time of 31 weeks included 33 weeks for 42 adolescents and 23 weeks for 12 pre-adolescents. Faster union time in pre-adolescents tended towards significance. Delayed union occurred in 22 %, nonunion in 13 %, mostly in adolescents. Two of 45 <b>covered</b> by vascularised <b>flaps</b> and 3 of 9 treated without flaps developed deep infection (p= 0. 028). There was no correlation between method of skeletal fixation and union time. CONCLUSION: Gustilo IIIB tibial shaft fractures in pre-adolescents tended towards faster healing with fewer complications, irrespective of the method of skeletal fixation. In adolescents, healing times were similar to adults. Soft tissue closure without flaps was associated with deep infection in one-third of patients, requiring debridement and <b>flap</b> <b>cover.</b> Adequate debridement and <b>flap</b> <b>cover</b> is suggested in all cases, irrespective of age...|$|R
