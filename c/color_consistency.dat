5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a <b>color</b> <b>consistency</b> between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E

Determining the agent is especially important because women may have more than one infection, or have symptoms that overlap those of another infection, which dictates different treatment processes to cure the infection. For example, women often self-diagnose for yeast infections but due to the 89% misdiagnosis rate, self-diagnoses of vaginal infections are highly discouraged.|$|E

Method: Sixteen adult New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 to 7 months, weighing between 2 and 2. 5 kg and without locomotor system abnormalities were studied. In all the animals, a defect {{was made in the}} femoral condyles of the right and left knees, measuring 3. 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth, using a trephine. The animals were divided into two groups: study group formed by the right knees, in which the medial and lateral condyles received implants of SCBG; and control group formed by the left knees, in which the medial and lateral condyles were allowed to heal naturally. The knees were assessed 90, 120 and 180 days after the operation. After the animals had been sacrificed, the anatomical specimens were resected and placed in Bouin's solution. They were then photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 5400 ® coupled to a Nikon SM 2800 ® stereoscopic loupe, to analyze the surface, <b>coloring,</b> <b>consistency,</b> continuity and healing. Results: The results were evaluated using the chi-square test. There {{were no significant differences in}} the macroscopic assessments of healing between the study and control groups.

25|$|Proper {{reproduction}} of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management {{of all the}} devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB.

Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced.

The development team explained that their previous game, Vagrant Story, which featured a [...] "strong man in his prime" [...] as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding Final Fantasy XII from a [...] "big and tough" [...] protagonist to a younger, youthful one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. With the casting of actor Kouhei Takeda for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan became less feminine and more [...] "active, upbeat bright and positive".

Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a <b>color</b> <b>consistency</b> between the characters and the environments. The designers stated that non-human characters and races feature a prominent role in the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers.|$|E

MÉTODO: Foram estudados 16 coelhos, adultos entre seis e sete meses, da raça Nova Zelândia, brancos,, com peso variando entre 2 e 2, 5 kg e sem alterações no aparelho locomotor. Em todos os animais foi feito um defeito com trefina com 3, 2 mm de diâmetro por 4 mm de profundidade nos côndilos femorais dos joelhos direito e esquerdo. Os animais foram divididos em dois grupos: Estudo - joelho direito, côndilos medial e lateral, preenchimento com GBPCA; Controle - joelho esquerdo, côndilos medial e lateral, submetidos à cicatrização natural e analisados nos períodos de 90, 120 e 180 dias após a cirurgia. Após a eutanásia, ressecaram-se as peças anatômicas, que foram imersas em solução de Bouin, para {{posterior}} fotografia com câmara Nikon Coolpix 5400 ® acoplada a lupa estereoscópica Nikon SM 2800 ® para análise da superfície, coloração, consistência, continuidade e cicatrização. RESULTADOS: Foram avaliados pelo teste do Qui-quadrado. Não houve diferenças significantes na avaliação macroscópica da cicatrização entre os grupos Estudo e Controle. CONCLUSÃO: No que se refere à superfície, coloração, consistência, continuidade e cicatrização dos defeitos, a macroscopia do tecido reparado com GBPCA se mostrou semelhante à do grupo Controle.

The mixture is homogenized, under high pressure homogenization above 130 bar (unit) and at a high temperature of 60 °C. The formation of the small globules (below 2 microns in size) previously mentioned allows for reducing a cream layer formation and increases the viscosity of the product.
