40|$|Two {{methods to}} {{establish}} a common scale across grades within a content area using a common item design (separate and concurrent) have previously been studied under simulated conditions. Separate estimation is accomplished through separate calibration and grade-by-grade <b>chained</b> <b>linking.</b> Concurrent calibration established the vertical scale in a single step by simultaneously estimating parameters for all items at all grades. These methods, and a third hybrid method, pairwise concurrent estimation, were examined in this study, using operational test data. Data were obtained from responses to the 2002 Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) mathematics assessments in grades 5 through 10. These assessments had been constructed {{to have at least}} 20 items in common between adjacent grades. The data set for each grade consisted of 10, 000 cases, randomly selected from the population of approximately 54, 000 students with valid scores at each grade. The 2002 CSAP mathematics scales were placed on a common scale spanning grades...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for assessing the structural integrity of mooring components for offshore applications. Finite element calculations were performed {{in order to determine the}} stress levels in studless and stud <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> as well as to evaluate the critical regions of the links. A study was also developed based on the concept of critical volume associated with the material volume susceptible to a certain critical crack size. The results showed that the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> present a higher critical volume than that related to the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links,</b> fact that confirms the beneficial effect of the stud. According to the crack assessment procedure the critical crack length is smaller for the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> However, the critical association between volume and crack size turns the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> more susceptible to brittle fracture than the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2002, several mooring {{chains of}} Girassol Off-loading buoy which was {{installed}} offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> was identified {{in addition to}} tension induced fatigue {{after a series of}} experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be "simple" and "adequate" {{in the sense that it}} should idealize the complicated geometry of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Then, a case study is presented in which a methodology to calculate OPB stresses for one sea-state is described. This methodology follows a de-coupled approach in which results of coupled floater-mooring analysis are taken as an input for the simplified models of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic EngineeringOffshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of continuously variable (CVT) chain drives. According to the discrete structure of the chain, which causes the polygonal actions, the mechanical model contains each <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> and pulley as a separate body. While a <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> {{is part of a}} strand, only joint forces including friction act on the <b>chain</b> <b>links,</b> whereas in the contact situation additional impulsive and frictional forces in the contact zones between the <b>chain</b> <b>link's</b> rocker pins and the tapered surfaces of the cone pulleys have to be taken into account. For the calculation of the contact forces Coulomb's friction law as well as a time sparing continuous approximation are applied. Simulation results show the influence of the cone pulley's deformation on the power transmission. They also show the repercussion of the polygonal action. Furthermore the chain's pitch influence on the vibrational behavior of the transmission is discussed. A comparison of calculated and measured tensional forces ver [...] ...|$|R

Its superstructure leans on three crawlers of the same length, width and height. During the stacker's travel from the erection site to the open pit mine, three crawler <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> fractured, presenting {{an indication of the}} problems that were to occur during exploitation. In fact, after only 1000 working hours (about three months), 30 <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> sustained fractures resulting in direct and indirect costs due to the downtime that substantially diminished the effects of the overburden removal system. The goal of the study presented in the paper was to diagnose the cause of <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> breakdown occurrence. Working stresses in the <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> are defined by applying FEM. Experimental investigations define the chemical composition, the tensile properties, the impact toughness and the macro and microhardness. Metallographic examinations are conducted additionally. Based on the results of the numerical-experimental analysis, it can be concluded that <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> breakdown is predominantly caused by (a) substantial deviation of the mechanical properties of the material with respect to those prescribed by the standard and (b) the existence of macro and microcracks in the material structure...|$|R
