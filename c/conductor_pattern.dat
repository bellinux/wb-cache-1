Typically, one would grow {{a number of}} the nanotubes oriented perpendicularly to a silicon integrated-circuit (IC) substrate, starting from (and anchored on) patterned catalytic spots on the substrate. Such arrays of perpendicular carbon nanotubes could be used as electrical interconnections between levels of multilevel ICs. The process (see Figure 1) begins with the formation of a layer, a few hundred nanometers thick, of a compatible electrically insulating material (e. g., SiO(x) or Si(y) N(z) on the silicon substrate. A patterned film of a suitable electrical conductor (Al, Mo, Cr, Ti, Ta, Pt, Ir, or doped Si), having a thickness between 1 nm and 2 m, is deposited on the insulating layer to form the IC <b>conductor</b> <b>pattern.</b> Next, a catalytic material (usually, Ni, Fe, or Co) is deposited to a thickness between 1 and 30 nm on the spots from which it is desired to grow carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes are grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Unlike the matted and tangled carbon nanotubes grown by thermal CVD, the carbon nanotubes grown by PECVD are perpendicular and freestanding because an electric field perpendicular to the substrate is used in PECVD. Next, the free space between the carbon nanotubes is filled with SiO 2 by means of CVD from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), thereby forming an array of carbon nanotubes embedded in SiO 2. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is then performed to remove excess SiO 2 and form a flat-top surface in which the outer ends of the carbon nanotubes are exposed.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the enhancement of electroquasistatic and magnetoquasistatic nondestructive evaluation techniques. The terminals of the sensors involved are connected to conductors which are traditionally located on a single plane and have a spatially-periodic structure. The sensor operates as a two-port device with one conductor used to excite the sensor and a second conductor used to sense the response to test materials. Existing measurement capabilities are extended: 1. Multiple sensing elements are incorporated into electroquasistatic and magneto-quasistatic sensors such that the response can be accurately modeled. Single sensing element sensors which remain stationary on a test material's surface cannot provide information about variations in material properties along the surface. Scanning of a single element sensor requires many passes {{in order to provide}} high resolution property mapping of the surface. By introducing an array of sensing elements it is possible to provide stationary resolution and increase the rate at which a test material's surface can be mapped. Multiple sensing elements can also provide the ability to independently measure material properties that may otherwise be inseparable. (cont.) The sensors developed allow semi-analytic models to accurately predict their response to layered-media. The sensor is then able to measure absolute material properties using only an air calibration. 2. Existing sensor modeling methods are extended to address new sensor structures. Traditional formulations for models of spatially-periodic sensors were limited to simple <b>conductor</b> <b>patterns</b> on a single plane. These models have been reformulated to address more complex <b>conductor</b> <b>patterns</b> and allow placement on multiple sensor planes. In addition, the models have been used to approximate the sensor response of sensors with aperiodic <b>conductor</b> <b>patterns.</b> 3. Instrumentation for characterizing the terminal response of a many-element sensor is developed. The two-port nature of a single element sensor allows for its characterization by commonly available impedance measurement instruments. The complete realization of the capabilities of a multiple element sensor requires that its terminal response can be rapidly and accurately characterized. An impedance instrument compatible with sensors having up to 39 elements was developed along with methods for accurate calibration. (cont.) 4. A perturbation method is presented for rapidly predicting the response of a magnetoquasistatic sensor to a notch in a conducting material. Since magnetoquasistatic sensors are often used in the detection of cracks, the ability to model the sensor response to a simplified notch representation is desired. Due to the computational efficiency offered by the spatially-periodic layered-media models, a method of utilizing the computed material current density {{in the absence of the}} notch is sought. An approximate response is determined by introducing the notch in a way that perturbs the original current distribution. The extended capabilities are demonstrated through measurements on a variety of material configurations. In some cases the measurements can be represented as images of absolute material properties. In addition to the application of this research to quasistatic measurement methods, other disciplines can benefit from this work. Modeling techniques presented are valuable for microstrip and strip-line transmission lines, microcircuits, and can possibly be applied in fields such as geology and geological exploration.

40|$|We {{consider}} resonant transmission {{through a}} finite-length quantum wire connected to leads via finite transparency junctions. The coherent electron transport is strongly modified by the Coulomb interaction. The low-temperature current-voltage ($IV$) curves show step-like {{dependence on the}} bias voltage determined by {{the distance between the}} quantum levels inside the <b>conductor,</b> the <b>pattern</b> being dependent on the ratio between the charging energy and level spacing. If the system is tuned close to the resonance condition by the gate voltage, the low-voltage $IV$ curve is Ohmic. At large Coulomb energy and low temperatures, the conductance is temperature-independent for any relationship between temperature, level spacing, and coupling between the wire and the leads...|$|R
40|$|Low-resistance printed {{conductors}} {{are crucial}} {{for the development of}} ultra-low cost electronic systems such as radio frequency identification tags. Low resistance conductors are required to enable the fabrication of high-Q inductors, capacitors, tuned circuits, and interconnects. Furthermore, conductors of appropriate workfunction are also required to enable fabrication of printed Schottky diodes, necessary for rectification in RFID circuits. Last year, we demonstrated the formation of low-resistance conductive printed structures using gold nanoparticles. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, technologies for formation of printed conductors using silver and copper nanoparticles. These are particularly advantageous for several reasons. First, both silver and copper offer a 2 X reduction in sheet resistance over gold, resulting in improved interconnect performance and inductor Q. Second, the material costs associated with both silver and copper are expected to be significantly cheaper than gold. Third, the workfunction of silver enables the fabrication of all-printed Schottky diodes with a silver rectifying contact to many common printable organic semiconductors. Solutions of organic-encapsulated silver and copper nanoparticles may be printed and subsequently annealed to form low-resistance <b>conductor</b> <b>patterns.</b> We describe novel processes for forming silver and copper nanoparticles, and discuss the optimization of the printing/annealing processes to demonstrate plastic-compatible low-resistance conductors. By optimizing both the size of the nanoparticle and the encapsulant sublimation kinetics, it is possible to produce particles that anneal at low-temperatures (< 150 °C) to form continuous films having low resistivity and appropriate workfunction for formation of rectifying contacts. This represents a major component required for all-printed RFID...|$|R

The fluid {{can be handled}} in atmospheric conditions and processed at low temperature (105 °C) with no thermal annealing. A layer conductivity exceeding 600 S/cm has been demonstrated. The particles were produced in a continuous flow reactor from copper chloride powder by hydrogen reduction at high temperature (950 °C). Results indicate that conductivity is enhanced through the formation of carbon nanotubes by addition of ethene and water to the reaction flow. The type and concentration of dispersing additive and co-solvents {{had a significant impact}} on dispersion stability and electrical conductivity of the deposited layer. Applicability of the fluid for direct patterning of coatings for e. g. antistatic purposes was demonstrated by inkjet printing of a <b>conductor</b> electrode <b>pattern...</b>|$|R

The grid pattern comprises a plurality of concentric conductive grids of selected geometric shapes which are centered about {{the center of the}} exposed active surface of the counter-doped layer. Connected to the grids is one or more conductors which extend to the cell's periphery. For the pattern area, the grids and conductors are arranged in the pattern to minimize the maximum distance which any injected majority carriers have to travel to reach any of the grids or <b>conductors.</b> The <b>pattern</b> has a multiaxes symmetry with respect to the cell center to minimize the maximum temperature differentials between points on the cell surface and to provide a more uniform temperature distribution across the cell face...|$|R
