Throughout the 17th century and the Elizabethan era, women wore <b>ceruse,</b> a lethal mixture of vinegar and white lead. They also applied egg whites to their faces to create a shiny complexion.

30|$|English and German {{lead glass}} is {{reported}} individually from the Middles Ages on [12, 13]. These glasses are either made like the usual local glass plus some lead {{added to the}} glass melt or only from sand and lead without other fluxes, which results partial in very high lead contents up to 70 wt% or more [13]. The English early modern lead crystal was manufactured from the 1670 s on [14 – 16], introduced into London by Ravenscroft and adopted by other English glassmakers from the 1680 s on [15, 16]. Assumingly, the recipe was adopted from Venetian lead glass, known from the fifteenth century on [14, 16]. Seventeenth century recipes use quartz sand or “stones from tarso”, “Levantine” or “Hispanic soda” for crystal or common frit, a premelting mixture of the glass contents. To this frit litharge is added [17, 18]. Calculated lead contents are different for known recipes from the sixteenth to the seventeenth century, Moretti gives 20  % for an anonymous manuscript from the fifteenth to the sixteenth century, around 56  % for Neris lead crystal and completely varying contents for the recipes of a glass beads manuscript contemporary to Neri (20, 45, 50, 56 and 66  %) [14]. Another Italian manuscript {{from the end of}} seventeenth century gives quartz sand, arsenic, <b>ceruse,</b> borax, minium, nitre, “tartar” and “ammoniac salt” for lead crystal, wich results in calculated lead content around 20  % [14], whereas Ravenscroft supposedly used quartz sand and/or flint stones, borax, nitre, “(calcined) tartar” and litharge [14, 16]. The hypothesized lead contents for this glass vary between 9 and 28  % [14].|$|E

Due to high response rates of induction chemotherapy in chemo-naïve patients with localized disease, their prognosis should be better than patients with recurrent disease. Methods: From January 1, 2008 to July 1, 2012, we retrospectively collected all patients’ records with SCCHN diagnosed as metastatic. Patients, disease, treatment and its results were analyzed. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: Of the 749 new patients treated for SCCHN in our institution, 16 (2. 1 %) were metastatic at diagnosis, of whom five had cytological results to prove it. Six patients died before treatment or had palliative care and ten received initial chemotherapy and then surgery and/or radiotherapy according to the primary response. Four patients treated with first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel- 5 FU-cisplatin (TPF) showed a complete response of metastatic lesions allowing locoregional treatment. The overall survival at 1 year and 3 years was 50 % and 24 %, respectively. The median survival was 7 months (1 – 72 months). Seven patients (43. 7 %) had a higher survival at 12 months, including five (31. 5 %) who are still alive without recurrence with a mean follow-up of 30 months. There was a significant difference in overall survival (P< 0. 01) between patients who had chemotherapy with TPF versus other therapeutic protocols. The median survival of patients with lung metastases only was 15 months (1 – 72 months), significantly higher than that of patients with liver and/or bone localizations, which was 2 months (1 – 9 months). Conclusion: Patients with metastatic SCCHN treated by TPF followed by multimodal treatment could achieve long survival.

40|$|On 8 April 1933, Professor Henry van de Velde {{was officially}} {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} new library of the Rijksuniversiteit Ghent, together with buildings for the Higher Institute for Art History and Classical Studies (HIKO), and the Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Institute, the latter of which was quickly replaced by an Institute for Minerology and Geology. Only the library and the HIKO were actually built on the Blandijnberg – the highest point in the city – on {{the location of the}} De Vreesebeluik, once a model neighbourhood for workers. Van de Velde’s design for the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy was also never realised. Henry van de Velde designed a high-rise functioning as a book depot, 64 meters high, his ‘fourth’ tower of Ghent, and a symbol of knowledge. The concrete construction was developed together with his colleagues Gustave Magnel and Jean-Norbert Cloquet. Van de Velde took great care with the belvedere, the highest storey, which was first conceived as a museum of books, but later became a sober reception room for important guests. He himself selected several large interior-decorating firms to carry out the work. Malcorps from Brussels did the interior: the finishing with black marble, <b>ceruse</b> oak and wenge, a plastered ceiling, a parquet floor, the metal radiator covers painted black. At the end of 1939, the interior was almost complete. During the Second World War, the tower was occupied by the German soldiers. They built a look-out {{at the top of the}} water reservoir. Later came an anti-aircraft post, which was blown up on the Germans’ retreat, resulting in damage to the reservoir. The belvedère, only completed in 1950, gradually deteriorated because of the damage. The construction of the engine room for the new lift in 1967 destroyed the harmony of the space. In 1971, the belvedere underwent not a restoration but a ‘renovation’, during which Henry Van de Velde’s designs for the ceiling and the floor were not respected. This unfortunate intervention suffered rapid deterioration due to poor maintenance. Other parts of the complex were also poorly maintained, adapted and ‘renovated’. In 2003, under the impulse of PROJECT 2, the urgent need for a complete restoration of the whole building complex was recognised. On 16 September 2005, the board of the university took the crucial decision to borrow 30 million euros for the restoration and renovation.

This study aimed to determine whether weekly cisplatin (q 1 w) could be a safe and effective alternative. Patients and methods: Two hundred and sixty-two patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, irradiated in our institution with cisplatin (q 1 w or q 3 w) between January 2004 and December 2008, were retrospectively included. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated. Survival distributions were estimated by Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Prognostic effect of chemo-radiotherapy was explored using Cox model. Results: A total of 165 and 97 patients received q 1 w and q 3 w cisplatin, respectively. Median age, stage at diagnosis, alcohol consumption, intensity-modulated radiation therapy use, median weight, and renal failure before radiotherapy were significantly different, showing lower risk in the q 3 w group. Q 3 w cisplatin {{was found to be}} more toxic in terms of weight loss, renal failure, worse chemotherapy plan completion, and grade 3 / 4 mucositis and dermatitis, with more patients requiring analgesics, secondary hospitalization, and radiotherapy interruption (≥ 3 days), and patients affected by long-term toxicities. With a median follow-up of 73 months (95 % confidence interval [CI] [68. 9 – 76. 2]), OS was found to be significantly better with q 3 w (5 years OS: 62. 3 %; 95 % CI [51. 6 – 71. 3]) than with q 1 w cisplatin (5 years OS: 52. 6 %; 95 % CI [44. 5 – 60. 0]) (log-rank P= 0. 0146). More number of patients treated according to the q 1 w schedule experienced a recurrence: 47. 3 % vs 30. 9 % (P= 0. 009). Thus, the PFS for q 3 w schedule was found to be globally better (5 years PFS: 55. 8 %; 95 % CI [45. 0 – 65. 3]) than for q 1 w schedule (5 years PFS: 43. 6 %; 95 % CI [35. 9 – 51. 0]) (log-rank P= 0. 0161). However, both multivariate analyses, OS and PFS, produce no significant hazard ratio for chemo-radiotherapy modality once adjusted on unbalanced covariates according to the descriptive analysis. Conclusion: Though q 1 w seemed to be safer than q 3 w according to the descriptive analysis, multivariate analyses failed to conclude about its efficiency. Therefore, we conclude that the q 3 w schedule should remain the standard and prospective comparisons are needed.
