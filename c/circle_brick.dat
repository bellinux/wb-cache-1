50|$|The site {{includes}} 4.25 lane {{miles of}} roadway that include several familiar features of urban driving, including signalized intersections, a railroad crossing, a roundabout, a traffic <b>circle,</b> <b>brick</b> and gravel roads, and parking spaces. Building facades {{can be moved}} and fake pedestrians can be altered for different kinds of tests. There are two simulated highway entrance ramps with ramp metering. Two features - a metal bridge and a tunnel - are a special challenge for wireless signals and radar sensors to get through.|$|E
50|$|Foundations of two minarets {{attached}} to portal are prolonged rectangular prisms. Facades of the foundations {{are treated with}} patterned placing framed with trilobite equilateral arch. Not tall, octahedral bulk {{is used as a}} pedestrian to cylindrical trunks of the minarets built of <b>circle</b> <b>brick.</b> Narrow bricks with turquoise glaze were put to vertical junctures of placing. Image of the placing gets across an Arabic ligature, beginning in the trunk of one of the minarets and finishing in the other. The inscription is written in accurate kufi script, which is similar to inscription on Momine Khatun Mousileum’s frame board. Terra-cotta colored letters were placed against a turquoise background - this method is relatively rare in Azerbaijani architecture of the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} made of bricks, it is cross - shaped, nine - fraction, five - dome. The {{composition}} is centrical, pyramidally built with the highest central dome and lower ones - over the faceted sleeves of architectural cross. So its composition reminds a wooden. Ukrainian church with five octahedral capacities - octahedrons each crowned with dome combined in on plastic unity. Thanks to such pyramidal construction the church looks tender, elegant and solemn. The facades are a characteristic feature of the church. The main role in their decoration is played by portal and windows margins: triangular pediments, frames, shallow - cut cornices. Modelled ornamentation is not used in the church, common and <b>circle</b> <b>brick</b> which replaced plinth is used both as building and ornamental material. The facades are plastered and limed The characteristic feature of the interior is its opening upwards. It is a five - chamber pillarless temple crowded by five domes. The top is designed in traditional Ukrainian style - with fractures. The walls are white washed. The domes and crosses are gilded.|$|E
50|$|The grounds {{include a}} gravel drive from Russell Street with a turning <b>circle</b> and <b>brick</b> edging, mature trees {{to the south}} and east, hedges along the south and east {{boundaries}} and an expanse of lawn with gardens to the southeast.|$|R
50|$|Buildings 2, 3, and 4 each {{featured}} a courtyard {{in the center}} of each building. The building 2 courtyard featured trees and flower gardens. The building 3 courtyard had a <b>circle</b> of <b>bricks.</b> The building 4 courtyard {{featured a}} fountain with a pond, benches, and flower gardens. Some teachers held classes in the courtyards when the weather was nice.|$|R
5000|$|Caras Park, {{located just}} south of the {{historic}} Wilma Theatre downtown, was created {{as a result of a}} land reclamation project done as the state highway department replaced the aging, two-lane Higgins Avenue Bridge in 1962 with the current four-lane structure. Before the reclamation, the Clark Fork River divided to create an island with the north channel's bank extending to nearby buildings such as the Wilma Theatre. The south channel was deepened for the increased water flow and the infilled land later became Caras Park. [...] Events in the park were not common until the early 1980s and permanent fixtures like Out to Lunch that began in 1986. The Missoula Downtown Association took over from Parks and Recreation for management of the park and made improvements to make Caras Park more event friendly. Seating, event <b>circles,</b> <b>brick</b> plazas, restrooms, and storage structures were added. Large temporary tents were used for events until 1997 when a permanent Caras Park Pavilion was constructed. [...] With its centralized, waterfront location the park has become the hub of Missoula's festivities. These include Out to Lunch, the International Wildlife Film Festival, First Night Missoula, Garden City BrewFest and offered intimate concert settings for artists such as Jewel, Chris Isaak, Santana, Ziggy Marley, and B.B. King.|$|R
5000|$|To {{pass the}} level, all destructible bricks must be shattered. Adding to the challenge, there are bricks which [...] "retract" [...] for a time, {{enabling}} {{the ball to}} pass through instead of shattering it. Certain sets of bricks also move around the <b>circle.</b> Other <b>bricks</b> take multiple hits to shatter. Steel bricks are almost indestructible, unless one hits a dymamite brick next to it, but {{are not required to}} complete the level. Dynamite bricks (indicated by red dots) when hit will take out several other bricks with its explosion but are also not required.|$|R

5000|$|The {{circle in}} front of Westcott was first closed to traffic by former Florida State University President Sandy D’Alemberte in 1994. In 2005, former Florida State University President T.K. Wetherell took steps to {{complete}} the restoration work from the prior decade, which included the removal of mildew from the Westcott Building’s front and paving the fountain’s <b>circle</b> with <b>bricks.</b> Wetherell sought to preserve the Westcott area as a historic symbol of Florida State University, as most who have attended the school consider its twin brick towers, arch-style entry and fountain an iconic component of the school.|$|R
5|$|The {{portion of}} the current route between Whitesbog and Lakehurst {{became a part of}} pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923. In 1927, Route 40 was legislated to run from Camden to Lakewood; the termini were {{eventually}} moved to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken and the Laurelton <b>Circle</b> in <b>Brick</b> Township. Route 40 became Route 70 in 1953 in order to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 40; in addition, the western terminus was cut back to its current location to avoid a concurrency with Route 38 and the eastern terminus was moved to the Brielle Circle, replacing a portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.|$|R
50|$|In 1772, an Annapolis barber by {{the name}} of Robert Johnson {{purchased}} town lot #73, and in 1773, his grandson built the brick house that still stands at 23 State <b>Circle.</b> The main <b>brick</b> house remained with Johnson heirs until around 1856. A portion of the lot was sold in 1808 to Elizabeth Thompson, who probably built the frame house at 1 School Street.|$|R
5000|$|As a final {{measure to}} counter any {{outright}} {{failure of the}} AWSS piping, a network of 177 independent underground water cisterns is present. Sizes vary from 75000 gal to over 200000 gal depending on location with a total storage capacity of over 11 million gallons of water. These cisterns are easily spotted by their street level viewable red <b>brick</b> <b>circles</b> complete with manholes labeled CISTERN S.F.F.D ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The Great Hole of Leicester" [...] is the {{unofficial}} name {{given to the}} terracotta and <b>brick</b> <b>circle</b> which stands by West Bridge. Originally formed only of the top half, the lower part was added, to form a circle in 1981. The top was the design over {{the entrance to the}} former wholesale fruit and vegetable market (1972) in Rutland Street, which stood opposite Athena. The terracotta panels, which feature mermaids, were hand-moulded by William Neatby at the Lambeth premises of Doulton and Co.|$|R
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} Prospect Park Zoo, {{prepared}} by Aymar Embury II, were announced in March 1934. The area between the Wild Fowl Pond and former Deer Paddock {{on the east side}} of the park, situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie, was chosen as the site for the new zoo. Architect Embury designed a half <b>circle</b> of six <b>brick</b> buildings centered on a seal pool. Built of red brick with limestone trim, the buildings featured bas-relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book.|$|R

The water works for the supply of Southampton are our last novelty, by which such of us benefit, as either {{themselves}} or their landlords pay a small contribution. They have given us some red buildings {{at one end and}} on the Hill a queer little round tower containing the staircase leading to the underground reservoir, a wonderful construction of <b>circles</b> of <b>brick</b> pillars and arches, as those remember who visited it before the water was let in. And, verily, we may be thankful that our record has so few events in it, no terrible disasters, but that there has been peace and health and comfort, more than falls to the lot of many a parish. Truly we may thankfully say, [...] "The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground, yea, I have a goodly heritage." ...|$|R
50|$|The Oak Circle Historic District is {{centered}} on Oak <b>Circle,</b> a curved <b>brick</b> street in southern Wilmette; Oak Circle {{is one of three}} curved Wilmette streets paved prior to World War I. Oak Circle is approximately 400 ft long and is bordered by Wilmette Avenue to the north and an alley to the south. Twenty-six properties are located along Oak Circle; fifteen of these are homes, and the other eleven are detached garages alongside the homes. The homes along Oak Circle are set back about 35 ft {{on the west side of}} the street and 25 ft on the east side. Lot sizes of the properties in the district are around 5000 to 6000 sq ft; many of the lots are irregular due to the curvature of Oak Circle. Many of the lots include trees, which are considered to contribute to the character of the district.|$|R
5|$|The Camden, Ellisburg, and Marlton Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1849 as a turnpike {{that was}} to run from Camden east to Marlton along what is today Route 70 and CR 601. The Marlton Pike {{was taken over by}} the county in 1907 at a time many other turnpikes became public roads. The current alignment of Route 70 between Whitesbog (the west end of the CR 530 concurrency) and Lakehurst was legislated as a part of pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923, a route {{that was to}} run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was designated to run from Camden to Lakewood along the current alignment of Route 70. In addition a spur of this route called Route S40 (now Route 72) was designated to head from the route at Four Mile to Manahawkin. Eventually, the eastern terminus of Route 40 was moved to the Laurelton <b>Circle</b> in <b>Brick</b> Township, where it intersected Route 35 (now Route 88) as well as Route 34, which continued north from this point; the western terminus was placed at the Airport Circle with U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 130 in Pennsauken, ending concurrent with Route 38. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was renumbered to Route 70 {{in order to avoid the}} conflict with U.S. Route 40 in the state. Also, Route 70 was designated onto its current alignment between Route 38 in Pennsauken and Route 34 and Route 35 at the Brielle Circle, removing the concurrency with Route 38 and replacing the portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.|$|R

6000|$|Their {{footsteps}} sounded {{loud and}} crisp upon the rough stone paving of the disappointing road {{which is all}} that is left of the most famous highway of the world. A peasant or two going home from the wine-shop, and a few carts of country produce coming up to Rome, were the only things which they met. They swung along, with the huge tombs looming up through the darkness upon each side of them, until they had come as far as the Catacombs of St. Calixtus, and saw against a rising moon the great circular bastion of Cecilia Metella in front of them. Then Burger stopped with his hand to his side. [...] "Your legs are longer than mine, and you are more accustomed to walking," [...] said he, laughing. [...] "I think that the place where we turn off is somewhere here. Yes, this is it, round the corner of the trattoria. Now, it is a very narrow path, so perhaps I had better go in front, and you can follow."

Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by at-grade intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an at-grade intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, was replaced by the 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|R
