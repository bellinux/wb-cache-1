50|$|The {{first three}} {{machines}} were {{delivered in the}} northern spring of 1955; in late 1958 a DEUCE Mark II improved model appeared. This version employed a <b>combined</b> <b>card</b> reader and punch. The combined IBM 528 reader and punch behaved like the separate Hollerith units on the earlier DEUCE Mark I machines; however, it was provided with hardware conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD on input, and vice versa on output. Data could also be read in and punched simultaneously at 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE Mark IIA provided seven extra mercury delay lines, each of 32 words.|$|E

40|$|Child-abuse-related deaths (CARD) {{and child}} {{mortality}} rates (CMR) are important issues in every culture. This paper examines both CARD and CMR in seventeen former communist countries (FCCs) {{since the end}} of the Russian hegemony, with two Western comparator countries: the USA and the UK. World Health Organisation CARD and CMR data (birth to four years) between 1988 – 90 and 2012 – 14 have been extrapo- lated. Chi-square tests compare each FCC mortality outcome with the Western com- parators over the period. To avoid under-reporting of CARD, undetermined deaths are also analysed and combined with confirmed CARD to provide a maximum esti- mate of abuse-related deaths. <b>Combined</b> <b>CARD</b> fell substantially in all FCCs, on aver- age by 66 per cent. Russia had the least successful reduction (– 25 per cent). <b>Combined</b> <b>CARD</b> fell significantly more in sixteen FCCs than in the USA. CMR in FCCs fell on aver- age by 66 per cent over the period. Moldova, Russia and FRY Macedonia have the highest current CMR. Thirteen FCCs had significantly greater CMR reductions than the Western comparators. All but one FCCs met the UN millennium 2 per cent per annum reduction target for CMR but not the USA and Bulgaria. Most FCCs have made sub- stantial improvements in reducing CARD and CMR. Country-specific research is required to investigate the major differences between FCCs and Western comparator outcomes...|$|E

Students first place playing cards of differing values on their foreheads and pair with another student to achieve the highest <b>combined</b> <b>card</b> value. Students are unaware of their own card value. After all have paired, a student with a more valuable card is introduced to the mix. Students then reassess their pairings and relationship satisfac-tion and the process is repeated. Data indicated that this demon-stration significantly enhances student knowledge of the subject material.

500|$|<b>Combining</b> <b>cards</b> in sets {{of three}} will create combo attacks {{that are usually}} more {{difficult}} to break because the rank of the combo will be {{the sum of the}} ranks of the three cards in the combo. Certain card combinations will create a [...] "sleight", a special combination that will create a powerful physical attack, magical spell, or summon attack. When the player runs out of cards, the deck must be reloaded. Additionally, using a card combination will cause the first card in the combo to become unusable until the end of combat.|$|R

50|$|Each {{mission is}} usually {{broken down into}} a few key objectives, each mission taking {{anywhere}} from 5 to 30 minutes to complete. The game is based on levels, the more fights you win, the more experience you receive which in turn makes your attacks stronger. In battle, the highest attack power of a card wins; however, you can also <b>combine</b> <b>cards</b> to create combination effects. For example, if you had 3 cards with a power rating of 7, you can combine these to create a 21 power card, which would most likely out-do your opponents cards. You can also combine defense in the same way.|$|R

25|$|After the attacking player {{declares}} attackers, {{the defending}} player chooses which creatures {{he or she}} will block with. A creature must be untapped in order for it to block. Unlike attacking, the act of blocking does not cause the blocking creatures to tap, and creatures with summoning sickness can block. Each creature can only block a single attacker, but the defending player may choose to block an attacking creature with more than one creature. Both players are given a chance to cast instants and activate abilities after blockers have been declared. If the blocker decides to combine defenses, the attacker gets to decide how attack points are distributed between the <b>combined</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
