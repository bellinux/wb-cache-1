50|$|An inter <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> {{is divided}} into blocks known as macroblocks. After that, instead of {{directly}} encoding the raw pixel values for each block, the encoder will {{try to find a}} block similar to the one it is encoding on a previously encoded frame, referred to as a reference frame. This process is done by a block matching algorithm. If the encoder succeeds on its search, the block could be encoded by a vector, known as motion vector, which points to the position of the matching block at the reference frame. The process of motion vector determination is called motion estimation.|$|E
50|$|Event {{segmentation}} {{is viewed}} as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.” It {{is considered to be}} an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived {{at the end of one}} event and the beginning of another.|$|E

Building a model to predict house prices can use historical and factual data.

30|$|For {{complexity}} {{control of}} the frame layer, {{it is important to}} maintain good rate distortion performance. In the proposed algorithm, we estimate the actual time saving of the <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> by considering the difference between the normal coding time of the <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> and the actual coding time. Then, the following strategies are adopted. (1) If the sum of the actual time saving of already coded frames is greater than the target time saving of the entire sequence, normal coding is carried out in time to avoid degradation of the rate distortion performance. (2) When the sum of actual time saving of the coded frames is less than the target time saving of the entire sequence, the remaining frames still need to be encoded under control. (3) When the actual time saving of the previous frame is much greater than the target time saving of the previous frame, the degree of {{control of the}} current frame needs to be reduced. Therefore, the current frame only uses the CSD method to save the coding time and achieve better rate distortion performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} of proper codings, {{such as the}} base- 2 coding, has allowed to establish the universal approximation property of Boolean functions: if a sufficient number b of inputs (bits) is taken, {{they are able to}} approximate arbitrarily well any real Borel measurable mapping. However, if the reduced set of monotone Boolean functions, whose expression involves only and and or operators, is considered, the standard approach points out significant limitations in their approximation capability. These limitations can be overcome by introducing new specific codings, called lattice <b>coding</b> and <b>frame</b> <b>coding,</b> which permit to show that also monotone Boolean functions possess the universal approximation property. The characteristics of these codings are analyzed in details, focusing on the ability of preserving metric and ordering. In particular, a comparison with classical base- 2 coding shows that the lattice and the <b>frame</b> <b>coding</b> require an increase of O(log b) and of O (√ b), respectively, in the number of bits.

30|$|For video content, as the <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> type is {{the same}} and frames are {{temporally}} nearer, the similarity becomes higher. This principle {{is based on the}} most representative principle of video codec compression. As described in [9], the H. 264 /AVC standard, which is the most widely used reference codec, also increases the compressibility of the codec using the similarities between temporally close frames. Therefore, it is effective to perform voltage and frequency scaling by taking advantage of complexity information of frames that have been decoded most recently and the same <b>coded</b> <b>frame</b> types requiring no extra calculation processing. In addition, our proposed method sets the limited delay bound of the delays caused by estimation errors, and if the limited delay bound is exceeded, the corresponding frame is decoded with a processor's maximum frequency. As such, if one frame is decoded with maximum frequency, the delay problem is solved, but overhead still exists in terms of power. However, since the number of estimation errors is small due to the offset caused by adding and subtracting repeatedly, and decoding time is reduced significantly when decoded with the maximum frequency, the related overhead is minimal. With such a small amount of energy consumption, frame drop or buffering caused by estimation errors does not occur, and energy-saving effects can be obtained, unlike in existing methods.|$|E
