40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the differences in}} the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) on small and large human <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins</b> and blockade of ET's action with calcium antagonists. Rings from distal and proximal human <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins</b> were suspended in organ baths and exposed to graded concentrations of ET- 1 (0. 1 - 30 nM). <b>Coronary</b> <b>veins</b> were the most sensitive to the constrictor action of ET- 1. In addition, distal coronary arteries were more sensitive than proximal arteries (EC 50 value-log M: 8. 92 +/- 0. 05 and 8. 34 +/- 0. 1, respectively). In proximal arteries, incubation with subthreshold concentrations of ET (300 pM) potentiated the vasoconstrictor effect of serotonin 1 microM (115 +/- 2. 6 % over contractile level before incubation). This potentiated contraction was fully blocked by nisoldipine, a calcium antagonist. In contrast, this potentiation was not observed in human <b>coronary</b> <b>veins.</b> Nisoldipine partly antagonized the contraction evoked by ET- 1 in human coronary arteries, but ET-contracted <b>coronary</b> <b>veins</b> were completely resistant to calcium channel blockade. Low concentrations of ET- 1 approximating reported circulating levels result in significant contraction of human <b>coronary</b> <b>veins</b> and potentiate the constrictor effect of serotonin in coronary arteries. The blocking effect of the calcium antagonist nisoldipine varies among distal and proximal <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins,</b> suggesting a different mechanism of contraction for ET- 1 among these vessels. Because of the suspected role of ET- 1 in coronary ischemic syndromes, this differential sensitivity may have important therapeutic implications...|$|R

Because increased Pco 2 in the myocardium correlates with both ischemic injury and depression of contractile function, the effects of hypertonic solutions of either the CO 2 -“generating” sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) buffer, a mixture of sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) and sodium bicarbonate (carbicarb) acting as a CO 2 -“consuming” buffer, or saline placebo (NaCl) were compared during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 25 healthy minipigs. Both buffer agents significantly increased the pH and HCO 3 −of arterial, mixed venous and <b>coronary</b> <b>vein</b> blood. Bicarbonate increased whereas carbicarb reduced blood Pco 2 in the systemic circuit as anticipated.

40|$|A {{network of}} {{perivascular}} nerve fibres was demonstrated in <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins</b> from guinea-pig and man. Nerve fibres displaying immunoreactivity to neuropeptide Y (NPY) had a distribution pattern {{similar to those}} containing immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase. Immunoreactivity to substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) occurred in the same varicose nerve fibres, which were distinct from those displaying immunoreactivity to NPY, and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibres were distinct from those displaying acetylcholinesterase activity. Only few nerve fibres positive for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were detected. Immunoreactivity to endothelin was demonstrated over the endothelium, and mRNA encoding the endothelin-A (ET-A) and the endothelin-B (ET-B) receptor were detected in human epicardial coronary arteries with and without endothelium and in human <b>coronary</b> <b>veins.</b> Vasomotor responses to different vasoactive substances were tested on isolated coronary vessels. Noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) induced mainly contraction of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>veins,</b> whereas relaxant responses were more pronounced in human epicardial coronary arteries. Coronary arteries from older individuals were however more susceptible to NA-mediated contraction than those from younger persons. Relaxation of human epicardial coronary arteries induced by NA, isoprenaline and ATP were endothelium-independent. NPY had no direct vasomotor effect on human epicardial <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins,</b> but in guinea-pig epicardial coronary arteries NPY inhibited relaxant responses induced by acetylcholine (ACh), VIP, substance P and isoprenaline. ACh induced strong contraction of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins,</b> and at lower concentrations ACh induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of human epicardial coronary arteries. Substance P, CGRP and VIP potently relaxed <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins.</b> In human epicardial coronary arteries, the relaxation to substance P was endothelium-dependent whereas the relaxation to CGRP seemed to be partially endothelium-dependent, and relaxation to VIP independent of an intact endothelium.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{efficacy}} of selective synchronized suction and retroinfusion of <b>coronary</b> <b>veins</b> was compared with synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion in preventing ischemic reduction of regional myocardial function and myocardial oxygen tension. Background. Because incomplete protection by synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion during ischemia {{might result from}} nonselective retroinfusion and only passive drainage of the veins, a suction device was added to a retroinfusion system. Methods. Regional myocardial function (ultrasonic crystals) and myocardial oxygen tension (polarographic electrodes) were studied in 30 pigs during 10 -min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (ischemia), followed by reperfusion. During ischemia, group A (n = 10) was supported by selective synchronized suction and retroinfusion; group B (n = 10) was supported by synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion, and group C (n = 10) was not supported by retroinfusion. Results. In group A, subendocardial segment shortening decreased from 21 ± 4 % (mean ± SD) before ischemia to 11 ± 5 % during ischemia. In contrast, systolic dyskinesia was observed in group B (− 2 ± 4 %, p 0 mm Hg only in group A. Conclusions. Preservation of regional myocardial function and myocardial oxygen tension was substantially higher by selective synchronized suction and retroinfusion of <b>coronary</b> <b>veins</b> than by synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion in pigs...|$|R

Prospective gating reduces radiation exposure but its impact on image quality is unknown is this setting. AimsThis study compared image quality and reliability of MDCT angiography of the <b>coronary</b> <b>veins</b> between prospective and retrospective gating. MethodsSeven anaesthetized pigs underwent 64 -detector row MDCT with prospective and retrospective ECG-gating. MDCT scans were evaluated for visibility of the veins, estimated radiation dose and vein characteristics. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was calculated. ResultsVisibility grades of all veins were significantly decreased in prospective (0. 82 ± 0. 6) compared to retrospective gating (1. 68 ± 0. 9; P< 0. 001), the lateral vein being missed in two cases when using prospective vs. retrospective gating. The maximal vein length was significantly increased when using retrospective gating (P= 0. 015). Inter-observer but not intra-observer reproducibility was dependent on the gating technique for the maximal length and contrast-to-noise ratio (P= 0. 003 for both). Heart rate was 82 ± 13 bpm and 86 ± 11 bpm during retrospective and prospective ECG-gating (P=ns) despite full dose of atenolol titration. ConclusionRetrospective gating seems to be superior to prospective gating MDCT to describe the coronary venous system but the conclusions of our study should be confined to high heart rate condition...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare two <b>coronary</b> <b>vein</b> imaging {{techniques}} using whole-heart balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) and a targeted double-oblique spoiled gradient- echo (GRE) sequences {{in combination with}} magnetization transfer (MT) preparation sequence for tissue contrast improvement.

40|$|SummaryThe {{origins and}} {{developmental}} mechanisms of coronary arteries are incompletely understood. We show here by fate mapping, clonal analysis, and immunohistochemistry that endocardial cells generate the endothelium of coronary arteries. Dye tracking, live imaging, and tissue transplantation {{also revealed that}} ventricular endocardial cells are not terminally differentiated; instead, they are angiogenic and form coronary endothelial networks. Myocardial Vegf-a or endocardial Vegfr- 2 deletion inhibited coronary angiogenesis and arterial formation by ventricular endocardial cells. In contrast, lineage and knockout studies showed that endocardial cells make a small contribution to the <b>coronary</b> <b>veins,</b> the formation of which is independent of myocardial-to-endocardial Vegf signaling. Thus, contrary to the current view of a common source for the coronary vessels, our findings indicate that the <b>coronary</b> arteries and <b>veins</b> have distinct origins and are formed by different mechanisms.
