40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{integration}} of management systems (MSs) in a country with low <b>certifications</b> <b>number</b> and growth rate and propose a research agenda towards improving the competitiveness of organisations that implement multiple MSs. The main research questions focus on the implementation process itself and the effect of low level of national certification to the integration process. To serve this research purpose, an exploratory research is designed in Greece (a country with relatively low certification counts and rates to the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 management standards). A case study approach is employed to enable deeper and comprehensive reasoning. A cross-case analysis is presented to explore patterns, similarities and differences among organisations. Findings show that four out of five organisations analysed are integrating its MSs at different levels, the integration methodology applied is similar for all organisations but audits are the most dissimilar aspect. This study is one of the first that addresses MSs' integration in Greece exploring contingency factors...|$|R

Drawing reasonable inferences, it is plausible that Harry Lawrence lawfully obtained possession of the aluminum cent, giving Plaintiffs superior claim of title to the aluminum cent.” On March 17, 2016, Lawrence and McConnell surrendered the penny to the U.S. Mint to settle the terms of their lawsuit which was dropped.

40|$|People {{pay much}} {{attention}} to the technology of data mining recently and more and more research institutions begin to buy the databases to analyze. If it doesn’t concern customer’s secrets the enterprises would also like to sell their data warehouse to do the research. Therefore, it becomes an important subject to prove the integrity of the database. This paper discusses about using the digital watermarking and the public authentication mechanism to strengthen the verification of integrity of the database. First, MD 5 hash algorithm is used to fetch a database feature. Second, making XOR operation of database feature and digital watermarking gets a <b>certification</b> <b>number.</b> At last, using the secret key encrypts the <b>certification</b> <b>number</b> and makes public in the network with the database. Before using this database, user needs to use database owner’s public key to decrypt the ciphertext to get the <b>certification</b> <b>number.</b> Then making XOR operation of database feature fetched by MD 5 algorithm and <b>certification</b> <b>number</b> gets a watermark. Finally, user can rely on the integrity of fetched watermark to understand whether the database is destroyed or not...|$|E
