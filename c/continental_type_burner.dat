40|$|Existing direct fired process heaters {{and steam}} boilers {{can have their}} {{efficiencies}} remarkably improved, and thus cut the fuel bill, by conversion from conventional <b>type</b> natural draft <b>burners</b> to high intensity, "forced draft" <b>type</b> <b>burners.</b> An available <b>type</b> that is "forced draft," but which does not require expenditure of energy for forced draft, will be discussed. Combustion Air is automatically controlled by the fuel flow - which fuel drives the "forced draft" fan to control airflow. Use of such <b>type</b> <b>burners</b> can, in many instances, increase efficiency to a point close enough to that obtainable by addition of air preheat until the difference in efficiency with air preheaters will not justify {{the high cost of}} air preheat systems. Low excess air and short, high intensity flame patterns assure reduction of stack temperature, thus increased efficiency. Conversion can be made "on-the-fly" without shutting down the fired heaters or boilers by insertion of an "installation package" of the burners into openings left after removal of conventional burners...|$|R

5000|$|Small {{domestic}} [...] "vaporising" [...] (i.e. burning kerosene or 28 second oil) burners do not modulate {{at all and}} {{are relatively}} inefficient. Boilers using the pressure jet <b>type</b> of <b>burner,</b> i.e. with a fan, (usually with 35 second oil) can achieve a turndown ratio of 2, while the rotary cup <b>type</b> <b>burner</b> can achieve 4. Condensing oil boilers are fairly unusual; the condensate from the combustion of oil is far more aggressive than gas, mainly due to sulphur content. These days oil companies are reducing sulphur content of oil on environmental grounds, so this may change. However due to problem of mixing the oil and air, turndown ratios of greater than four are uncommon.|$|R

40|$|The recent capture at {{the island}} of Sao Miguel-Azores of a local type of Trichogramma cordubensis Vargas & Cabello (Hym [...] Trichograrnmatidae) {{gave rise to the}} {{question}} of its epigenetic characterization, according to parameters indenticallo those of the <b>continental</b> <b>type.</b> This characterization was carrie{! out with the objective of recognizing its ability 10 be use{! as a bioligcal control agent against agricultural pests in this region.

The local type of Tcordubensis diverged significantly from the <b>continental</b> <b>type</b> in its longevity. Material and methods The first capture of the local T. cordubensis type was made by Pintureau et al (1990), in June 1989, at the location of Remedios, Lagoa.

40|$|A rapid, {{selective}} {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} 1 to 20 micrograms of nickel, chromium, and cobalt in airborne particulates is described. The method utilizes the combined techniques of low temperature ashing and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The airborne particulates are collected on analytical filter paper. The filter papers are ashed, and the residues are dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Nickel, chromium, and cobalt are determined directly with good precision and accuracy by means of atomic absorption. The effects of flame <b>type,</b> <b>burner</b> height, slit width, and lamp current on the atomic absorption measurements are reported...|$|R
