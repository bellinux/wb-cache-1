5000|$|Risks {{involving}} {{credit derivatives}} are a concern among regulators of financial markets. The US Federal Reserve issued several {{statements in the}} Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> for <b>credit</b> derivatives trades. These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system. [...] One challenge in regulating these and other derivatives {{is that the people}} who know most about them also typically have a vested incentive in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.|$|R
