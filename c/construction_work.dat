5|$|The Germans halted <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> at Mimoyecques as the Allies {{advanced}} up {{the coast}} following the Normandy landings. It fell to the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division on 5 September 1944 without resistance, {{a few days after}} the Germans withdrew from the area.|$|E
5|$|The <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> {{was carried}} out by over 5,000 workers, mostly German {{engineers}} drafted in from several companies including Mannesmann, Gute Hoffnungshütte, Krupp and the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the Ruhr and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers. The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays, but <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> continued nonetheless at a high pace underground. The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns ready by March 1944 and the full complement of 25 guns by 1 October 1944, but these target dates were not met.|$|E

5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, {{probably in}} the late-12th century, on the castle's motte, along with two stone gatehouses and towers along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts.

5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E

5|$|Andersen {{was born}} on 9 July 1898 in Kristiania (now Oslo), and had a {{difficult}} childhood, {{the latter part of}} it in an orphanage. He was the son of construction worker Ole Andersen and Josefine Hansen. Soon after Johannes was born, Norway entered a period of economic difficulties, with little <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> available. This led to his father having to change jobs from mason to milkman. Johannes' mother became obsessed with religion.|$|E
