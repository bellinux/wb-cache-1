50|$|A gas sensor {{composed}} of SWNHs could be fabricated with an electrokinetic method using dielectrophoresis (DEP). Conductanceof the DEP-fabricated SWNH sensor increased or decreased upon exposure to ppm-levels of NO2 or NH3, respectively, {{similar to the}} previously obtained CNT gas sensors {{which suggests that the}} SWNH aggregate behaves as a p-type semiconductor. The comparison reveals that intrinsic NO2 sensitivity of the SWNHs is lower than that of single-wall CNTs but comparable with the intrinsic sensitivity of multiple-wall CNTs (MWCNTs). Another gas sensor using <b>coating</b> <b>film</b> of SWHNs aimed to detect ozone in water. This sensor is based on the phenomena that the electric resistance of the SWNHs-film decreased with the adsorption of ozone molecules due to charge transfer from the surface of SWNHs to O3 molecules. The shift of the electric resistance of the SWNH-film was correlated with the ozone concentration and temperature based on monolayer adsorption model with consideration of activation energies of the relevant adsorption, desorption, and sensitivity of charge transfer.|$|E
