60|$|But I go farther. The Old-Age Pensions Act, so {{far from}} being in {{conflict}} with a scheme of contributory insurance, is really its most helpful and potent ally. The fact that at seventy the State pension is assured {{to all those who}} need it, makes a tremendous difference to every form of insurance confined to the years before seventy, whether for old age or for invalidity. I asked an eminent actuary the other day to make me some calculations. They are rough, general calculations, and no doubt they might be more exact. But roughly, I believe it to be no exaggeration to say that the rates to cover a man till seventy are in many cases scarcely half what they would be, if they had to cover him till death. Do you see what that means? It is a prodigious fact. It is the sort of fact by the discovery of which people make gigantic fortunes; and I suggest to you that we should make this gigantic fortune for John Bull. It means that the whole field of insurance has become much more fruitful than it ever was before, that there is a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> business possible which never was possible before. It means that the whole field of insurance is far more open to the poorest class of people than it was before, and that with a proper system the benefits of the Old-Age Pensions Act would not be confined to the actual pensioners who are drawing their money, but would extend forwards in anticipation to all other classes and to all other people, and that so far as five shillings a week is concerned--that is not much unless you have not got it--the actuarial position of every man and woman in this country has been enormously improved by the Old-Age Pensions Act.|$|E

50|$|While once {{very popular}} in France, Britain, and the United States, {{tontines}} have been banned in Britain, pursuant to the British Life Assurance Act 1774, 14 Geo. 3, c. 48, and as amended, and in the United States. See, e.g., Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S. 775, 779 (1881). Such financial instruments are illegal primarily because they create beneficiaries who {{have an interest in}} the reduced lifespan of another person, and because many of these schemes were little more than swindles that encourage mischief against the life of the insured. Geneva, in Switzerland, was known for its active market in tontines in the 17th and 18th centuries. The First Life Directive of the European Union specified tontines as a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> business to be underwritten by authorised and regulated companies, but that part of the regulations was not enacted in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Multi-peril crop {{insurance}} (MPCI): Coverage {{in this type}} of insurance is not limited to just one risk. Usually multi-peril {{crop insurance}} offers hail, excessive rain and drought in a combined package. Sometimes, additional risks such as insect or bacteria-related diseases are also offered. The problem with the multi-peril crop insurance is the possibility of a large scale event. Such an event can cause significant losses beyond the insurer's financial capacity. To make this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance,</b> the perils are often bundled together in a single policy, called a multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) policy. MPCI coverage is usually offered by a government insurer and premiums are usually partially subsidized by the government. U.S. Department of Agriculture is known to implement the earliest multi-peril crop insurance program in 1938. Federal Crop Insurance Corporation managed this multi-peril insurance program since then. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) is active in calculating the premiums based on individual risk factors since 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Buksh {{received}} many accolades for his contributions in life insurance development, {{but he was}} not immune from criticism by his contemporaries. His exit from the insurance industry came at the expense of an unruly trade union influenced by political parties. Ironically, it was Buksh who employed many trade union members and helped establish their lives in Dacca. Hedayetul Islam also notably pointed out Buksh’s favoritism toward employing people from his home district, many of whom were ill-qualified for their positions. The issue of non-qualified workers was forefront in the illegal demands made by the JBC trade union. When asked about the issue by Mushtari Shaffi, Buksh clarified his position: [...] "One can't love the whole country, unless, one loves the people of his own area." [...] Abdur Razzak supported Buksh's favoritism, stating that, [...] "I think he was 100 percent right in appointing them. If he did not do so, many families of our country would be totally eliminated." [...] Regarding this topic, Harunur Rashid noted that Buksh frequently visited his native village and discovered that the fates of people of his village had not changed after partition of the sub-continent. When he joined the EFU, people of his native village flocked to him in search of employment. Being a philanthropist, he did not refuse them. He attempted to accommodate people according to their qualifications. It may be that, in some cases, the people he hired were not well-suited to their tasks. Still, Buksh felt compelled to assist them on humanitarian grounds. Rashid observed that although Buksh employed a few dozen of people from his home area, he also employed hundreds of people from various places other than his village. Despite of controversies, Buksh became renowned by introducing insurance to the masses, spreading awareness of savings and changing the course of many lives through his forty years of hard work. He provided salvation from financial hardship to many families. Through his able leadership, he created jobs for thousands of young unemployed people of Bangladesh. The growth of the insurance industry in urban and rural areas resulted in the creation of new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> workers providing new economic opportunities developing newly demarcated social groups. The insurance salesmen who emerged in the 1950s to 1960s under Buksh's tutelage eventually helped the industry to develop and progress.|$|E

40|$|Practice {{proved that}} {{strategic}} planning {{is a necessary}} process for insurance companies. This process can help companies to adapt more easily to environmental changes. The strategic planning of the activity of an insurance company cannot be realized without a careful analysis {{of the evolution of}} the market and without studying the company's market position. A classic model used in the portfolio analysis is the Boston Consulting Group model. In this paper we have used the model for studying the activity of the leader of the Romanian insurance market. In 2009 Alliantz Tiriac had 17 types of insurance in the portfolio. Each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> was considered a strategic business unit. We have studied the insurance portfolio by using secondary data from specialized publications, such as the Romanian Insurance Supervisory Commission. Using the data, we have calculated for Alliantz Tiriac, for each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance,</b> the relative market share. The company was leader on the market for five classes of insurance. The economic crisis had a severe impact on the evolution of the Romanian insurance market: from the 17 classes of insurance studied: nine had registered a decrease of the market, eight had registered an increase, but only for three of them the growth exceeded 10 %. Using the relative market share and the market growth we have identified the “cash cows”: there are five classes of insurance in this category, among which the “Insurance for land vehicles (CASCO) ” which represented {{more than half of the}} sales (55. 82 %); unfortunately, in the case of this insurance type there was a very significant decrease of the market in 2010 compared to 2009 : - 25. 12 %, the “question marks” – there are three classes of insurance in this category, and the “dogs”. Due to the crisis, a large number of the company's products are in this category and there are no “star” products.

40|$|As {{part of the}} new {{regulatory}} framework of Solvency II, introduced by the European Union, insurance companies are required to monitor their solvency by computing a key risk metric called the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). The official description of the SCR is not rigorous and has lead researchers to develop their own mathematical frameworks for calculation of the SCR. These frameworks are complex and are difficult to implement. Recently, Bauer et al. suggested a nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulation framework to calculate the SCR. But the proposed MC framework is computationally expensive even for a simple insurance product. In this paper, we propose incorporating a neural network approach into the nested simulation framework to significantly reduce the computational complexity in the calculation. We study the performance of our neural network approach in estimating the SCR for a large portfolio of an important <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> products called Variable Annuities (VAs).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> {{products}} where the policy holder has {{the option to}} insure $k$ of its annual Operational Risk losses in a horizon of $T$ years. This involves a choice of $k$ out of $T$ years in which to apply the insurance policy coverage by making claims against losses in the given year. The insurance product structure presented can accommodate any kind of annual mitigation, but we present three basic generic insurance policy structures that can be combined to create more complex types of coverage. Following the Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) with Poisson distributed annual loss frequencies and Inverse-Gaussian loss severities {{we are able to}} characterize in closed form analytical expressions for the multiple optimal decision strategy that minimizes the expected Operational Risk loss over the next $T$ years. For the cases where the combination of insurance policies and LDA model does not lead to closed form expressions for the multiple optimal decision rules, we also develop a principled class of closed form approximations to the optimal decision rule. These approximations are developed based on a class of orthogonal Askey polynomial series basis expansion representations of the annual loss compound process distribution and functions of this annual loss...|$|E
