5|$|A global {{financial}} <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} nature of {{financial}} crises in the United States before 1914. It attempts to determine whether <b>crises</b> <b>were</b> statistically similar, predictable, and had a common generating mechanism. Using probit and hazard models and out-of-sample criteria, it is shown there are variables that explain movements in the probability of crises and that the probability of <b>crises</b> <b>is</b> seasonal. Two <b>crises</b> <b>were</b> predictable but in the other six episodes every forecasting model examined failed. These results suggest that financial <b>crises</b> <b>were</b> not all statistically alike and that their generation mechanisms differed. Copyright 1994 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before <b>Crisis</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique to the platform. It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, who created the initial concept {{at the request of}} Tetsuya Nomura for a game that had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile devices in the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E

Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, because he was so unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing teammates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value diminished. It was despite this decrease in form that he still, in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games.

Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E

40|$|According to Minsky's {{financial}} instability hypothesis, financial <b>crises</b> <b>are</b> caused by increasing debt burdens. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to argue instead that financial <b>crises</b> <b>are</b> caused by class and intra-class conflict. The 1966 financial <b>crisis</b> <b>is</b> particularly significant, from the perspective of Minsky's {{financial instability}} hypothesis, because it divides the postwar Golden Age of US capitalism from the current period of recurrent financial crises. After showing that increasing debt burdens do not account for the 1966 financial crisis, this paper explains the 1966 financial crisis in terms of class and intra-class conflict. ...|$|R
