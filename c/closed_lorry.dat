50|$|In June 2008 {{cost was}} {{estimated}} at 2,5 billion euro. Return on investment in the Oosterweel connection was expected to come from toll revenue generated at the Oosterweel tunnel. In order to guarantee these revenues, the banks requested that the existing Kennedy tunnel be <b>closed</b> to <b>lorry</b> traffic {{as soon as the}} Oosterweel connection would be operational. It was also stipulated that during a period of 35 years, it would be forbidden to make any decisions that might diminish traffic levels in the Oosterweel tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{road on the}} Ötztal valley side {{is called}} the Timmelsjoch Hochalpenstrasse. The pass is now popular with car and {{motorbike}} tourists. Due to its elevation, steepness, and narrow road, the Timmelsjoch pass is <b>closed</b> to <b>lorries</b> and vehicles with trailers. With its dramatic scenery, particularly on the southern side, the road has become popular with cyclists. On the last Sunday in August, several thousand cyclists {{take part in the}} Ötztaler Cycling Marathon crawl up the 29 km section from St. Leonhard in Passeier (672 m) to the pass, gaining 1800 m—the fourth and final pass included in the grueling 238 km marathon.|$|R

5000|$|The Almö bridge {{collapsed}} at 01:30 AM on 18 January 1980, {{when the}} bulk carrier [...] struck the bridge arch, collapsing the main span. The roadway landed {{on top of}} the ship, destroying the ship's bridge but causing no casualties on the ship. The loss of the ship's bridge made radio communication difficult, as the Swedish pilot had to use a handheld VHF radio. Because of the ice the ship was unable to launch a boat to get to shore and warn motorists as a fog was descending on the area. Eight people died that night as they drove over the edge until the road on the Tjörn side was closed 40 minutes after the accident. The mainland side had been <b>closed</b> by a <b>lorry</b> driver who had crept up the bridge in the fog and had grown suspicious when the railing disappeared. He was able to stop his lorry one meter before the abyss.|$|R
