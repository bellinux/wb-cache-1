25|$|In general, airport runways {{that are}} closed are not {{normally}} lighted, {{to make it}} clear they are not in use. At Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport, a single switch controlled green lights on the common taxiway to both runways and on the centreline of runway 05R. Civil Aeronautics Administration Deputy Director Chang Kuo-cheng said runway 05L was fully lit on Tuesday night by white and yellow lights and only the green <b>centreline</b> <b>lighting</b> was illuminated on closed runway 05R. On the taxiway to the runways, four large signs point the way to runway 05L, he added, and he refused to state explicitly that pilot error was the primary cause of the mix-up.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton International is {{designed}} for use by large airplanes on overseas flights, and includes a 10006 x 200 ft asphalt runway with <b>centreline</b> <b>lighting</b> for low-visibility operations, and a smaller 6010 x 150 ft asphalt runway. It is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport handle aircraft {{with no more than}} 220 passengers; however, they can handle up to 400 if the aircraft is unloaded in stages. The airport also hosts the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum. Hamilton can see cargo operations with very large aircraft such as the more commonly seen Antonov An-124 or an occasional Boeing 747. Because of this Hamilton has developed a niche community of aircraft spotters.|$|E
