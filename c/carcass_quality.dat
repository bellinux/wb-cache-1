25|$|The Merino is an {{excellent}} forager and very adaptable. It is bred predominantly for its wool, and its carcass size is generally smaller than that of sheep bred for meat. South African Meat Merino (SAMM), American Rambouillet and German Merinofleischschaf have been bred to balance wool production and <b>carcass</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{breeding stock}} {{were taken from}} the Finnsheep for their high prolificacy, early puberty and short gestation, Dorset for their superior mothering ability, <b>carcass</b> <b>quality,</b> early puberty and long breeding season, Targhee for their large body size, long breeding season and quality fleeces, and Rambouilet for their adaptability, hardiness, productivity and quality fleeces.|$|E
50|$|Beef {{quality grade}}s - A quality grade is a {{composite}} evaluation of factors that affect palatability of meat (tenderness, juiciness, and flavor). These factors include carcass maturity, firmness, texture, and color of lean, and the amount and distribution of marbling within the lean. Beef <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> grading is based on (1) degree of marbling and (2) degree of maturity.|$|E
50|$|It {{is capable}} of {{producing}} substantial hybrid vigor when used for crossbreeding. The F1 progeny grow faster and are more fertile than Brahmans. Adaptaurs have similar resistance to ticks and worms as Brahmans. They are at least 10% more efficient than Brahmans and have the favorable <b>carcass</b> <b>qualities</b> of the Bos taurus cattle.|$|R
5000|$|The Brangus breed was {{developed}} to the superior traits of Angus and Brahman cattle. Their genetics are stabilized at 3/8 Brahman and 5/8 Angus. The combination results in a breed which unites the traits of two highly successful parent breeds. The Brahman, through rigorous natural selection, developed disease resistance, overall hardiness and outstanding maternal instincts. Angus {{are known for their}} superior <b>carcass</b> <b>qualities.</b> They are also extremely functional females which excel in fertility and milking ability.|$|R
40|$|Choosing {{the right}} bull for your herd {{is a complex}} {{decision}} involving many factors including {{the type of person}} you are, the type of cows in your herd, and the type of calf you are marketing. If you are only interested in producing terminal market animals you would likely select a herd sire strictly for growth and <b>carcass</b> <b>qualities.</b> Whereas, if you sell weaned calves and keep your own replacement females, you {{may be more likely to}} focus on bulls with more maternal traits...|$|R
50|$|Hamed Kioumarsi {{and others}} have {{examined}} a new method in order to estimate the relation between component of <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity in Taleshi lambs, and {{with regard to the}} results, it can be concluded that this breed has a high potential for using the ratios by higher levels of energy and protein for obtaining the best growth performance.|$|E
50|$|In meat-type breeds, feather sexing {{was not so}} {{extended}} to commercialbroiler production because resulting poorly-feathered males are very prone to scratches in {{the skin of the}} belly, which can descredit <b>carcass</b> <b>quality.</b> After all, unlike egg-laying poultry, meat-type male chicks are not culled, so broiler males can be set apart later, once sexual differences become evident.|$|E
50|$|For these reasons, {{animal welfare}} often {{correlates}} to {{the incidence of}} PSE meat or other <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> issues. The length of transport, time period between loading and unloading, and the rest time in lairage are known to affect meat quality. Physical activity and psychological stress associated with transportation, as well as incidence of fighting between individuals in lairage, can confound these factors.|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} 207 {{crossbred}} steers {{used in this}} study indicate that when calves are placed in the feedlot on a finishing ration at weaning, they will have better feed efficiencies, greater lifetime ADGs, lighter carcass weights, and equal <b>carcass</b> <b>qualities</b> compared to those placed as yearlings. In recent times, heavy carcass weights have been rather common in the industry. Every over-weight steer had a desirable weight at one time, and this study shows that they would have produced a desirable carcass if managed correctly...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} linseed supplementation on <b>carcass,</b> meat <b>quality</b> and fatty acid profile of fat tissue was studied. No {{differences}} in <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> traits were observed, the exception being drip loss that was lower in pigs supplemented with linseed. As regards fatty acids, linseed supplementation {{led to the}} increased content of unsaturated, polyunsaturated and n- 3 fatty acids and decreased content of saturated fatty acids and n- 6 /n- 3 ratio in the subcutaneous and intramuscular fat of pigs...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{influences}} of conventional and organic rearing systems, breed crosses and feeding regimens on performance, carcass and technological and sensory meat quality traits in pigs were investigated. In two studies, a seasonal outdoor rearing system was investigated. Maternal performance of once-bred gilts was studied and their <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> was compared with maiden indoor reared gilts. In a third study, the outdoor-born progeny was raised indoors and outdoors; performance, <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> of these growing/finishing pigs were compared. In a fourth study, {{indoor and outdoor}} rearing systems of growing/finishing pigs, born indoors, including different feeding regimens (strategic/ad libitum/restrictive), diets (diluted/undiluted; conventional/organic) and breed crosses (LW*L/LW*D) were investigated. In a fifth study, effects of extra maternal feed supply during early gestation on sow and progeny performance, <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> were studied. The studies showed that once-bred gilts were suitable for a seasonal outdoor rearing system and produced <b>carcasses</b> of adequate <b>quality.</b> LW*L once-bred gilts had more piglets at weaning, whereas LW*D progeny had higher growth rate. For the progeny, outdoor pig...|$|R
5000|$|Hampshire hogs {{are noted}} for being {{well-muscled}} and rapid growers, and for exhibiting good <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> when used as meat animals. [...] When used as breeding stock, the sows of this breed have been praised for their capacity as mothers, having [...] "extra longevity in the sow". Hampshires are good tempered; {{they do not}} grow as fast as many cross-breds, but they do grow faster than Yorkshires.|$|E
50|$|The Lacombe is a white, {{medium-sized}} pig with a docile temperament. The breed has large, drooping ears, is long bodied {{and rather}} short of leg, and is quite meaty in conformation.

50|$|The Texel sheep {{originated}} on the isle of Texel, {{the largest}} of the Wadden Islands off the north coast of the Netherlands. The exact origin of the breed is unknown although it is thought to be a cross of multiple English breeds. It was slowly bred into a meat breed of outstanding <b>carcass</b> <b>quality.</b> It {{is now one of the}} most common meat breeds in the Netherlands, making up seventy percent of the national flock.|$|E
50|$|The Boer goat was {{probably}} bred from the indigenous South African goats of the Namaqua, San, and Fooku tribes, with some crossing of Indian and European bloodlines being possible. They {{were selected for}} meat rather than milk production; due to selective breeding and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent <b>carcass</b> <b>qualities,</b> {{making it one of}} the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world. Boer goats have a high resistance to disease and adapt well to hot, dry semideserts. United States production is centered in west-central Texas, particularly in and around San Angelo and Menard. The original US breeding stock came from herds located in New Zealand. Only later were they imported directly from South Africa.|$|R
40|$|A herd {{of polish}} lowland local sheep {{was divided into}} two equal groups: the first group was kept under an {{overhead}} shelter, and the second group was kept in a warm barn. The effect of maintenance on ewe’s reproductive performance, survival {{as well as the}} growth rate of lambs, and their <b>carcasses</b> <b>quality</b> was investigated. The lack of differences in fertility and prolificacy of ewes {{as well as in the}} survival and growth rate between the groups confirmed a good adaptation of Żelaźnieńska sheep to low temperature. Harsh environmental conditions did not cause a significant decrease of the body weight growth; however, they brought in an (insignificant) reduction of subcutaneous fat thickness and meatiness of the loin part of a lamb’s body. The fat content of carcasses obtained from lambs reared under the overhead shelter was significantly lower, with no differences of meat and bones contribution between the groups...|$|R

50|$|Pale, Soft, Exudative meat, or PSE meat, {{describes}} a <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> condition known {{to occur in}} pork, beef, and poultry. It is characterized by an abnormal color, consistency, and water holding capacity, making the meat dry and unattractive to consumers. The condition {{is believed to be}} caused by abnormal muscle metabolism following slaughter, due to an altered rate of glycolysis and a low pH within the muscle fibers. A mutation point in the ryanodine receptor gene in pork, associated to stress levels prior to slaughter are known to increase the incidence of PSE meat.|$|E
5000|$|Fat-tailed sheep are {{hardy and}} adaptable, able to {{withstand}} the tough challenges of desert life. When feed is plentiful and parasites not a major factor, fat-tailed sheep can be large in size and growth. The <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> of these sheep is quite good, {{with most of the}} fat concentrated in the tail area - it could account for as much as 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of the weight on a 60 pound (27 kilogram) carcass. The fat-tailed breeds seen frequently in the US are the Karakul and Tunis.|$|E
50|$|The Katahdin {{sheep breed}} {{was the first}} in the United States to reach sheep {{industry}} standards of <b>carcass</b> <b>quality.</b> The average Katahdin ewe weight is 120 to 160 pounds and the ram's weight is 180 to 250. Most Katahdin ewes will have a 200% lamb crop. The Katahdin sheds its winter coat, and so {{does not have to be}} sheared. The Katahdin's hair can come in any color as the emphasis of the breed is on production rather than appearance. When Katahdins are crossed with wool sheep, their offsping will usually have a mix of predominantly wool with some hair.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{investigation}} {{has yet been}} conducted for ACOX 1 and CSRP 3 gene polymorphisms in Korean cattle (Hanwoo), and their associations with <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> traits. In this study, SNPs in ACOX 1 and CSRP 3 genes were identified and their associations with <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> traits were investigated in 227 Hanwoo animals. Two SNPs (g. 224 G> A and g. 19491 G> A) in ACOX 1 gene and one SNP (g. 14859 C> T) in CSRP 3 gene were identified in Hanwoo and sequence analysis indicated that these SNPs were located in the coding regions. The allele frequencies of ACOX 1 g. 224 G>A and g. 19491 G>A SNPs were 0. 57, 0. 43, and 0. 56 and 0. 44, respectively, For CSRP 3 g. 14859 C>T polymorphism, the C and T allele frequencies were 0. 64 and 0. 36, respectively. The Hanwoo cattle were used to detect PCR-RFLP patterns for estimating the allele frequencies. Single marker association analyses were performed between genotype of each SNP, and <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality</b> association traits to evaluate the relationships in Hanwoo. The g. 224 G> A SNP genotypes of ACOX 1 gene, which {{was significantly associated with}} meat quantity grade at slaughter (P T SNP was used in this study and the obtained genotype and allele frequencies are almost similar with the previous results reported by Bhuiyan et al.

40|$|Continued {{selection}} pressures {{have been}} most successful at creating genetic populations of swine that contain higher percentages of carcass lean. Unfortunately, such genetic populations also tend to produce <b>carcasses</b> of lesser <b>quality.</b> <b>Carcass</b> leanness may be further enhanced {{by the presence of}} the halothane (HAL) gene, which is also associated with lower pork quality. The impact of myosin heavy chain isoforms on pork composition and quality traits of HAL-negative (NN) and HAL-carrier (Nn) gilts was investigated. Phenotypic correlations between fiber type composition and carcass composition or pork quality traits tend to be higher when the HAL gene is present. Regression analyses demonstrated that fiber type composition accounted for 53...|$|R
50|$|Once the crosses began, Hays {{selected}} for the traits he wanted, and any offspring that {{did not make the}} cut {{in one way or another}} would have their tails docked and were shipped off to a processing plant. Once all desired traits were achieved in the offspring, the breed was closed off to mating with any outside breeds. By the time the breed achieved pedigree status in 1975, it had achieved all of the traits Hays had hoped it would. These traits included, high growth rate, sturdy build, good <b>carcass</b> <b>quality,</b> easy calving and excellent milk production.|$|E
50|$|Since {{stress is}} highly {{correlated}} to <b>carcass</b> <b>quality,</b> reducing causes of stress during the slaughter process can drastically improve meat quality. In addition, calmer animals {{will have a}} lower body temperature, which can help eliminate protein denaturation if no lairage time is allowed. In birds, improving environmental quality will help to eliminate wing flapping, vocalizations, and excessive movement as animals are transported from the farm into the abbatoir, which can reduce PSE incidence. Lower meat pH's are correlated with the length and roughness of transportation. Stress levels are also known to decline as human handling decreases.|$|E
50|$|In agriculture, poultry litter or broiler litter is {{a mixture}} of poultry excreta, spilled feed, feathers, and {{material}} used as bedding in poultry operations. This term is also used to refer to unused bedding materials. Poultry litter is used in confinement buildings used for raising broilers, turkeys and other birds. Common bedding materials include wood shavings, sawdust, peanut hulls, shredded sugar cane, straw, and other dry, absorbent, low-cost organic materials. Sand is also occasionally used as bedding. The bedding materials help absorb moisture, limiting the production of ammonia and harmful pathogens. The materials used for bedding can also {{have a significant impact on}} <b>carcass</b> <b>quality</b> and bird performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the effect of tannery waste protein concentrate (TWPC) on fattening of cattle and the <b>carcass</b> and meat <b>quality,</b> with the aim of replacing the costly commercial protein concentrate (Jasoprot) with a more economical and effective alternative. Twelve young cattle (six male and six female) were fed during the study period on a control diet (T 1) with 10 % Jasoprot and on two test diets: 5 % TWPC + 5 % Jasoprot (T 2) and 10 % TWPC (T 3). The test diets significantly affected (p 0. 05) among the three groups. It is concluded that TWPC or an equal mixture of TWPC and Jasoprot may be an economic and efficient alternative protein source to Jasoprot in the cattle industry, which minimizes adverse effects on carcass and sensory meat quality.

5000|$|The use of {{supplemental}} growth hormones is controversial. The {{benefits of}} using growth hormones includes improved feed efficiency, <b>carcass</b> <b>quality,</b> {{and rate of}} muscle development. The cattle industry takes {{the position that the}} use of growth hormones allows plentiful meats to be sold for affordable prices. Conversely, there exists customer concern about growth hormone use being linked to a number of human health problems. However, there have been insufficient studies to prove or disprove these concerns. [...] Growth hormones are synthetically created but testing cannot distinguish between artificial hormones and those naturally produced by the animal itself. Using hormones in beef cattle costs $1.50 and adds between 40 and 50 lb to the weight of a steer at slaughter, for a return of at least $25.|$|E
