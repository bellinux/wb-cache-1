The usual reason given {{for the use of}} a <b>chronometric</b> <b>system</b> is that there is insufficient biological activity or geochemical change to find useful markers. That is a position which is now a little uncertain and is going to become increasingly tenuous over the next few years. For example, {{there are a number of}} good potential markers in the rise and decline of [...] "Christmas tree" [...] stromatolites, in the ebb and flow of banded iron formations, the appearance of stable carbon-13 isotope (13C) excursions, and so on. These have real meaning for the geologist and paleontologist.|$|E

Ironstone layers interbedded in thesandstones contain {{several generations}} of spectacularauthigenic xenotime overgrowths that formed around detritalzircon grains in response to successive hydrothermal events. Textural and chemical characterisations allow to distinguishthree generations of xenotime overgrowths, differing notablyin their REE characteristics. In-situ U-Pb data obtained onthese xenotime overgrowths show that their U-Pb systematicswere largely disturbed by successive hydrothermal eventsover about 90 Ma between~ 330 and~ 420 Ma, a time intervalencompassing most phases {{of the construction of}} the Variscanorogen in France. The younger dates cluster around~ 330 – 340 Ma and likely correspond to the age of the deposition ofmassive sulphides and base-metals in the Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux deposits, which is consistent with the structural contextswhere they formed. Finally, this study shows that similarlyto monazite, another phosphate widely used for U-Pb andTh-Pb dating studies, the U-Pb <b>chronometric</b> <b>system</b> inxenotime appears to be highly sensitive to fluid circulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>chronometric</b> <b>system</b> of compensation for the apparent movement {{of the sun and}} that for the moon {{has been the subject of}} several, never proven, hypotheses. Our studies on sandhoppers have demonstrated that the chronometric mechanism of the moon compass is separate from that of the sun compass. They show (i) that a period of seven days in constant darkness has no influence on the capacity for orientation, either solar or lunar, and indicates the presence of one or more continuously operating timing mechanisms; (ii) that two different shifts in the light–dark phase have no effect on the chronometric mechanism of lunar orientation, but they do affect that of solar orientation; and (iii) that exposure to an artificial moon delayed by seven days with respect to the natural cycle causes the expected change in the mean direction of individuals tested under the natural moon, but not of those tested under the sun...|$|E
40|$|The ages of {{the earth}} and moon as {{determined}} by various <b>chronometric</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed with primary emphasis placed on the development of an I-Pu-Xe chronometer. Data on excess fission xenon are reviewed with attention given to {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the assumptions required for lunar I-Pu-Xe chronometry. Using I-Pu-Xe dating, it is estimated that the retention of excess fission xenon in lunar samples began no more than 63 + or - 42 m. y. after the time of primitive meteorite formation...|$|R
