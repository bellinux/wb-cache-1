5|$|Unicorn was {{assigned}} to Force V, a flotilla <b>of</b> British <b>carriers,</b> commanded by Admiral Philip Vian, intended to provide air cover to Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno. In preparation for this mission, the ship disembarked all of her Swordfish, except for a small detachment of three from 818 Squadron for self-defence, and the Sea Hurricanes of 800 Squadron. They were replaced by Seafires of 809 and 897 Squadrons. Each of the Seafire squadrons had 10 aircraft, {{for a total of}} 33. Unicorn joined the escort <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Force</b> V in August at Gibraltar before they moved forward to the Central Mediterranean for intensive training prior to the commencement of the amphibious landing on 9 September.|$|R
5|$|Navy strikes were {{launched}} from the aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> Task <b>Force</b> 77, cruising off the North Vietnamese coast at Yankee Station.

5|$|HMS Forester {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the early 1930s. Although {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939, she helped to sink one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940.

5|$|HMS Foxhound {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. Although she was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet, the ship was detached as part of the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. Several weeks after the start of the Second World War in September 1939, Foxhound helped to sink a German submarine and participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940.
