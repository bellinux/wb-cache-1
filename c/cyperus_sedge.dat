50|$|Carex pseudocyperus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the sedge family known by the common name <b>cyperus</b> <b>sedge</b> or hop sedge. It grows in marshes, swamps, and the margins of ponds, rivers and canals. The stems can be up to 90 cm with one male spike and 3--5 pendulous female spikes, and bright yellow-green leaves to 1.2 m.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{features}} {{a wide range}} of plants and animals - mainly insects, also hosting flora and fauna specific to limestone soil. The stony, calcareous soil supports a herb-rich flora with local plants such as bee and pyramidal orchids, <b>cyperus</b> <b>sedge,</b> yellow vetchling, autumn gentian, tutsan, wild madder, tree-mallow, dwarf gorse and ivy broomrape. The quarry's sparse vegetation conditions hold the butterflies and other insects.|$|E
5000|$|Wetlands cover roughly 1 {{percent of}} the island, not {{counting}} running water. Marshes, swamp forests and lakes are found in all regions, along with rivers and streams. Typical species of wet habitats are several endemic <b>Cyperus</b> <b>sedges,</b> ferns, pandans (Pandanus), and the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Two species of water lilies, Nymphaea lotus and N. nouchali, {{are found in the}} west and east, respectively. Lagoons are mainly found on the east coast, but also occur in the west; they have a specialised halophyte flora. Peat bogs are restricted to highlands above [...] elevation; their distinct vegetation includes, among others, Sphagnum moss and sundew species (Drosera). Many wetlands have been converted into rice paddies and are otherwise threatened by destruction and pollution.|$|R

5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra.

50|$|Wild {{water buffalo}} are both diurnal and nocturnal. Adult females and their young form stable clans {{of as many}} as 30 {{individuals}} which have home ranges of 170 to 1000 ha, including areas for resting, grazing, wallowing and drinking. Clans are led by old cows, even when bulls accompany the group. Several clans form a herd of 30 to 500 animals that gather at resting areas. Adult males form bachelor groups of up to 10 individuals, with older males often being solitary, and spend the dry season apart from the female clans. They are seasonal breeders in most of their range, typically in October and November. However, some populations breed year round. Dominant males mate with the females of a clan who subsequently drive them off. Their gestation period is 10 to 11 months, with an inter-birth interval of one year. They typically give birth to a single offspring, although twins are possible. Age at sexual maturity is 18 months for males, and three years for females. The maximum known lifespan is 25 years in the wild. In the wild in Assam, the herd size varies from three to 30 individuals. They are probably grazers by preference, feeding mainly on graminoids when available, such as Bermuda grass, and <b>Cyperus</b> <b>sedges,</b> but they also eat other herbs, fruits, and bark, as well as browsing on trees and shrubs. They also feed on crops, including rice, sugarcane, and jute, sometimes causing considerable damage.|$|R
25|$|During autumn, {{parts of}} the Nile River are red with lotus flowers. The Lower Nile (North) and the Upper Nile (South) have plants that grow in abundance. The Upper Nile plant is the Egyptian lotus, and the Lower Nile plant is the Papyrus <b>Sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> papyrus), {{although}} it is not nearly as plentiful as it once was, and is becoming quite rare.|$|R
50|$|Matjiesrivier {{is a town}} at the {{southern}} foot of the Waboomsberg, some 37 km south of Prince Albert, off the road to Oudtshoorn. Afrikaans for 'little mat river', the reference is to a type of <b>sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> textilis) growing there, used by Khoekhoen in making mats with which they made their huts. Matjiesgoed is the common name for this sedge, literally 'little mat stuff.|$|R
50|$|Related {{to other}} nut sedges (such as tigernut), priprioca roots release a light, woody, and spicy {{fragrance}} with floral notes. It {{is one of}} the traditional spices of the Amazon region, used medicinally in local tradition, and its reddish essential oil is used commercially both by the cosmetic industry, and increasingly as a flavoring for food. While it is closely related to highly invasive sedges such as purple nut <b>sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> rotundus), priprioca is less prolific and competitive than its relative.|$|R

50|$|The Montezuma quail eats insects, {{especially}} in summer, {{as well as}} plants. Particularly important plant foods are Oxalis and other bulbs as well as <b>sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> esculentus and C. sphaerolepis) tubers, which it digs up. The holes, often at the bases of bushes and rocks, may {{be as much as}} 8 cm deep and are a good sign of the bird's presence. Crops sometimes contain bulbs of plants that have no above-ground growth at that season; how the birds find such bulbs is unknown.|$|R
50|$|They often live {{directly}} underneath Spanish bayonet or {{prickly pear}} plants. They {{are accustomed to}} sandy soil and eat mostly seeds, large and small grasses and small leaves of plants. Some food found in their cheek pouches are: seeds of needle grass (Stipa), bind weed, sandbur grass, a small bean (probably Astragulus), and <b>sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus).</b> Even those caught in grain fields usually have their pouches filled with weed seeds. Seeds of two species of pigeon grass, a few other grasses, and wild buckwheat {{have been found in}} their burrows.|$|R
5000|$|Sylvilagus palustris hefneri is diet {{specific}} choosing particular vegetation; however foraging {{strategies are}} {{not affected by}} sex or seasonality.

40|$|Abstract: Insect {{juvenile}} hormones (JHs) {{are involved}} in the regulation of physiological processes such as metamorphosis and reproduction in most insect species. In 1988, juvenile hormone III (JH III) and its biosynthetic precursor (insects), methyl farnesoate, were isolated from the <b>sedges</b> <b>Cyperus</b> iria L. and C. aromaticus (Ridley) Mattf and Kük (ref. 1). In C. iria roots, concentrations of 27. 2 ± 3. 3 mg of JH III per gram fresh weight was extracted; this is approximately 37 times the amount of JH detected in whole body extracts of the cockroach, Diploptera punctata (ref. 2, ref. 3). The extremely high concentration found in the plant and its presence throughout development suggests that JH III plays an important biological role(s) in the plant, perhaps through plant-insect, plant-plant or other interactions...|$|R

40|$|Wetlands {{have been}} used as a {{potentially}} cost-effective secondary waste water treatment system to treat the waste water before discharge into the water bodies. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the pollution reduction ability of plant species at various depths in a constructed wetland system. Two different grass species such as Eleucine indica (Goose grass), Dactyloctenium aegyptium (Crowfoot grass) and a <b>sedge</b> namely <b>Cyperus</b> iria (umbrella <b>sedge)</b> and the control without any plant species were introduced in the constructed wetland system. The system was operated continuously by inlet valve from tank filled with storm water. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, DO, BOD, TS, Nitrate and Phosphate contents were measured in one week interval using standard procedures. The results revealed that the pollution reduction ability was very high in Cyperus iria at one foot depth whereas the nitrate and phosphate reduction ability was comparatively high in Cyperus iria at their 1. 5 feet depth...|$|R
40|$|In most insect species, {{juvenile}} hormones regulate critical physiological {{processes such as}} metamorphosis and reproduction. In insects, these sesquiterpenoids are synthesized by retrocerebral endocrine organs, the corpora allata, via {{the classical}} mevalonate (MVA) pathway. One of these compounds, juvenile hormone III (JH III), has also been identified in the <b>sedge</b> <b>Cyperus</b> iria. In higher plants, biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone may proceed through two distinct pathways: the MVA pathway or the 2 C-methyl erythritol 4 -phosphate pathway or {{through a combination of}} both pathways. Cell suspension cultures of C. iria were used to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of JH III in the plant. Enzyme inhibition and labeling studies conclusively demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone of JH III proceeds via the MVA pathway. Inhibitor and precursor feeding studies also suggest that later steps of JH III biosynthesis in C. iria are similar to the insect pathway and that the final enzymatic reaction in JH III biosynthesis is catalyzed by a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase...|$|R
40|$|Species {{composition}} of plants {{present in the}} stomach contents of 34 road-killed swamp wallabies, W. bicolor, on North Stradbroke Island, south-east Queensland, was investigated, and related to seasonal variations in nitrogen and fibre contents of plants in the study area. W. bicolor consumed {{a wide range of}} plant categories including shrubs, forbs, grasses, ferns and fungi. Among these, grasses, followed by shrubs, were the major component of the stomach contents. These dietary plants had higher nitrogen contents than those non-dietary plants of the corresponding plant category, which were present in the study site but never found in the stomach contents. Individual grass species of high occurrence in the stomach contents were molasses grass, Melinus minutiflora, green couch, Cynodon dactylon and <b>sedges,</b> <b>Cyperus</b> spp. Although more fibrous, these species had similar or relatively high nitrogen levels compared to native shrubs, except during summer. This suggests that W. bicolor selected dietary plants of high nitrogen content rather than of low fibre content...|$|R
40|$|Herbicidal {{potential}} of different plant aqueous extracts was evaluated against early seedling growth of rice weeds in pot studies. Plant aqueous extracts of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), brassica (Brassica compestris), mulberry (Morris alba), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldunensis), and winter cherry (Withania somnifera) at a spray volume of 18 L ha- 1 each at the 2 - 4 leaf stage of rice weeds viz horse purslane (Trianthema portulacastrum) [broad-leaf], jungle rice (Echinochloa colona), and E. crus-galli (barnyard grass) [grasses] and purple nut <b>sedge</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> rotundus) and rice flat sedge (C. iria) [sedges]. The results showed significant interactive effects between plant aqueous extracts and the tested weed species for seedling growth attributes depicting that allelopathic inhibition was species-specific. Shoot and root length, lateral plant spread, biomass accumulation, and leaf chlorophyll contents in test species were all reduced by different extracts. The study suggested the suppressive {{potential of}} allelopathic plant aqueous extracts against rice weeds, and offered promise for their usefulness {{as a tool}} for weed management under field conditions...|$|R
50|$|The grey grasswren {{occupies}} a restrictive area of arid inland floodplains of central Australia. Sightings have {{occurred at the}} Bulloo Overflow in the New South Wales/Queensland border area, lower Cooper Creek, along the Kallakoopah anabranch of the Diamantina River and the overflow areas of lakes Machattie, Koolivoo and Mipea on Eyre Creek in South Australia.These birds frequent mainly floodplains of the above systems which contain areas dominated by lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta) and cane grass (Eragrostis australasia) on major drainage lines between resident sand dunes. In some swampy areas, a dense understory of spike-rush (Eleocharis plana), channel millet (Echinochloa turnerana), and <b>sedges</b> (<b>Cyperus</b> species) are present. The grey grasswren has also been known to occupy open vegetative areas well beyond the lignum swamps which are less subject to inundation during flood events. It appears that in drought years the grey grasswren occupies tall dense lignum as a refuse while in normal years it prefers other habitats. Hardy (2002) recorded significantly more captures in declared drought years than in normal years.|$|R
