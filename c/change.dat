5|$|Climate <b>Change</b> Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate <b>change</b> denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate <b>change</b> is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate <b>change</b> by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate <b>change.</b>|$|E
