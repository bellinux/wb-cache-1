5000|$|The power plot {{is useful}} in both {{positioning}} and orienting the vibrator, and when adjusting the vibrator unbalance. Poor or inappropriate vibrator locations or orientations, or excessive vibrator unbalance settings, cause large peaks in the power plot. Use of higher-powered vibrator motors (above 2-kW) provides more [...] "head-room" [...] for peaks in power to be tolerated, and treatment to take place, which was the case here: The power peak at ≈ 3700-RPM was {{only half of the}} vibrator motor’s 2.3-kW power <b>capacity</b> (<b>top</b> of the power scale).|$|E

30|$|A “topping” {{refinery}} relies {{entirely on}} distillation to separate cuts {{and is the}} simplest type of refinery that can be built. Residuum is sold as a heavy fuel oil, and if vacuum distillation is available, part of the residuum could be made into asphalt. No additional processing occurs at topping refineries, {{and much of the}} output stream is sold to other refineries with additional processing <b>capacity.</b> <b>Topping</b> refineries are usually built to prepare feedstocks for petrochemical manufacture or for the production of industrial fuels in remote areas. A large portion of the production from topping refineries is straight run fuel oil.|$|R
5000|$|The twitch {{gameplay}} in Vendetta Online {{revolves around}} lining up a correct shot against enemy ships, while avoiding incoming fire. The dynamics {{of this can}} be complex, as ships are moving through 3-D space, and the weapons fire itself has a specific velocity, modified by the ships' absolute velocity. The ships mostly obey the laws of Newtonian Mechanics although a few artificial limits are put in place to increase the playability of the game. The control scheme includes a full six degrees of freedom, allowing users to assign keys or control axes (via joystick, thumb-stick, throttle, accelerometer, or touch area) to yaw, pitch, roll, and thrust along three axes. Ships can also be controlled with the mouse and keyboard using [...] "mouselook" [...] mode, in which the direction of view is controlled by the mouse and the ship's nose auto-corrects to catch up. Ships each have detailed specifications such as mass, thrust, torque, cargo <b>capacity,</b> <b>top</b> speed, turbo energy drain, armor, and weapon ports. There are also many variants of the main ship types, some holding certain advantages over others, with some advanced variants belonging to special factions. Depending on what equipment is being used, and what is carried in the cargo hold, the mass of the ship (and consequently maneuverability) will change greatly, affecting combat.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{bankruptcies}} and acquisitions Between 2000 and 2014 reversed {{the trend of}} industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers (Nucor, US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking <b>capacity,</b> and the <b>top</b> ten had 58%.

5000|$|Initially, the Transalpin was {{operated}} by a four-member fleet of four-car [...] electric multiple units, which had been procured specifically for the purpose.

[...] A later variant of the Utva-65, the Utva-67 (first flown in 1967), was similar, but had the eight-cylinder, 400hp (298 kW) Lycoming IO-720-A1A and a revised fuselage of greater <b>capacity.</b> Its <b>top</b> speed was 295 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} in two phases between December 1984 and December 1992, with specifications changed from single-track to double-track during construction. Design capacity was 100 million tonnes a year, which it reached after ten years, but continuous upgrades (wider subgrade, 75 kg/m rails, wagons with higher <b>capacity</b> and <b>top</b> speed, longer trains and stronger locomotives, radio operation and centralised traffic control, automatic train inspection) quadrupled capacity. It carries more coal than any other railway line in China and the world.|$|R

High <b>capacity</b> on <b>top</b> of significant day surgery outside of hospitals (especially for ophthalmology and othopaedic surgery) with doctors paid fee-for-service for activity performed were cited by Siciliani and Hurst as likely factors preventing long waits, despite hospital budget limitations. Activity-based payment for hospitals also is linked to low waiting times (Siciliani & Hurst, 2003, 33-34, 70). Germany introduced Diagnosis-Related Group activity-based payment for hospitals (with a soft cap budget limit) (Busse & Blümel, 2014, pp. 142-148).|$|R

50|$|The {{system has}} a low level <b>capacity,</b> with <b>top</b> speed usually limited. A 30 km section of the Damascus - Aleppo line was {{designed}} for speeds reaching 120 km/h, {{but most of the}} track has a limit of 110 km/h. Most tracks of the CFS are limited to 80 km/h. Operational train speed is also limited by a lack of interlocked signalling, with most of the system operating by informal signalling. The Damascus al-Hijaz railway station, which lies in the city centre, is no longer operational, and the railway connections with other cities depart from the suburban station of Kadam.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of family {{character}} on SMEs’ ambidexterity. We propose that family character-associated <b>capacities</b> and <b>top</b> management demographic characteristics, particularly team diversity, can influence decision making. These characteristics facilitate perceiving environment changes, as well as responding to them with alternatives that allow SMEs to take advantage of such changes. In addition, these characteristics promote skills that can help reconfigure resources. In a sample of 132 SMEs, we demonstrate that family character and team diversity management – both in terms of experience and age – can improve ambidexterity. More specifically, in the more ambidextrous firms, owners and top management showed age and tenure diversity, but no generational diversit...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of strong natural gas markets and El Paso's {{increased}} output <b>capacity,</b> sales <b>topped</b> $2 billion in 1978, rose past $3 billion in 1980, and then increased to nearly $4 billion in 1981. In 1981, El Paso reported record earnings of $147 million. Unfortunately, El Paso's profit gains were short-lived. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, industry competitors had hustled to boost natural gas output capacity with expectations of strong demand. But a weak economy and a newfound emphasis on energy conservation slowed market growth. Supply outstripped demand in 1982 and natural gas prices dropped. Furthermore, El Paso's chemical businesses suffered major setbacks in 1982. Although El Paso's sales rose to $4.3 billion in 1982, its net income dropped to $53 million.|$|R
