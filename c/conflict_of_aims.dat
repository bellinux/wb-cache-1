There {{has been a}} <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>aims</b> between producers and users of the national income estimates. Politicians and international organisations wish income measures to reflect current political and economic priorities and achievements. Thus, the importance given to markets, the state and peasants in the estimates varies through time and space. Meanwhile, statisticians aim to produce a measure that best reflects the economy given the available data and definitions at any time. Scholars would prefer a measure that is consistent through time and space, so as to analyze and compare ‘progress’, but they cannot agree on how ‘progress’ is best defined. The result is not an objective measure, but rather an expression of development priorities determined by changes in the political economy. The article provides a much needed study of {{the ability of the}} statistical offices to independently and regularly provide income statistics. These data are of crucial importance, as they enter the public domain in policy evaluations, political debates and assessments of progress towards lofty goals such as the Millennium Development Goals...|$|E
40|$|The {{suspension}} {{of a car}} {{is responsible for the}} stability of the vehicle at a wide range of different road conditions and driving manoeuvres and it therefore defines the driving safety. Further main tasks of the suspension are to provide high ride comfort for the passengers and to reduce loads of both chassis and body components. In modern passenger cars the suspension has reached a state of maturity where major improvements of either driving safety or ride comfort can only be obtained by reducing the performance of the other criteria. The vehicle suspension can only provide a compromise between these two criteria. The optimisation for driving safety would demand a totally different set-up of the suspensions springs and dampers than it is needed to achieve the optimal ride comfort. To solve that <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>aims</b> in a better way, great efforts are currently made by the automotive industry in order to develop and improve active suspension systems that are able to adjust spring and damping rates in dependence on the current driving situation. Since a couple of years, the first active systems are available in passenger cars of the premium segment. Such systems allow the enhancement of both ride comfort and driving safety at the same time. The main tasks of the thesis were to determine the desired functions and product requirements for the application of an active suspension in a sports car. The resulting product requirements were the basis for the generation of design concepts for an active suspension. As a further task of the thesis, the concepts were designed up to a certain development state within a defined vehicle environment. Finally, a concept evaluation was carried out using a systems engineering approach close to the German standard VDI 2225. The results of the concept evaluation give a good overview about the performance and available potential of the different concepts. Compared to an active suspension system with the active force generator integrated in the suspension strut, a hydraulic system with master-slave cylinder principle better fulfils the product requirement and provides a higher performance, mainly due the benefits of a more variable packaging. Moreover, it could be found out that an alternative double wishbone front axle design for the investigated vehicle provides better conditions for the application of the active suspension than the current McPherson axle. The results and conclusions of that work shall help to determine the potential of the active suspension concepts and support the decision for further development steps in that certain development case...|$|E

40|$|Until the 1990 s, {{electricity}} {{policy in}} Germany showed a high legal and economic continuity. The German Energy Act as {{the regulatory framework}} of the electricity industry basicly didn´t change for more than 60 years after its passing in 1935. Due to the liberalization specifications of the European Commission to create a European internal market for energy, the traditional German energy supply system was fractionalized. The liberalization question resulted in the phalanx of the German electricity industry splitting into two groups: supporters and opponents. While the big interconnected firms saw their upcoming national and international expansion chances, especially the municipal companies, in particular, feared that competition could threat their existence. Until that time, the monopoly system was characterized by high electricity prices, big excessive production capacities and a fixation on large fossil and nuclear power plants. Additionally, the electricity industry protagonists showed a high resistance to modernization and innovation. The liberalization of the energy supply on all value added stages through {{the abolition of the}} old demarcation zones immediately created a completely new competition situation on the German electricity market. Conflictual constellations between the protagonists arose in a policy field, in which the company and association structures had not changed for decades prior. During that long period, strong cooperation relationships have been built between the electricity industry, the regulating authorities and the political decision-makers. On the interconnected companies level the liberalization led to a unprecedented market concentration. Their number decreased from nine to four. As a result of the liberalization and the changes of the market structure the association landscape finally erode as well. In parallel to that development, the red-green government coalition gained power in 1998, which pushed the electricity policy towards the overall objective of environmental compatibility of the electricity supply. Therefore, the year 1998 is the starting year for this doctoral dissertation as a strategic policy field analysis, which focuses on the protagonists of the electricity policy and their action motivations. The investigation period ends with the Bundestag election in 2009, so it includes three legislative periods in relation to the national level. Simultaneously, the increasing Europeanization of the policy field ensured the shift of decision-making power and growing conflicts between the national and the European policy level. During that time, the lines of conflict, policy processes and protagonist constellations mainly proceeded along the dominating trends of liberalization and the environmental compatibility of the electricity supply system and the resulting <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>aims.</b> However, the political and absolutely dominating trend during the investigation period has been the rising influence of the European policy level on the national policy field developments. Thereby, the European Commission has been the strategic centre of the Europeanization of the policy field, while the European parliament also continuously extended its influence...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS) This {{scheme is}} a {{temporary}} funding source (2002 – 2007 / 2008) especially to support the whole organic farming sector (incl. research) in Germany. In the summer of 2001, the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture commissioned a project team comprised of representatives from associations and science and headed by the Federal Agricultural Research Centre to develop {{a proposal for a}} package of measures to foster organic farming in Germany. A hearing of representatives from trade and industry, associations, consultancy, science and administration laid the foundation for the team's work. Based on this work, the Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture Renate Künast decided to incorporate the proposed measures into the Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS) to translate them into practice. This scheme supplements existing support measures with the aim of improving the basic conditions necessary for expanding organic farming. At the same time, it strives to increase supply and demand on a balanced, sustainable basis. These measures tackle all levels of organic farming, from the production to the consumption of organically produced food. Plans include training and information measures. Emphasis is also being placed on research promotion, the development of new technologies and steps to translate research findings into practice. Currently the FOFS is the main pool of the BMVEL for organic research funding. Marketing / Consumer behaviour The difficult economic situation in Germany has strained the food industry, because consumers have become much more conscious of prices. Mainly discount stores have profited from this development and even registered rising turnovers. The result of this is that production prices came more and more under pressure. For many foods production costs could barely be covered or lost out to cheaper products from abroad. An opposite trend {{can be seen in the}} organic sector: While retail stores in the food sector are having losses, the organic field is recording positive two-digit turnovers. Though there were different food scandals, these only had a short-term effect. More and more consumers are becoming aware of a healthy diet and nourishment. Surely, the Federal Scheme has contributed positively to this development. The consumer backgrounds are rather losing transparency, as the organic niche has lost its organic “alternative” image. Though there are still convinced organic activists, there are equally those, who are occasional buyers with different familial and educational backgrounds. Even the motives and reasons to buy organic have become diverse. Research projects dealing with the analysis of the qualitative structure of organic consumer behaviour (especially occasional and rare buyers of organic goods) have been realised on survey basis in the Federal Organic Farming Scheme. Furthermore, projects concerning the demand of organic food products have been conducted using panel data and long-term observations. Another branch of market research deals with the successful marketing initiatives of organic products, as well as the effect in sales promotion and special price offers in retail. An improvement is also necessary at the interface between producers of organic goods and commercial enterprises. Many consumers are prepared to buy organic products, but do not want to spend the time and effort to comb through the different stores in order to find what they want or need. Therefore, the need exists to bundle the portfolio of goods of the manufacturers and establish communication to retailers. Latter are only interested in clients that are affine to organic goods and want to keep such clients with respective marketing, so that these will buy from the retailer, who offers a large product palette. This sensitive topic was taken up by a broad project of the Federal Organic Farming Scheme, which is currently running. At the beginning of the Federal Scheme, research projects focused on the primary sector, i. e. the production side. But sustainable agriculture can only develop, if the demand side equally rises. Thus, in 2003 / 2004, many projects turned towards the marketing issue. In the meantime, the organic niche has started to develop into a branch of its own. The increasing entry of retailers and also of discount stores into the sale of organic goods reflects this as well. Unfortunately, risks evolve next to the many positive opportunities, as conventional agriculture has already experienced since several years: The producing side gets more and more under pressure from the buyer side, because the demand for high quality, consistent and largely produced goods, can only be satisfied, if a constant delivery is warranted. This increases the pressure on rationalisation. Additionally, foreign producers of organic raw materials and goods are also pressing forward onto the German market, which does not facilitate the situation for the German organic farms and businesses. Many stakeholders fear that German organic farmers will be forced to use conventional methods such as securing short-term harvest maximisation and placing the optimisation of the farm processes in the back. Advances in organic agriculture cannot be achieved if only single production techniques or branches are intensified or changed, without considering the interaction within the entire farming system. A solution for this <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>aims</b> is difficult, because economic, political, social and scientific interests have to be aligned. This implies the following for organic research: Scientists, as well as those who decide about financing of research projects in Germany, have to do justice to the area of conflict between the pressure of conventionalising (i. e. organic farming, which is on the legal periphery) and the desired holistic approach for a sustainable and environmental-friendly agriculture. The stakeholders of the organic food industry are equally challenged: They have not only to convince the consumer of the quality of produced goods, but also of the quality and raised environmental-friendliness of the production process. This proves to be a difficult task. The occasional buyer’s motives to go for organic products are mostly of an egoistic nature. He/she decides on the basis of health, taste etc. Higher or altruistic motives are of secondary nature, such as honouring the ecological and social benefits of organic agriculture. These include protection of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity as well as securing and creating new jobs. The Federal Scheme supports the difficult task to communicate the process quality as an added value. A model project supports a dairy farm by purposely raising the price of the produced milk by 5 cent/litre. Then, this surcharge is mentioned on the packaging as a direct income transfer for the milk producing farmers. This surcharge is given directly to the regional milk producers so that they are also able to produce cost effectively in the future. The practice was a success, as early fears of a loss in sales by 10 - 20...|$|E

One example is the ongoing debate regarding global warming and its causes and consequences. There are also several other problems in our society such as segregation and social tensions. Most agree that we must do something to solve these problems and that we must try to achieve a sustainable development for the entire planet. But how should it actually be done and what trade-offs, compromises, sacrifices and changes must be made? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how these issues are being dealt with in Swedish city planning. Which principles and objectives are being applied to achieve a sustainable development? Are the ambitions of the planners sufficient? And above all – which problems and <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> goals appear when they try to put the ideas of sustainable development into practice. To answer these questions I have conducted a case study of two current city development projects in Stockholm. For these two projects, several planning documents have been examined and analyzed. Based on this analysis I have conducted interviews with a responsible urban planner from each project and subsequently analyzed and evaluated the results. The main conclusions are that it is very difficult for the municipality to develop new housing for low-income earners in the inner city. The planners have no real tools to solve this issue that adds to segregation in the society. Furthermore, there is a major conflict between the aim to develop good public spaces and the municipalitys and the private operators economic interest in exploiting as much of the buildable land as possible.
