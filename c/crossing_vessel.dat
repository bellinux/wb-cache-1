40|$|The {{knowledge}} of asssociation of the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> in the ureteropelvic junction obstruction {{is important in}} planning the therapeutic strategy (endoscopic procedure, laparoscopic or open pyeloplasty). Next to the well-known imaging methods (ultrasonography-US, intravenous urography-IVU and retrograde pyelography-RP) is added the Doppler colour ultrasonography (US) which {{in the hands of}} a well-trained uroradiologist is reliable enough in the preoperative diagnosis of the <b>vessels</b> <b>crossing</b> at the ureteropelvic junction. But there is a controversy regarding the functional significance of this vessels in the ureteropelvic obstruction, because the information brought by Doppler colour US relyes on topographical data. <b>Crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> are important for two reasons: they are a potential source of hemorrhage following endoscopic incision and they may play an etiologic role in ureteropelvic junction obstruction and therefore may be a reason for failure of endoscopic techniques. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the reliability of the imaging methods, especially colour Doppler US, in the detection of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> in patients with surgically proven ureteropielic junction obstruction. METHODS: The files of all 117 patients who were diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction in our clinic between 2002 and 2005 were reviewed. There were selected and analysed the cases of 21 patients surgically treated and intra-operative diagnosed with <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels.</b> The indication for surgery was according to the usual criteria. RESULTS: Usual imaging methods (US, IVU) were used in all cases, and RP only in 9 selected cases. The results cleared up the three goals of imaging for ureteropelvic junction obstruction: to determine the presence and degree of renal obstruction, to assess renal function, and to determine the cause of the problem. For this final objective, Doppler colour US proved to have a sensibility of 79, 6 % in detecting the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels.</b> CONCLUSION: Colour Doppler US is reliable in the detection of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> at the ureteropelvic junction guiding the strategy to open dismembered pyeloplasty...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{minimally}} invasive treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction has evolved {{during the last decade}} from endoscopic to laparoscopic and robotic. We review our 10 -year experience with ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and report on our experience and followup. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all patients treated during the last 10 years. There were 294 procedures performed with complete records on 273 patients including 128 retrograde endopyelotomies, 116 laparoscopic pyeloplasties and 29 robotic pyeloplasties. Technique for each procedure is reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed on all results. Variables evaluated were gender, age (younger than 41 vs 41 years or older), side (right or left), presence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels,</b> presence of a high insertion, primary or secondary procedure and whether prior endopyelotomy or pyeloplasty had been performed. RESULTS: Mean followup for endopyelotomy, laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robotic pyeloplasty was 20, 20 and 19 months, respectively, with success rates of 60. 2 %, 88. 8 % and 100 %, respectively. On univariable analysis only the presence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> or a high insertion was significant for laparoscopic pyeloplasty. On multivariable analysis age was significant for endopyelotomy and the presence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> was significant for pyeloplasty. On Kaplan-Meier analysis failures were noted to occur after 5 years in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robotic pyeloplasty are superior {{minimally invasive}} treatments for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. However, endopyelotomy can be used for select patients. Because of late failures patients who undergo either of these procedures should receive long-term followup...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU) {{appearances of}} the circumcaval ureter, a rare congenital cause of hydronephrosis. Materials and Methods: Seven cases of circumcaval ureter, suspected on intravenous urography (IVU), underwent subsequent static MRU using heavily T 2 -weighted sequences. Results: The various appearances of circumcaval ureter on IVU and MRU were studied and compared. The circumcaval {{portion of the}} ureter was especially well seen on axial MRU sections, though this portion was routinely not visualized on IVU. In one case with a ureteric calculus, MRU also depicted a circumcaval course of the ureter, thus providing a complete diagnosis. In yet another case, where a circumcaval ureter was suspected on IVU, MRU proved the actual cause of ureteric obstruction to be a <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Conclusion: Static MRU using heavily T 2 -weighted coronal and axial sequences can make or exclude the diagnosis of circumcaval ureter unequivocally...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty was {{developed}} as a minimally invasive alternative to an open procedure {{for the treatment of}} ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. We present our experience with the first 30 consecutive cases of laparoscopic pyeloplasty performed at our institution. Materials and Methods: We studied 30 patients with ureteropelvic junction obstructions who underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty between March 2004 and March 2009. Of the 30 patients, 5 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) since April 2008. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to operative procedure: group 1, early laparoscopic pyeloplasty-dismembered (E/LP-D, n= 9); group 2, late la-paroscopic pyeloplasty-dismembered (L/LP-D, n= 9); group 3, laparoscopic pyeloplasty-Fenger’s method (LP-F, n= 7); and group 4, RALP (n= 5). Results: The mean age of the patients was 34. 0 ± 12. 8 years (range, 17 - 61 years). A <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> was present in 37. 9 % of cases.

40|$|Biometric {{technology}} is an efficient personal authentication and identification technique.

Also, the recent researches have been obtained no certain recognition rate yet becuse of the noises in the imaging patterns, and impossibility of Dimension reducing because of the non-complexity of the models, and proof of correctness of identification is required. Therefore, in this paper, first, the images of blood vessels on back of the hands of people is analysed, and after pre-processing of images and feature extraction (in the intersection between the vessels) we began to identify people using firefly clustering algorithms.

40|$|Background: Aberrant lower polar {{vessels are}} {{uncommon}} causes of pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. Preoperative identifi cation would help in planning the appropriate procedure. We attempted {{to determine whether}} routine investigations would predict <b>crossing</b> lower polar <b>vessels.</b> Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 20 patients that either had ultrasonographic investigation by a radiologist who was blinded to the aetiology of PUJ obstruction, or underwent minimal access surgery for PUJ obstruction, from 2005 to 2007, in the Birmingham Children&#x 2032;s Hospital, UK. Results: There were 20 patients with PUJ obstruction, 8 were found at operation to have <b>crossing</b> lower polar <b>vessels</b> causing PUJ obstruction.

40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{reconstructive}} urology {{is undergoing}} rapid change. We review {{the current status}} of laparoscopic reconstructive urology, with particular respect to pyeloplasty and reconstructive ureteric surgery. Methods: An extensive Medline search of reconstructive laparoscopic procedures was undertaken. The initial reports and large series reports of a range of procedures was examined and summarised. The most commonly practised procedure within this remit is laparoscopic pyeloplasty. Several series of over 100 patients have been published. Success rates average over 90 &#x 0025; for laparoscopic pyeloplasty with a low complication rate. Much less common laparoscopic reconstructive urological procedures include ureteric re-implantation, Boari flap, urinary diversion and transuretero-ureterostomy. The results of these are encouraging. Conclusions: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty may be safely performed by either the transperitoneal or retroperitoneal routes with excellent results. It should be considered the "gold standard" for the management of UPJ obstruction, especially in those patients with significant hydronephrosis, renal impairment or a <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Laparoscopic ureteric reimplantation, Boari flap, urinary diversion and transuretero-ureterostomy have been performed by experienced laparoscopic urologists with encouraging results...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of vessels crossing the ureteropelvic junction and of the grade of hydronephrosis in 86 patients who underwent endoureteropyelotomy. With a follow-up ranging from 1 to 12 years, the presence of crossing vessels had a significant negative influence on the outcome and recurrence rate of the procedure. The success rate was 82 % when no vessels were present but only 33 % when crossing vessels were documented. In 13 of 15 failures (87 %), a <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> was found at open pyeloplasty. The degree of hydronephrosis was a less potent detrimental factor, with an 81 % success rate in low-grade and 54 % in high-grade hydronephrosis. The best results (90 % success) were obtained in patients with no crossing vessels and low-grade hydronephrosis and the worst (30 % success) in those with high-grade hydronephrosis {{in the presence of}} crossing vessels. Selection of patients according to those prognostic factors is recommended. Conventional intravenous urographic imaging techniques proved insufficient, and only angiography provided diagnostic accuracy; less-invasive methods are desirable...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to report our initial {{experience}} with laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) in children with pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and describe the evolution and evaluate the results. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 32 consecutive infants and children with unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction and deterioration of renal function on isotope renography, who underwent LP (19 on the right, 13 on the left) between May 2003 and January 2007. Twenty-three were males and 9 females. The mean age was 7. 7 years old (range, 2 months to 17 years); the patient was placed in a three quarter lateral position and three ports were used. The PUJ was resected and the anastomosis was made by using absorbable sutures. A JJ stent was inserted by laparoscopy in most patients. Follow-up included clinical and ultrasound assessment, followed by isotopic renography at 6 months. Results: LP was feasible in 29 of 32 patients (91). The procedure could not be completed by laparoscopy in 3 patients; the main reason was difficulty in completing the anastomosis. Only 1 patient with a big redundant renal pelvis underwent a reduction. Stent insertion was successful in all, except 1 patient. An aberrant <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> was found in 12 patients. We held up the aberrant <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> and PUJ with two- or three-point - not absorbable - sutures, without the needed pyeloplasty in 2 of them. The other 10 underwent a LP enabled ureteric transposition. Three patients presented with postoperative complications: pyelonephritis in 2 patients and PUJ leakage in 1 who underwent nephrostomy with a further uneventful course. Mean operative time was 152 minutes (range, 120 - 270), and average hospital stay was 4. 7 days (range, 1 - 8). In 1 patient, cystoscopy showed that the JJ stent was not in the bladder at the time of removal, and ureteroscopy was used to retrieve it. Mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 2 - 56). A total of 29 patients (91) were asymptomatic after removal of the double JJ stent, showing a reduction of the degree of hydronephrosis in all patients, and had also improved PUJ drainage on isotope renography or sonography. Conclusions: LP is effective and safe in children with minimal morbidity and gives excellent short-term results. The feasibility is also excellent in patients younger than 1 year. The transabdominal approach revealed good exposition without disadvantages for the patient. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Aim To assess if {{calibration}} of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) using a high-pressure balloon inflated at the UPJ {{level in}} patients with suspected <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> (CV) could differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic stenosis prior to laparoscopic vascular hitch (VH). Materials and Methods We reviewed patients with UPJO diagnosed at childhood or adolescence without previous evidence of antenatal or infant hydronephrosis (10 patients). By cystoscopy, a high-pressure balloon is sited at the UPJ and the balloon inflated to 8 - 12 atm under radiological screening. We considered intrinsic PUJO to be present where a ‘waist’ was observed at the PUJ on inflation of the balloon and a laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty is performed When no ‘waist’ is observed we considered this to represent extrinsic stenosis and a laparoscopic VH was performed. Patients with absence of intrinsic PUJ stenosis documented with this method are included for the study. Results Six patients presented pure extrinsic stenosis. The mean age at presentation was 10. 8 years. Mean duration of surgery was 99 min and mean hospital stay was 24 hours in all cases. We found no intraoperative or postoperative complications. All children remain symptoms free at a mean follow up of 14 months. Ultrasound and renogram improved in all cases. Conclusion When no ‘waist’ is observed we considered this to represent extrinsic stenosis and a laparoscopic VH was performed. In these patients, laparoscopic transposition of lower pole <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> (‘vascular hitch’) may be a safe and reliable surgical technique...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{reported}} the outcome and complications of laparoscopic aberrant vessels transposition without performing pyeloplasty {{in patients with}} ureteropelvic stenosis. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patients with ureteropelvic stenosis accompanying with aberrant vessels underwent laparoscopic transposition of vessels between June 2001 and March 2003. 4 of the cases were male and 6 were female, and 4 out of 10 had right side and 6 had left side involvement. The mean age was 31. 9 (14 - 59). Reaction of aberrant vessels was performed by cutting the vain and fixing the artery to the lipid layer around the kidney and renal pelvis. Results: The procedure was successful in all the cases without any perioperative complications. The operative time was 2. 20 hours (1. 45 - 2. 50) including cystoscopy, DJ placement, and transposition. Mean hospital stay was 2. 9 (2 - 5) days, and patients were followed up an average of 9. 1 (3 - 22) months. Except one case of rehospitalization due to pain, no complication occurred. The rate of clinical and radiological improvement was 100 % and IVP showed {{a decrease in the}} degree of hydronephrosis as well as the resolution of obstruction observed in renogram. Conclusion: With regard to our findings, it seems, at least in a proportion of patients with UPJ stenosis accompanied with <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels,</b> that mechanical compression is the mere cause of obstruction and primary stenosis does not coexist. As a result, treatment is achieved by transposition of the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> without entering the renal unit. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{survey the}} effects of one-trocar-assisted pyeloplasty (OTAP) in the {{treatment}} of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in kids. Materials and Methods: Forty-four children (± 3. 5 years) were submitted to OTAP procedure. A flank incision under the XII rib was made, the Gerota′s fascia was achieved and a balloon Hasson trocar with an operative telescope inserted for retroperitoneal access. The renal pelvis and ureter were isolated and exteriorised. Forty-two patients underwent Anderson-Hynes dismembered and one Fenger pyeloplasty. One patient was converted to an open procedure. Two patients presented an aberrant <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel.</b> In all patients, a double J stent was positioned. The operative time and length of stay (LOS) were evaluated. Renal scan and ultrasound (US) were utilised to evaluate the results from 6 to 12 months. Results: OTAP was successful in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time and LOS were 128 min and 3, 5 days. We had four operative complications (9. 09 %). The US and a nuclear scan confirmed the resolution of the UPJO in all patients except one with the Fenger pyeloplasty who had an open Anderson-Hynes. Conclusions: The combination of retroperitoneoscopic and open procedures for dismembered pyeloplasty offers a simple, time-saving method in a minimally invasive fashion with low morbidity for patients with UPJO...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic Doppler {{technology}} {{has previously been}} reported to help identify vasculature during laparoscopy. Recently, we published our initial experience with this technology during laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, and robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty. We now present a prospective, pilot evaluation of the Doppler probe for these procedures. Methods: A laparoscopic Doppler probe {{was used in the}} above laparoscopic renal surgeries in 50 patients. Anatomic findings, Doppler survey time, dissection time, operative time, estimated blood loss, changes in management, subjective time saved/utility, technical difficulties, clinical complications, and ease of use were prospectively recorded. Results: Mean Doppler survey time was 1. 77 minutes. Mean hilar dissection time was 9. 25 minutes. Eight accessory vessels were not seen on preoperative imaging in 7 patients (17 %). In 3 cases of RALP, Doppler rectified preoperative imaging in detecting a <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel.</b> The probe altered management in 16 % of patients, subjectively saved time in 78 % of patients, and had 100 % concordance with dissection. There were no complications but 2 technical failures. Conclusion: The probe is quick, safe, easy to use, and has perfect concordance with surgical dissection. Randomized comparison with and without Doppler assistance is necessary to confirm the utility of this technology...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} a sequence of 47 laparoscopic Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasties for the treatment of patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction, independently of the etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty male and 27 female patients diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction were treated by Anderson-Hynes transperitoneal laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty from April 2002 to January 2006. The age of the patients ranged from four to 75 years, {{with a mean age of}} 32. 3 years. The follow-up ranged between six and 30 months, with a mean follow-up time of 24 months. The outcomes were evaluated through the assessment of symptoms and imaging studies. RESULTS: In 44 (93. 6 %) of the 47 patients, resolution of the pain and a reduction in ureteropelvic dilation were observed. The mean operative time was 157 minutes (ranging from 90 to 270 minutes). Neither blood transfusion nor conversion to open surgery was required. The mean hospital stay was 2. 2 days. The presence of crossing vessels over the ureteropelvic junction was verified in 26 patients (55 %), and vessel transposition in relation to the urinary tract was performed in 25 of these cases. In one patient, the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> was mobilized out of the ureteropelvic junction with a perivascular suture to the renal capsule associated with the pyeloplasty. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of transperitoneal Anderson-Hynes laparoscopic pyeloplasty used for different causes of pyeloureteral obstruction presented a success rate similar to a previously-published open procedure, with the advantage of being less invasive. This procedure may be considered the first option for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ureteropelvic {{junction}} obstruction (UPJO) {{is usually}} intrinsic; however, 15 %– 52 % {{may be associated}} with crossing renal/lower pole vessels. Investigators have demonstrated that the presence of crossing vessels decreased the success rate of antegrade endopyelotomy. We prospectively reviewed our series of laparoscopic pyeloplasty in children and analyzed as to whether crossing vessels affected the morbidity and outcome. Methods: Children < 18 years of age undergoing laparoscopic pyeloplasty for UPJO were prospectively included in the study. Pyeloplasty was performed anterior to the vessels, and the anastomosis was placed adequately distal to the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Children were followed up in the postoperative period for urinary tract infection, and a DTPA renogram was performed after 3 months in all. Results: Twenty (15. 74 %) children had crossing renal/lower pole vessels associated with UPJO. The mean age of these children was 11. 0 ± years. The mean operating time was 96. 15 ± 12. 54 min as compared to 76. 35 ± 8. 16 min in children with UPJO alone. The mean blood loss was 31. 50 ± 6. 03 cc as compared to 29. 56 ± 4. 50 cc in children with UPJO alone. The mean postoperative hospital stay 51. 50 h and 100 % of the children showed improvement of renal function as well as drainage on the postoperative diuretic renogram done after 12 weeks of surgery. Conclusions: Crossing renal/lower polar is associated with UPJO in about 15 % of children undergoing laparoscopic pyeloplasty. The presence of crossing vessels significantly prolonged operating time; however, the blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and short-term outcomes were similar to children with UPJO alone...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} review studies {{comparing}} {{the outcomes of}} the laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) pyeloplasty with those of conventional laparoscopic pyeloplasty (CLP). A systematic {{review of the literature}} was performed according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was rated according validated scales. The level of evidence (LE) was reported as described by the Oxford criteria. Preoperative demographic parameters and perioperative outcomes between the two surgical techniques were assessed. A meta-analysis of the included studies was performed. A total of 5 studies were elected for the analysis, including 164 cases, 70 (42. 6 %) of them being LESS and 94 (57. 4 %) being CLP. Four studies were observational retrospective comparative studies (LE: 3 a- 4); one was a prospective randomized controlled trial (LE: 2 b). There {{was no significant difference in}} age, body mass index, gender, side and presence of the <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel,</b> between the groups. There was no significant difference regarding the operative time (weight mean difference [WMD]: − 7. 02; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: − 71. 82 - 57. 79; P = 0. 83) and length of hospital stay (WMD: 0. 04; 95 % CI: − 0. 11 - 0. 20; P = 0. 58), whereas the estimated blood loss was statistically lower for LESS (WMD: − 16. 83; 95 % CI: − 31. 79 -− 1. 87; P = 0. 03). The postoperative use of analgesic favored the LESS group but without reaching statistical significance (WMD: − 7. 52; 95 % CI: − 17. 56 - 2. 53; P = 0. 14). In conclusion, LESS pyeloplasty offers comparable surgical and functional outcomes to CLP while providing the potential advantages of less blood loss and lower analgesic requirement. Thus, despite being more technically challenging, LESS pyeloplasty can be regarded as a minimally invasive approach for patients seeking fewer incisional scars...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty compared with open surgery {{and to determine}} whether the morbidity and outcome rates are different in each of these techniques. We report our 10 -year experience with open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty at one istitution. From February 1999 to October 2010, 49 patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction were assigned into two groups. 25 patients underwent open surgical pyeloplasty (period 1999 - 2010) and 24 underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty (period 2004 - 2010). 25 patients undergoing open pyeloplasty had a retroperitoneal flank approach. Of the 24 laparoscopic cases 18 had a transperitoneal retrocolic access, 1 had a transperitoneal transmesocolic access and 5 had a retroperitoneal access. In all 49 cases an Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty was used. We retrospectively compared the operative time, hospital stay, perioperative complications and follow-up of the two groups. Clinical symptoms were assessed before and after surgery, subjectively. Patients dermographic data were similar between the two groups with mean age of 42 years (range 6 - 78) and with a male/female ratio of 1 : 1. 45. A <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> could be identified in 37. 5 % (9 / 24) with laparoscopy vs. 32 % (8 / 25) in open surgery. Compared with open procedures, laparoscopic procedures were associated with a longer mean operating time (274 vs 143 min), a shorter mean hospital stay (9. 9 vs 15. 8 day) and the perioperative complication rates were 16. 7 % for laparoscopic pyeloplasties and 20 % for open pyeloplasties. The success rates were 90. 5 % for laparoscopy and 90. 9 % for open surgery. Average follow-up was 40. 9 month for the laparoscopic group and 72. 3 month for the open group. Failed procedures showed no improvement in loin pain or obstruction. The efficacy (in term of success rate and perioperative complications) of laparoscopic pyeloplasty is comparable to that of open pyeloplasty, with shorter mean hospital stay and better cosmetic results. These findings may suggest, that the laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty has the potential to replace open surgery and may be considered the first option for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in expert hands...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction Horseshoe kidney {{occurs in}} 1 per 400 - 800 live births {{and are more}} {{frequently}} observed in males (M:F 2 : 1). Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is commonly associated with horseshoe kidneys. The variable blood supply, presence of the isthmus and high insertion of the ureter contribute to this problem. Case report An asymptomatic 6 year-old boy presented with antenatal hydronephrosis. Ultrasonography and CT scan demonstrated left UPJO associated with a horseshoe kidney. DMSA showed 33 % of function on the left side. DTPA showed a flat curve and lack of washout. A left dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed after identification of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> and abnormal implantation of the ureter. After one year, the child is asymptomatic. DTPA demonstrated a good washout curve. Results Our cohort consisted of six patients, five males and one female, {{with a mean age}} of 6 years (range 6 m- 17 years) and a mean follow-up of 3 years. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was more common on the left side. Symptoms appeared only in 34 % of the cases. Mean operative time was 198 minutes (range 120 - 270 minutes). <b>Crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> were common (observed in 50 % patients). High implantation of ureter was seen in 67 % patients and intrinsic obstruction in 83 %. Surgical difficulties were found in two cases. Hospital stay was 4. 3 days (3 to 6 days), with only one patient having a mild complication (pyelonephritis). All cases had clinical and radiologic improvement.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of open pyeloplasty (OP), laparoscopy-assisted extracorporeal (LEXP), and robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) for ureteropelvic junction obstruction in pediatric patients. We retrospectively reviewed the age-matched cohort of 30 children who underwent OP, 30 who underwent LEXP, and 10 who underwent RALP at a single institution, from 1996 to 2014. Pre- and post-operative variables including success rate were compared among surgical groups. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 120. 2 months, the Society for Fetal Urology grade was 3. 6, the anteroposterior diameter was 3. 1 cm, and the renal relative function was 44. 0 %. The distribution of laterality, mean body mass index, and preoperative anteroposterior pelvic diameter on ultrasound did not differ among groups. The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the RALP group (3. 2 days) than in the OP (6. 6 days) and LEXP (5. 8 days) groups (p< 0. 001). The duration of analgesics use was shorter in the RALP group (1. 1 days) than in the other groups (p< 0. 001). During the mean follow-up period of 49. 0, 20. 1, and 16. 6 months, the success rate was 96. 7 %, 89. 7 %, and 100 % in the OP, LEXP, and RALP groups, respectively, although this difference was not statistically different (p = 0. 499). In multivariate regression analysis, the presence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> was the only factor that decreased the success rate (hazard ratio: 46. 09, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 41 - 879. 6, p = 0. 011). Patients who undergo RALP have a reduced hospital stay and lower use of pain medication; however, there is no difference in the success rates for OP, LP, and RALP surgeries. The presence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> is a negative prognostic indicator for surgical outcome regardless of the surgical method...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Technological {{advances}} {{have increased the}} application of the endoscopic management of upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Materials and Methods: Published, peer-reviewed articles on endoscopic treatment of upper tract TCC and UPJO were identified using the MEDLINE database. Results: Although nephroureterectomy remains the gold standard for upper tract TCC treatment, low-grade, low-stage and small tumors, especially in patients with solitary kidneys or poor renal function can be managed with encouraging success rates, despite the considerable recurrence rate. Endoscopic alternatives to pyeloplasty for UPJO can be used especially in cases with absence of <b>crossing</b> <b>vessels,</b> stricture length less than 1. 5 cm, severe hydronephrosis and renal function less than 30 %.

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2016 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Türkiye coğrafi konumu ile Asya ve Avrupa kıtaları arasında stratejik bir öneme sahiptir. Bu iki kıtayı birbirinden ayıran iki önemli boğazdan biri olan İstanbul Boğazı’nda; seyir emniyeti açısından doğal yapısından kaynaklı sahip olduğu zorlukları bir yana gemi sayıları ve kapasitelerindeki artış ile bazı düzenlemeler yapılmasına ve önlemler alınmasına rağmen kaza riski günden güne artmaktadır. Türkiye ekonomisinin kalbi sayılan ve resmi verilere göre yaklaşık 15 milyon insanın yaşadığı bir metropol olan İstanbul, stratejik konumu, sahip olduğu doğal güzellikleri, tarihi ve kültürel değerleri ile dünyadaki sayılı şehirlerdendir. Önemi tartışılmaz olan bu şehir, İstanbul Boğazı’ndan geçen gemiler yüzünden büyük tehlikelerle karşı karşıyadır. Çeşitli tipteki bu gemilerin boğaz geçişleri sırasında karışabileceği kazalar telafi edilemez felaketlere sebep olabilir. Bu sebeple geçmişte yaşanan olaylardan ders çıkarılması ve gelecekte kazaya sebep olabilecek risklerin iyi tespit edilmesi ve değerlendirilmesi, olabilecek kazaları önlemek üzere düzenlemeler yapılması gerekmektedir. Mevcut literatür incelendiğinde İstanbul Boğazı ile ilgili kaza analiz çalışmaları, risk analiz modelleme çalışmaları ve trafik düzeni ile ilgili çeşitli çalışmalara rastlamak mümkündür. Bu çalışma ile İstanbul Boğazı’ndaki gemi trafiği seyir emniyetinde riskler oluşturduğu değerlendirilen balıkçı gemileri ve tekneleri hakkında araştırmalar yapılmış ilgili ulusal mevzuatın ve düzenlemelerin yeterliliği incelenmiştir. Çalışmanın içeriğinde İstanbul Boğazının doğal yapısı ile ilgili bilgilere, İstanbul Boğazı’nda manevra, trafik çevresi ve deniz trafiği ile ilgili istatistiklere, İstanbul Boğazı, gemiler ve gemi geçişleri ile ilgili ulusal ve uluslar arası mevzuatın ilgili bölümlerine, su ürünleri ve balıkçılık ile ilgili genel bilgilere ve mevzuatın içeriğine yer verilmiştir. Bahse konu balıkçı gemileri ve tekneleri hakkında İstanbul Boğazı’nda görev yapan Gemi Trafik Hizmetleri personelinin, Sahil Güvenlik Komutanlığı personelinin, Kıyı Emniyeti Genel Müdürlüğü personelinin, kılavuz kaptanların görüşlerine, Bulanık Analitik Hiyerarşik Proses (Fuzzy-Ahp) yöntemi ile hazırlanan anketlerle başvurulmuştur. Son bölümde İstanbul Boğazı paydaşlarına uygulanan anketlerden edinilen verilerin analizi yapılmış, İstanbul Boğazı’ndaki balıkçı teknelerinin durumu, hangi bölgelerde ne kadar risk oluşturduğu belirlenerek sorunu giderebilecek çözümler üretilmesi hedeflenmiş, değerlendirmeler ve önerilerde bulunulmuştur. The Strait of Istanbul is 17 nmi long, average width is 1, 5 nmi {{and minimum}} width is 698 meter. Its {{one of the}} most {{critical}} passage in the world for vessels with its sharp turns, headlands and complex-strong currents which reach 5 knots in some areas. Situated in between the continents of Asia and Europe, Turkey has a strategically important location. In addition to the natural difficulties regarding navigational safety arising from its shape, at the Bosphorus, one of the two straits separating these continents, there is an increasing risk of accidents in spite of the regulations and precautions imposed regarding the number and capacity of ships. In time of peace, merchant vessels and warships shall enjoy complete freedom of transit and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag and with any kind of cargo, without any formalities since 1936. Recently, there are about 150 vessels per day and 50. 000 annually transiting the Strait while there were transiting 4500 vessels in 1936. In addıtıon to this there are 2500 local traffic vessels navigate daily between Asia and Europe continents[3]. The Turkish Straits passage regime is regulated under the Montreux Convention of 1936. Relating to the regime of the Turkish Straits establishes freedom of passage and navigation. Turkey has safety and envirometal protection interests in Turkish Straits. In the year of 1998 “Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits” approved. The purpose of Vessel Traffic Regulations is to ensure safety of navigation, safety of life, property and marine environment by improving the safety of vessel traffic in the Straits. According to this regulation new traffic separation schemes have been approved by IMO and were adopted. Even though it is not possible to totally eliminate all the risks despite the restrictions and bans in the legislation concerning the ships using İstanbul strait, the regulations implemented within the Turkish waters improve the safety of maneuver, navigation, life and property. Below are the regulations regarding the situation of the fishing boats which are thought to have negative impacts on navigational safety in light of the research consulted during this study. Istanbul, a metropolis considered to be the heart of Turkey’s economy and home to approximately 15 million people according to official data, is a unique city considering its strategical location, history and culture. Yet, this unique city also faces considerable dangers because of the ships crossing the Bosphorus. The potential accidents that may occur during the transit of the ships which vary in size and types may result in irrecoverable disasters. Thus, it is vital to do a risk study based on past accidents and to introduce necessary regulations to avoid possible accidents. It is possible to find studies on accident analyses, risk analysis modeling and traffic regulation of the Bosphorus within the existing literature. When the results of the accidents which occur due to reasons such as the transiting of ships, navigating difficulties of the strait, busy local traffic of the ships are considered, it is obvious that some measures are needed to be taken to avoid any risks which can result in an accident. In this context, it is of significance importance to pinpoint the possible risk factors, to present possible solution ideas and to implement future projects. While passing through narrow canals, it is almost impossible for big tonnage and tramp vessels to maneuver or stop quickly. Considering that its usually one or two persons hunting on the fishing vessels, in the case of a possible breakdown such as a simple engine out, it is possible to cross into the way of a transiting vessel and cause an accident. Such accidents have occurred before. This study investigates the fishing vessels which are considered to be potential risks to the vessel traffic and navigational safety of Bosphorus, as well as the adequacy of the national legislation and regulations on the subject. The content of the study includes information about the natural structure of the Bosphorus, statistics on marine traffic and maneuver, the relevant parts of the national and international legislation on ships and transits, general information on fishing and fisheries. In this study, considering the maneuver and the traffic environment in Strait, the ordinance about the fishing boats-which are assessed to have negative impact on navigational safety-is searched. There are not found any study about this topic in literature. In Istanbul region there are 46 fishing port and total number of fishing vessels are 4. 000 [28]. Its not possible to determine statistics datas of private boats which conduct amateur piscary activities in Bosphorus. This sudy shows its necessity because of there is no any studies about fishery activities in Bosphorus in literature, even though it has heavy piscary activities. The perceptions of crew of Vessel Traffic Services, Coast Guard, Shore Safety Administration and the Strait Pilots show that fishing vessels occupy traffic separation schemes and there are complaints and informing to Coast Guard Command daily basis who has authority to prevent them and fine them. Also its easy to observe the marine traffic and consider what is going wrong in the Bosphorus during the day. Especially big size merchant ships use ship’s whistle accourding to COLREG that which is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Considering the ship accidents in the Bosphorus there is not much fishing vessel involved such kind catastrophic accidents. But rates of near miss events are high. The maters of transit ships are under high stress already because of natural diffuculties and often maneuvering. In addition to this criterias small vessels which are occuping the traffic seperation both distractor them and make them more streessed. Considering the maneuver and traffic environment in Istanbul Strait, it was not possible to display the dense fishing areas of boats of less than 15 meters fishing vessels in electronic charts-which are considered to have a negative effect on navigation safety-because they are not obliged to carry AIS equipment. For determining the movements and the effects of fishing boats in Strait; the crews of the Vessel Traffic Services, Coast Guard, Shore Safety Administration and the Strait Pilots for displaying what kind of risks occurs in which areas. Aim of questionnaires which are prepared with Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process method (Fuzzy AHP) for evaluating the perceptions of these crews. The Turkish Straits play an important role in World Trade. The statu of law for Istanbul Strait and the marine traffic problems in the area are described briefly in the beginning of the study. Aim of this study is to point out general marine traffic and the navigational risks especially occur from fishing vessels in the area by different stakeholders who use the Strait for various reasons. Considerations of different participants were utilized for this study. 5 participants of each; Fishers, Pilots, Shore Safety Administration, Coast Guard and the VTS crew of 5 groups were selected non-randomly as stakeholders and questionnaires adopted for FAHP are applied to participants in face-to-face interviews. Each group was asked for 4 questions. The high risk accident areas in İstanbul Strait and accident risk factors for navigation safety were selected from literature review; which constitutes the main frame of the study. The last chapter includes an analysis of the data gathered by the surveys conducted with the shareholders of the Bosphorus, as well as an evaluation of the risk the fishing ships and boats pose, and potential solution proposals. According to the 9 th article of International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG), a fishing boat is not to hinder the passage of a vessel passing through a narrow canal or a gateway. The regulations concerning the passage regime on Turkish straits were made according to the 10 th article of COLREG. As per article 9, within the traffic separation scheme, a vessel is not to use the inner traffic lane as long as it can safely use the traffic lane allocated within the traffic separation scheme. In addition, vessels smaller than 20 meters in length, sailing ships and fishing boats can use the inner traffic lane[9]. According to this article, fishing boats or individuals occupied with hunting can use the inner traffic lanes. However, as many small boat owners are not aware of these borders, it is common to intrude into the traffic separation scheme lanes in practice. As per article 10 of COLREG, (e) A vessel other than a <b>crossing</b> <b>vessel</b> or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except: in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger; to engage in fishing within a separation zone. According to Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits Convention 2 nd Chapter, 3 th article, the borders of the traffic separation scheme is defined according to the this article that states “Trafifc seperation scheme is designed according to the 10 th article of COLREG which is approved by IMO. ” According to the 4 th chapter, 30 th article of Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits Convention, “It is forbidden to sail with a sailing ship, to shovel, to swim and to hunt within the traffic separation scheme in Turkish straits. Only the sport events such as sailing ships, shoveling and swimming races are subject to permission. ” In line with this article, the vessels which hunt and sail within the traffic separation scheme are reported to the port authorities. The articles mentioned above are the implementations imposed with the aim to avoid possible risks. However, it is observed that despite these regulations, hunting activities within the traffic seperation scheme lines still continue. The details about the analyses carried out are given in chapter. Briefly; it was observed that the maneuver and traffic environmental related risk factors in İstanbul Strait were changing regionally, the weight of some regions was heavier and the stakeholders have almost the same consensus on this subject. The “Local Traffic” criteria among the accident risk factors in the Strait and the “fishing boats” criteria among the risk factors in local traffic were highlighted by the results of the questionnaires applied. We can also see that the fishing boats were causing problems in almost all areas among coasts which are non-parallel and across the Strait, in southern entry-exit region, especially in “Sarayburnu-Haydarpaşa” they were invading the traffic separation line together with dense local traffic and in “Kandilli-Bebek Region” they were causing extra stress on traffic and increasing the possible accident risks, where is the narrowest area in the Strait and has the strongest current rates, due to its natural features. The result of the questionnaires gathered from stakeholders also support and accepts the hypothesis of “fishing boats cause dangerous conditions” for navigational safety in Strait. It is important to follow the requirements of the era, the change and development in World and prepare projects for future. Considering the point of sea areas, there are important differences between the transiting ship numbers of 1936 and today, given as an example in relevant chapter. From this example, there are many important subjects to take into account for future. As the core of the study, the risks and the consequences from fishing activities in İstanbul Strait are clearly described in relevant chapters. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Increasing experience in laparoscopic techniques allows proper treatment of such anomalies. However, its feasibility in difficult cases with altered kidney anatomy such as that of duplicated renal pelvis still needs to be addressed. Case presentation We present a case of a 22 -year-old white Caucasian female patient with ureteropelvic junction obstruction of the lower ureter of a completely duplicated system that was managed with laparoscopic pyeloplasty. <b>Crossing</b> <b>vessels</b> were identified and transposed. The procedure was carried out successfully and the patient's symptoms subsided. Follow-up studies demonstrated complete resolution of the obstruction.
