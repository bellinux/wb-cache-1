5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the {{measurement}} of the positions of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects.</b> Historically, accurate knowledge of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18th century, Charles Messier {{compiled}} a catalog containing the 109 brightest <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often {{consists of a}} system of horoscopes purporting to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> {{at the time of their}} birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
50|$|Traditional sextants have a half-horizon mirror, which {{divides the}} field of view in two. On one side, there is a view of the horizon; on the other side, a view of the <b>celestial</b> <b>object.</b> The {{advantage}} of this type is that both the horizon and <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> are bright and as clear as possible. This is superior at night and in haze, when the horizon can be difficult to see. However, one has to sweep the <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> to ensure that the lowest limb of the <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> touches the horizon.|$|R
50|$|The Moon was {{the first}} {{celestial}} body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions {{of being the first}} remote <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> ever to be visited by humans.|$|R

5|$|The episode's title {{refers to}} an astronomical {{alignment}} of three <b>celestial</b> <b>objects,</b> usually the sun, the Earth, and a moon or planet. Mulder and Scully's behavior in the episode was written specifically by Carter to alert the show's audience that Mulder and Scully would not become a romantic partnership. In addition, the episode contained various fan in-jokes, such as Scully getting upset because Mulder is always the driver, which was inspired by nitpicking from fans.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{constructed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments {{are part of the}} Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> such as planets as it travels through space.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
50|$|The Moon is Earth's largest natural {{satellite}} and the nearest major <b>celestial</b> <b>object.</b> Observing the Moon {{can be accomplished}} by using a variety of instruments ranging from the naked eye to large telescopes. For most people, the Moon is the only <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> upon which surface features can be discerned with the naked eye.|$|R

50|$|In spherical astronomy, the {{parallactic angle}} is the angle between the great circle through a <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> and the zenith, and the hour {{circle of the}} object. It is usually denoted q. In the {{triangle}} zenith—object—celestial pole, the parallactic angle will be the position angle of the zenith at the <b>celestial</b> <b>object.</b> Despite its name, this angle is unrelated with parallax. The parallactic angle is zero when the object crosses the meridian.|$|R
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> and {{phenomena}} sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{and high}} tech {{research}} and development operations {{are located in the}} city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and <b>celestial</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E
25|$|Astronomy is the {{scientific}} study of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> (such as stars, planets, comets, and galaxies) and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere (such as the cosmic background radiation). It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects,</b> as well as the formation and development of the universe.|$|E

25|$|Early {{cultures}} identified <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> with {{gods and}} spirits. They related these objects (and their movements) to phenomena such as rain, drought, seasons, and tides. It is generally {{believed that the}} first astronomers were priests, and that they understood <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> and events to be manifestations of the divine, hence early astronomy's connection {{to what is now}} called astrology. Ancient structures with possibly astronomical alignments (such as Stonehenge) probably fulfilled astronomical, religious, and social functions.|$|E

50|$|A sextant {{does not}} require a {{completely}} steady aim, because it measures a relative angle. For example, when a sextant is used on a moving ship, the image of both horizon and <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> will move around in the field of view. However, the relative position of the two images will remain steady, {{and as long as the}} user can determine when the <b>celestial</b> <b>object</b> touches the horizon the accuracy of the measurement will remain high compared to the magnitude of the movement.|$|R
50|$|In May 2008, two new exoplanets of Jupiter size, COROT-4b and COROT-5b, {{as well as}} {{an unknown}} massive <b>celestial</b> <b>object,</b> COROT-3b, were {{announced}} by ESA.|$|R

25|$|As X-ray {{detectors}} {{have become}} more sensitive, they have observed that some planets and other normally X-ray non-luminescent <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> under certain conditions emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Many insects use the {{ultraviolet}} wavelength emissions from <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> as references for flight navigation. A local ultraviolet emitter will normally disrupt the navigation process and will eventually attract the flying insect.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the {{sensitivity}} of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating <b>celestial</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{celestial}} {{region was}} made up of the fifth element, aether, which was unchanging and moved naturally with uniform circular motion. In the Aristotelian tradition, astronomical theories sought to explain the observed irregular motion of <b>celestial</b> <b>objects</b> through the combined effects of multiple uniform circular motions.|$|E
25|$|A {{gravitational}} slingshot {{can carry}} a space probe onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass.
