2500|$|While {{in theory}} the LMP {{concepts}} are useful and not evidently subject to manipulation, in practice system operators have substantial discretion over LMP results through {{the ability to}} classify units as running in [...] "out-of-merit dispatch", which are thereby excluded from the LMP calculation. In most systems, units that are dispatched to provide reactive power to support transmission grids are declared to be [...] "out-of-merit" [...] (even though these are typically the same units that are located in constrained areas and would otherwise result in scarcity signals). System operators also normally bring units online to hold as [...] "spinning-reserve" [...] to protect against sudden outages or unexpectedly rapid ramps in demand, and declare them [...] "out-of-merit". The result is often a substantial reduction in <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> {{at a time when}} increasing demand would otherwise result in escalating prices.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} market {{clearing}} {{in an economy}} is that of finding prices such that supply meets demand. In this work, we propose a kernel method to compute nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> for instances where linear prices do not suffice. We first present a procedure that, given a sample of values and costs {{for a set of}} bundles, implicitly computes nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> by solving an appropriately formulated quadratic program. We then use this as a subroutine in an elicitation procedure that queries demand and supply incrementally over rounds, only as much as needed to reach <b>clearing</b> <b>prices.</b> An empirical evaluation demonstrates that, with a proper choice of kernel function, the method is able to find sparse nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> with much less than full revelation of values and costs. When the kernel function is not suitable to clear the market, the method can be tuned to achieve approximate clearing. ...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} from the New York ISO shows that the <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> for point-to-point congestion revenue rights, also known as financial transmission rights (FTRs), resulting from centralized auctions conducted by Independent System Operators differ significantly and systematically from the realized congestion revenues that determine the accrued payoffs of these rights. The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we prove that quantity limits on the FTR bids may cause the auction <b>clearing</b> <b>prices</b> to differ from the bid prices. This phenomenon which {{is inherent in the}} theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to clear the auction, is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs. Secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence.

40|$|We {{cast the}} problem of {{combinatorial}} auction design in a Bayesian framework in order to incorporate prior information into the auction process and minimize the number of rounds to convergence.

An empirical evaluation over a range of valuation domains demonstrates that our Bayesian auction mechanism is highly competitive against the combinatorial clock auction in terms of rounds to convergence, even under the most favorable choices of price increment for this baseline.

50|$|The {{software}} {{creates an}} agent-based {{model for a}} particular stock, consisting of a population of trader agents and a virtual market. Each agent represents a virtual trader/investor and has its own trading rule and funds. The model is then evolved step by step in the following way: At every step a new (historical) real market price is imported. All agents evaluate their trading rule and place orders on the virtual market. The virtual market then determines the <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> and executes all matching orders. The <b>clearing</b> <b>price</b> is taken as the forecast for the next step real market price. (So the virtual market serves as a one-step-ahead prediction market for the real market). This process is repeated for every new received real market price. Meanwhile, the trading rules evolve through a special adaptive form of genetic programming. The forecasts are thus based {{on the behavior of}} the entire market instead of only on the best performing trading rule. This intends to increase the robustness of the model and its ability to adapt to changing market circumstances.|$|E

40|$|In a {{competitive}} electricity market with substantial involvement of renewable electricity, maximizing profits by optimizing bidding strategies {{is crucial to}} different power producers including conventional power plants and renewable ones. This paper proposes a game-theoretic bidding optimization method based on bi-level programming, where power producers are at the upper level and utility companies are at the lower level. The competition among the multiple power producers is formulated as a non-cooperative game in which bidding curves are their strategies, while uniform <b>clearing</b> <b>pricing</b> is considered for utility companies represented by an independent system operator. Consequently, based on the formulated game model, the bidding strategies for power producers are optimized for the day-ahead market and the intraday market with considering the properties of renewable energy; and the <b>clearing</b> <b>pricing</b> for the utility companies, {{with respect to the}} power quantity from different power producers, is optimized simultaneously. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is provided to search the solution of the generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, simulation results were performed and discussed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed non-cooperative game-based bi-level optimization approach...|$|R
