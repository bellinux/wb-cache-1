5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of more precise cost {{information}} on contract renegotiations between supply-chain parties. Specifically, we experimentally investigate the benefits of activity-based costing (ABC) information to address common supply chain inefficiencies that are <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> buyer or the seller, but have the same underlying costs. Results suggest that the impact of more precise cost information depends crucially on <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of <b>the</b> inefficiency that parties need to address during the negotiation. ABC information increases the total joint profit in the supply chain. However, ABC information increases the sellerâ€™s perceptions of the fairness of the buyerâ€™s arguments for contract changes only when <b>the</b> buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. The combined effect of ABC information on joint profit and fairness perceptions thus increases the buyerâ€™s profit only when buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. status: publishe...|$|R
