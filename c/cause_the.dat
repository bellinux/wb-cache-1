5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of more precise cost {{information}} on contract renegotiations between supply-chain parties. Specifically, we experimentally investigate the benefits of activity-based costing (ABC) information to address common supply chain inefficiencies that are <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> buyer or the seller, but have the same underlying costs. Results suggest that the impact of more precise cost information depends crucially on <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of <b>the</b> inefficiency that parties need to address during the negotiation. ABC information increases the total joint profit in the supply chain. However, ABC information increases the seller’s perceptions of the fairness of the buyer’s arguments for contract changes only when <b>the</b> buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. The combined effect of ABC information on joint profit and fairness perceptions thus increases the buyer’s profit only when buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. status: publishe...|$|R
