Cooked sampling was done at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months frozen storage. The breast and thigh from the left side were used for taste panel evaluations of appearance, tenderness, juiciness and flavor. Right portions were used for objective tenderness and extractable fluids. A second lot of birds of ten each for two intermediary curing brines of 20 % and 15 % with cover brines of 15 % and 12 % respectfully were similarly evaluated. Smoked pheasant after 9 months frozen storage was still acceptable. Curing brine of 20 % with 15 % <b>cover</b> <b>brine</b> was more acceptable to the taste panel...|$|E
40|$|Physical, structral, and {{electromagnetic}} {{properties and}} interrelating processes in sea ice {{are used to}} develop a composite model for polarimetric backscattering signatures of sea ice. Physical properties of sea ice constituents such as ice, brine, air, and salt are presented {{in terms of their}} effects on electromagnetic wave interactions. Sea ice structure and geometry of scatterers are related to wave propagation, attenuation, and scattering. Temperature and salinity, which are determining factors for the thermodynamic phase distribution in sea ice, are consistently used to derive both effective permittivities and polarimetric scattering coefficients. Polarmetric signatures of sea ice depend on crystal sizes and brine volumes, which are affected by ice growth rates. Desalination by brine expulsion, drainage, or other mechanisms modifies wave penetration and scattering. Sea ice signatures are further complicated by surface conditions such as rough interfaces, hummocks, snow <b>cover,</b> <b>brine</b> skim, or slush layer. Based on the same set of geophysical parameters characterizing sea ice, a composite model is developed to calculate effective permittivities and backscattering covariance matrices at microwave frequencies to interpretation of sea ice polarimetric signatures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpoilage of low-acid {{canned food}} during {{prolonged}} storage at high temperatures {{is caused by}} heat resistant thermophilic spores of strict or facultative bacteria. Here, we performed a bacterial survey over two consecutive years on the processing line of a French company manufacturing canned mixed green peas and carrots. In total, 341 samples were collected, including raw vegetables, green peas and carrots at different steps of processing, <b>cover</b> <b>brine,</b> and process environment samples. Thermophilic and highly-heat-resistant thermophilic spores growing anaerobically were counted. During vegetable preparation, anaerobic spore counts were significantly decreased, and tended to remain unchanged further downstream in the process. Large variation of spore levels in products immediately before the sterilization process {{could be explained by}} occasionally high spore levels on surfaces and in debris of vegetable combined with long residence times in conditions suitable for growth and sporulation. Vegetable processing was also associated with an increase in the prevalence of highly-heat-resistant species, probably due to cross-contamination of peas via blanching water. Geobacillus stearothermophilus M 13 -PCR genotypic profiling on 112 isolates determined 23 profile-types and confirmed process-driven cross-contamination. Taken together, these findings clarify the scheme of contamination pathway by thermophilic spore-forming bacteria in a vegetable cannery...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Changes in the {{physicochemical}} and {{sensory characteristics}} of commercial plain (whole) and pitted ripe olives of the Gordal, Manzanilla, Hojiblanca and Cacereña cultivars were studied during {{a three-year period}} in conditions that mimicking the storage of such products in real life. No spoilage was developed during this period. Throughout the shelf-life, the pH of the <b>cover</b> <b>brines</b> had a marked valley decrease {{at the beginning of}} storage followed by a progressive further decline, the surface colour (measured instrumentally) and firmness of the olives followed a first-order kinetic decay, mitigated according to the iron and calcium contents. Also, a slight browning of the <b>cover</b> <b>brines</b> {{at the beginning of the}} storage was observed. No significant changes in most of the sensory characteristics were observed by the panel test during shelf-life except for a limited change in olive surface colour. At the end of the shelf-life, most of the samples were classified as 'extra' category according to the IOC sensory evaluation method and only plain Gordal presentation was classified as 'first, choice or select'. © 2013 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the circulation of}} Tailings Lake, located 220 km north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. From Jul 2004 to Sep 2007, temperature and conductivity profiles were collected together with data from three moored temperature chains and a meteorological station. The salt content of the lake was elevated (salinity 1 g L 21) relative to surrounding natural waters (, 0. 1 g L 21). Winter ice cover included 60 – 80 cm of transparent ‘‘black’ ’ ice, which excluded up to 99 % of the salt from the water as the ice formed. During winter, the salt excluded from the ice was mixed throughout the water column under the ice. In spring, ice melt and snow runoff resulted in a freshwater cap; the density contrast between this fresh epilimnion and the more saline hypolimnion was sufficient to inhibit spring turnover. In summer, the epilimnion was deepened by storms, mixing anoxic water from the hypolimnion into the surface layer. Because spring turnover was suppressed, oxygen replenishment of the hypolimnion occurred only in fall. Although Tailings Lake has been subject to numerous anthropogenic changes, similar effects can be expected in other natural and manmade water bodies with elevated salinity and significant ice <b>cover.</b> <b>Brine</b> rejection from sea ice and its importance to ocean circulation has long been appreciated (Carmack 1990).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of electro-coagulation and ozonation technologies for the partial depuration of ferrous solutions deriving from the color fixation stage of ripe olive processing. Different operational conditions were investigated along with the possibilities of combining the two techniques sequentially. In electro-coagulation the best depuration conditions were obtained using a current density of 25 mA cm- 2 for 40 min; COD elimination reached 30 %, the phenols and color of the solutions were also considerably reduced and the dissolved Fe was completely removed. On the contrary, the microbial population mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, hardly decreased. The application of ozonation also reduced the total phenols, color and COD of solutions, but did not decrease the iron concentration. However, it considerably affected the microbial population in a higher proportion than electro-coagulation. In light of the results obtained, the best working conditions consist of applying 40 min electro-coagulation with aluminum in the anode and iron in the cathode at 25 mA cm- 2 current density, followed by the storage of a partially purified solution bubbling ozone to reduce the microorganism population and even eliminate it completely when 6 g O 3 L- 1 were added.

40|$|Sea ice is {{a dynamic}} {{biogeochemical}} reactor and a double interface actively interacting with both the atmosphere and the ocean. However, proper understanding of its annual impact on exchanges, and therefore potentially on the climate, notably suffer from the paucity of autumnal and winter data sets. Here we present the results of physical and biogeochemical investigations on winter Antarctic pack ice in the Weddell Sea (R. V. Polarstern AWECS cruise, June-August 2013) which are compared with those from two similar studies conducted {{in the area in}} 1986 and 1992. The winter 2013 was characterized by a warm sea ice cover due to the combined effects of deep snow and frequent warm cyclones events penetrating southward from the open Southern Ocean. These conditions were favorable to high ice permeability and cyclic events of brine movements within the sea ice <b>cover</b> (<b>brine</b> tubes), favoring relatively high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. We discuss the timing of this algal activity showing that arguments can be presented in favor of continued activity during the winter due to the specific physical conditions. Large-scale sea ice model simulations also suggest a context of increasingly deep snow, warm ice, and large brine fractions across the three observational years, {{despite the fact that the}} model is forced with a snowfall climatology. This lends support to the claim that more severe Antarctic sea ice conditions, characterized by a longer ice season, thicker, and more concentrated ice are sufficient to increase the snow depth and, somehow counterintuitively, to warm the ice...|$|E
50|$|This plant siphons off brine {{from the}} nearby Bonneville Salt Flats during the winter when the bed is <b>covered</b> in <b>brine.</b> This {{has led to the}} {{disappearance}} of the flats, that is the thick salt layer that normally covers the area. This is destroying its utility as a popular race bed and surface for setting ground speed records, where long, uniform flat surfaces are required. This has led to an outcry from the fans who use it. In an effort to reverse this loss, Intrepid has voluntarily been pumping processed brine back to the flats. Activists are confident this will reverse the damage, but are wary because the replenishment is voluntary and are worried what may happen if ownership of the mine changes hands, so are working on legislation to make the brine replenishment mandatory.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlmost all Red Sea deeps contain metal-rich sediments <b>covered</b> by <b>brine</b> pools. It is {{generally}} agreed that these metal-rich deposits precipitated from overlying metal-rich brines that originated from migrating hydrothermal fluids. No brine pool has ever been reported in Thetis Deep, inciting us to evaluate if such a brine layer ever occurred in the deep during the past. In order to address that questioning, a study combining mineralogical, geochemical (major-, minor-, rare-earth elements) and isotopic (Sr. Nd. Pb) approaches was completed on cored sediments and extracted interstitial waters from {{inside and outside the}} deep.;The sediments have an overall hydrothermal origin, as shown by the REE concentrations and patterns, metal contents, and Pb-Nd isotopic data, all pointing to a mantle signature. The intensity of the hydrothermal activity varied with time in the deep; the most intense episode resulting in an almost pure Fe-oxi-hydroxide layer. Varied chemical arguments, especially the Zr and REE data of the sediments, favor the fact that the whole sedimentation in Thetis Deep occurred {{in the absence of a}} stable, salt-rich and mineralized brine pool, and that no brine layer ever existed. This conclusion is supported by the constant Sr isotope composition of the sediment and its interstitial waters that are almost identical to that of the Red Sea seawater. The study also suggests that hydrothermal activity monitored fluid supplies that interacted differently with seawater in the different Red Sea deeps, resulting in an overall formation of metal-rich sediments, but along varied local conditions.

40|$|A multiproxy {{study of}} palaeoceanographic and climatic changes in northernmost Baffin Bay shows that major {{environmental}} changes have occurred since the deglaciation {{of the area}} at about 12 500 cal. yr BP. The interpretation is based on sedimentology, benthic and planktonic foraminifera and their isotopic composition, as well as diatom assemblages in the sedimentary records at two core sites, one located in the deeper central part of northernmost Baffin Bay and one in a separate trough closer to the Greenland coast. A revised chronology for the two records is established {{on the basis of}} 15 previously published AMS 14 C age determinations. A basal diamicton is overlain by laminated, fossil-free sediments. Our data from {{the early part of the}} fossiliferous record (12 300 - 11 300 cal. yr BP), which is also initially laminated, indicate extensive seasonal sea-ice <b>cover</b> and <b>brine</b> release. There is indication of a cooling event between 11 300 and 10 900 cal. yr BP, and maximum Atlantic Water influence occurred between 10 900 and 8200 cal. yr BP (no sediment recovery between 8200 and 7300 cal. yr BP). A gradual, but fluctuating, increase in sea-ice cover is seen after 7300 cal. yr BP. Sea-ice diatoms were particularly abundant in the central part of northernmost Baffin Bay, presumably due to the inflow of Polar waters from the Arctic Ocean, and less sea ice occurred at the near-coastal site, which was under continuous influence of the West Greenland Current. Our data from the deep, central part show a fluctuating degree of upwelling after c. 7300 cal. yr BP, culminating between 4000 and 3050 cal. yr BP. There was a gradual increase in the influence of cold bottom waters from the Arctic Ocean after about 3050 cal. yr BP, when agglutinated foraminifera became abundant. A superimposed short-term change in the sea-surface proxies is correlated with the Little Ice Age cooling...|$|R
30|$|With {{the notable}} {{exceptions}} of Lebedeva and Fogden (2011), Delshad et al. (2006) and Anderson (1987), {{the vast majority}} of the work found in the literature focuses on uniformly wetted systems (e.g., water-wet and oil-wet systems). However, it is generally accepted that most geologic porous media are not uniformly wetted. In addition, crude oil can alter the rock state by adsorbing or depositing polar components, thus resulting in a mixed-wet state of relatively oil-wet subareas where oil makes contact combined with unaltered subareas <b>covered</b> by <b>brine.</b> The term “mixed-wettability” was introduced by Salathiel (1973) to describe systems with large pores that are predominantly oil-wet and smaller ones that are water-wet, and in which the residual oil saturation is much lower than that obtained in uniformly wetted systems. Donaldson et al. (1969) reported that changes in wettability affect water flood behavior. They treated the core samples with various amounts of organochlorosilane to change the wettability of the cores from water-wet to oil-wet. The results showed that less oil was recovered after a water injection as the system became more oil-wet. Moreover, according to Morrow Norman and Geoffrey (2001) an infinite number of possible wetting states exist between the strongly water-wet and the strongly oil-wet, and similarly there are many varied flow behaviors Tiab and Donaldson (2004). Understanding the effect of wettability on fluid recovery requires information pertaining to pore-scale fluid distribution, wetting preferences, and pore geometry Kumar (2008). Multiple pore-level models have been proposed to explain the effect of mixed wettability. Heiba et al. (1983) used network models to study the distribution of oil under mixed-wettability conditions. Raeesi and Piri (2009) used a pore-scale network model to study the effect of wettability and trapping. Radke et al. (1992) developed a pore-level illustration to explain how mixed-wettability forms and how it affects the reservoir rock.|$|R
40|$|Only {{recently}} a strong air-sea signature of δ 13 C, i. e. δ 13 Cas, in modern bottom {{waters of the}} Atlantic sector of the Antarctic Ocean was revealed (Mackensen, 2012). This high southern δ 13 Cas may have been reduced in the Last Glacial Maximum, and parts of an ocean wide deep-water δ 13 CDIC lowering {{may be attributed to}} sea-ice formation with low-δ 13 Cas brine rejection and diminished air-sea gas exchange in the southern ocean. Low benthic δ 13 C values from the Nordic seas in cold stadials of the last glaciation have been attributed to brine formation, but {{little is known about the}} carbon isotopic composition of Arctic Ocean brines and deep-water masses. Here I show that today dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of bottom water in the deep Arctic Ocean is 13 C enriched with mean δ 13 CDIC values of 1. 2 ‰, whereas bottom waters bathing most of the continental margins with mean δ 13 CDIC values of about 0. 8 ‰. This difference is also recorded in Recent epibenthic foraminiferal δ 13 C from the deep Arctic versus Greenland and Svalbard continental margins. It is in contrast, however, to the continental slope of the Laptev and East Siberian seas, where epibenthic δ 13 C is as high as in the deep basins. I conclude that (i) most of the shelves contributing to Arctic bottom water by brine rejection produce high-δ 13 Cas brine, and (ii) a strong δ 13 Cas signal from brine formation in polynyas today is masked by anthropogenically lowered atmospheric δ 13 CCO 2. I then hypothesize that during stadials, when most of the Arctic Ocean was perennially sea-ice <b>covered,</b> less <b>brine</b> was produced, and that this cessation of brine rejection would have lowered bottom-water δ 13 C values in the Arctic Ocean and subsequently in the Nordic seas...|$|R

5000|$|Lake Magadi is a saline, {{alkaline}} lake, approximately 100 {{square kilometers}} in size, that lies in an endorheic basin formed by a graben. The lake {{is an example}} of a [...] "saline pan". The lake water, which is a dense sodium carbonate brine, precipitates vast quantities of the mineral trona (sodium sesquicarbonate). In places, the salt is up to 40 m thick. The lake is recharged mainly by saline hot springs (temperatures up to 86 °C) that discharge into alkaline [...] "lagoons" [...] around the lake margins, there being little surface runoff in this arid region. Most hot springs lie along the northwestern and southern shorelines of the lake. During the rainy season, a thin (less than 1 m) layer of <b>brine</b> <b>covers</b> much of the saline pan, but this evaporates rapidly leaving a vast expanse of white salt that cracks to produce large polygons.

40|$|An {{environmental}} {{scanning electron microscope}} (ESEM) {{was used for the}} first time to obtain well-resolved images, in both temporal and spatial dimensions, of lab-prepared frost flowers (FFs) under evaporation within the chamber temperature range from − 5 to − 18  °C and pressures above 500  Pa. Our scanning shows temperature-dependent NaCl speciation: the brine covering the ice was observed at all conditions, whereas the NaCl crystals were formed at temperatures below − 10  °C as the brine oversaturation was achieved. Finger-like ice structures <b>covered</b> by the <b>brine,</b> with a diameter of several micrometres and length of tens to 100  µm, are exposed to the ambient air. The brine-covered fingers are highly flexible and cohesive. The exposure of the liquid brine on the micrometric fingers indicates a significant increase in the brine surface area compared to that of the flat ice surface at high temperatures; the NaCl crystals formed can become sites of heterogeneous reactivity at lower temperatures. There is no evidence that, without external forces, salty FFs could automatically fall apart to create a number of sub-particles at the scale of micrometres as the exposed brine fingers seem cohesive and hard to break in the middle. The fingers tend to combine together to form large spheres and then join back to the mother body, eventually forming a large chunk of salt after complete dehydration. The present microscopic observation rationalizes several previously unexplained observations, namely, that FFs are not a direct source of sea-salt aerosols and that saline ice crystals under evaporation could accelerate the heterogeneous reactions of bromine liberation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate the sedimentation under hypersaline and anoxic conditions and the related geochemical processes. Two sediment cores from the anoxic-hypersaline Urania basin (eastern Mediterranean) were studied. Furthermore, sapropels from {{the vicinity of the}} basin were analysed in terms of their early diagenetic alteration and compared to the basin sediments. A major component of the Urania basin sediments is elemental S (6. 5 - 18. 9 wt. %). Dissolved sulfate, which is derived from messinian evaporites, is reduced by bacterial activity to dissolved sulfide. Organic carbon and methane are the main reducing agents. Aqueous sulfide is oxidised to elemental S at the seawater/brine interface and accumulates at the basin floor. Contrasting this, pyrite is only a minor sink for dissolved sulfide (~ 1 wt. % pyrite). Elemental S and pyrite show similar delta 34 S-values between - 2 and - 11 permil. These values differ significantly from values of sedimentary pyrites usually found, e. g. in eastern Mediterranean sapropels (< - 35 permil). The relatively positive delta 34 S-values originate most probably from a special population of (halophile?) microorganisms. About 1 / 3 of the bulk carbonate in the sediments is made up of dolomite. A recently published dolomitisation model (Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997) may explain primary dolomite precipitation in the Urania basin. The form and size of the dolomite crystals as well as the chemical composition of the brine point to dolomite formation within the brine. Dolomite from nearby the Urania basin in sediments which are not <b>covered</b> by <b>brine</b> indicates brine migration to sediments outside the basin. In the deepest part of the Urania basin, fluids and particles are introduced into the basin from deeper sedimentary levels. A layer of a few cms thickness in the sedimentary succession from outside the basin proves that anoxic mud similar to Urania basin sediments extruded outside the basin. Comparison of Urania basin sediments with sapropels, which were equally deposited under anoxic conditions, showed marked differences between these two sediment types. This is due to different material sources and sedimentation processes. The different analysed sapropels showed various states of preservation. The youngest sapropel S- 1 is completely preserved. Opposed to that, sapropel S- 2 is completely oxidised and only identified in the core by Mn- and Ba-distribution. Sapropels S- 5 and S- 6 exhibit different degrees of early diagenetic alterations. Sapropel S- 3 lies within the region of the core which contains dolomite rather than calcite. Migrating brines fuelled sulfate reduction in this sapropel, which led to the complete dissolution of all carbonate in S- 3...|$|R
