50|$|In 2015, Romanuk was {{assigned}} to his first <b>conference</b> <b>final.</b> Since then, he is the number two play-by-play announcer for Rogers' NHL coverage (behind Jim Hughson). However, he did not call a single 2016 NHL <b>conference</b> <b>final</b> game for unknown reasons (Jim Hughson called that year's Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>Final</b> while Bob Cole called that year's Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Final).</b> In 2017, he called his second <b>conference</b> <b>final.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the Saskatchewan defence {{dominated}} the league again with 206 points allowed, {{but could not}} beat Calgary in the Western <b>conference</b> <b>final,</b> or beat Calgary in the Western <b>conference</b> <b>final</b> in 1971. In 1972, the Roughriders beat the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Western <b>conference</b> <b>final,</b> but, despite limiting the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to just 13 points, lost the 60th Grey Cup game because of a weak offence. In the 1973 season, the Roughriders could not get by the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western <b>conference</b> <b>final.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1992–93 season, the Rangers {{accumulated}} 112 points in the 1993–94 season and won their second Presidents' Trophy. With a seven-game victory against the Vancouver Canucks in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, the Rangers ended a 54-year Stanley Cup drought. After reaching the Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> in 1997, the Rangers {{did not return to}} the playoffs until 2006. In the 2013–14 season, the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 20 years, defeating the Canadiens in the Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> in six games before losing to the Los Angeles Kings in the championship series. New York earned its third Presidents' Trophy with a team record 113 points in 2014–15, but was eliminated in the <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> by the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the most recent season, 2016–17, the Rangers reached the playoffs for the seventh straight season, but were defeated by the Ottawa Senators in the second round.|$|E

5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} the referees working this game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} decade, the Rockets rehauled their roster and were again contenders for the NBA title. In the 2014–15 NBA season, led by head coach Kevin McHale and guard James Harden, the Rockets won their first {{division}} title in 21 years, {{and reached the}} Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> {{for the first time}} since 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{specific}} skills, Nash was particularly effective playing the pick and roll, notably with Nowitzki {{when he was}} with the Mavericks and later with the Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion. When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004, he helped the Suns improve from a 29–53 record in 2003–04 to 62–20 in 2004–05, reaching the <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> {{for the first time in}} 11 years, earning him his first MVP award. The next season, he led the Suns into the <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals,</b> despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, Kurt Thomas and Brian Grant); further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring. With Nash operating at the point, between the 2005–06 and 2009–10 seasons, the Suns led the league in field goal percentage.|$|E

5|$|In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 {{and went}} on to win 62 games and their fifth {{straight}} division title. The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals.</b> Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 playoffs, Getzlaf {{tied the}} {{previous}} Ducks {{record for most}} assists in a post-season – which he himself set in 2009 – at 14 when he provided the primary assist on teammate Simon Després' game-winning goal in Game 3 of the Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> against the Chicago Blackhawks on May 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Wade {{averaged}} 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6.0 rebounds while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets. Wade continued his high level of play in the second round by averaging 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards. The Heat's playoff run was stopped by the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions, in 7 games in the Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals.</b> Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> that prevented him from playing in the series' sixth game and limited him in the seventh. The Heat lost the series in the seventh game despite leading three games to two after the fifth game and holding a lead with three minutes remaining in Game 7.|$|E

50|$|In the Wales Conference, the Patrick Division {{champion}} Philadelphia Flyers {{were upset}} by the New York Rangers in the first round. The defending champion Islanders had qualified second in the Patrick Division, and defeated the Washington Capitals in the first round, and defeated the Rangers {{to qualify for the}} <b>Conference</b> <b>Final.</b> In the Adams Division, the first-place Boston Bruins defeated the Quebec Nordiques and the Buffalo Sabres (who swept the Canadiens in their opening round series) to advance to the <b>Conference</b> <b>Final.</b> In the <b>Conference</b> <b>Final,</b> the Islanders defeated Boston in six games to qualify for their fourth consecutive Cup Finals appearance.|$|R
5|$|Looking to {{make good}} on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh {{consecutive}} Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs {{in the first round of}} the Western <b>Conference</b> <b>Finals</b> before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western <b>Conference</b> <b>finals</b> win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award. The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell did return {{alongside}} Slava Voynov in the 2013–14 season.

5|$|On the ice, {{the team}} reached the 2010 playoffs as the eighth seed {{for the second}} year in a row, yet upset the top-seeded Washington Capitals and the then-defending Stanley Cup {{champion}} Pittsburgh Penguins in the first two rounds. The Habs lost the Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>finals</b> to the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell <b>Conference</b> <b>finals.</b> That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the <b>conference</b> <b>finals.</b> From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
