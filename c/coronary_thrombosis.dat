5|$|Ballard's {{release from}} Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she {{received}} a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, {{and was forced to}} formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from <b>coronary</b> <b>thrombosis</b> at the age of 32. At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.|$|E

Clinical Picture: A 30 -year-old lady presented with acute peripartum massive anterior ST segment myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of coronary atherosclerosis {{in patients with}} ischemic heart disease is extensive, and involves at least two major <b>coronary</b> arteries. <b>Thrombosis,</b> occlusion by atheromatous debris and, infrequently, internal hemorrhage may produce final closure of the coronary artery.

40|$|The acute {{coronary}} syndrome due to {{the left}} main <b>coronary</b> artery (LMCA) <b>thrombosis</b> is a clinically rare and catastrophic event.   We describe a young man (smoker, alcoholic, and drug abuser) {{with a history of}} recent surgery and typical chest pain who had non-occlusive LMCA <b>thrombosis</b> in <b>coronary</b> angiography. The <b>thrombosis</b> was successfully treated with two 180 µ/kg intracoronary boluses of eptifibatide, which was continued through an intravenous infusion at 2 µ/kg/min for 48 hours postprocedurally.

Alongside a number of internal parasites, she also had <b>coronary</b> <b>thrombosis</b> and arteriosclerosis, most likely linked to excessive weight gained due to a sedentary lifestyle. A fused spinal disc probably caused her immense pain, which contributed to a decrease in physical activity.

25|$|Russert's {{longtime}} friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic coronary artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was <70 mg/dL) and exercise, {{and that he had}} performed well on a stress test in late April. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of coronary artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an occlusive <b>coronary</b> <b>thrombosis</b> in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque.|$|E
25|$|UA {{may occur}} unpredictably at rest, {{which may be}} a serious {{indicator}} of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or <b>coronary</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.|$|E

40|$|The {{antithrombotic}} {{effect of}} the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, CRL 42796, was examined in canine models of carotid and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>thrombosis.</b> In the carotid artery thrombosis model, occlusion occurred in all control vessels (time to thrombosis 47. 6 ± 8. 9 min). After treatment with low dose CRL 42796 (15 μg kg− 1 loading dose + 0. 31 μg kg− 1 min− 1 i. v.), two of five vessels occluded. Time to thrombosis increased significantly to 155. 2 ± 23. 1 min. When the drug infusion was increased (0. 69 μg kg− 1 min− 1), each of five vessels remained patent. Ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP was examined in platelet rich plasma (PRP) prepared from citrate or heparin anticoagulated blood. CRL 42796 reduced platelet reactivity at low and high doses in PRP from citrate anticoagulated blood. However, in PRP from heparin anticoagulated blood, only the higher infusion dose produced {{a significant reduction in}} ex vivo platelet responses. A combination of oral aspirin (4. 6 mg kg− 1 − 41, − 17 h) and the low infusion dose of CRL 42796 did not produce an additional benefit beyond that provided by CRL 42796 alone. <b>Coronary</b> artery <b>thrombosis</b> was inhibited in four of five vessels treated with the lower infusion dose of CRL 42796 and in five of five vessels treated with the higher infusion. Time to thrombosis increased with both doses (Control, 90. 8 ± 10. 4 min; low dose, 165. 8 ± 14. 2 min; high dose, > 180. 0 ± 0 min). The results indicate that CRL 42796 is an effective in vivo antithrombotic agent against experimentally-induced carotid and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>thrombosis...</b>|$|R
