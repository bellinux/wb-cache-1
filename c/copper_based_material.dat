40|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} {{miniaturization}} in microelectronics, the influence of dimensional constraining effects {{on the strength of}} solder joints becomes increasingly important. Detailed investigations show a strong dependence of tensile strength and ductility on solder geometry. This paper focuses on FEM simulations of the thickness effect of Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder gaps under tensile load. Solder joints and <b>copper</b> <b>base</b> <b>material</b> are simulated with an elasto-plastic material model in the framework of von Mises plasticity. Within the solder material a pronounced triaxiality of stress is observed. In consequence, the von Mises stress inside the solder material is considerably smaller than the longitudinal stress along the tensile axis. This leads to increased tensile strength of thin solder joints. However, the increase of strength also depends on the yield stress of the <b>copper</b> <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> The FEM simulations were compared with experimental results of tensile tests and satisfactory coincidence was found. The remaining deviation between experiment and simulation is explained by pressure dependency of the flow stress. In conclusion, a new pressure dependent plasticity model is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Since ages, {{copper and}} its alloys have found {{extensive}} applications in manufacture of bushes and bearings, heat transfer conductors, high conductivity electrical contactors and so on. However, currently, {{in all these}} applications, {{there is a significant}} enhancement in the service loads, wear resistance, conductivity thus forcing the material researchers to develop a newer class of <b>copper</b> <b>based</b> advanced <b>materials.</b> In this direction, researchers have focused their attention on improving the strength and the tribological properties by reinforcing copper with hard ceramic reinforcements such as Silicon carbide and Titanium carbide.

It is called solid state welding. A rotating hard cylindrical pin is pressed on metals to be welded by friction. In FSW, there are only three process variables to control: rotation speed, travel speed and pressure, all of which are easily controllable. Four rotational speeds were used keeping the feed rate constant. The plunge depth is related directly to the pressure was varied depend on the work material. Analysis was carried by measuring surface roughness (RA), tensile, micro hardness and metallographic tests. At rotational speed of 1925 RPM, aluminum to aluminum welding had given ultimate tensile strength up to 86 percent.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{deals with the}} {{elaboration}} of <b>copper</b> <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> reinforced in surface by particles of second phases through friction stir processing (FSP). Its aim is twofold. First, it consists in elaborating such materials and in characterizing their microstructure. Early attempts towards an optimization of the microstructure lead to investigate the effect of process parameters on the material flow and therefore on the microstructure. Second, mechanical properties of the materials are correlated to the microstructure. Yttria particles with a 4 µm diameter were initially located into two grooves machined at {{the surface of a}} copper plate. They were subsequently incorporated inside the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> by friction stir processing. The microstructure of the oxide dispersion strengthened materials is characterized at various scales by light microscopy, electron probe microanalysis and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Emphasis is given to the analysis of the distribution of th powder particles wich were refined up to a nanometric level by FSP. FSP indeed contributes to the dissociation ot the clusters of primitive powder particles and to their intergranular fracture. The uniformity of the particles distribution was also shown to beenhanced with the number of lap-passes. Despite their low volume fraction, the smallest reinforcements present the highest density. Some hardness and tensile tests performed on as processed samples highlighted the strengthening effect of these finest second phases. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the material flow generated during multipass FSP and to improve the microstructure and properties of the samples, some specimens were elaborated by changing the weld pitch at each lap pass in pure copper. This route demonstrates the effect of eachh pass on the material flow allowing to observe the difference between the number of passes and the number of complete onions observed in transverse cross-sections.

A growing trend to use new copper-based functional materials is recently observed world-wide. Within this group of materials particular attention is drawn to those with ultrafine grain size of a copper matrix. Design/methodology/approach: This study was aimed to investigate mechanical properties and microstructure in strips of age hardenable CuNi 2 Si alloy processed by continuous repetitive corrugation and straightening (CRCS). Tests were performed with quenched (900 °C/ 1 hour/water) or annealed (650 °C / 1 hour) 0. 8 mm thick strips using original die set construction (toothed rolls and plain rolls set) installed in tensile testing machine. The changes of mechanical properties (HV, ultimate tensile strength, 0. 2 yield strength) as well as microstructure evolution versus number of deformation cycles were investigated.

40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a promising}} technology for energy production with inherent capture {{of carbon dioxide}} at minimal energy penalty. In CLC, oxygen is transferred from an air reactor to a fuel reactor {{by means of a}} solid oxygen carrier. Direct contact between air and fuel is avoided, resulting in an undiluted CO 2 exhaust stream. As such, CLC was picked up recently as a high potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. While initial focus was on storage projects, CO 2 is more and more considered as a valuable chemical substance for enhanced oil/gas recovery projects {{as well as for the}} production of chemicals, polymers or building materials. A critical aspect of the CLC technology is the oxygen carrier performance which has a very strong impact on the economic viability. Parameters such as particle size, density, porosity, strength, attrition resistance, reactivity, environmental aspects and cost, define the performance of the oxygen carrier. The first generation oxygen carriers was Ni-based. However, due to cost of nickel and toxicity, a search for Ni-free oxygen carriers was conducted with similar or superior performance in CLC. This lead to the development of Cu-, Fe and Mn-based oxygen carriers, that demonstrate the beneficial oxygen uncoupling effect, with complete fuel conversion as a result. In this contribution it is shown that the industrial spray-drying technique is a very versatile and scalable technique for the fabrication of oxygen carriers.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} microstructure, mechanical properties and deformation behavior of copper microcomposites: Cu- Y 2 O 3, Cu- ZrO 2 and Cu-WC produced by powder metallurgy techniques. Design/methodology/approach: Tests were made with Cu-Y 2 O 3, Cu-ZrO 2 and Cu-WC microcomposites containing up to 2 % of a strengthening phase. The materials were fabricated by powder metallurgy techniques, including milling of powders, followed by their compacting and sintering. The main mechanical properties of the materials were determined from the compression test and, additionally, measurements of HV hardness and electrical conductivity were made. Analysis of the initial nanocrystalline structure of these materials was made and its evolution during sintering and cold deformation was investigated. Findings: It was found out that addition of up to 2 wt. % of a strengthening phase significantly improves mechanical properties of the material and increases its softening point. The obtained strengthening effect have been discussed based on the existing theories related to strengthening of nanocrystalline materials. The studies have shown importance of “flows” existing in the consolidated materials and sintered materials in pores or regions of poor powder particle connection which significantly deteriorate the mechanical properties of microcomposites produced by powder metallurgy. Research limitations/implications: The powder metallurgy techniques {{make it possible to}} obtain copperbased bulk materials by means of input powder milling in a planetary ball mill, followed by compacting and sintering. Additional operations of hot extrusion are also often used. There is some danger, however, that during high-temperature processing or application of these materials at elevated or high temperatures this nanometric structure may become unstable.

This paper reviews the issue of copper corrosion in different environments and applications. Special attention is paid to the influence of relative humidity and low molecular weight carboxylic acids. These acids are present in rain, snow, clouds and particulate matter and contribute about 15 - 35 % of rain acidity. Attention is also paid to copper corrosion originated by formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid vapours. Corrosion product layers (patina) are analysed, showing the relationship between potential and current density cathodic peaks, and models are proposed that show a proportionality factor of the dimensions of a resistor. These results are of practical importance in copper roofing applications. Before 1985, copper was almost universally considered to be a corrosion resistant conduit of potable water, and few instances of copper tube failure were reported. Where unacceptable performance was identified, the problem was usually attributed to reticulation and plumbing systems. In air conditioning applications, premature failure of copper tubing frequently occurs due to pitting corrosion after a short time in service or even during post-installation leakage tests. This type of corrosion is described in the literature as formicary corrosion, and its morphology is characterised by microscopic caverns connected by tunnels. Specimens are analysed to assess the reasons for such premature corrosion failure. Finally, procedures to mitigate copper corrosion are addressed. Pickling in dilute mineral acids (H 2 SO 4 and HCl) is discussed as the most common method for removing oxides formed on the surface of <b>copper</b> <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> during mill processing and manufacturing operations. The use of corrosion inhibitors, such as immersion corrosion inhibitors and volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCI), is a widespread practice to reduce copper corrosion, achieving significant delays in the corrosion process.

This project, in {{an effort}} to improve upon basic {{crystalline}} silicon photovoltaic energy conversion, proposes both an alternative material and an alternative method of solar energy conversion. The sun, responsible for giving us life of all kinds, is capable of giving us more. Photovoltaic energy, derived from the conversion of solar energy to electrical energy, can be a very efficient process. Unfortunately, it is often produced at a location and time where we are unable to use it immediately, necessitating transmission or storage of this converted energy; both imposing energy losses and costs. Furthermore, the typical use of crystalline silicon for this process is hindered by supply and fabrication cost issues. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting offers an alternative energy-transport mechanism in the form of evolved hydrogen gas. Untethered by aging power lines and insufficient energy distribution technology, hydrogen gas offers new methods to store and transport converted solar energy to be used in fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines representing a sustainable, clean and completely carbon-free energy cycle.

Scanning-electron microscopic analysis in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was utilized to characterize {{the condition of the}} tube inner wall surface and any carbon deposition or corrosion that was formed during selected runs. Results show that the carbon deposition process in stainless steel tubes was relatively insensitive to fuel type or test condition. The deposition rates were comparable for all fuels and none of the stainless steel test pieces showed any signs of corrosion. For tests conducted with copper tubing, the sulfur content of the fuel {{had a significant impact on}} both the condition of the tube wall and carbon deposition rates. Carbon deposition rates for the lowest sulfur fuels (2 ppm) were slightly higher than those recorded in the stainless steel tubes with no corrosion observed on the inner wall surface. For slightly higher sulfur content (25 ppm) fuels, nodules that intruded into the flow area were observed to form on the inner wall surface. These nodules induced moderate tube pressure drop increases. The highest sulfur content fuels (400 ppm) produced extensive wall pitting and dendritic copper sulfide growth that was continuous along the entire tube wall surface. The result of this tube degradation was the inability to maintain flow rate due to rapidly increasing test section pressure drops. Accompanying this corrosion were carbon deposition rates an order of magnitude greater than those observed in comparable stainless steel tests. The results of this investigation indicate that trace impurities in fuels (i. e. sulfur) can significantly impact the carbon deposition process and produce unacceptable corrosion levels in <b>copper</b> <b>based</b> structural <b>materials...</b>|$|R

The mechanical strength of the solder mask/copper base layer interface is not influenced by the different copper complex formations of amine and anhydride based curing agents.|$|R
