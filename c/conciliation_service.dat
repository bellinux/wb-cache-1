25|$|However, many {{scholars}} and studies draw the opposite conclusion. A 1991 {{study by the}} Government Accountability Office {{based on data from}} the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service</b> found that, of all strikes from 1985 to 1989, about 10 percent of major and 16 percent of minor strikes involved the use of strikebreakers. The occurrence of replacement workers was three times higher in strikes which lasted at least a month in duration. Academic studies support this conclusion.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, Aaron {{served as a}} conciliator with the United States <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service</b> and helped settle a number of labor disputes—particularly in California's aircraft industry during the post-war wave of strikes. President Harry S. Truman appointed {{him to be a}} public member of the Wage Stabilization Board on July 5, 1951. He was a strong critic of the Board's case-by-case method of awarding pay increases. During the 1952 steel strike, he played a role as a go-between for the United Steelworkers of America and the Board. President Truman appointed him vice chairman of the Board on May 29, 1952. Aaron was deeply critical of congressional efforts to cut the Board's budget, and declared that Congress should either fully fund the Board's activities or have the courage to legislate the Board out of existence.|$|E
25|$|As {{the talks}} dragged on to mid-December without movement, the {{government}} began to take action. ESA administrator Roger Putnam summoned to Washington, D.C., Fairless, Ernest T. Weir (president of National Steel Corporation), and Charles M. White (president of Republic Steel). The three met with Putnam on December 13, who attempted to determine what the employers' bargaining position was. Although Putnam ruled out price relief based on a rise in wages, {{for the first time}} he and OPS director DiSalle indicated that the government would permit the steel manufacturers to seek the maximum price increase allowed by the Capehart Amendment. Cyrus Ching, now head of the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service,</b> sent two of his top aides to meet with union officials to determine the union's bargaining strategy and timeline. The aides met with Murray and the union's collective bargaining committee on December 14, but made no headway. WSB director Feinsinger, however, began paving the way for a relaxation of Wage Regulation 6. On December 8, Feinsinger told the press that the Board was already working on a revision to the regulation which would permit merit pay increases. Five days later, Feinsinger let it be known that a number of economic issues (such as increased pension contributions) might be removed from the calculation of the basic wage rate in order to relieve the pressure on the negotiating parties.|$|E

25|$|Negotiations {{for a new}} CBA {{began in}} early 2010. Team owners and new NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell demanded a cutback in {{salaries}} and benefits under the cap system, promising to lockout the players if no new agreement was reached by March 1, 2011. The NFLPA rejected Goodell’s proposal, requesting to see all league and club financial records to determine what need, if any, the clubs had for a decrease in player costs. The players voted during their 2010 team meetings to end the NFLPA’s status as a labor union as of March 1, 2011, unless a new CBA was reached by that time. Although there was no salary cap in 2010, free agency activity and overall expenditures on players declined, leading the NFLPA to file a collusion case, claiming that the owners had unlawfully agreed to reduce competition for free agents. After failing to make any progress in negotiations, both sides accepted mediation {{under the auspices of}} the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service</b> (FMCS) in February 2011. During mediation, players and owners agreed to extend the 2006 CBA by one week. The FMCS failed to mediate a settlement and the previous CBA expired on March 7, 2011. That same day, the NFLPA announced it was no longer a union. This allowed players to file individual antitrust cases, many of which challenged the legality of the impending lockout. Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts were two of the eight named plaintiffs in the action filed in Federal District Court in Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|A second {{labor dispute}} halted {{work on the}} bridge when 200 members of Sand and Gravel Workers Union Local 22075 went out on strike over a refusal by the Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation to adopt the closed shop. The strike, which began on August 14, {{immediately}} halted concrete work {{not only on the}} new Sousa Bridge but on more than 20 building and transportation infrastructure projects, and idled more than 5,000 workers. Howard T. Colvin, a United States Department of Labor conciliator, was called in to help end the dispute. Initially, Colvin expressed optimism that the strike could be settled swiftly. But the union rejected a potential settlement on August 23 because it lacked specific wage and hour agreements. On August 25, Representative William Alvin Pittenger (R-Minnesota) asked the Army Corps of Engineers to break the strike and supply sand and gravel itself. The Army refused. On August 28, the federal government intervened in the strike. Federal Works Agency Administrator John M. Carmody questioned why the single source was used to supply all the sand and gravel to so much projects, and threatened to find a new supplier if a settlement was not forthcoming. John R. Steelman, head of the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service,</b> announced he was personally interveneing in the negotiations {{to bring an end to}} the strike. Meanwhile, Colvin proposed a strike settlement which was immediately accepted by the union and rejected by the company. Carmody and Steelman's intervention appeared to work. Progress in strike talks was announced on August 30, and on September 5 the company and union ended the strike after agreeing to Colvin's terms.|$|E
500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service.</b> Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Since the {{collapse}} of the bubble economy in the early 19909 ̆ 2 s, Japan 9 ̆ 2 s industrial society experienced a drastic increase in individual employment disputes. At the same time, union management disputes have been clearly on the decline since the 19809 ̆ 2 s. To cope with such a structural change of labor disputes, it was necessary to restructure the labor dispute resolution system, which was established after World War II. As a first step, in 2001 the Ministry of Welfare and Labor established a system to offer information, counseling and <b>conciliation</b> <b>services</b> through its local agencies. Then, the Labor Tribunal System was created in 2004 by Judicial Reform as a second major step to respond to the increase in employment disputes. In the same year, Judicial Reform also led modification of the conventional labor law system, i. e., the adjudication of union management disputes by Labor Commissions. Thus, as a consequence of Judicial Reform, the post-war labor dispute resolution system underwent a large-scale reform in recent years. This paper describes the backgrounds, process and contents of this reform...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{insurance}} law and regulation {{is concerned with}} compensating consumers who have been wrongly denied coverage. But policyholders nonetheless have relatively few realistic options for challenging an insurer 2 ̆ 7 s adverse coverage determination. Litigation is often too slow and costly {{for those who have}} recently suffered significant financial loss. Meanwhile, the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options that do exist-such as the <b>conciliation</b> <b>services</b> that insurance regulators offer or the existing variants {{of insurance}} arbitration-are generally either ineffective or unavailable for most disputes. This Article proposes a new way forward by looking to the United Kingdom 2 ̆ 7 s innovative Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which operates parallel to the British financial services regulator and is devoted solely to resolving consumer financial disputes. The comparative success of the FOS, the Article argues, is attributable primarily {{to the ways in which}} it blends elements of the individual, uncoordinated insurance ADR schemes that are used in the United States. As such, this Article concludes that American lawmakers can significantly improve insurance compensation by strategically rethinking the institutional architecture of insurance dispute resolution. It also suggests that the British FOS may offer a model for improving consumer dispute resolution in realms beyond insurance. Insurance, ADR, Consumer Financial Services, Innsurance Regulatio...|$|R

2500|$|Passage of the Taft-Hartley Act over President Harry S.

Steelman, Assistant to the President of the United States (the office later became the White House Chief of Staff), asked Ching to head up the new agency. [...] Ching initially refused, but Truman himself asked Ching to direct the new agency in order to forestall congressional opposition to funding the new agency. Ching served {{until the end of}} the Truman administration. During his time in office, Ching advised Truman to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act during a strike at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in December 1947, and mediated several important strikes—including the 1949 steel strike, the 1949 Hawaii dockworkers' strike, and several coal strikes. He also spent much of his time fighting off attempts to put FMCS back under the authority of the United States Department of Labor.|$|E
2500|$|When the 1946 {{collective}} bargaining agreement expired in 1949, the United Steelworkers demanded that U.S. Steel provide each worker a pension. The Taft-Hartley Act's provisions permitting an injunction against a strike in an industry critical to national security were invoked {{an hour after the}} United Steelworkers walked off the job on July 7. Cyrus S. Ching, director of the Federal Mediation and <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Service,</b> attempted to mediate a solution to the strike, but these talks broke down on July 11. President Truman proposed a 60-day cooling off period, but Fairless rejected it. Fairless proposed a fact-finding board (which had worked in the 1946 strike) and 60-day cooling off period on July 14, and President Truman accepted the plan the following day. As the fact-finding board conducted its hearings, in August Fairless publicly denounced what he called was [...] "dictatorial" [...] governmental regulation of wages and prices. On September 14, the fact-finding board issued its report, and said that U.S. Steel should provide pensions for its workers. [...] Fairless denounced the recommendation as a [...] "revolution" [...] against free enterprise, and rejected the fact-finding panel's report wholesale. Nonetheless, Fairless agreed to attend a mediation session in Washington, D.C., two days later. On September 17, Murray accused Fairless of imposing a double-standard on workers when he revealed that U.S. Steel was paying the pensions of its executives. Public opinion turned sharply against Fairless, and with the Taft-Hartley injunction due to expire Murray announced that the union would strike. Fairless opened bargaining with the union, and President Truman won a postponement of the strike until October 1 in order to allow negotiations to bear fruit. But the negotiations did not result in a contract, and the union struck on schedule. Murray announced on October 13 that the union would settle for a pension plan funded by a 29 cents per hour contribution from U.S. Steel. Fairless continued to resist the pension plan idea. But as layoffs spread throughout the steel industry, other steel companies began meeting with Ching to seek a resolution. [...] On October 18, Fairless quietly sent an aide to meet with Ching and to discuss the pension plan proposal. On October 31, Bethlehem Steel reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers that implemented a pension plan. [...] Under pressure to agree to the same terms, Fairless agreed to meet with Ching and Murray. But no agreement was forthcoming. [...] Jones & Laughlin Steel signed a pension plan deal with the union on November 7, and Youngstown Sheet & Tube agreed to the union's terms two days later. With all the other major steel companies resuming production, Fairless set aside his previous opposition to the pension plan and signed with the union on November 11.|$|E
