40|$|Rationale: Cannabis (CB) use and {{dependence}} {{are associated with}} regionally specific alterations to brain circuitry and substantial psychosocial impairment. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between CB use {{and dependence}}, and the volumes of brain regions critically involved in goal-directed learning and behaviour¿the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate. Methods: In the largest multi-site structural imaging study of <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> vs healthy controls (HC), 140 <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> and 121 HC were recruited from four research sites. Group differences in OFC and caudate volumes were investigated between HC and <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> and between 70 dependent (CB-dep) and 50 non-dependent (CB-nondep) users. The relationship between quantity of CB use and age of onset of use and caudate and OFC volumes was explored. Results: <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> (consisting of CB-dep and CB-nondep) did not significantly differ from HC in OFC or caudate volume. CB-dep compared to CB-nondep users exhibited significantly smaller volume in the medial and the lateral OFC. Lateral OFC volume was particularly smaller in CB-dep females, and reduced volume in the CB-dep group was associated with higher monthly cannabis dosage. Conclusions: Smaller medial OFC volume may be driven by CB dependence-related mechanisms, while smaller lateral OFC volume may be due to ongoing exposure to cannabinoid compounds. The results highlight a distinction between cannabis use and dependence and warrant examination of gender-specific effects in studies of CB dependence...|$|R

40|$|Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) sulcogyral {{patterns}} are stable morphological variations established early in life. They consist of three distinct pattern types, with Type III in particular {{being associated with}} poor regulatory control (e. g., high sensation seeking and negative emotionality, low constraint), which may confer risk for earlier onset of cannabis (CB) use and greater use in later life. The OFC sulcogyral pattern may therefore be a stable trait marker in understanding individual differences in substance-use vulnerability and associated affective disturbances in users. In a large multisite cross-sectional study, we compared OFC pattern type distribution between 128 healthy controls (HC) and 146 <b>CB</b> <b>users.</b> Within users (n = 140), we explored the association between OFC pattern type and CB use level, and subsequently if level of CB use informed by OFC pattern type may mediate disturbances in affective tone, as indexed by depressive symptoms. While OFC pattern distribution did not distinguish between HC and CB groups, it informed greater lifetime use within <b>users.</b> Specifically, <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> with pattern Type III in the right OFC tended to use more CB over their lifetime, than did <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> with pattern Type I or II. Greater lifetime CB use was subsequently associated with higher depressive symptoms, such that it mediated an indirect association between right OFC pattern Type III and higher depressive symptoms. The present study provides evidence for neurobiological differences, specifically sulcogyral pattern of the OFC, to modulate level of CB use, which may subsequently influence the expression of depressive symptom...|$|R
5000|$|Citizens Band {{radio is}} a family of {{services}} available in different countries and with different operating rules, generally using channels in the 27 MHz part of the radio spectrum. 26-27 MHz occupies the [...] "boundary area" [...] between HF (3-30 MHz) and VHF (30-300 MHz). This means that CB signals provide local coverage similar to low-band VHF during times of low sunspot activity. However, during {{the peak of the}} sunspot cycle, CB frequencies exhibit skywave propagation just like the lower parts of HF do, making communication hundreds or even thousands of miles (km) away possible. While some operators seek out long distance [...] "DX" [...] contacts on CB frequencies and on frequencies above channel 40 and below channel 1 (a practice referred to as [...] "freebanding" [...] or [...] "outbanding"), interference from distant stations will often make local communication extremely difficult or impossible during band openings. CB was, and still is, designed for short-distance (local) communications needs. US FCC law prohibits communicating with any station more than 250 km (155.3 miles) on CB frequencies. Like many rules regarding the HF CB services, the distance prohibition is largely ignored and unenforced. Often as a result of channel overcrowding and interference, many HF <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> have turned to purchasing [...] "export" [...] or [...] "10-meter" [...] radios that operate in the legal CB band but also provide access to frequencies above and below the CB band. Other <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> purchase amplifiers to increase their output power and [...] "punch through" [...] interference caused by distant stations (or by local stations running amplifiers). This has created a tragedy of the commons situation in and near the HF CB spectrum (25-28 MHz). As more users purchase amplifiers and operate on out-of-band frequencies, more interference is produced, forcing others to acquire even more powerful equipment to punch through even more interference, and/or to acquire transceivers capable of accessing more frequencies so that a clear frequency may be found. Many <b>CB</b> <b>users</b> have moved to other personal radio services to avoid these issues.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To compare stress, morale, and {{intended}} job turnover in staff in non-congregate settings where the minority of residents had CB and congregate settings {{where the majority}} of residents had CB. Method: A self-completion survey questionnaire was used to collect information on the characteristics of staff, staff stress, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave employment. Information was also collected on the characteristics and working practices of settings. Results: There were few significant differences between non-congregate and congregate settings. Over 25 % of staff reached criterion on the GHQ- 12 for experiencing emotional distress. Over 33 % were likely to seek new employment in the next year. The greatest sources of stress were lack of resources and lack of staff support, not service <b>user</b> <b>CB.</b> Lowest satisfaction was with rate of pay. Those in non-congregate settings reported greater stress due to lack of procedures to deal with CB. Conclusions: High levels of staff intended turnover are due more to job insecurity and lack of support than service <b>user</b> <b>CB,</b> even in settings {{where the majority of}} residents display CB. Employers seeking to reduce turnover should pay attention to pay and conditions, and staff training in methods for dealing with CB...|$|R
2500|$|Stott Hall Farm, (...) {{the only}} {{farm in the}} UK {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} a motorway, was built in the 18th century on Moss Moor. It lies south of Booth Wood Reservoir where the carriageways are separated between junctions 22 and 23. The road divides for much of its length between the Windy Hill and Deanhead cuttings because of the surrounding geography but a myth persists that it was split because the owners Ken and Beth Wild refused to sell. Sally Boazman, BBC Radio 2's traffic reporter and <b>CB</b> radio <b>users</b> nicknamed it the Little House on the Prairie. It is separated from the motorway by crash barriers and a fence to keep livestock in and prevent out-of-control vehicles crashing onto the property. It is one of the ten best-known sights on the motorway network. It was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary, a Yorkshire Television documentary and a short film.|$|R
40|$|In cloud computing, users scale their {{resources}} (computational) {{based on their}} need. There is massive literature dealing with such resource scaling algorithms. These works ignore a fundamental constrain imposed by all Cloud Service Providers (CSP), i. e. one {{has to pay for}} a fixed minimum duration irrespective of their usage. Such quantization in billing cycles poses problem for users with sporadic workload. In recent literature, Cloud Broker (CB) has been introduced for the benefit of such <b>users.</b> A <b>CB</b> rents resources from CSP and in turn provides service to users to generate profit. Contract between <b>CB</b> and <b>user</b> is that of pay-what-you-use/pay-per-use. However CB faces the challenge of Quantized Billing Cycles as it negotiates with CSP. We design two algorithms, one fully online and the other partially online, which maximizes the profit of the CB. The key idea is to regulate users demand using dynamic pricing. Our algorithm is inspired by the Ski-Rental problem. We derive competitive ratio of these algorithms and also conduct simulations using real world traces to prove the efficiency of our algorithm.

5000|$|On April 7, 1975, {{about two}} weeks after their disappearance, a witness in Manassas, Virginia, {{reported}} seeing two girls resembling Sheila and Katherine {{in the rear of}} a beige 1968 Ford station wagon. The witness stated that the girls were bound and gagged in the vehicle. The driver of the station wagon resembled the man in the publicly available sketch of the prime suspect. The witness further claimed that when the driver spotted the witness tailing him, he ran a red light and sped west on Route 234 towards Interstate 66 in Virginia. The station wagon had Maryland license plates with the possible combination [...] "DMT-6**." [...] The last two numbers are unknown due to the bending of the car's plate. The known combination was issued in Cumberland, Hagerstown, and Baltimore, Maryland at the time. This supposed sighting inspired a small army of mobile citizen band (<b>CB)</b> radio <b>users</b> to scour the area throughout the evening and into the night with a running commentary and chatter but without any tangible results. A search for matching plate numbers failed to produce any information. Although this witness's report was at first treated as credible, and a media firestorm erupted because of it, it was later deemed [...] "questionable" [...] by police. [...] Despite its questionable nature, media continue to mention this report as credible.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{equation}} mixture models (SEMMs), {{when applied}} as a semiparametric model (SPM), can adequately recover potentially nonlinear latent relationships without their specification. This SPM {{is useful for}} exploratory analysis when {{the form of the}} latent regression is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to help users familiar with structural equation models to add SEMM to their toolkit of exploratory analytic options. We describe how the SEMM captures potential nonlinearity between latent variables, and how confidence bands (CBs; point wise and simultaneous) for the recovered latent function are constructed and interpreted. We then illustrate the usefulness of CBs for inference with an empirical example on the effect of emotions on cognitive processing. We also introduce a visualization tool that automatically generates plots of the latent regression and their <b>CBs</b> to promote <b>user</b> accessibility. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the use of this SPM for exploratory research...|$|R

40|$|Danièle Debruyne, 1, 2 Reynald Le Boisselier 1 1 Centre for Evaluation and Information on Pharmacodependence - Addictovigilance (CEIP-A), 2 Toxicology and Pharmacology Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, University Hospital Centre Côte de Nacre, Caen, France Abstract: New psychoactive {{drugs that}} have {{appeared}} {{over the last}} decade are typically dominated by cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids (SCs). SCs have been emerging as recreational drugs because they mimic the euphoria effect of cannabis while still being legal. Sprayed on natural herb mixtures, SCs have been primarily sold as “herbal smoking blends” or “herbal incense” under brand names like “Spice” or “K 2 ”. Currently, SCs pure compounds are available from websites for the combination with herbal materials or for the use in e-cigarettes. For the past 5 years, an ever increasing number of compounds, representative of different chemical classes, have been promoted and now represent a large assortment of new popular drugs of abuse, which are difficult to properly identify. Their legal status varies by country with many government institutions currently pushing for their control. The in vitro binding to CB 1 /CB 2 receptors is usually well-known and considerable differences have been found in the CB 1 versus CB 2 selectivity and potency within the different SCs, with several structure-activity relations being evident. Desired effects by <b>CB</b> 1 agonist <b>users</b> are relaxation/recreative, however, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or psychiatric/neurological side effects are commonly reported. At present there is no specific antidote existing if an overdose of designer drugs was to occur, and no curative treatment has been approved by health authorities. Management of acute toxic effects is mainly symptomatic and extrapolated from experience with cannabis.
