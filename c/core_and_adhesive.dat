40|$|Abstract. Inserts {{are used}} to {{transfer}} localized loads to structures made of sandwich composites. Stress concentrations near inserts are known to cause failures in sandwich panels. Experimental insert pull-out tests show that the load to failure can vary by 20 % between batches of sandwich panels. Clearly, uncertainties in the mechanical properties of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> potting materials have to be accounted for in the optimal design of inserts in sandwich composites. In this paper, we use an one-dimensional computational model of an insert in a homogenized honeycomb sandwich panel to explore the utility of reliability methods in design. We show that the first-order reliability method (FORM) produces accurate estimates of loads that lead to low failure probabilities. We also observe that FORM is sensitive to the failure criteria and may not converge if the failure surface is not smooth and convex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractComposite {{sandwich}} structures made of thick glass face sheets adhesively-bonded to glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) core profiles {{have the potential}} to outperform existing non-composite glazing configurations but their feasibility has yet to be investigated and there are no analytical models that describe their structural response. This paper presents the new analytical models for predicting deflections and strains in adhesively-bonded GFRP-glass sandwich beams. The new analytical models successfully account for: the shear deformations of the <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> layers; the local bending of the constituent parts about their centroidal axes; and the global bending of the sandwich component as a whole. The deflections and strains predicted by analytical models are validated by finite element simulations and compared with the results of destructive tests performed on adhesively-bonded GFRP-glass beams in a four-point bending configuration. The analytical models were also evaluated for alternative GFRP-glass configurations tested by others. The GFRP-glass beams specially assembled in this study confirm the physical feasibility of constructing these proposed components...|$|E
40|$|Tissue-resident {{dendritic}} cells patrol {{for foreign}} antigens while undergoing slow mesenchymal migration. Using actomyosin-based structures called podosomes, dendritic cells probe and remodel extracellular matrix topographical cues. Podosomes comprise an actin-rich protrusive core {{surrounded by an}} adhesive ring of integrins, cytoskeletal adaptor proteins and actin network filaments. Here we reveal how the integrity and dynamics of protrusive <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> rings are coordinated by the actomyosin apparatus. Core growth by actin polymerization induces podosome protrusion and provides tension within the actin network filaments. The tension transmitted to the ring recruits vinculin and zyxin and preserves overall podosome integrity. Conversely, myosin IIA contracts the actin network filaments and applies tension to the vinculin molecules bound, counterbalancing <b>core</b> growth <b>and</b> eventually reducing podosome size and protrusion. We demonstrate a previously unrecognized interplay between actin and myosin IIA in podosomes, providing novel mechanistic insights into how actomyosin-based structures allow dendritic cells to sense the extracellular environment...|$|R

40|$|Debonding is {{a common}} {{manufacturing}} flaw of sandwich beams and panels that may severely hamper their load-bearing capacity. It is akin to pre-cracking between either the face and adhesive or the adhesive and core [2, 9 – 13]. Face debonding is usually ignored, since face and adhesive materials are commonly much tougher than core materials. Pre-cracking between adhesive and core may grow either interfacially or into the core (kinking), as decided by energy release criteria. Under load-control conditions, initiation of either kind of crack leads to immediate (brittle) structural failure. Stability considerations aside, the rational analysis and design of sandwich sections requires at least some qualitative {{understanding of how the}} energy release rates and stress intensity factors (SIFs) depend on the loading conditions, the length of debonding, and the properties and dimensions of the surrounding materials. In this work we consider the effects of debonding in a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen of aluminum faces and PVC-foam core (Divinycel H, see [20]), as shown in Figure 1 below. The configuration follows the one proposed by Prasad and Carlsson [11], which is similar to the standard ASTM D 5528 - 94 a peel test [19]. All materials are linear elastic, and four cases of core density are considered (H 60, H 80, H 100, and H 250), which {{have been the subject of}} other investigations [e. g., 13] too. All cases are typical of foam-core sandwich structures, where the core is much more flexible than the adhesive and faces. In each case debonding is introduced between the <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> at the loaded end. For reasons explained in the text...|$|E

Face sheets, which are to be bonded to the core material, are provided {{on opposite sides of}} the frame and extend over the frame, thus sealing the core material in the cavity. An adhesive is provided between the <b>core</b> material <b>and</b> the face sheets and the combined thickness of the <b>core</b> material <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> is a close fit within the opposed face sheets. A gas tight seal, such as an O-ring gasket, is provided between the frame and the face sheet members to form a gas tight cavity between the face sheet members and the frame. External heat and pressure are used to bond the face sheets to the core material. Gas pressure is introduced into the sealed cavity to minimize out-gasing of the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Podosomes are multimolecular mechanosensory {{assemblies}} that coordinate mesenchymal {{migration of}} tissue-resident dendritic cells. They have a protrusive actin <b>core</b> <b>and</b> an <b>adhesive</b> ring of integrins and adaptor proteins, such as talin and vinculin. We recently demonstrated that core actin oscillations correlate with intensity fluctuations of vinculin but not talin, suggesting different molecular rearrangements for these components. Detailed {{information on the}} mutual localization of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> ring components at the nanoscale is lacking. By dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we {{for the first time}} determined the nanoscale organization of individual podosomes and their spatial arrangement within large clusters formed at the cell-substrate interface. Superresolution imaging of three ring components with respect to actin revealed that the <b>cores</b> are interconnected <b>and</b> linked to the ventral membrane by radiating actin filaments. In core-free areas, alphaMbeta 2 integrin and talin islets are homogeneously distributed, whereas vinculin preferentially localizes proximal to the <b>core</b> <b>and</b> along the radiating actin filaments. Podosome clusters appear as self-organized contact areas, where mechanical cues might be efficiently transduced and redistributed. Our findings call for a reevaluation of the current "core-ring" model and provide a novel structural framework for further understanding the collective behavior of podosome clusters...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} on overall deformations of the time-dependent constitutive properties of fiber-reinforced polymeric matrix composite materials {{being considered for}} use in orbiting precision segmented reflectors, simple sandwich beam models are developed. The beam models include layers representing the face sheets, the <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>adhesive</b> bonding of the face sheets to the core. A three-layer model lumps the adhesive layers with the face sheets or core, while a five-layer model considers the adhesive layers explicitly. The deformation response of the three-layer and five-layer sandwich beam models to a midspan point load is studied. This elementary loading leads to a simple analysis, and {{it is easy to}} create this loading in the laboratory. Using the correspondence principle of viscoelasticity, the models representing the elastic behavior of the two beams are transformed into time-dependent models. Representative cases of time-dependent material behavior for the facesheet material, the <b>core</b> material, <b>and</b> the <b>adhesive</b> are used to evaluate the influence of these constituents being time-dependent on the deformations of the beam. As an example of the results presented, if it assumed that, as a worst case, the polymer-dominated shear properties of the core behave as a Maxwell fluid such that under constant shear stress the shear strain increases by a factor of 10 in 20 years, then it is shown that the beam deflection increases by a factor of 1. 4 during that time. In addition to quantitative conclusions, several assumptions are discussed which simplify the analyses for use with more complicated material models. Finally, it is shown that the simpler three-layer model suffices in many situations...|$|R

When F-lll is retired from service honeycomb panels will have experienced extended exposure to hostile environments. The processes leading to degradation of metal-honeycomb sandwich structure and its effect on the structural integrity of F-lll structure is critical information required for successful, long term aircraft management. The work presented in this report summarises initial investigations into the mechanical strength response of metal-honeycomb sandwich structure exposed to high humidity environments. Honeycomb sandwich panels constructed from <b>core</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>adhesives</b> materials currently used for repairs at RAAF-Amberley have been conditioned in high humidity environments and examined using flatwise tension, peel and bending tests. The durability performance of honeycomb panels depended on the construction materials and the mode of loading employed.

Six crowns were adhesively luted to dentin stubs, six to endodontically treated teeth with <b>adhesive</b> titanium posts <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> composite <b>cores,</b> <b>and</b> six to <b>adhesive</b> composite cores without posts. Another ten unprepared teeth served as a control. All restored teeth were subjected to long-term occlusal and thermal stresses.

At the luting composite-composite crown interface, 61. 6 to 88. 7 % of "continuous margin" before and 57. 7 to 75. 5 % after stressing were recorded.

40|$|Sandwich beams are {{composite}} systems having high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight {{ratios and}} are used as light weight load bearing components. The use of thin, strong skin sheets adhered to thicker, lightweight core materials has allowed industry to build strong, stiff, light, and durable structures. Due {{to the use of}} viscoelastic polymer constituents, sandwich beams can exhibit time-dependent behavior. This study examines and predicts the time-dependent behavior of sandwich beams driven by the viscoelastic foam core. Governing equations of the deformation of viscoelastic materials are often represented in differential form or hereditary integral form. A single integral constitutive equation is used to model linear viscoelastic materials by means of the Boltzmann superposition principle. Based on the strength of materials approach, the analytical solution for the deformation in a viscoelastic sandwich beam is determined based on the application of the Correspondence Principle and Laplace transform. Finite element (FE) method is used to analyze the overall transient responses of the sandwich systems subject to a concentrated point load at the midspan of the beam. A 2 D plane strain element is used to generate meshes of the three-point bending beam. User material (UMAT) subroutine in ABAQUS FE code is utilized to incorporate the viscoelastic constitutive model for the foam <b>core.</b> Analytical models <b>and</b> experimental data available in the literature are used to verify the results obtained from the FE analysis.

To {{improve the}} structural and thermal performance of composite sandwich panels, combinations of UHPC and expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads were investigated. High-performance expanded polystyrene concrete (HPEPC) was tested with various EPS bulk ratios to determine the suitability of the mechanical properties for use as a high-strength lightweight aggregate concrete. As a core material in composite sandwich panels, the mechanical properties of HPEPC were compared with those of EPS mortar. The compressive strength of HPEPC is approximately eight times greater than that of EPS mortar, and the thermal conductivity of approximately a quarter that of EPS mortar. The structural behavior of composite sandwich panels was empirically analyzed using different combinations of <b>cores,</b> face sheets, <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> materials. In the flatwise and edgewise compression tests, sandwich panels with HPEPC cores had high peak strengths, irrespective of the type of face sheets, as opposed to the specimens with EPS mortar cores.
