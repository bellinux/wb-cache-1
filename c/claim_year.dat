So drummer Levon Helm moved to play mandolin, pianist Richard Manuel played drums, bassist Rick Danko played fiddle and producer John Simon played tuba, while organist Garth Hudson played upright acoustic piano in a ragtime fashion. [...] Helm also sang the lead vocals.|$|R

50|$|In the meantime, the {{government}} was to rule by decree. Since traditionally such Constituent Acts {{did not need to}} be signed by the Crown, the King never signed it, permitting him to <b>claim,</b> <b>years</b> later, that he had never signed any document instituting the junta.

40|$|The {{unallocated}} loss adjustment expense (ULAE) reserve {{has traditionally}} been estimated by the paid-to-paid method (PTP), which compares paid calendar <b>year</b> <b>claims</b> department expenses to paid calendar year losses and then applies the resulting ratio to claims reserves. More recently, Wendy A. Johnson proposed a method that compares paid calendar <b>year</b> <b>claims</b> department expenses to a weighted average of claim counts, and applies this ratio {{to the number of}} claims still to be settled. This paper will explore the shortcomings of these two methods, and will offer two alternative methods which attempt to address some of these shortcomings. The first alternative method uses expected paid loss in place of actual paid loss as the projection base in the PTP method. The second is claim count based like the Johnson method, but reflects the changes in average ULAE costs per <b>claim</b> per calendar <b>year,</b> as the portfolio of claims is run off. The second method does so by projecting future calendar <b>year</b> <b>claim</b> staff levels and average ULAE per claim staff member.
