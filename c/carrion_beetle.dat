It belongs to the order Coleoptera and the family Silphidae. The <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> in North America is carnivorous, feeds on carrion and requires carrion to breed. It {{is also one of the}} few species of beetle to exhibit parental care. The decline of the American burying beetle has been attributed to habitat loss, alteration, and degradation, and they now occur over less than 10% of their historic range.|$|E
25|$|Oiceoptoma noveboracense is {{a member}} of the family Silphidae, or carrion beetles, which feed on {{decaying}} organic matter such as dead animals. Its common name is the margined <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle,</b> from the orange-red margins on the pronotum, which are helpful when identifying this species. The larva is typically light brown to red and also has vertical ridges on its thorax like the adult. This diurnal beetle can be found mainly in the spring into the fall, and it has a strong preference towards a deciduous forest habitat. The primary forensic importance of this beetle is its ability to use the succession of insect fauna to provide confirmation of postmortem intervals.|$|E

The vegetation of the survey sites consist of four types, deciduous forest, mixed forest of deciduous and sasa types, and bushes. A total of 1, 084 individuals in 6 species of <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> by using bait traps were investigated and among them, Nicrophorus quadripunctatus was the most dominant species with 947 (87. 36 %).

50|$|Gold-necked <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle,</b> or Tomentose {{burying beetle}} (Nicrophorus tomentosus), is {{a species of}} burying beetle that was {{described}} by Friedrich Weber in 1801. The beetle belongs to the Silphidae family which are carrion beetles. The beetles have sensitive antennae that contain olfactory organs. Thus, the beetle can locate dead animals (carcass), and then as the name suggests, can bury them. However, unlike other burying beetles, N. tomentosus does not feed these brood carcasses. They instead eliminate the soil under the carcass, so the carcass will sink underneath. Recognition of these beetles can be distinguished by its black color with orange markings on the wing covers (elytra).|$|E

40|$|Urbanization is an {{increasingly}} pervasive form of land transformation that reduces biodiversity of many taxonomic groups. Beetles exhibit {{a broad range}} of responses to urbanization, likely due to the high functional diversity in this order. Carrion beetles (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Silphidae) provide an important ecosystem service by promoting decomposition of small-bodied carcasses, and have previously been found to decline due to forest fragmentation caused by urbanization. However, New York City (NYC) and many other cities have fairly large continuous forest patches that support dense populations of small mammals, and thus may harbor relatively robust <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> communities in city parks. In this study, we investigated <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> community composition, abundance and diversity in forest patches along an urban-to-rural gradient spanning the urban core (Central Park, NYC) to outlying rural areas. We conducted an additional study comparing the current <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> community at a single suburban site in Westchester County, NY that was intensively surveyed in the early 1970 â€™s. We collected a total of 2, 170 carrion beetles from eight species at 13 sites along this gradient. We report little to no effect of urbanization on <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity, although two species were not detected in any urban parks. Nicrophorus tomentosus was the most abundant species at all sites and seemed to dominate the urban communities, potentially due to its generalist habits and shallower burying depth compared to the other beetles surveyed. Variation between species body size, habitat specialization, and % forest area surrounding the surveyed sites also did not influence <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> communities. Lastly, we found few significant differences in relative abundance of 10 different <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> species between 1974 and 2015 at a single site in Westchester County, NY, although two of the rare species in the early 1970 â€™s were not detected in 2015.

50|$|Silphidae is {{a family}} of beetles that are known {{commonly}} as large <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles,</b> <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> or burying beetles. There are two subfamilies: Silphinae and Nicrophorinae. Nicrophorines are sometimes known as sexton beetles. The number of species is relatively small and around two hundred. They are more diverse in the temperate region although a few tropical endemics are known. Both subfamilies feed on decaying organic matter such as dead animals. The subfamilies differ in which uses parental care and which types of carcasses they prefer. Silphidae {{are considered to be}} of importance to forensic entomologists because when they are found on a decaying body they are used to help estimate a post-mortem interval (PMI).|$|R

Adult beetles with predatory behavior on the oldest Diptera larvae can impact their populations and thereby complicate the estimation of the time of death as these larvae are frequently used as a postmortem indicator. In addition, both larvae and adult developmental stages have potential use as a postmortem interval (PMI) indicator because the adult can colonizes carcasses from the second postmortem day onward and the larvae from the fifth day onward...|$|E

Lone females fed on the meat twice as much as lone males. A positive relationship between the cumulative quantity of food intake until the first brood and the clutch size suggested that the quantity of food intake during the pre-oviposition period was critical...|$|E

Cubiculum ornatus n. igen. and isp. is described from numerous fossil bones in the Upper Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of northwestern Madagascar, and consists of hollow, ovoid chambers with concave flanks excavated into both spongy and compact bone. Traces similar in morphology to Cubiculum ornatus have been reported elsewhere in North America, Asia, Europe, and Africa in bones {{ranging in age from}} Jurassic to Pleistocene, and have been interpreted as pupal chambers constructed by <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. Osteocallis mandibulus n. igen. and isp. is described in dinosaur bones from continental deposits of the Upper Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of Madagascar and the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah. O. mandibulus consists of shallow, meandering surface trails, composed of numerous arcuate grooves, bored into compact (cortical) bone surfaces, and is tentatively interpreted as a feeding trace. Based on similar patterns of bioglyph preserved in both Cubiculum ornatus and Osteocallis mandibulus, the tracemaker is interpreted to be the same or similar for both borings.

40|$|<b>Carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{important}} in terrestrial ecosystems, consuming dead mammals and promoting the recycling of organic matter into ecosystems. Most forensic studies are focused on succession of Diptera while neglecting Coleoptera. So far, little information is available on <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> postmortem colonization and decomposition process in temperate biogeoclimatic countries. These beetles are however part of the entomofaunal colonization of a dead body. Forensic entomologists need databases concerning the distribution, ecology and phenology of necrophagous insects, including silphids.

We collected beetles on Nakanoshima Island (experimental site) and lakeshore areas (control site) and compared the species richness, abundance, diversity index, and community composition of beetles between the sites. Results showed that although both species diversity and abundance of carabid beetles were significantly higher at the lakeshore site, those of dung and <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> were higher at the island site. It was additionally observed that abundance of larger carabid beetles was higher at the lakeshore site, whereas that of small-sized carabid beetles did not differ between the lakeshore and island sites.
