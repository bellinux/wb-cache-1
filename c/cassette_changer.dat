40|$|The {{application}} of roentgen methods to pelvimetry {{has been an}} interest in this dinic for {{the past fifteen years}} and during that time a number of communications on the subject have appeared {{as a result of our}} experience. In March, 1937, we described 7 a modification of the technic for producing lateral roentgenograms, and since that time we have added this projection to our grid method of superior strait pelvimetry as a routine in all cases where roentgen pelvimetry is performed. Within recent months we have instituted a slight modification in our technic of the grid method, 4 and it is the purpose of this paper to set down the essentials of both technics as they are used at present. WVithout the employment of both procedures in each individual we are convinced that an adequate survey of the pelvis is not possible. Furthermore, inasmuch as the mensuration of the anteroposterior diameter of the superior strait is possible in both technics, each procedure becomes an admirable check on the accuracy of the other. Any procedure in roentgen technic which is useful for routine clinical work must be simple, rapid, and accurate. All of these conditions seem to be approximated by the methods herein described. Our routine is to take the lateral projection first, and this technic may be described as follows: 1. The patient removes her dothing, putting on heelless slippers and the usual hospital bed-gown open at the back. 2. She is placed standing in front of an adjustable <b>cassette</b> <b>changer,</b> such as is used for chest work, with either the right or left lateral aspect of the body toward the target (Figs. 1 and 2). One arm rests on the top of the <b>cassette</b> <b>changer</b> and serves to steady the patient while the other is folded over the chest. The patient is told to distribute her weight equally on both feet. The use of the upright position for the taking of lateral pelvigrams is, of course, not new. Its use in obstetrical patients has been stressed by Garnett and Jacobs, ' Vaughan, 8 and others. * From the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and of Roentgenology, Yale University School of Medicine.

5000|$|Trim {{packages}} {{started with}} the top level Ultima Grand Selection with the 3.0 V6 engine, the Ultima with the 3.0 V6, (later the Ultima received the 3.0 V6 turbo), the XS-II Grand Selection with the 2.0 V6 Turbo, the XS-II with the 2.0 V6 Turbo, the XS with the V6 Turbo, the XJ-II with a 2.0 V6 and the base model called the XJ with the 2.0 V6. All models came with a digital instrument cluster, all models except the XS and the XJ came with stereo and cruise control buttons installed in the steering wheel center pad, and both Grand Selection models were installed with a 6-inch TV screen installed in the dashboard below the A/C controls that allowed passengers to watch broadcast TV if the transmission was in Park and the parking brake applied. The video entertainment system also had RCA connections to attach a camcorder and watch recorded video. The stereo and video equipment was supplied by Sony.The Leopard F31 had few factory options, but dealers offered {{the addition of a}} cellular phone installed in a dedicated compartment in the dashboard above the glove compartment where a modern passenger side airbag would now be located, and a choice of a <b>cassette</b> tape <b>changer</b> with a separate single disc CD player later upgraded to a CD changer. Catering to Japanese tastes for luxury, the Leopard wasn't available in leather for all trim packages, with wool interior offered on the top three trim packages. The front passenger seat was also equipped with what Nissan called [...] "Partner Comfort Seat" [...] where the top portion of the front passenger seat was further articulated to tilt forward, supporting the passengers shoulders while allowing the seatback structure to recline. The front edge of the passenger seat cushion was also adjustable. This was created by Dr. Yoshiyuki Matsuoka who worked for Nissan starting in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Hindustan has a {{joint venture}} with Mitsubishi that began in 1998. The plant is located in Thiruvallur, Tamil Nadu. The {{mid-size}} SUV Pajero Sport was manufactured until 2016. In India, Mitsubishi had ruled the automotive industry in 2000 with the Mitsubishi Lancer Slxd diesel 2.0l engine and slxi 1.5l petrol with upscal ammenities like stereo systems with <b>cassette</b> and cd <b>changers,</b> automatic controllable/foldable mirrors, leather seats, cup holders, defoggers, 5-speed manual transmissions, rally based body chassis as it was based on the legendary Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution which exceeded what Indian manufacturers were offering, but as time went by, their sales trended down due to poor engine/ transmission combinations for the Indian market. But since launching a redesigned Pajero sport in 2012, Mitsubishi has managed to retain their fame. This new SUV hosts a 2.5l DI-D Variable Geometrical Turbo Diesel engine mated to a 5-speed AT or MT. But 4WD was available only on the manual version, and 2WD is offered on the automatic version. Though the redesigned Pajero Sport was initially launched in 2010 for other worldwide markets, its design still retains a modern quality in the Indian market. The Pajero Sport received a cosmetic update in late 2014 with refreshed bumpers, front grille, tailgates and interior. The Mitsubishi Pajero Sport is a competitor to SUVs like the Toyota 4Runner, Ford Endeavour, etc.|$|R
