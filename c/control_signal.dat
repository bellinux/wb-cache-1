Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
25|$|Data {{transfers}} {{worked like}} this: To move {{the address of}} the next instruction from the B register to the S register, an RB (read B) <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> was issued; this caused the address to move from register B to the read bus, and then to the write bus. A WS (write S) <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> moved the address from the write bus into the S register.|$|E

Data {{from central}} {{registers}} (A, Q, Z, or LP), or other internal registers could be gated onto the read bus with a <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> The read bus {{connected to the}} write bus through a non-inverting buffer, so any data appearing on the read bus also appeared on the write bus. Other control signals could copy write bus data back into the registers.|$|E

Feedback active noise controllers that can generate damped-oscillation <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are designed by using an internal model-based linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) design technique. The low and upper bounds containing a desired ANC bandwidth is specified by two frequencies of the <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> To acquire desired ANC performance, sound pressure attenuation ratios within the bandwidth are tuned by <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> of other frequencies and damping ratios. Computer simulation and experimental results show that sound pressure attenuation ratio of {{less than or equal}} to 0. 3 and {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5, respectively, can be achieved in a wide-band of 100 Hz by using 3 damped-oscillation <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Experimental results also show effective noise reduction for time varying disturbance and band. -limited white noise within the ANC bandwidth. These results support the feasibility of the designed controllers with damped-oscillation <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> for wide-band feedback active noise control in acoustic ducts...|$|R

25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the read–write heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the new project was that Director T-10 {{encountered}} difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to discontinuities, variations and noise in the radar signal, the position derivatives sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> {{was based on the}} value of the derivatives. This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape. As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from cartesian (rectangular) to polar coordinates and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking errors.|$|E

To obtain one-dimensional systolic arrays with a description of both data and <b>control</b> <b>signals,</b> one simply applies the standard space-time mapping technique to the source and control UREs...|$|R

25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> did not leak to the output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the preamplifier had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E
25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E
50|$|In the encoder, {{the input}} is {{passed through a}} {{multiband}} filter, then each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> from the envelope followers are transmitted to the decoder. The decoder applies these (amplitude) <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> to corresponding filters for re-synthesis. Since these <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> change only slowly compared to the original speech waveform, the bandwidth required to transmit speech can be reduced. This allows more speech channels to share a single communication channel, such as a radio channel or a submarine cable (i.e. multiplexing).|$|R

25|$|Tonearm skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{recorded}} using four-track equipment. Although eight-track tape recorders {{were available in}} the US, the first units were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967. As with previous Beatles albums, the Sgt. Pepper recordings made extensive use of the technique known as reduction mixing, in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the Abbey Road engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio. EMI's Studer J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process. Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the extra time required to write and record melodic basslines that complemented the song's final arrangement. When recording the orchestra for [...] "A Day in the Life", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50Hz <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> between the two machines.|$|E
