5|$|In medieval Scotland {{education}} {{was dominated by}} the Church and largely aimed at the training and education of clerics. In the later medieval period {{there was a general}} increase in the numbers of educational institutions as well as increasing use by the laity. These included private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, song schools attached to most major churches and an increasing number of grammar schools, particularly in the expanding burghs. These were almost exclusively aimed at boys, {{but by the end of}} the 15th century Edinburgh also had schools for girls. The growing emphasis on education <b>cumulated</b> with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools. All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite, with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish and Cumbric {{languages}} {{were replaced}} by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education <b>cumulated</b> in the Education Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed {{to the development of}} the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a <b>cumulated</b> difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or desalination of seawater at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian officials said they were “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with pumping over an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current water deficit in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before distribution losses would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cumulate</b> {{rocks are}} igneous rocks {{formed by the}} {{accumulation}} of crystals from a magma either by settling or floating. <b>Cumulate</b> rocks are named according to their texture; <b>cumulate</b> texture is diagnostic of the conditions of formation of this group of igneous rocks.|$|R

500|$|The Scottish {{education}} system {{has always been}} distinct {{from the rest of}} the United Kingdom, with a characteristic emphasis on a broad education. In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education <b>cumulated</b> with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn [...] "perfyct Latyne", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite. In the Reformation the 1560 First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible. In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the Education Act (1872).|$|E
500|$|There is {{documentary}} evidence for about 100 schools {{of these different}} kinds before the Reformation. Most of the schoolmasters of these schools were clergy, and also acted as chaplains of religious foundations, hospitals or private chaplains of noblemen to supplement their merge incomes. To some extent, all education was controlled by different branches of the church, but {{towards the end of}} the period there was an increasing lay interest. This sometimes resulted in conflict, as between the burgh of Aberdeen and the cathedral chancellor, when the former appointed a lay graduate as schoolmaster in 1538, and when a married man was appointed to the similar post in Perth. Education began to widen beyond the training of the clergy, particularly as lay lawyers began to emerge as a profession, with a humanist emphasis on educating the future ruling class for their duties. The growing humanist-inspired emphasis on education <b>cumulated</b> with the passing of the Education Act 1496, thought to have been steered through parliament by the Keeper of the Privy Seal William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn [...] "perfyct Latyne". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite, with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, formal {{education}} {{was limited to}} monastic life, but from the twelfth century new sources of education had begun to develop, with song and grammar schools.

By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education. They were almost exclusively aimed at boys, {{but by the end of}} the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had schools for girls.

50|$|It can be {{seen that}} the effect on the {{composition}} of the residual melt left behind by the formation of the <b>cumulate</b> is dependent on the composition of the minerals which precipitate, the number of minerals which co-precipitate at the same time, and the ratio of the minerals which co-precipitate. In nature, <b>cumulates</b> usually form from 2 mineral species, although ranges from 1 to 4 mineral species are known. <b>Cumulate</b> rocks which are formed from one mineral alone are often named after the mineral, for example a 99% magnetite <b>cumulate</b> is known as a magnetitite.|$|R
25|$|Layered peridotites are igneous sediments {{and form}} by {{mechanical}} accumulation of dense olivine crystals.

Until the fifteenth century, those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities, which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language.

By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.

40|$|Whole-rock {{major element}} {{compositions}} are investigated in 99 <b>cumulates</b> from the Proterozoic Bjerkreim-Sokndal layered intrusion (Rogaland Anorthosite Province, SW Norway), which {{results from the}} crystallization of a jotunite (Fe-Ti-P-rich hypersthene monzodiorite) parental magma. The scattering of <b>cumulate</b> compositions covers three types of cumulates: (1) ilmenite-leuconorite with plagioclase, ilmenite and Ca-poor pyroxene as cumulus minerals, (2) magnetite-leuconorite with the same minerals plus magnetite, and (3) gabbronorite made up of plagioclase, Ca-poor and Ca-rich pyroxenes, ilmenite, Ti-magnetite and apatite. Each type of <b>cumulate</b> displays a linear trend in variation diagrams. One pole of the linear trends is represented by plagioclase, and the other by a mixture of the mafic minerals in constant proportion. The mafic minerals were not sorted during <b>cumulate</b> formation though they display large density differences. This suggests that crystal settling did not operate during <b>cumulate</b> formation, and that in situ crystallization with variable nucleation rate for plagioclase was the dominant formation mechanism. The trapped liquid fraction of the <b>cumulate</b> plays a negligible role for the <b>cumulate</b> major element composition. Each linear trend is a locus for the cotectic composition of the <b>cumulates.</b> This property permits reconstruction by graphical mass balance calculation {{of the first two}} stages of the liquid line of descent, starting from a primitive jotunite, the Tjorn, parental magma. Another type of <b>cumulate,</b> called jotunite <b>cumulate</b> and defined by the mineral association from the Transition Zone of the intrusion, has to be subtracted to simulate the most evolved part of the liquid line of descent. The proposed model demonstrates that average <b>cumulate</b> compositions represent cotectic compositions when the number of samples is large (> 40). The model, however, does not account for the K 2 O evolution, suggesting that the system was open to contamination by roof melts. The liquid line of descent corresponding to the Bjerkreim-Sokndal <b>cumulates</b> differs slightly from that obtained for jotunitic dykes in that the most Ti-, P- and Fe-rich melts (evolved jotunite) are lacking. The constant composition of the mafic poles during intervals where cryptic layering is conspicuous is explained by a compositional balance between the Fe-Ti oxide minerals. which decrease in Fe content in favour of Ti. and the pyroxenes which increase in Fe.

40|$|We {{explore a}} model for the {{chemical}} evolution of the lunar interior that explains the origin and evolution of lunar magmatism and possibly the existence of a lunar core.

Any remaining primitive lunar mantle rises to its level of neutral buoyancy in the <b>cumulate</b> pile. Perhaps melting of primitive lunar mantle due to this decompression results in early lunar Mg-rich magmatism.

Variations in <b>cumulate</b> layering attitudes probably resulted from the combined effects of thermal convection phenomena during crystallization and deformation following crystallization but prior to magnetization. Analysis of <b>cumulate</b> layering over larger structural domains indicates that kilometer-scale deformation produced southwest plunging folds within the Hall Cove and Judd Harbor bodies. Bogue et al. [1995] proposed that a compound structural correction involving unplunging of fold axes followed by unfolding of average <b>cumulate</b> layering could restore <b>cumulate</b> layering to horizontal. However, using the full set of 21 site-mean paleomagnetic directions from Duke Island (16 from the current study and 5 from Bogue et al.
