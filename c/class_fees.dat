60|$|The {{doctor was}} boiling over with anger, but Montgomery was a {{valuable}} assistant--steady, capable, and hard-working--and {{he could not}} afford to lose him. Even if he had been prompted to advance those <b>class</b> <b>fees,</b> for which his assistant had appealed, it would have been against his interests to do so, for he did not wish him to qualify, and he desired him to remain in his subordinate position, in which he worked so hard for so small a wage. There was something in the cool insistence of the young man, a quiet resolution in his voice as he claimed his Saturday, which aroused his curiosity.|$|E
60|$|The student smiled bitterly, {{and turned}} to his work of making up the morning prescriptions. It was poor and unworthy work--work which any weakling might have done as well, {{and this was a}} man of {{exceptional}} nerve and sinew. But, such as it was, it brought him his board and One pound a week--enough to help him during the summer months and let him save a few pounds towards his winter keep. But those <b>class</b> <b>fees!</b> Where were they to come from? He could not save them out of his scanty wage. Dr. Oldacre would not advance them. He saw no way of earning them. His brains were fairly good, but brains of that quality were a drug in the market. He only excelled in his strength, and where was he to find a customer for that? But the ways of Fate are strange, and his customer was at hand.|$|E

60|$|Outside, {{through the}} grimy surgery window over a {{foreground}} of blackened brick and slate, {{a line of}} enormous chimneys like Cyclopean pillars upheld the lowering, dun-coloured cloud-bank. For six days in the week they spouted smoke, but to-day the furnace fires were banked, for it was Sunday. Sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man. There {{was nothing in the}} surroundings to cheer a desponding soul, {{but it was more than}} his dismal environment which weighed upon the medical assistant. His trouble was deeper and more personal. The winter session was approaching. He should be back again at the University completing the last year which would give him his medical degree; but, alas! he had not the money with which to pay his <b>class</b> <b>fees,</b> nor could he imagine how he could procure it. Sixty pounds were wanted to make his career, and it might have been as many thousand for any chance there seemed to be of his obtaining it. He was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of Dr. Oldacre himself, a large, clean-shaven, respectable man, with a prim manner and an austere face. He had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local Church interest, and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him. His standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high, and he expected the same from his assistants. His appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent. A sudden impulse came over the despondent student. He would test the reality of this philanthropy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the general equilibrium implications of performance fees linking the compensation of fund managers to {{the return of}} the managed portfolio relative to that of a benchmark portfolio. We find that symmetric (“fulcrum”) performance fees distort the allocation of managed portfolios in a way that induces a significant positive effect on the equilibrium prices of stocks included in the benchmark portfolio, a significant negative effect on their equilibrium Sharpe ratios, and a marginally positive effect on their equilibrium volatilities: these implications of the model are consistent with the available empirical evidence. We also find that asymmetric performance fees can generate the opposite pricing implications. Moreover, asymmetric performance fees result in lower volatilities for benchmark stocks than for nonbenchmark stocks. Finally, we document that, within the <b>class</b> of <b>fee</b> structures we consider, some amount of benchmarking can improve the welfares of fund investors. ...|$|R

40|$|Class action {{lawyers are}} some of the most {{frequently}} derided players in our system of civil litigation. It is often asserted that class action lawyers take too much from <b>class</b> judgments as <b>fees,</b> that <b>class</b> actions are little more than a device for the lawyers to enrich themselves at the expense of the class. In this Article, I argue that some of this criticism of class action lawyers is misguided. In particular, I perform a normative examination of <b>fee</b> percentages in <b>class</b> action litigation using the social-welfarist utilitarian account of litigation known as deterrence-insurance theory. I argue that in perhaps the most common class action [...] the so-called "small stakes" class action [...] class action lawyers not only do not make too much, but actually make too little. Indeed, I argue that it is hard to see as a theoretical matter why lawyers should not receive 100 % of class judgments in small-stakes cases. Of course, it is unlikely that judges in the current political climate will feel comfortable awarding <b>class</b> action lawyers <b>fees</b> equal to 100 % of judgments in any type of class action, small stakes or otherwise. Moreover, it is not entirely clear that judges have the legal authority to award fees at such a level. Nonetheless, even if judges cannot award 100 % of small-stakes judgments to class action lawyers due to political or legal constraints, deterrence-insurance theory suggests that they should award fee percentages as high as they can in small-stakes cases, which, by any measure, are much higher than the percentages they tend to award now. Unfortunately, deterrence-insurance theory is unable to provide judges with as much guidance in large-stakes and mixed-stakes class actions...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} ways of calculating prevailing-party {{attorney}} fees. Most courts recognize that actual costs may be disproportionate and inequitable. Thus, many jurisdictions rely on other calculations. Many courts or laws invoke a lodestar calculation: reasonably expected billable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, sometimes multiplied by a factor reflecting the risk or complexity of the case. Courts in class actions frequently award fees proportionate to the damages recovered. In 2013, a federal court awarded <b>class</b> counsel attorneys <b>fees</b> totaling over $90 million for a $1.25 billion settlement in In Re Black Farmers Discrimination Litigation. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which, among other provisions, regulates the fees that can be awarded in a class action, was passed in response to concerns that courts were not adequately overseeing the award of such fees.|$|R
60|$|A {{review of}} the counts in the {{indictment}} I have brought against private medical practice will show that they arise out of the doctor's position as a competitive private tradesman: that is, out of his poverty and dependence. And it should be borne in mind that doctors are expected to treat other people specially well whilst themselves submitting to specially inconsiderate treatment. The butcher and baker {{are not expected to}} feed the hungry unless the hungry can pay; but a doctor who allows a fellow-creature to suffer or perish without aid is regarded as a monster. Even if we must dismiss hospital service as really venal, the fact remains that most doctors do a good deal of gratuitous work in private practice all through their careers. And in his paid work the doctor is on a different footing to the tradesman. Although the articles he sells, advice and treatment, are the same for all <b>classes,</b> his <b>fees</b> have to be graduated like the income tax. The successful fashionable doctor may weed his poorer patients out from time to time, and finally use the College of Physicians to place it out of his own power to accept low fees; but the ordinary general practitioner never makes out his bills without considering the taxable capacity of his patients.|$|R
