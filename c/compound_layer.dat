Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are an essential part of solder joints. At low levels, they have a strengthening effect on the joint; but at higher levels, they tend to make solder joints more brittle. If the solder joint is subjected to long-standing exposure of high temperature, this could result in continuous growth of intermetallic <b>compound</b> <b>layer.</b> The brittle intermetallic <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formed in this way is very much prone to fracture and cold therefore lead to mechanical and electrical failure of the joint.

In this work, triode plasma nitriding (TPN) was applied to Ti-stabilized interstitial free (IF) steels {{in an attempt to}} increase their hardness without compromising their excellent conformability. Shot peening was also trialed before triode plasma nitriding in an attempt to enhance nitriding kinetics and achieve deeper case depths. Triode plasma nitriding was performed at 450 °C, 475 °C and 500 °C for 4 h on Ti-stabilized IF steel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the steel structure. Instrumented indentation hardness–depth profiles indicated that a significant hardening effect was achieved after plasma nitriding at 500 °C for 4 h. These nitriding conditions doubled the near-surface hardness of the parent IF steel and led to a case depth of 500 μm. Instrumented indentation hardness-profile data also indicated that the shot peening pre-treatment did not have any beneficial effect on nitriding kinetics as a reduction in case depth occurred after this mechanical pre-treatment. Increased surface roughening promoted by shot peening reduced the nitrogen uptake during nitriding. Dry sliding wear tests also corroborated the benefits of plasma nitriding on Ti-stabilized IF steels, as significantly lower wear volumes resulted after this surface hardening treatment. Although oxidative wear was found to occur in all IF steel samples, wear performance was found to be influenced by load support provided by underlying steel substrates and thickness of <b>compound</b> <b>layers.</b> The best wear performance of solely plasma nitrided samples could be attributed to thicker <b>compound</b> <b>layers</b> and deeper hardened cases compared to shot-peened+plasma nitrided samples, which exhibited shallower case depths and thinner <b>compound</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} study, {{we proposed a}} model that describes the formation of thin-film of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces of two immiscible solid layers A and B {{under the influence of}} irradiation. However, we begin our study with a non-irradiation process where we investigate the growth kinetics of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> under the diffusion of one and two kinds of species. This diffusion process takes place by means of one or two transport mechanisms during an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formation process. The results that follow from this investigation reveal a complex growth kinetics of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> under the diffusion of two kinds of species by means of two transport mechanisms. However, the complex growth behaviour transforms to simple linear-parabolic or parabolic growths when only one kind of species diffuse by means of one transport mechanism. In the irradiation aspect of the study, the A and B solid layers (bilayer system) are considered to be bombarded by a beam of light and heavy energetic particles independently under different considerations. We take into account two possibilities during the irradiation of this bilayer system. Firstly, the majority of the kinetic energy of the radiation particles is considered to be converted into heat energy which subsequently results in the heating of the irradiated layers. We assume that the energy transferred from the incident particles to the atoms of the irradiated materials during the course of irradiation is less than their lattice threshold displacement energy. Thus, no defects are generated during this process. The influence of heating that accompanies the irradiation process is investigated to see if it could accelerate the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces of the A and B layers. The second possibility is considered under the presupposition that the kinetic energy transferred by the radiation particles is greater than the lattice threshold displacement energy of the A and B layers; therefore, this process results in defects generation. The contribution of the two basic point defects (i. e. interstitial and vacancy defects), induced by irradiation, towards the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> is studied independently. The results that follow from this study show that the rate of growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces depends on the defect generation rate. The growth rate increases proportionally with the defect generation rate. At high-temperature irradiation, the growth rate depends strongly on both temperature and defect generation rate while at lowtemperature irradiation it depends strongly only on defect generation rate. On the other hand, the radiation heating makes no significant contribution towards the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at low temperature; this is because the dimensions of the A and B layers that are considered in this study are in the order of a few tens of nanometers. Considering the fact that the amount of energy deposited by the radiation particles increases with the thickness of the irradiated layer, less energy is, therefore, deposited in the irradiated layers under the thin film consideration. This reason makes radiation heating a less probable process for an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formation under the influence of irradiation. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.
