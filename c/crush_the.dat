5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} Macrinus dispatched his Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus to {{the region}} with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head {{was sent back to}} the emperor.|$|E

5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the operculum.|$|E

The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a start date of 18 May.|$|E

5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, {{who lost their}} properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly {{to regain control}} of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|Renoart of Nephin pillaged the {{countryside}} and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle {{at the gates of}} the town.

He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar {{before the end of the}} year, forcing Renart to flee to Cyprus. Before long, Bohemond returned to Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E

5|$|The Tank Corps {{was formed}} as the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps in 1916. Tanks {{were used for}} the first time in action in the battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. The {{intention}} being that they would <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> barbed wire for the infantry, then cross the trenches and exploit any breakthrough behind the German lines. In November 1916, they were renamed the Heavy Branch MGC and in June 1917, the Tank Corps.|$|E
5|$|The show of {{solidarity}} between the sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{war against}} Bulgaria {{was the first}} major {{undertaking}} carried out by Basil II after his ascension to the throne in 976, although the Bulgarian attacks had begun in that year. One {{of the reasons for the}} ten years of inaction was the policy of one of the strongest nobles in Byzantium, Basil, who de facto ruled the Byzantine Empire in the first years of his namesake. During that time, the main objective of the government in Constantinople was to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> rebellion of the military commander Bardas Skleros in Asia Minor between 976 and 979.|$|E

5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez was a monarchist {{at heart}} and he despaired when King Louis XVI {{went to the}} {{guillotine}} on 21 January 1793. He found the political situation in Paris to be chaotic. He was appalled at the tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders. Having already negotiated with the enemy, Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March. The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris. He would overthrow the National Convention, <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791. For their part, the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup. But Dumouriez moved too slowly. On 1 April, four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris. They were seized and {{handed over to the}} Austrians.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
