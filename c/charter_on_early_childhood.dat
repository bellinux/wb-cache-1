50|$|He was {{a leader}} in Canada on {{questions}} about the socioeconomic determinants of human development and health. A particular emphasis was <b>on</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> {{and the role of}} communities. In the late 1990s, he co-chaired a seminal report, with former New Brunswick Lieutenant Governor, Margaret McCain, for the Government of Ontario <b>on</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> learning. The report was issued as The Early Years Study - Reversing the Real Brain Drain on April 20, 1999. The report emphasized promoting early child development centres for young children and parents; boost spending <b>on</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> education to the same levels as kids in K to 12; focus on programs that are available to all income levels, because even the middle-class children need these services; and encourage local parent groups and businesses to set up these programs instead of the government, when possible. Recognition of this led Dr. Mustard and his colleagues to emphasize to all sectors of society the crucial nature of the early years to provide a healthy and competent population.|$|R
