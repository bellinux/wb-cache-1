2500|$|Assimilation into Canadian {{culture was}} {{the norm for}} nearly all European immigrants, {{according}} to Prokop (1989). [...] An important indicator of assimilation {{was the use of}} English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the government faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization. [...] However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically [...] used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta {{played a central role in}} the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a <b>community</b> <b>character</b> that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition.|$|E

50|$|According to Ellacuría, {{the value}} of the Old Testament is not reduced with the New Testament. The New Testament makes the <b>community</b> <b>character</b> of faith from the Old Testament {{something}} radical and universal. It makes it radical, because it establishes that the alliance of God with people {{is much more than a}} simple code of laws and lithurgical rituals; it is an invitation to justice and charity, not as exceptional practices, but as a stable structure. That is why this alliance is established in a law. It mates the faith universal, because the New Testament is communicated to every human being, independently of race, culture, sex, religion or social condition.|$|E
