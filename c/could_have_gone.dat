After in-home visits from Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell {{ultimately}} chose Texas.

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E
5|$|The Kokinshū, Tales of Ise and Tales of Yamato all {{describe}} Narihira leaving Kyoto {{to travel}} east through the Tōkaidō region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see utamakura) along the way. The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical likelihood that a courtier <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E

5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone.</b> While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy. That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

25|$|As per Smith's and Strachey's reports, Dr. David Beers Quinn {{theorized that}} the colonists moved north to {{integrate}} with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan {{claimed to have}} killed. To make the journey northward, Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings.

25|$|After {{in-orbit}} {{activation of}} the ATV's propulsion system about two hours after launch, {{the second of the}} four Propulsion Drive Electronics (PDE) units, which controlled a quarter of the ATV's maneuvering thrusters, reported an unexpected difference in the mixing pressure between the fuel and the oxidiser. Engine burns were briefly postponed while the fault was investigated. A restart of the entire propulsion system by the ATV Control Centre in Toulouse, France, resolved the problem. The ESA reported that the mission <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> ahead even if one quarter of the maneuvering thrusters had been unavailable.|$|E
25|$|The Warriors <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{second in}} the Pura Cup table if they had managed to force a win {{on the final day}} against the Redbacks, having earned a three-run first innings lead when Steve Magoffin had Dan Cullen caught behind for six midway through day three. Effectively 88 for three overnight, the Warriors lost nightwatchman Beau Casson and Adam Voges in the first session, but Marcus North and Dave Bandy batted out four hours in a 211-run fifth-wicket partnership. The Warriors batted out the day to draw the game, and were thus third, with a chance to qualify with a win in the final round at the Bushrangers.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategy}} of the German colonial forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel (later Generalmajor) Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, was to divert Allied forces from the Western Front to Africa. His strategy achieved only mixed results after 1916, when he was driven out of German East Africa and Allied forces became composed almost entirely of South African, Indian and other colonial troops. Black South African troops were not considered for European service {{as a matter of}} policy, while all Indian units had been withdrawn from the Western Front by the end of 1915; the campaign in Africa consumed considerable amounts of money and war material that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to other fronts.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, CNN, in {{partnership}} with corporate sister Time magazine, ran a report that Operation Tailwind in 1970 in Vietnam included use of Sarin gas to kill a group of defectors from the United States military.

Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky atrocity <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War's unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story's producers were summarily fired, and one of them has been highly critical of CNN's handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.|$|E

25|$|The Pacers {{finished}} the 2006–07 season {{as one of}} the worst seasons in team history. For the Pacers, who finished with a 35–47 record, nearly everything that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong did. The turning point of the season would be an 11-game losing streak that started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and Marquis Daniels, a lack of a solid back up point guard, the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive efforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs {{for the first time since}} the 1996–97 season.|$|E
25|$|India {{started the}} second innings 231 runs ahead and {{requiring}} quick runs {{to force a}} result. Sehwag (47), Dravid (91*) and Tendulkar (60*) all contributed, as India raced to 211 in 43 overs to set Australia 443 to win. Four overs {{at the end of}} the fourth day produced no wickets and Australia had to play out the last day to save the test, while India needed 10 wickets to win. The Australian batting responded well under pressure, with Langer, Ponting and Martyn scoring forties. But at 4–196, with more than one session to go, the match <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> either way. However Steve Waugh, playing his last test, and Simon Katich put the match out of India's reach. Waugh scored 80 and Katich was unbeaten on 77 as the match was drawn despite 4 more wickets for Kumble which gave him 12 wickets for the match itself. Despite Kumble's efforts on a flat wicket, Sachin Tendulkar was Man of the Match for his unbeaten scores of 241 and 60 in the match. The series score was maintained at 1–1.|$|E
25|$|Although Eugene <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> south {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Turkish war, he chose instead to conduct operations from Vienna; but Austria's military effort in Sicily proved derisory, and Eugene's chosen commanders, Zum Jungen, and later Count Mercy, performed poorly. It was only from pressure exerted by the French army advancing into the Basque provinces of northern Spain in April 1719, and the British Navy's attacks on the Spanish fleet and shipping, that compelled Philip V and Elisabeth to dismiss Alberoni and join the Quadruple Alliance on 25 January 1720. Nevertheless, the Spanish attacks had strained Charles VI's government, causing tension between the Emperor and his Spanish Council on the one hand, and the conference, headed by Eugene, on the other. Despite Charles VI's own personal ambitions in the Mediterranean it was clear to the Emperor that Eugene had put the safeguarding of his conquests in Hungary before everything else, and that military failure in Sicily also had to rest on Eugene. Consequently, the Prince's influence over the Emperor declined considerably.|$|E

25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then had suddenly been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent re-analysis of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological precipitation data and field measurements, including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing year-on-year melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. year-on-year accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E
25|$|Blues' {{first game}} in October saw them return to Ewood Park {{for the second}} time in eleven days. Goals from David Bentley and Benni McCarthy saw Blackburn take a two-goal lead, before Cameron Jerome struck to give the Blues a lifeline, but there was to be no comeback. It ended in a 2–1 win for Blackburn Rovers, leaving Birmingham 13th in the league table after nine games played. Thirteen days later a trip to Manchester City was next on the agenda for the Blues, where a 37th-minute goal from Elano saw the points stay in Manchester. The last game of the month was a crucial bottom of the table clash with Wigan Athletic at St Andrew's. A Marcus Bent goal in the 23rd minute was {{cancelled}} out three minutes later when Kapo scored from a penalty. After half time, Bent was able to recover Wigan's lead before they were pegged back again, this time by a goal scored by Birmingham defender Liam Ridgewell. The game <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> either way before Kapo struck again, this time in the 81st minute leaving Wigan no chance to come back. It was Birmingham's third win of the season, and at the end of the month they were in 13th position with 11 points.|$|E
25|$|When league {{football}} {{returned to}} the Riverside for the derby clash with Sunderland, a lot {{had happened in the}} interim. The club had recorded an overdue victory – against Barrow in the FA Cup (see FA Cup section), with Afonso Alves getting back amongst the goals, while the transfer window had seen Stewart Downing's transfer request rejected along with offers from Tottenham, while Portsmouth's moves for Gary O'Neil had all been rebuffed. Josh Walker made his full league debut, starting in central midfield – more than two years after his substitute appearance in the last game of 2005–06, and Downing played centrally, supporting Alves. Downing and Alves linked up well to put Boro ahead before half time. The central midfield partnership of Walker and Digard were both forced off with injuries picked up from opposition challenges, meaning Matthew Bates was pushed into an unfamiliar central midfield role. Sunderland pressed more and more in the second half, and got their equaliser courtesy of Kenwyne Jones. The visitors <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to win the game but Adam Johnson made a backheeled clearance off the goal line, and McMahon won a last-ditch tackle on Djibril Cissé after he was put through on goal on the stroke of full-time. The 1–1 draw extended Boro's winless run to nine games.|$|E
