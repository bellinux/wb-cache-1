50|$|A {{fan filter}} unit (FFU) {{is a type of}} {{motorized}} air filtering equipment. It is used to supply purified air to cleanrooms, laboratories, medical facilities or microenvironments by removing harmful airborne particles from recirculating air. The units are installed within the system's ceiling or floor grid. Large cleanrooms require a proportionally large number of FFUs, which in some cases may range from several hundred to several thousand. Units often contain their own pre-filter, HEPA filter and internally <b>controllable</b> <b>fan</b> air distribution.|$|E
50|$|Motherboards are {{generally}} air cooled with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips, {{such as the}} Northbridge, in modern motherboards. Insufficient or improper cooling can cause damage to the internal components of the computer, or cause it to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPU's until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on their heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional case fans and integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures and <b>controllable</b> <b>fan</b> connectors which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. Alternatively computers can use a water cooling system instead of many fans.|$|E
40|$|The Ventilationjet {{system is}} used to {{dehumidify}} a greenhouse with a fully closed blackout screen during the night. Gerbera producer Zuijderwijk and Witzier in the Netherlands uses this equipment but was not satisified with the duhumidification capacity since the RH was rising to unwanted levels. That forced him to pull {{a gap in the}} screens but that resulted in local temperature drops and botrytis. In this research project the cause of the high humidity was found {{to be the result of}} a combination of unwanted transpiration from the floor area and a limited air supply through the screens as a result of a turbulent flow in the outlet of the fans. The problem was fixed by developing a new version of the Ventilationjet where the air was supplied through a vertical duct instead of a simple round opening in the screens. Also the air supply capacity was increased from 3 m 3 /m 2. hr to 14 m 3 / m 2. hr with a speed <b>controllable</b> <b>fan.</b> In addition, measures were taken to prevent humid, warm air to reach the area above the blackout screen by guiding this air to a central opening in the screen above the concrete path in the middle of the greenhouse. The ventilation windows above this ventilation gap in the screen release this humid air to the outside world, without causing a temperature drop since the fans create an overpressure...|$|E
40|$|Tests of a {{full scale}} {{variable}} pitch fan engine to obtain data on the structural characteristics, response times, and fan/core engine compatibility during transient changes in blade angle, fan rpm, and engine power is reported. Steady state reverse thrust tests with a take off nozzle configuration were also conducted. The 1. 4 meter diameter, 13 bladed <b>controllable</b> pitch <b>fan</b> was driven by a T 55 L 11 A engine with power and blade angle coordinated by a digital computer. The tests demonstrated an ability to change from full forward thrust to reverse thrust in less than one (1) second. Reverse thrust was effected through feather and through flat pitch; structural characteristics and engine/fan compatibility were within satisfactory limits...|$|R
40|$|Virtual Teratak, a 3 D virtual home {{navigation}} and control {{system is designed}} and developed to complement or replace existing remote controls, allowing home users to control networkconnectable devices such as <b>controllable</b> lights, televisions, <b>fans,</b> etc. easily and conveniently with Android-based smartphones. The system is augmented with actual photos of the home so that users can control home devices more intuitively. A 3 D virtual home navigation interface is also implemented with WebGL and HTML 5 running on web browsers, which enable the users {{to have a more}} immersive experience in controlling their home appliances. Users can thus navigate the 3 D virtual home, touch the 3 D virtual appliances and control the actual appliances easily. Virtual Teratak has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Digital Home located within Multimedia University, Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that fires in the low-gravity {{environment}} of Earth-orbiting spacecraft are different from fires on Earth. The flames lack the familiar upward plume, which is the result of gravitational buoyancy. These flames, however, are strongly influenced by minor airflow currents. A recent study conducted in low gravity (microgravity) on the Russian orbital station Mir used burning plastic rods mounted in a small chamber with a <b>controllable</b> <b>fan</b> to expose the flame to airflows of different velocities. In this unique project, a Russian scientific agency, the Keldysh Research Center, furnished the apparatus and directed the Mir tests, while the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field provided the test materials and the project management. Reference testing and calibrations in ground laboratories were conducted jointly by researchers at Keldysh and at the NASA Johnson Space Center's White Sands Test Facility. Multiple samples of three different plastics were burned in the tests: Delrin, a common material for valve bodies; PMMA, a plastic "glass"; and polyethylene, a familiar material for containers and films. Each burned with a unique spherical or egg-shaped flame that spread over the rod. The effect of varying the airflow was dramatic. At the highest airflow attainable in the combustion chamber, nearly 10 cm/sec (a typical ventilation breeze), the flames were bright and strong. As airflow velocity decreased, the flames became shorter but wider. In addition, the flames became less bright, and for PMMA and polyethylene, they showed two colors, a bright part decreasing in volume and a nearly invisible remainder (see the photographs). Finally, at a very low velocity, the flames extinguished. For the plastics tested, this minimum velocity was very low, around 0. 3 to 0. 5 cm/sec. This finding confirms that at least a slight airflow is required to maintain a flame in microgravity for these types of materials...|$|E
