40|$|Rapid mass {{movements}} (RMM) pose {{a substantial}} risk {{to people and}} infrastructure. Reliable and cost-efficient measures {{have to be taken}} to reduce this risk. One of these measures includes establishing and advancing the state of practice in the application of early warning systems (EWSs). EWSs have been developed during the past decades and are rapidly increasing. In this paper, we focus on the technical part of EWSs, i. e., the prediction and timely recognition of imminent hazards, as well as on monitoring slopes at risk and released mass movements. Recent innovations in assessing spatial precipitation, monitoring and precursors of the triggering and deformation of RMM offer new opportunities for next-generation EWSs. However, technical advancement can only be transferred into more reliable, operational EWSs with an adequate well-instructed dedicated staff. To this end, an intense dialog between scientists, engineers and those in <b>charge</b> of <b>warning,</b> as well as further experience with new comprehensive prototype systems jointly operated by scientists and practitioners, will be essential...|$|R

40|$|Warnings and {{emergency}} planning for flooding {{are based on}} the reality that no matter how thorough our investigations and flood prevention efforts through engineered structural works or land use management, some risk will always remain. This paper examines recent experience with flood warnings in the UK and continental Europe. It combines this experience with an overview of the relevant literature to identify lessons for incorporation into policy, and problem areas which would most obviously benefit from additional research. Throughout, the emphasis is on the non-engineering aspects of warning systems. Results indicate that much is being achieved in terms of the detail of warning design, but the broader issues seem to be largely ignored by both the research literature and practice. First among these broader issues is the failure, by those <b>charged</b> with <b>warning</b> system development and operation, to conceptualise the warning task as one based explicitly on the needs of those at risk. Making this happen will require the development of processes to build the necessary culture of cooperation and learning among the many organisations involved...|$|R

Catharine took the list, and there, to her surprise and indignation, she saw the dreaded name of Lady Castlemaine at the head of it.|$|R
40|$|Cyclones {{continue}} {{to pose a}} dangerous threat to the coastal populations of Bangladesh, despite improvements in disaster control procedures. After 138 000 persons died in the April 1991 cyclone, we carried out a rapid epidemiological assessment to determine factors associated with cyclone-related mortality and to identify prevention strategies. A nonrandom survey of 45 housing clusters comprising 1123 persons showed that mortality was greatest among under- 10 -year-olds (26 %) and women older than 40 years (31 %). Nearly 22 % of persons who did not reach a concrete or brick structure died, whereas all persons who sought refuge in such structures survived. Future cyclone-associated mortality in Bangladesh could be prevented by more effective warnings leading to an earlier response, better access to designated cyclone shelters, and improved preparedness in high-risk communities. In particu-lar, deaths among women and under- 10 -year-olds could be reduced by ensuring that they are given special attention by families, neighbours, local authorities, and especially those in <b>charge</b> of early <b>warnings</b> and emergency evacuation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrological}} model GRP {{has been}} developed at IRSTEA for almost 10 years. GRP was conceived to simulate continuous rainfall-runoff transformation and assimilate real-time discharge data, meeting a good compromise in terms of parsimony, efficiency, robustness and simplicity. The operational forecast platform containing GRP is managed by the French central hydrometeorological service for flood forecasting (SCHAPI). This platform is currently used {{by more than half}} of the local flood forecasting services (SPC). The objective of this paper is to present the evolution of the GRP model, focusing on the dynamics of transferring research results to operational services. Many research projects have been carried out to enhance the model performance and provide new functionalities. The feedback from the forecasters in <b>charge</b> of flood <b>warning</b> in the operational services is also constantly assessed to better adapt the system to their needs. This has revealed to be a valuable source of interaction to better develop not only the model and its mathematical representation but also the operational products intended to support decisions...|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} hide on the pieces they selected, as {{they use it}} for sandals, shield-covers, the hilts of their knives and various other {{purposes}} where tough hide is desirable. I was much interested in their shields, especially after I saw one used in defense against the attack of a saber-tooth tiger. The huge creature had <b>charged</b> us without <b>warning</b> from a clump of dense bushes where it was lying up after eating. It was met with an avalanche of spears, some of which passed entirely through its body, with such force were they hurled. The charge was from a very short distance, requiring {{the use of the}} spear rather than the bow and arrow; but after the launching of the spears, the men not directly {{in the path of the}} charge sent bolt after bolt into the great carcass with almost incredible rapidity. The beast, screaming with pain and rage, bore down upon Chal-az while I stood helpless with my rifle for fear of hitting one of the warriors who were closing in upon it. But Chal-az was ready. Throwing aside his bow, he crouched behind his large oval shield, in the center of which was a hole about six inches in diameter. The shield was held by tight loops to his left arm, while in his right hand he grasped his heavy knife. Bristling with spears and arrows, the great cat hurled itself upon the shield, and down went Chal-az upon his back with the shield entirely covering him. The tiger clawed and bit at the heavy rhinoceros hide with which the shield was faced, while Chal-az, through the round hole in the shield's center, plunged his blade repeatedly into the vitals of the savage animal. Doubtless the battle would have gone to Chal-az even though I had not interfered; but the moment that I saw a clean opening, with no Kro-lu beyond, I raised my rifle and killed the beast.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCascading {{uncertainty}} in meteo-hydrological modelling chains for forecasting and integrated flood risk assessment {{is an essential}} step {{to improve the quality of}} hydrological forecasts. Although the best methodology to quantify the total predictive {{uncertainty in}} hydrology is still debated, there is a common agreement that one must avoid uncertainty misrepresentation and miscommunication, as well as misinterpretation of information by users. Several recent studies point out that uncertainty, when properly explained and defined, is no longer unwelcome among emergence response organizations, users of flood risk information and the general public. However, efficient communication of uncertain hydro-meteorological forecasts is far from being a resolved issue. This study focuses on the interpretation and communication of uncertain hydrological forecasts based on (uncertain) meteorological forecasts and (uncertain) rainfall-runoff modelling approaches to decision-makers such as operational hydrologists and water managers in <b>charge</b> of flood <b>warning</b> and scenario-based reservoir operation. An overview of the typical flow of uncertainties and risk-based decisions in hydrological forecasting systems is presented. The challenges related to the extraction of meaningful information from probabilistic forecasts and the test of its usefulness in assisting operational flood forecasting are illustrated with the help of two case-studies: 1) a study on the use and communication of probabilistic flood forecasting within the European Flood Alert System; 2) a case-study on the use of probabilistic forecasts by operational forecasters from the hydroelectricity company EDF in France. These examples show that attention must be paid to initiatives that promote or reinforce the active participation of expert forecasters in the forecasting chain. The practice of face-to-face forecast briefings, focusing on sharing how forecasters interpret, describe and perceive the model output forecasted scenarios, is essential. We believe that the efficient communication of uncertainty in hydro-meteorological forecasts is not a mission impossible. Questions remaining unanswered in probabilistic hydrological forecasting should not neutralize the goal of such a mission, and the suspense kept should instead act as a catalyst for overcoming the remaining challenges...|$|R
