40|$|Current {{treatment}} for coronary stent thrombosis (ST) often lacks satisfactory results and clinical outcome is poor. We investigated {{the impact of}} manual thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on myocardial reperfusion and clinical outcome in patients with angiographically proved ST. We interrogated our PCI registry for patients with a first stent placement from January 2002 through May 2010 who had undergone an emergency repeated PCI procedure and systematically <b>reviewed</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> and hospital records for evidence of ST. We identified 113 patients with ST. Thrombus aspiration was used in 51 patients and 62 patients received conventional PCI. Histopathologic analysis of thrombus aspirates was performed in 6 patients. Use of thrombus aspiration predicted postprocedure Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow (odds ratio 3. 16, 95 % confidence interval 1. 22 to 8. 17, p = 0. 018) and myocardial blush grade 2 / 3 (odds ratio 3. 20, 95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 8. 55, p = 0. 020) after multivariable adjustment with bootstrap model selection. Distal embolization was lower in the thrombus aspiration group compared to the conventional PCI group (14 % vs 37 %, p = 0. 017). In most patients, aspirated thrombus was large and contained platelet and erythrocyte components at histopathologic analysis. Mortality in the thrombus aspiration group and conventional PCI group was 9. 8 % versus 16 % at 30 days (p = 0. 351) and 12 % versus 21 % at 1 year (p = 0. 220), respectively. In conclusion, use of manual thrombus aspiration in patients with ST was associated with greater epicardial and microvascular myocardial reperfusion. In addition, mortality was lower in patients treated with thrombus aspiration, although not statistically significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Aim: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is one of}} the most {{frequent}} causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the anatomical diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis. Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS) is a non-invasive imaging modality used for the diagnosis of CAD. In this study, we aimed to compare the findings of MPS and <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> Material and Method: Eighty-one patients (37 males, 44 females; mean age 55 ± 10. 95 years) with angina and detected perfusion defects on MPS were included in this study. All of the patients underwent <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> A narrowing %u 2265 50 % was considered pathological on the coronary angiography. Results: Findings of the <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> and MPS were compared and found consistent in 51 (63 %) patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{improve the}} {{characterisation}} of chest pain by comparing symptoms {{in patients with}} normal and abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Single tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS: 65 consecutive patients with chest pain and completely normal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> recruited {{over a period of}} one year, and 65 sex matched patients with significant stenoses at angiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised chest pain questionnaires. RESULTS: 61 of 65 patients (94 %) and every control reported chest pain on exertion. There were no important differences in the site, quality, and radiation of pain but three symptoms had discriminatory value expressed in binary fashion ("typical" v "atypical") : the consistency with which pain was reproduced by exercise (typical, score index 10 / 10), the duration of pain episodes (typical, five minutes), and the frequency of pain at rest (typical, 10 % all pain episodes). All three symptoms were atypical in 21 (32 %) patients with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms,</b> but only one patient with an abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> Patients with no typical features had a 2 % chance of an abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> if aged under 55 years or 12 % if aged 55 years or more. The additional impact of exercise stress testing was low. CONCLUSIONS: Chest pain characteristics which separate patients with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> from patients with obstructive coronary heart disease can be defined objectively.

40|$|For {{accurate}} {{analysis of}} serial <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> {{in a given}} patient over time, {{it is important to}} acquire paired angiograms recorded in exactly the same condition. Using the automatic gantry setting, we evaluated the geometric reproducibility of <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> and the reproducibility of vessel measurements in serial quantitative <b>coronary</b> angiography. <b>Coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> of 40 patitents who underwent PTCA were analyzed before PTCA, after PTCA (medium-term) and at follow-up (long-term). The geometric reproducibility of <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> was assessed by comparing 120 angles between the major coronary branches. Reproducibility on vessel analysis was evaluated by measuring the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of 120 non-dilated segments. Differences in the angles of the X-ray gantry were small and the standard deviation of the differences was not more than 0. 5 degrees. The differences in the measurements of the angles between the major coronary branches were 0. 1 ± 1. 2 degrees in the same frame pre-PTCA, 0. 1 ± 3. 4 degrees between pre- and post-PTCA, and 0. 8 ± 4. 7 degrees between pre-PTCA and at follow-up. The differences in MLD were 0. 01 ± 0. 10, 0. 01 ± 0. 17, and 0. 05 ± 0. 19 mm, respectively. The automatic gantry setting provides good reproductibility of the X-ray imaging position.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{influence}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on contrast-induced renal toxicity has been poorly studied. Nevertheless, it {{is a common}} practice in many centers to stop these drugs before coronarography. Our goal was to study whether renal function was affected in patients taking ACEIs or ARBs and undergoing a <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> METHODS: Patients on ACEIs or ARBs (n= 17) and those not on ACEIs or ARBs (n= 18) admitted for a <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> underwent glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) assessment either by isotopic clearances (51 Cr-EDTA and MAG 3) or inulin and paraimmuno-hippurate clearances 24 hours prior to and immediately after <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> RESULTS: Median percentage GFR changes induced by the injection of contrast medium during <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> were - 9 % (interquartile range - 19 % to + 3 %) in the control group and - 1 % (interquartile range - 9 % to + 39 %) in the ACEI/ARB group. Mean ERPF remained stable after coronarography in the control group (median change - 8 %; interquartile range - 18 % to + 6 %) and increased slightly in the ACEI/ARB group (median change + 9 %; interquartile range - 17 % to + 60 %). The median percentage difference in EPRF change was not statistically significant between the 2 groups (p= 0. 18).

40|$|Introduction: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) among women is an ignored entity in India. The {{aim of this}} study was to {{evaluate}} the role of hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) on the extent of CAD in women, admitted with ischemic chest pain. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data of female patients admitted with chest pain suspected of cardiac origin and then underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. We obtained the ages, blood pressures, blood sugar levels, and angiographic findings of these patients after analyzing the patient records and <b>reviewing</b> the <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms.</b> Results: We studied 163 female patients with a mean age of 58 ± 10. 5 years. Of them, 71 (43. 5 %) had HT, 46 (28 %) had DM, and 46 patients (28 %) had neither HT nor DM. DM prevalence was higher (12 / 25, 48. 0 %) among women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as compared to those with non-STEMI (6 / 26, 23. 1 %) or unstable angina (28 / 112, 25. 0 %; P = 0. 06). In contrast, a higher proportion of the women with unstable angina had neither HT nor DM. Coronary angiography revealed a significant CAD in 86 (52. 8 %) women. Of them, 34 had DM (odds ratio: 3. 542, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 669 - 7. 516, P = 0. 001) and forty had HT (odds ratio: 1. 290, 95 % CI: 0. 693 - 2. 404, P = 0. 422) while 12 had neither of the two risk factors. Triple vessel disease was more common in women > 50 years of age, but the relationship between risk factors and CAD remained same in both the age groups. Conclusion: We conclude that increasing age along with DM is major risk factors for CAD among women. However, while older women tend to present with more extensive CAD, presentation with noncritical CAD or normal coronaries and muscle bridge is more common in younger women with suspected acute coronary event...|$|R
