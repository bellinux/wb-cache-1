5000|$|A {{postage stamp}} was {{proposed}} {{to be issued}} by Indonesia on the rich flora and fauna of its provinces. It was proposed to issue 33 stamps in succession between 2008 and 2011. In 2008 the series issued represented the province of Bali with the stamp depicting floral species of Dysoxylum densiflorum, known as Majegau in Indonesian language. The stamp issue described the qualities of this species as [...] "one of woods commonly used for Balinese <b>carving</b> <b>material</b> thanks to its strength and beautiful colour and pattern".

50|$|Other {{materials}} besides rubber {{may be used}} {{to produce}} a stamp. Woodcut and linocut, the carving of linoleum, are art forms based on the same principles. Linoleum is much harder than rubber and thus requires special tools. Woodcut is mostly used by professional artists, requiring much talent and patience. Rubber <b>carving</b> <b>material</b> can be purchased, but is marketed as a child's toy and not widely used. Additionally, photopolymer stamps are growing in popularity. They are most often produced in a set of coordinated images using a clear polymer material on an acetate carrier sheet for storage and packaging. The stamps are peeled from the carrier sheet and applied to a clear acrylic handle. This allows the stamper to view the image through the handle and effect precise placement of the image where desired. Photopolymer stamps are generally produced in the United States for sale domestically and internationally. Similar clear stamps made of silicone are produced by U.S. companies in China. Silicone stamps have many of the same properties of the photopolymer stamps. The production of clear stamps makes storage of a large collection of images easier, since they are all used with just one set of various sized handles. They are also often very economical being produced in sets of several images which work together to form a cohesive look.|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th-century {{unglazed}} terracotta, {{which had}} long been used for preliminary clay models or maquettes that were then fired, became fashionable as a material for small sculptures including portrait busts.

[...] Claude Michel (1738-1814), known as Clodion, was an influential pioneer in France. [...] John Michael Rysbrack (1694-1770), a Flemish portrait sculptor working in England, sold his terracotta modelli for larger works in stone, and produced busts only in terracotta. [...] In the next century the French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day.|$|R
50|$|The {{surgeons}} {{placed a}} tube in Novemthree's trachea {{to allow him}} to breathe while removing the majority of his tumours. The surgeons would have to cut the tumors in three different surgeries and re-sculpt his face by <b>carving</b> the tumour <b>material</b> left behind because the tumors had destroyed much of his facial structure: the <b>carved</b> <b>material</b> {{was the only way to}} provide support. The first surgery was performed on Novemthree's left cheek, giving him sight in his left eye. The second surgery performed was to excise the tumor under his chin. The third surgery excised the tumour in his mouth and nasal cavity as well as the one in his right cheek. With the majority of the masses removed with each surgery, the remaining <b>material</b> was <b>carved</b> by a plastic surgeon with chisels and an electric saw to sculpt out facial features. In spite of doubts from the surgical team, he regained sight in his right eye as well; the tumor had prevented his sight via pressure on the optic nerve. The final surgery would resize Novemthree's mouth, and reconstruct his face to approximate normality.|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 54 - 58. In this study, {{we propose}} a virtual reality application {{that can be}} utilized to design preliminary/conceptual models similar to real world clay sculpting. The proposed system makes use of the innovative gestural interface that enhances {{the experience of the}} human-computer interaction. The gestural interface employs advanced motion capture hardware namely data gloves and six-degrees-of-freedom position tracker instead of classical input devices like keyboard or mouse. The design process takes place in the virtual environment that contains volumetric deformable model, design tools and a virtual hand that is driven by the data glove and the tracker. The users manipulate the design tools and the deformable model via the virtual hand. The deformation on the model is done by stuffing or <b>carving</b> <b>material</b> (voxels) in or out of the model {{with the help of the}} tools or directly by the virtual hand. The virtual sculpting system also includes volumetric force feedback indicator that provides visual aid. We also offer a mouse like interaction approach in which the users can still interact with conventional graphical user interface items such as buttons with the data glove and tracker. The users can also control the application with gestural commands thanks to our real time trajectory based dynamic gesture recognition algorithm. The gesture recognition technique exploits a fast learning mechanism that does not require extensive training data to teach gestures to the system. For recognition, gestures are represented as an ordered sequence of directional movements in 2 D. In the learning phase, sample gesture data is filtered and processed to create gesture recognizers, which are basically finite-state machine sequence recognizers. We achieve real time gesture recognition by these recognizers without needing to specify gesture start and end points. The results of the conducted user study show that the proposed method is very promising in terms of gesture detection and recognition performance (73...|$|E

40|$|Sunken {{relief is}} a special art form of {{sculpture}} whereby the depicted shapes are sunk into a given surface. This is traditionally created by laboriously <b>carving</b> <b>materials</b> such as stone. Sunken reliefs often utilize the engraved lines or strokes to strengthen the impressions of a 3 D presence and to highlight the features which otherwise are unrevealed. In other types of relief, smooth surfaces and their shadows convey such information in a coherent manner. Existing methods for relief generation are focused on forming a smooth surface with a shallow depth which provides the presence of 3 D figures. Such methods unfortunately do not help the art form of sunken reliefs as they omit the presence of feature lines. We propose a framework to produce sunken reliefs from a known 3 D geometry, which transforms the 3 D objects into three layers of input to incorporate the contour lines seamlessly with the smooth surfaces. The three input layers take {{the advantages of the}} geometric information and the visual cues to assist the relief generation. We have modified the existing techniques of line drawings and relief generation, and then combine them organically for this particular purpose...|$|R
