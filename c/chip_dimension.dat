The number of repeaters inserted into interconnects is expected to be enormous due to the ever-increasing <b>chip</b> <b>dimension.</b> The huge number of repeaters can take up significant silicon area and consume a lot of power. Consequently, minimization of power consumption of repeaters with timing closure constraints is a very important problem in future low-power VLSI design. In this dissertation, we investigate efficient schemes for low-power repeater insertion on global interconnects. We first analyze key issues on repeater library design by introducing an analyti-cal low-power repeater insertion algorithm for uniform two-pin interconnects. Our study leads to the answer of how to design a compact repeater library for low-power in early design stages. We then discuss several low-power repeater insertion schemes under given timing constraints. These schemes achieve a better trade-off between solution quality and runtime than previously proposed approaches. To handle the signal integrity problem while performing repeater insertion, we next present a novel low-power repeater insertion scheme under both timing and signal slew rate con-straints. The proposed scheme is able to capture both delay and slew rate information, resulting in high quality interconnect designs. Besides the repeater insertion algorithms for given intercon-nects, we also describe a simple yet effective power macromodel for global interconnects with the consideration of low-power repeater insertion.
