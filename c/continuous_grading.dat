This paper studies the permeability and mechanical properties of pervious concrete affected by the aggregate gradation.

40|$|Three {{different}} routes {{were used}} to infiltrate the pores of anodic porous alumina templates with silver nanoparticles, selected {{as an example of}} a bioactive agent. The three methods present a <b>continuous</b> <b>grading</b> from more physical to more chemical character, starting from ex situ filling of the pores with pre-existing particles, moving on to in situ formation of particles in the pores by bare calcination and ending with in situ calcination following specific chemical reactions. The resulting presence of silver inside the pores was assessed by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The number and the size of nanoparticles were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy of functionalized alumina cross-sections, followed by image analysis. It appears that the best functionalization results are obtained with the in situ chemical procedure, based on the prior formation of silver ion complex by means of ammonia, followed by reduction with an excess amount of acetaldehyde.

It {{does not seem to}} be possible to explain this phenomenon using a suitable extension of the Schur-Weyl duality to infinite dimension. We suggest an explanation of a different nature that does not have analogs in the classical representation theory. We start from the combinatorial/probabilistic approach to characters of "big" groups initiated by Vershik and Kerov. In this approach, the space of extreme characters is viewed as a boundary of a certain infinite graph. In the cases of S(infinity) and U(infinity), those are the Young graph and the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph, respectively. We introduce a new related object that we call the Young bouquet.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal loading on the {{performance}} of the graded materials has been studied. In this study, two types of graded materials have been considered: 1) <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> materials 2) sandwich graded materials. For the first part, a transient analysis of a mixed mode dynamic crack in <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> materials under thermo-mechanical loading was performed. Later, the effect of low and high temperature on the blast performance of sandwich graded materials was investigated. ^ Asymptotic analysis in conjunction with displacement potentials are used to develop thermo-mechanical stress fields for a mixed mode propagating crack in a <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> material. The crack is assumed to propagate at an angle with respect to the gradation direction. Asymptotic temperature field equations are derived for exponentially varying thermal properties, and these equations were then used to develop various temperature fields around the crack-tip. Later, these temperature fields were used in deriving thermo-mechanical stress fields. Using asymptotic thermo-mechanical stress fields, the effect of temperature field and transient parameters (loading rate, crack-tip acceleration, temperature change) on the contours of maximum principal stress and circumferential stress is discussed. Also, the effect of different temperature fields on the crack extension angle was studied. ^ High strain rate constitutive behavior of E-glass Vinyl ester composites and Corecell™ M 100 foam at different temperatures has been studied using SHPB apparatus. Eight different target temperatures were chosen: - 40 ºC, - 20 ºC, 0 ºC, 22 ºC, 40 ºC, 60 ºC, 80 ºC and 100 ºC. The sandwich composites were maintained at the target temperature before being subjected to shock-wave loading using a shock-tube. A high-speed photography system utilizing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to record the real time deformation of the specimen. The results show a significant decrease in flow stress with the increase in the temperature of the core material. Significant fiber-matrix delamination was observed in face-sheets at elevated temperatures with little change in the value of compression modulus. For the low temperature environment, the core material shows brittle behavior resulting in core-cracking of the sandwich specimen under blast loading. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{satisfy the}} diverse product quality {{specifications}} {{required by the}} broad range of polyethylene applications, polymerization plants are forced to operate under frequent grade transition policies. During the grade transition, the reactor temperature must be kept within the narrow range between the gas dew point and the polymer melting point, otherwise the particles melt or agglomerate inside the reactor. In the present study, a dynamic well-mixed reactor model is used to develop a grade transition strategy to prevent melting and agglomeration of particles in an ethylene polymerization reactor. The model predicts the conditions under which the temperature of the reactor is outside the allowable range in <b>continuous</b> <b>grade</b> transition. Manipulation of feed flow and cooling water flow rates has shown that the reactor temperature cannot be maintained within the allowable range.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a {{proposed}} mix design method for SCC utilizing different properties of coarse aggregate. The work was conducted in three phases, i. e. paste, mortar and concrete to facilitate the mix design process. Initial investigation on cement paste determined the basis for water cement ratio and superplasticizer dosage for the concrete. For the study on mortar, metakaolin (MK) as pozzolan was used at replacement levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by weight of cement. Self compactability of mortars was obtained by adding suitable materials such as mineral admixtures and superplasticizer which provided a sufficient balance between flowability and viscosity of the mix. The optimum MK replacement level for cement was 10 {{from the viewpoint of}} workability and strength. Flowability of mortar decreased with the use of metakaolin. Moreover, strength of mortar increased when the optimum replacement level of pozzolan was used. Different fresh concrete tests were adopted. The results obtained for fresh concrete properties showed that flowability of concrete increased with increase flowability of mortar. The mixes which contained coarse aggregate with lower volume, small size, and <b>continuous</b> <b>grading</b> affected positively the fresh properties of SCC.

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of fault sealing properties {{is an important}} part of oil and gas exploration and development. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is a systematic evaluation method for fault sealing. Since traditional methods are greatly affected by human factors during the establishment of the single-factor membership degree, the assignment method results in fuzzy evaluation values, so that the result only reflects the target interval. In this paper, the dynamic clustering method was introduced to determine the single-factor membership degree. Then, a single-factor evaluation matrix was constructed using the <b>continuous</b> <b>grading</b> function in order to determine the optimum comprehensive evaluation matrix and make a fuzzy {{evaluation of}} the fault sealing properties. A comparison of the fuzzy evaluation and its result before and after improvement, combined with current oil and gas distribution regularity, showed that the evaluation results before and after improvement are significantly different. For faults designated as “best” and “poorest,” the evaluation results are consistent with oil and gas distribution. However, for faults designated as “good” or “poor,” the evaluation results of sealing property are not completely consistent with the oil and gas distributions. The improved results reflect the overall and local sealing properties of target zones and embody the fuzziness of fault sealing, indicating the improved method is more precise for evaluating fault sealing properties under complicated conditions.|$|E
40|$|Concrete is {{generally}} {{perceived as being}} an inherently durable material. However, many concrete structures need substantial repairs and maintenance during their service life, with the resultant costs to the economy reaching 3 - 5 % of GNP in some countries. Durability is therefore key in concrete design and specification. Aggregates constitute between 60 and 80 %, by volume, of typical concretes and have a profound influence on the physical properties of hardened concrete. The aggregate particle size distribution is usually selected so as to achieve a particle packing density that is equal to or near the maximum, which is seen as optimal for strength and durability. However, the influence of aggregate grading on durability apart from that which it has through its effect on particle packing density is not understood. Alternative mechanisms through which grading may effect durability include tortuosity and the porosity of the interfacial transition zone. This research aimed {{to determine the extent}} of the influence that aggregate grading has on concrete durability independently of particle packing density and to determine whether fineness modulus (FM) is a suitable and sufficient parameter for the characterisation of aggregate particle size distribution with regard to the performance based specification of concrete where durability is the concern.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{mathematical}} model based on physiological observations which describes the evolution of the blood lactate concentration ([LA-]) versus the oxygen uptake (VO 2) during a <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> exercise test. This model is based on several assumptions: 1) [LA-] reflects the balance between the rates of appearance and disappearance of the lactate in the blood compartment; 2) VO 2 measured at the end of each step, is a linear function of the power output and thus of the time; 3) the appearance rate of lactate into the blood is an exponential function of VO 2; 4) the rate of disappearance is a saturable process which can be modelized by Michaelis-Menten kinetics; 5) the volume of distribution of lactate in the blood compartment is a constant during exercise. The parameters used in this model correspond to the integration of several biochemical and physiological phenomenons. The originality of this approach is to express the rate of lactate appearance and disappearance versus VO 2 rather than time. Whatever the general pattern of the data, the fitted curve gives always very good results. Especially, the theoretical curve fits the decrease in [LA-] usually observed during the first steps of such an exercise. From the computed parameters the evolution of lactate clearance during a <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> exercise test may be modelized. A strong relationship exists between the level of endurance training and the maximum lactate clearance (Clmax) reached during the exercise test. The VO 2 for Clmax is an indicator of the shift of the relationship [LA-]-VO 2. Then, we propose to use the maximum lactate clearance which is individually determined, to characterize the endurance level of an athlete...|$|R

40|$|Background. Assessment of Learning (AoL; {{assessment}} is deployed to measure achievement) is a generally accepted {{part of the}} educational system. However, {{little is known about}} how this affects students’ motivational experiences, in the context of Physical Education (PE). Aim. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, the present study investigated the differences in perceived competence satisfaction and frustration, quality of motivation and level of fear during a regular PE lesson when compared to a lesson in which no AoL took place. Differences between both lessons were also investigated according to students’ grades. Methods. Thirty-eight teachers and 724 secondary school students completed validated questionnaires to measure students’ perceived competence, motivation and fear after a regular lesson, and a second time after a lesson in which AoL was applied. Also, both students and teachers reported on the students’ scores, on the way AoL took place and on the degree to which assessment for learning took place to be able to control for the latter. Multilevel regression analyses were deployed. Results. In general, students experienced less competence satisfaction and autonomous motivation, {{and on the other hand}} more competence frustration, controlled motivation, amotivation and fear in a lesson in which AoL was applied.

In a first experiment, 14 subjects evaluated the quality of images degraded by 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 8 μm of defocus, astigmatism, trefoil, coma, spherical aberration (SA 4) and secondary spherical aberration (SA 6) by putting a mark on a 5 -items <b>continuous</b> <b>grading</b> scale. The desired aberration was introduced either by a deformable mirror or by displaying a simulated image. In the second experiment, 5 of the previous subjects evaluated the quality of through-focus images in presence of SA 4, SA 6 and combinations of SA 4 and SA 6. Both experiments were performed with an artificial pupil of 6 mm diameter. The addition of increasing amounts of aberrations reduced the subjective grading of the targets, with SA 6, SA 4 and defocus being the most degrading aberrations. The correlation between the results obtained with the AO device and with simulated images gave a r 2 of 0. 95. Combinations of 0. 4 μm of SA 4 and 0. 2 μm of SA 6 of opposite signs induced a bimodal through-focus image score curve. We were able to anticipate the subjective gradation of subject’s vision thanks to image quality metrics (r 2 = 0. 92). Image quality score shows similar results as that obtained by objective image quality metrics, which provides a useful tool for optical designers and practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Asphalt {{surfacing}} {{and base}} layers constitute an estimated 20 % of new, reconstructed and rehabilitated road costs- hence {{the importance of}} maximising product value {{by means of a}} credible fit-for-purpose performance specification system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new product performance specification system that can be used by asphalt suppliers to comprehensively define the fit-for-purpose nature of their mixes (especially <b>continuous</b> <b>graded</b> mixes). The proposed criteria are based on a combination of applicable and credible design criteria and performance specifications that have been filtered out from existing methodologies, best practice studies and experience worldwide. The developed new asphalt product performance specifications offer a valuable alternative to the existing outdated Marshall mix design specification sheet and is currently adopted by one of the largest asphalt suppliers in South Africa. 1...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{assessment}} aims {{to enhance}} {{student learning and}} understanding of a subject and so achieve better educational outcomes. We investigated how <b>continuous</b> assessment <b>grades</b> affected final exam grades. Using a dataset for six academic post-Bologna Process years (2009 - 2015) for a first-year undergraduate microeconomics course offered at a Spanish public university, we examined conditional dependence between continuous assessment and final exam grades. Our results would indicate a limited contribution of continuous assessment results to final exam results: the probability of the final exam performance improving on the <b>continuous</b> assessment <b>grade</b> was lower than the probability of the opposite occurring. A consistent exception, however, was students who obtained an A <b>grade</b> for <b>continuous</b> assessment. Our results would cast some doubt on the beneficial effects of continuous assessment advocated by the Bologna Process...|$|R
