2500|$|Replacement of {{the steam}} engines began in 1922, {{starting}} at Whitworth Street. Four [...] pumping engines were removed {{and replaced by}} electrically driven centrifugal pumps. The work was completed by 1924. The following year, the remaining [...] pumps were retained, but their steam cylinders were removed, and the flywheels replaced by a helical gear drive, to connect the pumps to [...] electric motors. These were variable speed direct current devices, and a motor converter set had to be installed, to provide the low voltage DC supply from the incoming high voltage alternating <b>current</b> <b>supply.</b> The motor converter set was built in 1914, and was second-hand. The pumps at the Water Street station were converted to electrical operation {{in a similar manner}} soon afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{among the}} {{anhydrous}} rare-earth phosphates, {{it is the}} tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the yttrium earths, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the cerium earths preferentially. The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that comprise Earth's mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in Earth's crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the cerium earths. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of the cerium earths are known {{around the world and}} are being exploited. Corresponding ore bodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the <b>current</b> <b>supply</b> of yttrium originates in the [...] "ion-absorption clay" [...] ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or gadolinite.|$|E

30|$|The {{main idea}} of the energy source {{emulation}} is to control the voltage and the <b>current</b> <b>supplied</b> to the powered device {{by means of a}} digital system in an attempt to follow a modeled energy source.
