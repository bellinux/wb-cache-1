40|$|Systems of free fermions are {{classified}} by symmetry, space dimensionality, and topological properties described by K-homology. Those systems belonging to different classes are inequivalent. In contrast, {{we show that}} by taking a many-body/Fock space viewpoint it becomes possible to establish equivalences of topological insulators and superconductors in terms of duality transformations. These mappings connect topologically inequivalent systems of fermions, jumping across entries in existent <b>classification</b> <b>tables,</b> because of the phenomenon of symmetry transmutation by which a symmetry and its dual partner have identical algebraic properties but very different physical interpretations. To constrain our study to established <b>classification</b> <b>tables,</b> we define and characterize mathematically Gaussian dualities as dualities mapping free fermions to free fermions (and interacting to interacting). By introducing a large, flexible class of Gaussian dualities we show that any insulator is dual to a superconductor, and that fermionic edge modes are dual to Majorana edge modes, that is, the Gaussian dualities of this paper preserve the bulk-boundary correspondence. Transmutation of relevant symmetries, particle number, translation, and time reversal is also investigated in detail. As illustrative examples, we show the duality equivalence of the dimerized Peierls chain and the Majorana chain of Kitaev, and a two-dimensional Kekulé-type topological insulator, including graphene as a special instance in coupling space, dual to a p-wave superconductor. Since our analysis extends to interacting fermion systems we also briefly discuss some such applications. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
