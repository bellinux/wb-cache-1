25|$|The 618 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a rotary valve inlet and an exhaust valve. Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual Ducati <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{for most}} markets, Honda fitted a new <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> (CDI) system [...] {{to replace the}} earlier contact points ignition, thereby helping to meet {{emission}} standards in markets such as the US. At {{the same time the}} electrical system was changed from 6 volt to 12 volt.|$|E
500|$|The early Super Cubs used a 6 volt {{ignition}} magneto {{mounted on the}} flywheel, with a battery to help maintain power to the lights, while later ones were upgraded to <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> (CDI) systems. The lubrication system did not use an oil pump or oil filter, but was a primitive splash-fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox, with a non-consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil. Both {{the front and rear}} brakes were drums. On both the front and rear wheels were 2.25" [...] × 17" [...] wire spoke wheels, with full-width hubs.|$|E

50|$|The Suzuki TS50X is an air-cooled, , single-cylinder, {{two-stroke}} engined, trial style motorcycle {{manufactured by}} Suzuki from 1984 to 2000. It had a five-speed manual gearbox and {{complied with the}} United Kingdom requirements of {{the time to be}} classified as a moped. Electrics were 12 volt and <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> electronic <b>ignition</b> was used.The machine used Suzuki's own CCI oil pump delivery system, avoiding the need to pre-mix two-stroke engine oil.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CD250 is a , air-cooled, four stroke, upright twin {{motorcycle}} {{which was}} retailed by Honda in the UK from 1988 to 1993. It {{has a single}} front disc brake and a rear drum.

50|$|The {{machine was}} {{equipped}} with <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> electronic <b>ignition,</b> disc front and drum rear brakes and Comstar wheels. It had both electric and kick start and centre and side stands. Electrics were 12 volt, and the battery was housed in a side panel. The other side panel contained a small toolkit. Instrumentation was {{by way of a}} handlebar mounted binnacle. This contained a tachometer, warning lights for main beam, ignition/neutral and indicators, and a speedometer in miles per hour, with markings for kilometres, plus an odometer.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century digital {{electronic}} ignition modules became available for small engines on such applications as chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers. This was made possible by low cost, high speed, and small footprint microcontrollers. [...] Digital electronic ignition modules can be designed as either <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> (CDI) or inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems. Capacitive discharge digital ignitions store charged energy for the spark in a capacitor within the module that can be released to the spark plug at virtually any time throughout the engine cycle via a control signal from the microprocessor. This allows for greater timing flexibility, and engine performance; especially when designed hand-in-hand with the engine carburetor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model was}} the {{successor}} to the ageing twin cylinder CB360 and the highly regarded, but expensive for the 400cc class, four-cylinder CB400F. The CB400T has two fewer cylinders than its CB400F predecessor and although the press was initially skeptical of it, reviews stated {{that it was a}} worthwhile successor and more than capable of competing with contemporary rivals. Its overhead camshaft [...] air-cooled parallel-twin had been completely redesigned, with a chain drive that operated three valves per cylinder, two for inlet and one for exhaust. It differs from rival manufacturers 400cc twin-cylinder models because it has a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins instead of the more common 180° crank layout. Counter-rotating balance-shafts help to reduce unwanted vibrations caused by the 360° crank layout. Honda fitted these models with <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> instead of the points system found on its predecessors, that required frequent maintenance. It uses a five-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling is provided by twin Keihin [...] carburettors. A steel diamond cradle type frame uses the engine as a stressed member to reduce mass and increase ground clearance.|$|E

50|$|The Honda H100S is a {{two-stroke}} motorcycle {{introduced in}} June 1983, alongside the original Honda H100-A, which was {{released to the}} UK in February 1980.The H100-A was built for fulfilling {{the role of an}} economical, practical, lightweight commuter machine. It was designed for riders who preferred the basic simplicity of the two stroke engine configuration; In true Honda style, equipment such as a fully enclosed chain, <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> electronic <b>ignition</b> (CDI), and a separate oil injection system allowed the rider to enjoy easy operation of the motorcycle with the very minimum of maintenance and attention.The lowly tuned engine gives adequate performance for use in normal traffic conditions, but does not consume high amounts of fuel. Under normal operating conditions, mileage to the gallon figures regularly exceed 80, often close to 100, very impressive for a two stroke and not far off Honda's own four-stroke commuting machines.The engine uses a reed-valve induction system, and the vibration inherent in single cylinder engines is largely cancelled out by the single shaft primary balancer.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CD125TC Benly is a , air-cooled, four stroke, twin {{cylinder}} [...] "commuter" [...] style motorcycle manufactured by the Honda Motor Company between 1982 and 1985 for the United Kingdom. Its engine size and power output {{were designed to}} conform to provisional licence restrictions {{of the time and}} it was a version of the Honda CD200 Benly introduced in the late 1970s, with the same four speed constant mesh transmission (as the 200) but electric start only. The machine was identical in all other respects apart from the engine barrel size. It was equipped with an enclosed chain and <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> electronic <b>ignition.</b> Brakes were drum front and rear and it had both centre- and side-stands. Electrics were 12 volt, and the battery was housed in the right-hand, side-panel. The left-hand panel contained a small toolkit. Instrumentation was by way of two handlebar-mounted binnacles. One contained a speedometer, with odometer and trip meter and was in miles per hour with markings for kilometres and maximum speeds in gears. The other contained warning lights for main beam, ignition/neutral and indicators.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Honda SH50 is a , air-cooled, two stroke, single cylinder, scooter style, {{restricted}} moped {{manufactured by}} the Honda Motor Company between 1984 and 2006, with substantial revisions for the 1996 model year. It {{was equipped with}} continuously variable automatic transmission, (Honda V-Matic transmission) together with both electric and kick start, automatic choke and <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> electronic <b>ignition.</b> Brakes were drum front and rear, (disc front on later models) operated pedal-cycle style by two handlebar levers. The early models had some resemblance to Honda's C50/70/90 Super Cub range with a similar shape, dual seat and rear carrier, but with a scooter type floor, unlike the P series of mopeds such as the Honda PC50 or the Honda Express N series, which had cycle style construction. The SH50 was {{also known as the}} City Express and in some markets, as the Scoopy. All models had cycle type wheels as against the smaller wheels of later 50cc scooter style mopeds. The battery, fuel tank and two-stroke-oil reservoir were contained under the seat. Electrics were 12 volt and a handlebar mounted binnacle, which effectively formed part of the front bodywork, contained basic instrumentation and warning lights.|$|R

50|$|Most {{ignition}} systems used in {{cars are}} inductive <b>discharge</b> <b>ignition</b> (IDI) systems, which are solely {{relying on the}} electric inductance at the coil to produce high-voltage electricity to the spark plugs as the magnetic field collapses when the current to the primary coil winding is disconnected (disruptive discharge).
