While designed to indent the pipe surface, {{it has been found}} that some balls skid instead which reduces the connection integrity. This work was aimed at finding important features which relate to rolling and skidding of precision balls on the surface of pipes. A skidded ball is associated with a failure and a rolled ball is associated with success. Experiments simulating the activation were performed and compared with analytical models. Several features such as friction, ball size, material hardness and surface finish were identified as important for understanding the transition of the ball from roll into skid. The results of the surface and subsurface analysis correlated well with the model output. Once the important features are verified, progress can be made to achieve production of more robust connectors (from successful activations) leading to better customer <b>confidence</b> in <b>buying</b> mechanical pipeline connector products. ...|$|R

Due to {{the large amount of}} counterfeit autograph memorabilia, autograph clubs were developed to give potential purchasers the <b>confidence</b> to <b>buy.</b> It is a fact that a piece of autograph memorabilia is sold every 15 seconds on eBay or other Internet sites. The Autograph Club was first seen in the 1940s, with the hobby growing different clubs began emerging onto the scene. As the autograph clubs advanced, they began developing many new strategies to help the collector. Historically, clubs occurred in many different countries. Once people started buying, selling, and trading, there was need for people with a common interest to be able to associate with one another despite having no ties other than a common hobby. Autograph clubs were created for interest and enjoyment, along with financial rewards. Involvement in autograph clubs can lead to building advanced skills, knowledge, and experience. Education is the aim of most autograph clubs.|$|R

Clearly, {{in the midst of a}} crisis, one should not be overly concerned with moral hazard, as the immediate task is to restore confidence, and guarantees can be helpful in that respect. Nonetheless, to keep market discipline operational, it is important to specify when the extra deposit insurance will end, and this timeline needs to be credible.

40|$|Nowadays the {{influence}} of online social networks is beginning to affect consumer 9 ̆ 2 s purchasing decisions, particularly due to the trust gained among users by electronic word of mouth. Due to {{the change in the}} way people communicate, consumers have begun to share their experiences about products, brands or services through the Internet. Recently, using digital marketing to spread information through social media platforms is booming in Thailand. There are lots of producers, marketers or even celebrities who have chosen this alternative to promote and review their products via different social platforms. The precise relationships between consumer decision making in purchasing products and its effectiveness in searching for online reviews through different social platforms are unclear. This paper explores this issue; critically discusses the concept of influencing consumer decision-making in cosmetics after receiving information from online reviews on social platforms. In this study the primary data was gathered using a questionnaire and there were 166 respondents who answered the questions. All of them were asked about their lifestyle and how that related to decision making in purchasing cosmetics products. The findings show that most of them are familiar with searching online and used to reading online reviews before making a purchase decision for cosmetics products. They stated that it can give them more <b>confidence</b> to <b>buy</b> a product. Some respondents watched videos of product reviews for entertainment. They gained knowledge about how each product works and were able to absorb the information unconsciously...|$|R
30|$|Reputation systems collect, aggregate, and {{distribute}} feedback about entities’ past behaviors (Resnick et al. 2000). Theoretically, reputation is a distribution of opinions, estimations, or evaluations about an entity in an interest group (Bromley 2001). An interest group {{is one where}} the people within a group have some relationship or concern with an entity (Bromley 2001). Reputation systems have been validated as highly effective ways to protect customers from transactional risks. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} reputation systems are effective to reduce transitional losses, improve customers’ <b>buying</b> <b>confidence,</b> help them make purchase decisions, and drive sales growth for sellers (Ba and Pavlou 2002; Bolton et al. 2004; Park et al. 2007). Despite their effectiveness, they are vulnerable to rating fraud, a phenomenon wherein raters benefit themselves by creating biased ratings (Cai and Zhu 2015; Mayzlin et al. 2014). Rating fraud is common in the cyber world, and some companies commit such activities. For instance, 19 review management companies were caught and fined because of injecting dishonest ratings into various sites, such as Yelp.com (Sved 2014).|$|R
30|$|Zhang and Kraisintu (2011) {{describe}} {{the contribution of}} traceability in negative and positive perspectives related to the economic sustainability. While positive aspect relates to the direct economic gains, the implementation cost relates to negative perspective of the traceability. Further, traceability information {{can be related to}} two key economic factors namely cost and benefits. Cost signifies to the expenses that a buyer or the retailer bears in case of external quality failure. Benefit implies the additional economic incentives that the traceability adoption offers to an organization. Traceability particularly benefits the enterprises with information beyond their organizational scope which aids them with the better control and understanding of the supply chain. This includes the benefits associated with better inventory management, reduced stock levels, better demand–production balance, and more visibility of supplies in the supply chain (Alves et al. 2013; Gobbi and Massa 2015; Guercini and Runfola 2009; Kwok and Wu 2009). Products can be efficiently located and tracked using traceability information inside the supply chain, which improves the actors’ responsiveness, reduces the production lead-time, and contributes towards the abovementioned benefits (Kwok and Wu 2009). Further, traceability supplies the visibility of the supply chain to the end-consumer. It improves the customers’ <b>confidence</b> while <b>buying</b> the product, which helps the brands in the long term by building the brand identity for transparency perspective. Interestingly, some customers consider traceability equivalent to certification (Ubilava and Foster 2009), which can potentially add to the abovementioned retailer–end-user relation. Furthermore, as aforementioned product recall is a well-recognized issue. In this context, traceability can help the identification of recalled product more precisely thus efficiently implement the removal of recalled products from the market. Subsequently, this can help the organization from the bad reputation originated from the product recalls (Zhang and Kraisintu 2011).|$|R
40|$|Many {{authors have}} noted that {{consumer}} <b>confidence</b> in <b>buying</b> fresh flowers is strongly related to their perceived value in that quality and vase life must be high and consistent over time for consumers to repeat buy. Growers, wholesalers, exporters and retailers seek practical information about recommended handling and treatments at the harvest and postharvest stages, including that relating to flowers native to Australia and South Africa ("wildflowers"). This information is essential for products to be of high quality with an acceptable vase life for the end consumer, especially if exported. Published postharvest manuals generally focus on traditional flower crops and so rarely include many, or any, wildflowers. A manual entitled Postharvest Handling of Australian flowers from Native Plants and Related Species was published in 2002 and addressed this gap, but required updating. This situation presented an opportunity to provide in-depth information to compliment the Australian wildflower quality specifications (see accompanying paper in the same volume), and to assemble the latest knowledge on wildflower quality and postharvest issues. The resultant manual contains extensive information about harvesting, quality issues and recommended postharvest care focussed on wildflowers. Much of the information is documented for the first time, being based on the most up to date research and development (R&D) as well as practical experience of the floral supply chain, researchers and other technical experts. The manual provides practical and detailed information on postharvest treatment of fresh wildflowers for growers, florists, wholesalers and exporters to use on a daily basis. It discusses the many unique features of wildflowers that must be understood and managed in order to maximise their quality and vase life after marketing and export. The manual also includes postharvest advice for 16 flower- and foliage lines for which quality specifications were not produced. This advice is presented according to the same template as the specifications...|$|R

They present ideal images that they desire to obtain or actual images that they already have. People find differences between ideal images and actual images as well astry to overcome differences by managing appearance or purchasing fashion items. The congruence between real and ideal self-images and perceived body images stimulate clothing involvement or consumer confidence to influence fashion innovativeness and fashion opinion leadership. Fashion leaders are known for <b>confidence</b> when making <b>buying</b> decisions on new fashion products {{and are more likely}} to influence other consumers to buy new items. This study useda structural equation model to understand the influence of perceived self and body image on clothing involvement and consumer confidence as well as define how perceived images influence fashion leadership through clothing involvement and consumer confidence. The results of this study indicated that self-image congruence has a positive impact on social body image and personal body image. A positive influence of perceived body image on clothing involvement and consumer confidence was also detected.

Design/methodology/approach – We examine two aspects of poor consumer decision making, yet to be fully explored in the wider regulatory literature. Initially, we review how financial services providers consider product innovations and the marketing strategies they pursue in constructing their offerings to consumers. Secondly, we ass… a popular financial product, the interest bearing deposit account, to examine what savings product choices are actually presented to consumers. These areas are explored through semi?structured interviews undertaken with semi financial services managers and through {{a review of the}} entire product offerings to the interest bearing deposit market. Findings – We report that savings markets are characterised by high product turnover and short duration. Consumers in the UK, alike many developed nations, and often unfamiliar with, and lack <b>confidence</b> when, <b>buying</b> savings products.

40|$|Computational Intelligence {{has found}} a {{challenging}} testbed for various paradigms in the financial sector. Extensive research has resulted in numerous financial applications using neural networks and evolutionary computation, mainly genetic algorithms and genetic programming. More recent advances {{in the field of}} computational intelligence have not yet been applied as extensively or have not become available in the public domain, due to the confidentiality requirements of financial institutions. This study investigates how co-evolution together with the combination of par- ticle swarm optimisation and neural networks could be used to discover competitive security trading agents that could enable the timing of buying and selling securities to maximise net profit and minimise risk over time. The investigated model attempts to identify security trend reversals with the help of technical analysis methodologies. Technical market indicators provide the necessary market data to the agents and reflect information such as supply, demand, momentum, volatility, trend, sentiment and retracement. All this is derived from the security price alone, {{which is one of the}} strengths of technical analysis and the reason for its use in this study. The model proposed in this thesis evolves trading strategies within a single pop- ulation of competing agents, where each agent is represented by a neural network. The population is governed by a competitive co-evolutionary particle swarm optimi- sation algorithm, with the objective of optimising the weights of the neural networks. A standard feed forward neural network architecture is used, which functions as a market trend reversal confidence. Ultimately, the neural network becomes an amal- gamation of the technical market indicators used as inputs, and hence is capable of detecting trend reversals. Timely trading actions are derived from the <b>confidence</b> output, by <b>buying</b> and short selling securities when the price is expected to rise or fall respectively. No expert trading knowledge is presented to the model, only the technical market indicator data. The co-evolutionary particle swarm optimisation model facilitates the discovery of favourable technical market indicator interpretations, starting with zero knowledge. A competitive fitness function is defined that allows the evaluation of each solution relative to other solutions, based on predefined performance metric objectives. The relative fitness function in this study considers net profit and the Sharpe ratio as a risk measure. For the purposes of this study, the stock prices of eight large market capitalisation companies were chosen. Two benchmarks were used to evaluate the discovered trading agents, consisting of a Bollinger Bands/Relative Strength Index rule-based strategy and the popular buy-and-hold strategy. The agents that were discovered from the proposed hybrid computational intelligence model outperformed both benchmarks by producing higher returns for in-sample and out-sample data at a low risk. This indicates that the introduced model is effective in finding favourable strategies, based on observed historical security price data. Transaction costs were considered in the evaluation of the computational intelligent agents, making this a feasible model for a real-world application.
