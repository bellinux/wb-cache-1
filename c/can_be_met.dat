5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>met</b> by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>met</b> by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization of military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>met</b> in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, ash and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism {{associates}} this commandment {{with the}} three theological virtues. The first virtue, faith, instructs Catholics to believe in God and avoid heresy, apostasy, and schism. The second virtue, hope, cautions Catholics against despair and presumption. According to the Catechism, the last virtue, charity, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>met</b> only if Catholics refrain from indifference or ingratitude toward God, and avoid spiritual laziness and a hatred of God stemming from pride. The Catechism enumerates specific violations of this commandment, including superstition, polytheism, sacrilege, atheism, and all practices of magic and sorcery. It further prohibits astrology, palm reading, and consulting horoscopes or mediums. The Catechism attributes the latter actions to a [...] "desire for power over time, history, {{and in the last}} analysis, other human beings as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers".|$|E

Florette's son is called Jean Cadoret, but Ugolin, in the local custom, calls him Jean de Florette. Jean {{makes it clear that}} {{he has no intention of}} selling, but plans to take up residence and live off the land. He has a grand scheme for making the farm profitable within two years, involving breeding rabbits and feeding them off cucurbit. Jean does not know about the blocked spring, only of a more distant one, and is relying on rainfall to fill a cistern with water for supplying livestock and irrigating crops. The distant spring, where an old Italian couple lives, is [...] away and also part of the property. Jean believes the needs of the farm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>met</b> from here. Ugolin is discouraged, but Papet tells him to befriend Jean and gain his confidence. They also keep secret from him the fact that—while average rainfall for the surrounding region is sustainable—the area where Florette's farm lies rarely gets any of this rain. Meanwhile, the two work to turn the local community against the newcomer, who is described merely as a hunchbacked former tax collector, since the deceased Pique-Bouffigue had cousins in the village who know about the blocked spring and would tell Jean about it should they come to trust him.|$|E
