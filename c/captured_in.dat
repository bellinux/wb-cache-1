5|$|After the war, General Janko Bobetko {{estimated}} HV {{losses at}} more than 70 killed and 250 wounded. According to official records, 49 HV soldiers were killed during the operation. Of the casualties, the Bjelovar Corps accounted for five dead and 26 wounded. According to Bosnian Serb sources, the VRS sustained 44 killed, 53 wounded and three <b>captured.</b> <b>In</b> addition, six Bosnian Serb police officers were killed and nine were wounded. Bosnian Serb sources hold that Serb civilian casualties were 54 killed, 39 wounded and 6 <b>captured</b> <b>in</b> the two days of the offensive. Two Danish peacekeepers, deployed with the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), {{were killed in the}} VRS shelling of Dvor. In 2006, Croatian authorities began investigating allegations of war crimes committed during the operation, specifically the killing of 40 civilians in the Bosanska Dubica area by troops of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{scheme for}} {{particle}} <b>capture</b> <b>in</b> acceleration mode with mini-mum losses, the so-called adiabatic particle capture, is {{proposed for the}} super-conducting heavy-ion synchrotron, Nuclotron. Analytical calculations and com-puter simulations of the adiabatic <b>capture</b> <b>in</b> Nuclotron are given. The realization of this highly effective <b>capture</b> scheme <b>in</b> Nuclotron will allow minimizing the particle losses and increasing {{the intensity of the}} accelerated beams.

5|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the battle, Oxford fled to France and participated in piracy of English ships, continuing his campaign against Yorkist reign. He was <b>captured</b> <b>in</b> 1473 after conquering St Michael's Mount, an island off the southwest coast of England. Twelve years later Oxford escaped from prison and joined Henry Tudor's fight against the Yorkists, commanding the Lancastrian army at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.|$|E
5|$|Although Umar later {{relieved}} him of high command, he nevertheless {{remained the}} effective {{leader of the}} forces arrayed against the Byzantines {{during the early stages}} of the Byzantine–Arab Wars.

5|$|Beginning in May, {{the brigade}} endured 112 {{consecutive}} days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy. Though {{most of the}} skirmishes were small, {{by the end of}} the period, injuries and desertion had cut the regiment's strength by 25%. Ross was <b>captured</b> <b>in</b> late July at the Battle of Brown's Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were <b>captured</b> <b>in</b> nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August 1944, the vast {{majority}} of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions—the Panzer Lehr and 9th SS—now existed in name only. The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates for the number of German soldiers <b>captured</b> <b>in</b> the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000, although some estimates put total German losses (killed and <b>captured)</b> <b>in</b> the Pocket as high as 200,000.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 51st Motorised Brigade, Enes Taso, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Dalj in August–December 1991.

In May 2012, Croatian authorities in Osijek started a trial of two Croatian Serbs charged with war crimes against Croatian civilians, including the gang rape of a 20-year-old woman and forcing her parents and siblings to watch the rape. Both of them were convicted in September 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. In 2013, the Croatian Veterans' Affairs Minister stated that Croatian authorities have filed 150 indictments for war crimes committed during the Dalj massacre and war crimes perpetrated in Dalj area during the war.|$|E
