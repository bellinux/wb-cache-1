40|$|Abstract A {{titanium}} oxide layer {{used in a}} dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has to meet two opponent properties to enable high conversion efficiency: a large surface area (for high dye loading) and good connection between TiO 2 grains (for efficient extraction of electrons toward the front contact). In order to meet a trade-off between these criteria a preparation method for TiO 2 paste formulation based on Pechini sol–gel method and commercial nanocrystalline TiO 2 powder has been developed. A series of TiO 2 pastes with different molar ratios between titanium isopropoxide, citric acid and ethylene glycol (1 :X: 4 X) in the paste have been examined. The structure and morphology as well as <b>cross-cut</b> <b>tests</b> of deposited and sintered TiO 2 layers have been analyzed.

40|$|Most of the {{currently}} used exterior arcrylic coating systems are characterised by their ability of being penetrated by moisture both {{into and out}} of the wood. Normally, a good adhesion of these coating systems at a higher load of humidity cannot be achieved. In cases of an already damaged coating film or an increased presence of humidity (i. e. construction during winter) in the boundary to the wood surface, only a short-term exposure to water is needed to detach a coating film with an insufficient wet adhesion completely. At present, the adhesion test is being performed according to the European Standard EN ISO 24624; <b>Cross-cuts</b> <b>test</b> ISO 2409; 1994. The long-term use of this test method for exterior wood coatings showed that compareable and repeatable results could not relieable be guaranteed. This new fixed method is suitable for the testing of exterior wood or wood based material coatings and describes a method following EN ISO 24624 for the testing of the wet adhesion of a single-layer or multilayer coating system consisting of paints, varnishes or similar products.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} different surface pretreatments and {{their influence on}} a subsequent surface metallization. A direct liquid injection metalorganic CVD (DLI-MOCVD) process is presented for the low temperature metallization of composites, ultimately aiming at the surface unctionalization of 3 D parts. The process involves the organometallic precursor Cu(I) hexafluoroacetylacetonate 2 -methyl- 1 -hexene- 3 -yne (hfac) Cu(MHY). We determine chemical kinetics of the global deposition reaction and show {{the improvement of the}} adhesion of the Cu films by applying surface pretreatments that etch and/or activate the surface before deposition. To this purpose, gas phase and wet chemical processes are used. Gas phase pretreatments consist either in the use of a remote microwave plasma, an in situ UV oxidation, or in the deposition of acrylic acid/ethylene plasma buffer layer by using an atmospheric pressure cold plasma jet. The liquid phase pretreatment is based on a commercial series of solutions that includes swelling, oxidation, and neutralization steps. The adhesive strength of the Cu films on poly-epoxy and on carbon fiber/poly-epoxy composite surfaces is specifically investigated by scratch and <b>cross-cut</b> <b>testing,</b> and is correlatedwith topographical, chemical, and energetic characteristics of the surfaces prior deposition, investigated by interferometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and wettability measurements through the sessile drop method.

The structure and properties of the hybrid coating were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared, ultravio-let-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X–ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic mechanics microscope, contact angle measuring instrument, and hardness tester etc. It is found that {{the basic structure of}} the hybrid coating is Si—O—Si. After heat-cured at 120, the thickness of the hybrid coating is 0. 84 ℃ µm by dipping-withdrawing manner. The hybrid coating is smooth, homogenous and densified, and can improve the transparency of PC (transmittance is increased by nearly 5 %). The contact angle of the hybrid coating to the water increases with the increase of curing time. The contact angle is 93 °after heat-cured at 120 ℃ for 3 h. The hybrid coating has excellent thermal stability, which increases gradually with the increase of TEOS content. When the mole ratio of R (organic groups) and Si in SiO 2 /organosilicone hybrid resin is 0. 78, the adhesion strength of hybrid coating on PC sheet is 0 class (<b>cross-cut</b> tape <b>test),</b> and it reaches a pencil scratch hardness of 2 H.

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} {{graphene}} as a conductive nanofiller in {{the preparation}} of inorganic/polymer nanocomposites has attracted increasing interest in the aerospace field. The reason for this is the possibility of overcoming problems strictly connected to the aircraft structures, such as electrical conductivity and thus lightning strike protection. In addition, graphene is an ideal candidate to enhance the anti-corrosion properties of the resin, since it absorbs most of the light and provides hydrophobicity for repelling water. An important aspect of these multifunctional materials is that all these improvements can be realized even at very low filler loadings in the polymer matrix. In this work, graphene nanoflakes were incorporated into a water-based epoxy resin, and then the hybrid coating was applied to Al 2024 -T 3 samples. The addition of graphene considerably improved some physical properties of the hybrid coating as demonstrated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, ameliorating anti-corrosion performances of raw material.

The parabolic cooling towers (factory of electrical power) are a typical example of construction, which has a special aggressive environment.

40|$|Samples of Nd–Fe–B were {{coated with}} {{bismaleimide}} (BMI), a resin which {{is well known}} for its desirable barrier, mechanical, and thermal properties but has not been used as a coating material. The performance of BMI-coated samples (average coating thickness ~ 15 μm) was compared with commercial epoxy-coated samples (average coating thickness ~ 20 μm) in a series of tests. In the copper-accelerated acetic acid–salt spray test, the epoxy-coated samples failed badly (damaged area > 50 %) within 20 h while the BMI-coated samples showed no sign of failure up to 200 h. Using the <b>cross-cut</b> tape <b>test</b> for adhesion strength (ASTM D 3359), the commercial epoxy coatings suffered 25 % area detachment while for the BMI coatings, no detachment was observed. The scratch resistance of the BMI coatings, measured in terms of scratch depth in the pin scratch test, was about 1. 5 that of the commercial epoxy coatings, and the Vickers hardness was higher by a factor of about 2. 5. When magnetized under the same magnetizing field, {{there was no significant difference}} in the magnetization obtained among bare, epoxy-coated, and BMI-coated samples. These results suggest that BMI coatings are excellent for protection of the Nd–Fe–B magnets against corrosion and function better than the commonly used epoxy resin.

40|$|Mesoporous ceramic nanocomposites with well-distributed catalytically active {{nanoparticles}} {{in their}} pores, are very interesting materials, {{which can be}} used as easy-to-clean coatings, for example. The aim of this work is to develop the basics for the preparation of such materials, and to characterize it. For this, the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers shall be used; combined with the simultaneous transformation of SiO 2 and gold precursors, mesoporous ceramic nanocomposites doped by gold shall be prepared. Firstly, the amphiphilic block copolymers are dissolved in a selective solvent. Due to microphase separation of the incompatible blocks, micelles are formed; here, the corona consists of the soluble polymer block, and the unsoluble block builds the micelle core. The micelle corona is loaded with a SiO 2 precursor, and the micelle core with a gold salt. A substrate is coated by the loaded micelle solution, using a suitable technique like dip-coating. Next, the ceramic matrix is prepared by in-situ transformation of the precursors by calcification. Simultaneously, the gold salt reacts to metallic gold nanoparticles, and the block copolymer is removed completely, resulting in a porous structure doped by the nanoparticles. Here, the micelles act as templates, and their super structure sets the ordering of the prepared coating. Furthermore, the super structure of the block copolymer is influenced by the added precursors. A periodic hexagonal super structure of the block copolymers is preferred in order to realize highly ordered mesoporous structures. Polystyrene-poly(2 -vinylpyridine) block copolymers (PS-b-P 2 VP) are used as amphiphilic block copolymers; they were synthesized using living anionic polymerization. Tetrachloroauric acid is used as gold precursor, and polyalkoxysiloxanes (PAOS) based on polyethoxysiloxane (PEOS) are used as SiO 2 precursor. The advantages of PAOS are its solubility in many organic solvents, and its easy modifiability. Moreover, it has a high SiO 2 content, and it is very stable during storage. Furthermore, the ceramic coatings, prepared from PAOS, are insensitive against basic hydrolysis, and highly stable against heat. In this work, the influence of the ceramic precursors on the block copolymer morphology is characterized, first. It was found that there is only a slight compatibility between the micelle corona and the precursors, in case of unmodified PEOS. Therefore, PEOS was modified with different organic groups. Using PAOS modifications with small loading concentrations, it was observed that the hexagonal structure was usually only minorly disturbed, whereas, for a relatively high PAOS loading concentration, there is only a low compatibility with the micelle corona, or not at all. Latter results in a lined up arrangement of micelles like a string of pearls or in worm-like micelles. Calcination such morphologies leads to unregular arrangements with canyons on the subtrate surface, without observation of a mesoporous structure. For the PAOS modification poly(phenethyl-co-ethoxysiloxan) with a modification degree of 43 % and 39 % highly ordered structured could be prepared. Especially, the 39 % modification proved to be suitable, indeed, even at high PAOS loading concentrations, the block copolymer micelles were ordered almost perfectly hexagonally. After calcination, this results in a very homogeneous mesoporous structure with pore sizes of about 30 nm, doped regularly with gold nanoparticles. Latter had the desired size of about 4 nm to 7 nm. Such coatings with a high surface can be used as thermocatalytically active coatings, e. g. as easy-to-clean systems. In order to prove the applicability of such coatings, demonstrator steel tubes were coated by a precursor-loaded micelle solution. Then, the oil and grease, representing typical contaminations, were put onto the tube. A degradation test showed that such contaminations are degraded completely and residue-free, at 250 °C to 350 °C, for many contamination-heating cycles. Further important point for the application as easy-to-clean coating is the scratch resistance. In fact, abrasion, adherence, and <b>cross-cut</b> <b>tests</b> proved that the prepared coatings are stable against relatively light mechanical strain...|$|R

Bisphenol-A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate resin {{was added to the}} inorganic part in predetermined amounts. The resultant mixture was utilized in the preparation of free films as well as coatings on aluminum substrates. Thermal and mechanical tests such as DSC, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile and shore D hardness tests were performed on free films. Water contact angle, gloss, Taber abrasion <b>test,</b> <b>cross-cut</b> and tubular impact tests were conducted on the coated samples. SEM examination and EDS analysis was performed on the fractured surfaces of free films. The hybrid coatings on the aluminum sheets gave rise to properties such as moderately glossed surface; low wear rate and hydrophobicity. Tensile strength of free films increased with up to 10 % inorganic content in the hybrid structure and this increase was approximately three times that of the control sample. As expected; the % strain value decreased by 17. 3 with the increase in inorganic content and elastic modulus values increased by a factor of approximately 6.

40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two finish coat systems was also studied. These finish coats were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. Finish coat system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear coat, and finish coat system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of finish coats, the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by <b>cross-cut</b> <b>test</b> method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding finish coats better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system.

40|$|A {{series of}} large scale dynamic tests were {{conducted}} at the LKAB Kiirunavaara mine using explosives to generate the dynamic load on the support system. This {{was done with the}} aim of developing a testing methodology for in-situ testing of ground support. Furthermore, the response of the installed rock support system to strong dynamic loading was evaluated. The results of the Tests 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 indicated that the relation between the burden and the used amount of explosive had a vital role in either reducing or involving the effect of the detonation gases in the test results. Higher peak particle velocities were measured compared to those of similar large scale tests carried out in other countries. However, the level of induced damage in Tests 1 and 2 was limited to a fractured zone behind the support system while in Tests 4 and 5 the burden was unexpectedly destroyed. Based on the test results and preliminary numerical analysis, a modified test (Test 6) was designed at the same mine. The aim was to avoid the unexpected damage of burden as was observed in earlier tests, and to modify the dynamic loading leading to increase the depth of fractured zone and if possible pushing the support system beyond its limit. Results indicated that a larger fractured zone compare to earlier tests was developed behind the support system while the installed support system was still functional. Evidence from the damage to the <b>tested</b> <b>cross-cuts</b> in Test 6 indicated a reduction of radial cracks that provide access for the gas expansion.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} of the Anthropocene is to advance human development without undermining critical ecosystem services. Central to this challenge is {{a better understanding of}} the interactions and feedbacks between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being, which interact in dynamic and complex social-ecological systems. These relationships have been the focus of much work in the past decades, however more remains to be done to comprehensively identify and quantify them, especially at larger scales. In this thesis, a social-ecological systems approach is adopted to investigate connections between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in South Africa. The country’s high levels of biological and socio-economic diversity, as well as its emerging economy make South Africa an interesting case for exploring these connections. Using data from a variety of public sources, and at different sub-national scales, the thesis first identifies and analyses a variety of bundles of ecosystem service use. Based on these bundles, three social-ecological system archetypes were identified and mapped in South Africa, namely the green-loop (high overall use of local ecosystem services), transition, and red-loop (low overall use of local ecosystem services) systems. Further analysis explored the social and ecological drivers of these patterns, and found the distribution of systems mainly influenced by social factors including household income, gender of the household head, and land tenure. Second, this thesis uses human well-being indicators to construct, analyse and map multi-dimensional human well-being bundles. These bundles were found to spatially cluster across the landscape, and were analysed for congruence with the ecosystem service use bundles. Discrepancies in the expected overlap of ecosystem service use and human well-being were highlighted and concur with findings elsewhere and the ongoing debate in the literature on the impacts of time-lags, indicator choice and scale of these interactions. Third, biodiversity in South Africa was analysed by employing an indicator of biodiversity intactness (BII) at the population level. The BII was found to have declined by 18. 3 % since pre-industrial times. Biodiversity loss was linked to the potential supply of ecosystem services, as well as human well-being patterns. A potential threshold at 40 % biodiversity loss was detected, beyond which population abundances decline sharply. Finally, the thesis examines multiple perspectives on ecosystem services in sustainability research, including the social-ecological systems perspective, and discusses the complementarity of the different perspectives in furthering a deeper understanding of the connections between people and ecosystems. The social-ecological systems perspective employed throughout the empirical work presented in this thesis contributed towards <b>cross-cutting</b> insights, the <b>testing</b> of new kinds of data and the development of new approaches, all of which represent important steps towards unravelling the connections between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being, and contributing to the key Anthropocene {{challenge of}} sustainable development.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Submitted.
