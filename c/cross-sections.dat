Because of the reduced height, the oval <b>cross-section</b> provides some merits in its install height and stress distribution. This paper introduces a new method to generate optimal shape of the non-circular <b>cross-section.</b> For given width and height, arbitrary shape of the <b>cross-section</b> are described using the Hermite spline curves. <b>Cross-section</b> area and maximum stress level are chosen as performance indices, and nonlinear optimization problems are formulated with inequality constraints. Compared to a production spring wire, <b>cross-section</b> area can be reduced about 2. 4 [%] without increasing maximum stress level. In addition, the other approach gives an optimum <b>cross-section</b> which reduces maximum stress level of 2. 0 [%] without increasing <b>cross-section</b> area...|$|R
5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture <b>cross-sections</b> must be very low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} <b>cross-sections,</b> such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>cross-sections</b> {{of these}} fusion-evaporation {{reactions}} increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical <b>cross-sections.</b> He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the <b>cross-sections</b> provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different stent parameters {{on the development of}} restenosis, so as to provide references and basis for the design of stent forms. Methods: Stents were categorized into groups according to stent unite length, strut number, strut <b>cross-section</b> diameter, stent depth into fluid, strut <b>cross-section</b> shape. The influence of different parameter settings on wall shear stress distributions was investigated based on three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Results: The strut <b>cross-section</b> diameter had the most obvious impact on wall shear stress. It would lead to the increase of low wall shear stress area with shorter stent unite length, more strut number, larger strut <b>cross-section</b> diameter and deeper stent depth into the fluid. In comparison with triangular and square <b>cross-section</b> shape, the low shear stress area was much smaller by using stent with circular <b>cross-section.</b> Conclusions: It is suggested that the circular <b>cross-section</b> shape should be adopted in stent design, with preference to reducing strut <b>cross-section</b> diameter, strut number and stent depth into the fluid, while increasing stent unite length...|$|R
