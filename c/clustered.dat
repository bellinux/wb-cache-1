Each circle {{represents}} <b>cluster,</b> and the number located {{at the center of the}} circle shows the number of inner edges in the <b>cluster.</b> The number assigned to an edge shows the number of the cross-cluster edges. The dotted shape represents seed <b>cluster</b> (container). (1) In the initial state, two largest <b>clusters</b> (<b>cluster</b> 1 and <b>cluster</b> 2) are chosen as seed <b>clusters.</b> (2) The smallest seed <b>cluster</b> (<b>cluster</b> 2) and its one of adjacent <b>clusters</b> (<b>cluster</b> 3) are merged.

Then, <b>cluster</b> 1 is merged with its adjacent <b>cluster,</b> <b>cluster</b> 4, and the size becomes 65.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Clustering</b> {{is related}} to data mining for {{information}} retrieval. Relevant information is retrieved quickly while doing the <b>clustering</b> of documents. It organizes the documents into groups; each group contains the documents of similar type content. Different <b>clustering</b> algorithms are used for <b>clustering</b> the documents such as partitioned <b>clustering</b> (K-means <b>Clustering)</b> and Hierarchical <b>Clustering</b> (Agglomerative Hierarchical <b>Clustering</b> (AHC)). This paper presents analysis of Semantic Suffix Tree <b>Clustering</b> (SSTC) Algorithm and other <b>clustering</b> techniques (K-means, AHC, and Lingo). SSTC perform the <b>clustering</b> and make the <b>clusters</b> based on synonyms shared between the documents.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>cluster</b> {{automorphism}} group of a skew-symmetric <b>cluster</b> algebra with geometric coefficients.

We show that several classes of <b>cluster</b> algebras with coefficients are gluing free, for example, <b>cluster</b> algebras with principal coefficients, <b>cluster</b> algebras with universal geometric coefficients, and <b>cluster</b> algebras from surfaces (except a 4 -gon) with coefficients from boundaries. Moreover, except four kinds of surfaces, the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of a <b>cluster</b> algebra from a surface with coefficients from boundaries is isomorphic to the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of its principal part <b>cluster</b> algebra; for a <b>cluster</b> algebra with principal coefficients, its <b>cluster</b> automorphism group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of its initial quiver.
