5|$|Following {{the removal}} of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant <b>cantilever</b> cranes on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane). Fewer than sixty giant <b>cantilever</b> cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is {{believed}} only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal <b>cantilever</b> wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two <b>cantilever</b> sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E

5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using <b>cantilever</b> varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. <b>Cantilever</b> resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, <b>cantilever</b> {{monoplane}} {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set.

5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via <b>cantilever</b> jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Minneapolis I-35W arch-truss bridge on August 1, 2007, the Washington State Department of Transportation was directed to perform inspections of all steel <b>cantilever</b> bridges in the state that used gusset plates in their design, including the George Washington Memorial Bridge.

40|$|Very good {{crystallinity}} {{and highly}} c-axis-oriented aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films are sputtered on titanium (Ti) to fabricate thin piezoelectric <b>cantilevers.</b> Raman spectroscopy measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicate {{the high quality}} of these AlN films. A fabrication process, fully CMOS compatible, is developed to realize slender piezoelectric microcantilevers. Actuation enhancement for the AlN piezoelectric <b>cantilevers</b> is achieved by coating the slender beams with a thin PECVD silicon nitride (SiN) layer. Very good linearity and high displacement, up to 19. 5 nm for 200 μm long <b>cantilevers</b> and 4. 25 nm for 100 μm long <b>cantilevers</b> for 1 V actuation at quasi-static mode, are obtained with a 500 nm SiN top layer. These displacement values are three times larger than our previously reported values for <b>cantilevers</b> without SiN layer coating.

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, <b>cantilever</b> monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month.

5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998.

However, some sections were built using a balanced <b>cantilever</b> design, where spans were first built {{on their own and}} then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had to be built {{in the middle of the}} Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the off-peak hours, causing congestion on the Van Wyck.|$|E
