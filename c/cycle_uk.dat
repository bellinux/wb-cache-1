The potential for partitioning and transmutation (P&T) of these materials is considered and associated potential developments discussed. The paper recommends international P&T research as part of a move to reduce the volume of nuclear waste. This reduction would be beneficial in addressing security and environmental concerns, as well as improving public acceptance of the back-end of the nuclear fuel <b>cycle.</b> <b>UK</b> nuclear waste management; partitioning; transmutation; nuclear fuel cycle; radioactive waste; critical infrastructures; nuclear energy; security; safety; environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{cyclical}} fluctuations in rates of workplace injury for the UK from 1986 to 2005. Time series analysis shows that, in aggregate terms, {{the rate of}} minor injuries is pro-cyclical whilst the rate of major injury is not affected by the level of economic activity. Analysis by sector reveals that cyclical fluctuations are sharper in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Using panel data, we find that fluctuations in both the rates of minor and major injury {{are related to the}} level of new hiring and the ratio of actual to usual hours worked. However, only minor injuries are related to variables that control for workers' bargaining power. The analysis demonstrates the importance of both compositional effects and individual reporting behaviour to understanding cyclical variations in workplace injury rates.

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the causes of}} the reduction in business cycle volatility seen in many major economies over the last decade. Using stylised models of the economies of the US, Euro area, UK and Japan, we argue that economic stability has been fostered by improved monetary policy and by associated changes in the behaviour of inflation, which has itself led to a reduction in the volatility of economic shocks. Assuming an absence of cataclysmic events, our projections suggest that most major economies should continue to enjoy an unusual degree of stability. growth volatility, inflation, stabilisation, business <b>cycles,</b> US, <b>UK,</b> Euro area, Japan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{duration}} of the <b>UK</b> commercial property <b>cycles,</b> their volatility and persistence to gauge future market direction. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs a novel approach to dissect cycles in a form of a three-step algorithm. First, the Hodrick-Prescott de-trends the selected variables. Second, volatility (measured by the variance) screens periods of atypical fluctuations in the series. Finally, the series is regressed against its past values to assess the level of persistence. The sequential steps screen the length of the <b>cycles</b> in <b>UK</b> commercial property market to facilitate interpretation. Findings – The estimates suggest that UK commercial property market follows an eight-year cycle. Combined modelling results indicate that the current market trend is likely to change over the coming year. The modelling suggests increasing probability of a market correction in late 2016 /early 2017. Practical implications – This updated appreciation of the <b>UK</b> commercial property <b>cycle</b> duration allows for better market timing and investment decision making. Originality/value – The paper adds additional evidence on the contested issue of <b>UK</b> commercial property <b>cycle</b> duration...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the {{macroeconomic}} environment on business exit in a world where acquisition and bankruptcy are co-determined. We estimate competing risk hazard regression models using data on UK quoted firms spanning a 38 -year period that witnessed several business cycles. We find that the processes determining bankruptcies and acquisitions depend on the macroeconomic environment. In particular, macroeconomic instability has opposing effects on bankruptcy hazard and acquisition hazard, raising the former and lowering the latter. While bankruptcy hazard is counter-cyclical and acquisition hazard pro-cyclical, the US business cycle is a better predictor than the <b>UK</b> <b>cycle</b> itself.

Using Markov switching approach we find {{clear evidence of}} cyclical variations of the three premiums, most noticeably variations in size premium.

The macroeconomic indicators prompting such cyclicality the most are growth in industrial production, term structure, credit spread and money supply. Using forecast returns from our model and a trading strategy that alternates between size/style/momentum portfolios and risk-free rate, we show that exploiting cyclicality in premiums proves particularly profitable for portfolios featuring small cap stocks in recessions...|$|R

40|$|Employing a Bayesian approach, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} international business <b>cycles</b> on the <b>UK</b> economy {{in the context of}} a smooth transition VAR. We find that British business cycle is asymmetrically influenced by the US, France and Germany. Overall, positive and negative shocks generating in the US or France affect the UK in the same directions of the shock. Yet, a shock emanating from Germany always exerts negative accumulative effects on the UK. More strikingly, a positive shock arising from Germany negatively affects UK output growth more than a negative shock from Germany of the same size. These results suggest that the appropriate UK economic policy depends upon the origin, size and direction of the external shocks.

Alternative TAR models conditioned on past growth rates of industrial production yield substantial reductions in residual variance over both linear and SETAR counterparts, iid residuals in all cases other than the US, and threshold values at or very near zero, clearly identifying the asymmetric behaviour of unemployment during expansionary and contractionary phases of the business cycle. ...|$|R
