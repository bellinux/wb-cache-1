40|$|The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a {{military}} and paramilitary organization that is meant to defend <b>the</b> ideals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979.

This paper examines <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IRGC</b> in Iran’s intelligence system through a comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IRGC’s</b> intelligence arm, along with its operations and capabilities. In doing so, the scope, objectives, resources, customers, and sponsors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IRGC’s</b> intelligence activities are also analyzed. Additionally, this paper explores how <b>the</b> <b>IRGC</b> interacts with <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Iran, <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Intelligence and Security (MOIS), other key internal stakeholders, and foreign client organizations. A key focus of this analysis is <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>IRGC</b> and <b>the</b> MOIS and <b>the</b> growing influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IRGC</b> in Iran’s intelligence community over the last decade. The paper concludes that <b>the</b> <b>IRGC</b> has now eclipsed the MOIS within Iran’s intelligence community and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful institutions in Iranian politics today, using its intelligence activities as its key means of maintaining power and influence within the country. ...|$|R
