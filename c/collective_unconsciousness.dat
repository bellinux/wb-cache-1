40|$|Paper {{provides}} an interesting counterpoint to structuralist analyses. Author attempts to correct some fundamental misunderstandings of the Jungian {{notion of the}} collective unconscious {{and its relationship to}} cultural expressions of this collective unconscious as myth. Myth, according to Rajcok, is both ordered by its parent culture and orders that culture by reinforcing the expressed patterns. Interestingly, Jung's archetypes serve more as Kantain categories than as the dialectical moments envisioned by Levi-Strauss. What emerges is a Jungian theory far more accessible to anthropologists,which parallels classical structuralism in accounting for variations in the form of particular myths, but preserves the integrity of the individual mind by differentiating the <b>collective</b> and specific <b>unconsciousness...</b>|$|R

In this study, the concept was originally called ‘‘collective cyberconsciousness”. The latter is an extension of the idea of ‘‘collective consciousness’’ coupled with ‘‘citizen media’’ usage. The authors of this study made also a parallel between this original definition of VCC and other comparable concepts such as Durkheim's collective representation, Žižek’s ‘‘collective mind’’ or Boguta’s ‘‘new collective consciousness’’ that he used to describe the computational history of the Internet shut down during the Egyptian revolution. Since VCC is the byproduct of the network’s successful actions then these actions must be timely, acute, rapid, domain-specific, and purpose-oriented to successfully achieve their goal. Before reaching a momentum of complexity, each collective behavior starts by a spark that triggers a chain of events leading to a crystallized stance of a tremendous amount of interactions. Thus, VCC is an emergent global pattern from these individual actions.|$|R

Because consciousness is integral to human survival, Beowulf must also be a study of human consciousness in conflict with conscious and unconscious forces that threaten its being, as well as in faithful obedience to those forces that promote its potential for becoming. [...] The dynamic of Beowulf contains the interaction of consciousness with a projection, upon the 'real 1 world, of forms perhaps inherent {{in the structure of the}} human psyche. The power of the conscious mind to repress the contents of the unconscious, forcing them 'underground' or 'underwater,' and the perceived necessity of its doing so, creates the tension that gives rise to the inter-psychic dialectic. The religious tensions of the poem derive from conflicting ideologies, including the subliminal influence of 'pagan' or 'high pagan’ (i. e., gnostic) thought. The ideal product of this tension is its resolution through the recreation or transformation of both the individual entity and collective consciousness into a form that transcends apparent limitations, so that the objectives of survival can continue to be met.

Everything in Beowulf is, from this perspective, symbolic, from the archetypal forms which manifest themselves as patterns or projections of being and action, to the landscape, which impresses itself upon the reader as both an introjection of objective reality and as a projection of subjective perception, to the structures of human consciousness, to the characters encountered by the heroic protagonist. [...] The eponymous hero is both an archetypal form of consciousness (where he is seen as the agent of the ego) and unconsciousness (where he is understood to be an agent of the 'self'). His primary function is to act for 'good’ in opposition to the forces for 'evil' represented by the two monsters and the dragon, who stand for the dangerous and destructive elements of the three primary instincts that form the unifying thematic principle for the discussion: aggression, sexuality, and transformation (or the so-called religious instinct). These instinctual occupations, the modes of action in which the hero, Beowulf, like every human being, engages, have psychic as well as physical manifestations and goals. The psychic goal is individuation, or the process of becoming a fully 'realized' individual. The evolutionary stages of the hero represent the development of the individual's consciousness, which must include awareness of his or her own strengths and weaknesses, so that the transformative requirements of individuation may be met. [...] The whole of Beowulf can be seen as the enactment of the process of individuation. Beowulf, the hero, is, in this analysis, the “individuant,” who confronts in the monsters and dragon the archetypal projections of his own unconscious, which may, through the structural and formal elements of the poem, be discovered as a driving force, or will, directing the three instincts described by C. G. Jung: the aggressive, the sexual and the religious. The antagonists, in their respective forms as Grendel, the Merewife and the Wyrm, represent the repressed elements of these three primary instincts; Beowulf's battles represent the battles between consciousness and the destructive elements of both the personal and the collective unconscious.

As such, it has great significance for imaginative and literary production, and provides a framework for my readings of Harris's novels, Jonestown (1996), The Mask of the Beggar (2003), and The Ghost of Memory (2006), which explore the creative potential of creolization as a dialogue between consciousness and, what Jung and Harris refer to as, the <b>collective</b> <b>unconsciousness.</b> This essay brings into focus Harris's use of Jungian-inspired concepts, such as archetypes and the collective unconscious, in a development of creolization theory as a imaginative response to historical trauma and the generation of originality in art...|$|E

40|$|As {{professionals}} who encountered first-hand the invidious barriers within patriarchal society that hindered career women, Ethel Smyth and Virginia Woolf both used their published writings to pursue lifelong crusades against the under-representation of females {{in their respective}} disciplines.

Woolf’s encouragement and criticism of Smyth’s literary endeavours are examined in the context of her biographical theories and feminist critiques, and of the lesbian proclivities of both women.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 196 - 200) In {{this thesis}} I interpret The Dynasts {{as a work}} of realism and argue against perceiving it as a product of deterministic idealism. Thus the Immanent Will stands as metaphor for a <b>collective</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> [...] the political, social and moral unconsciousness of humanity [...] as opposed to a reified abstraction that aimlessly but deterministically controls men's wills. This thesis explores the way in which consciousness as it is depicted in The Dynasts (or rather as it is implied, since it is unconsciousness that is really depicted) may be interpreted so as to provide an understanding of present-day reality in which man's unconsciousness has brought him to the brink of self-annihilation. The problem of interpretation resolves itself into the following areas: Victorian consciousness in its largely cosmopolitan aspect; the formation of Hardy's consciousness, which I perceive to be dialectical in nature; an examination of The Dynasts as a synthesis of Hardy's consciousness; and finally the question of meliorism [...] whether it is to be thought of in passive terms, as a process of evolution, or whether it is subject to human action.

In their pursuit of a 'therapeutic state', psychologists have medicalised morality by developing powerful myths which replace 'right' and 'wrong' with 'healthy' and 'sick'. The dominant myth is that psychology is a science while other myths include the unconscious mind, the <b>collective</b> <b>unconsciousness,</b> motive-forces, personality traits, conditioning and mental illness. The pernicious myth of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has resulted in drugging more than 20 million children worldwide. In Professor Robert Spillane's provocative new book, QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOUR, he deplores the fact that many children who misbehave today may end up in a psychiatrist's rooms, be labelled 'mentally disordered' and drugged accordingly. In his controversial chapter on ADHD he challenges the diagnosis of a syndrome which is considered to be highly suspect in certain quarters. It is estimated that 20 million children worldwide are being drugged for something considered a 'myth'. No one has any idea of the long term effects of these drugs on children...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades {{terrorism}} has been very active in Italy provoking many deaths and many slaughters, due mainly to the explosions of bombs either located on the trains or in the railway stations. The list of these terrorist events is extraordinarily long, insofar that most Italian citizens do not even remember their dates, places, and victims. By illustrating the different intervening factors that explain the collective oblivion of the terrorist slaughters, this article documents how institutional and cultural amnesia represents a very relevant key to understanding why Italy tends to forget its recent past. Usually, the collective and social memory has been conceived as the product of “institutional work”. The oblivion, on the contrary, has been considered mainly as a passive process, as the implied result of the social activities of remembering. In this perspective, a community might tend to forget what has not been selected by the process of remembering. On the contrary, the two qualitative researches on whose data this article is based, document that forgetting is an active process, and illustrate how the <b>collective</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> in Italy is socially constructed. These data show to what extent the collective amnesia {{is the result of the}} everyday work of specific groups and institutions whose primary interest is to forget. In other words, it is argued that the oblivion requires a continuous work in everyday life to silence the survivors and the families’ victims who are still alive, to destroy all possible symbols and cultural traces of these crucial events, and to avoid that the art system might successfully articulate the different versions of the contested past by shaping and legitimating them...|$|E

40|$|The 1990 s saw {{a climax}} of {{literature}} representations in what Ong called the secondary orality, particularly in film, television, and radio; for instance, {{the film industry}} produced a number of adaptations of novels that had been accepted into the American literary canon, while television and radio marketed literature through book clubs and literary shows. All these literary productions mediated through film, radio, and television are referred to in this study as mediatized literature. The argument of this dissertation is that 1990 s U. S. mediatized literature constitutes a post-modern re-enactment of the traditional oral literature that initially emerged on U. S. territory with pre-literate populations. In support of this thesis, chapter 1 presents {{the features of the}} oral traditions of four ethnic groups, while subsequent chapters feature an application of these characteristics, or variations thereof, to literary discourses from film, television, and radio. There is a structural correlation between the oral tradition of the four ethnic groups presented in chapter 1 [...] Native-American, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian [...] and some of the movie adaptations discussed in chapters 2 and 3 that are based on fiction representing the same ethnic groups (Beloved for the African-American mediatized literature, The Mambo Kings for the Hispanic one, etc.). While analyzing the features common to both the oral tradition and the mediatized literature, this study makes use of four variables (authorship, audience, literary product, and literary aesthetics) and of a complex critical apparatus that includes theories of the linguistic sign, the Bakhtinian dialogic system, the Jungian concept of the <b>collective</b> <b>unconsciousness,</b> Bolter 2 ̆ 7 s concept of remediation, etc. Throughout this dissertation, I will argue that, in spite of the Ongian condescension vis-Ã¡-vis oral cultural messages as inferior to the written ones, and contrary to Postmanian media apprehensions and Franzenian inertia toward mediatized literature, both oral and mediatized literary messages can be classified as literature, although they may not always follow traditional aesthetic parameters embraced by canonical written literature. Chapter 5 of this dissertation presents some of the major points of the current conversation related to the acceptance of mediatized literature and of the oral tradition into the category of literature and to the complex socio-economic and literary implications of the dissemination of literature through mass media...|$|E
