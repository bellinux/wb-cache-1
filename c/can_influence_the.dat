5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> deposition {{and retention of}} snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} online {{in the same way}} as over the board, but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games over the board, {{communication}} is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners. This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board. The time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large.|$|E

In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|These {{characters}} also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted {{against them}} results in temporary paralysis as the characters {{do not have}} individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game {{are similar to those}} in traditional RPGs, although the player <b>can</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.|$|E
