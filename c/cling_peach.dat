50|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing {{transition}} to mechanical harvesting of cling peaches (mostly used in canning) where the cost of labor is 70 percent of a grower's direct costs. In 2016, 12 percent of the <b>cling</b> <b>peach</b> tonnage from Yuba County and Sutter County in California will be mechanically harvested. Fresh peaches destined for direct consumer sales must still be hand-picked.|$|E

In such cases, unique market equilibrium solutions may not exist. This study develops a framework for price prediction under bargaining and applies it to the California <b>cling</b> <b>peach</b> industry. The price prediction equation turns out to involve the same variables as would a model specified for perfect competition.

40|$|ATS + Activator 90 (2. 5 and 5 %). All {{products}} were applied as single treatments to single tree rows by orchard sprayer at 100 gallons per acre in a ‘Loadel ’ orchard that was ‘pulled ’ prior to harvest. Soybean oil treatments were applied Feb. 11, {{toward the end}} of the dormant season (as per Carl Sams, Univ. Tenn.); all other treatments were applied on Feb. 28, when bloom was approximately 75 % of full bloom. On March 2 at full bloom, ATS + Activator 90 treatments resulted in phytotoxicity of blooms that resembled severe brown rot blossom blight. The lower concentration of Activator 90 resulted in less browning of the petals than the higher concentration. All other treatments appeared normal; no damage to shoots or tightly closed buds was found in any treatment. Set counts were taken on May 6, however, crop loads, yields and fruit size were not collected data, as there was no harvest. No treatment was statistically different than the control, and some treatments appeared to enhance set. Soybean oil at 6 % and ATS + 5 % Activator 90 numerically reduced set. We observed that the ATS + Activator treatments (especially at the higher concentration of Activator), resulted in a very even fruit distribution on a per shoot basis, as well as in the canopy overall, and that very few undersized fruit were observed. These treatments resembled an ideal hand-thinned <b>cling</b> <b>peach</b> tree...|$|E
40|$|Raw product {{prices for}} many {{processed}} {{fruits and vegetables}} are determined in part as an outcome of negotiations between processors and farmer bargaining associations. In such cases, unique market equilibrium solutions may not exist. This study develops a framework for price prediction under bargaining and applies it to the California <b>cling</b> <b>peach</b> industry. The price prediction equation turns out to involve the same variables as would a model specified for perfect competition. Hence a mistaken assumption about the structure of competition may still provide a model that predicts well, provided the structure remains constant. Key words: bargaining, demand, econometric model, peaches, prices. Many U. S. -produced fruits and vegetables are marketed through farmer associations whose primary function is to bargain with processors over prices of the raw product and other terms of trade. In 1982 there were ten fruit and nine-teen vegetable bargaining associations in the United States, eighteen of the twenty-nine located in the western states of California, Oregon, and Washington (Skinner). Because bargaining implies some type of oligopsony-oligopoly structure, derived grower-level demand functions may not exist for these com-modities (as they do under perfect competi-tion). Each processing firm may take account of how its procurement price {{is affected by the}} quantity purchased and possibly by the reac-tions of its rivals. Many behavioral specifica-tions are possible. With the bargaining asso-ciation simultaneously attempting to act as a cartel, it may be impossible to define unique equilibrium solutions for the raw product prices. 1 This presents a difficult problem for econometric modelers...|$|E
40|$|Slow-release {{pheromone}} tech-nology {{can successfully}} control oriental fruit moth and peach twig borer while eliminating in-season insecticide sprays in <b>cling</b> <b>peaches.</b> In {{conjunction with a}} demon-stration program, we compared mating disruption for these two pests with standard grower pest-control methods in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, and monitored for pest damage, yield and grower costs. While the mating-disruption program was effective in controlling the targeted pests, costs were higher and growers preferred a partial disruption program that included some supplemental late-season insecticide sprays. Subsequently, we developed monitoring methods to determine the need for supple-mental sprays. This partial mating-disruption program still costs about $ 60 more per acre than a standard spray program. Predicting efficacy and determining the need for supplement sprays is also more difficult with the partial program than with the pheromone-based control program...|$|R
40|$|This study formulates and {{estimates}} a six-equation model for canned <b>cling</b> <b>peaches</b> and fruit cocktail in which processors {{are viewed as}} price setters, with quantities not sold at the set price carried over to the next year. The system consists of two price-markup equations, two quantity-dependent demand equations and two inventory change identities. The three-stage least squares estimation results tend to support the behavioral hypotheses. Key words: demand, fruit cocktail, peaches, price markup, simultaneous equations. Most processed fruit and vegetable commod-ities are processed within a relatively short har-vest season and placed in storage for later dis-tribution. The current pack plus any inventories carried {{from the previous year}} constitute a fixed crop-year supply which cannot be increased until the next harvest period. Processors have the option of selling the entire supply during the current year or, depending on market con-ditions, carrying some portion over to the next season. Because of this option, the quantities actually sold during the current market period and the FOB price received by processors are, in general, jointly determined. The manner in which such systems are spec-ified for purposes of empirical analysis de-pends on the assumptions concerning the be-havior of processors. Most studies have either explicitly or implicitly treated processors as price takers whose only decision is how much of the available total supply to allocate to cur-rent period sales. The market allocation de-cision (short-run supply) is modeled by ex-pressing annual quantity sold {{as a function of the}} available total supply, current price, and perhaps some measure of expected future price. Demand then is expressed with annual average price received by processors as the normalized The authors are professors of agricultural economics at the Uni...|$|R
