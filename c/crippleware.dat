5000|$|<b>Crippleware</b> {{has been}} defined in realms of both {{software}} and hardware. In software, <b>crippleware</b> means that [...] "vital features of the program such as printing {{or the ability to}} save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key". While <b>crippleware</b> allows consumers to see the software before they buy, they are unable to test its complete functionality because of the disabled functions. Hardware <b>crippleware</b> is [...] "a hardware device that has not been designed to its full capability". The functionality of the hardware device is limited to encourage consumers to pay for a more expensive upgraded version. Usually the hardware device considered to be <b>crippleware</b> can be upgraded to better or its full potential by way of a trivial change, such as removing a jumper wire. The manufacturer would most likely release the <b>crippleware</b> as a low-end or economy version of their product.|$|E
50|$|In software, <b>crippleware</b> {{means that}} vital {{features}} of the program such as printing {{or the ability to}} save files are disabled until the user buys the software. This allows users to {{take a close look at}} the features of a program without being able to use it to generate output. The distinction between freemium and <b>crippleware</b> is that an unlicensed freemium program has useful functionality, while <b>crippleware</b> demonstrates its potential but is not in itself useful.|$|E
50|$|SketchFighter is {{distributed}} as shareware; specifically, <b>crippleware</b> {{as only a}} subset of the game is playable prior to registration.|$|E
50|$|Possibly {{considered}} <b>crippleware,</b> a {{major concern}} is that only two projects may be hidden from the public. All other designs will be visible publicly.|$|E
50|$|LaunchBar is {{distributed}} as <b>crippleware</b> shareware - full {{usage of the}} application requires paying the registration fee, but up to 7 abbreviations may be used per session without paying anything.|$|E
50|$|Open source {{application}} {{used for}} {{the configuration of the}} solution are FreeBSD, MySQL, and Pentaho. A <b>Crippleware</b> version was made available to the sector via SAGONET. Other versions exists that addresses professional and enterprise requirements.|$|E
5000|$|One of Ambrosia's {{founding}} mantras {{was that}} shareware software {{should not be}} distributed as <b>crippleware.</b> The company's software was released on the honor system with only a short reminder that you had used the unregistered software for [...] "x" [...] amount of time, creating what is commonly called nagware. This policy has since been changed and the company today employs typical shareware piracy prevention measures, {{as well as more}} innovative ones such as used in the Escape Velocity line of games where Hector the Parrot will use her heavily armed frigate to attack players of unregistered copies after the trial period has expired. Their software products now fall under the category of <b>crippleware.</b> Matt Slot has written about the factors that played into the policy change.|$|E
50|$|Shareware is closed-source {{software}} whose owner encourages redistribution at no cost, {{but which}} the user sometimes must pay to use after a trial period. The fee usually allows use {{by a single}} user or computer. In some cases, software features are restricted during or after the trial period, a practice sometimes called <b>crippleware.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In software, <b>crippleware</b> {{means that}} [...] "vital {{features}} of the program such as printing {{or the ability to}} save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key". This allows users to {{take a close look at}} the features of a program without being able to use it to generate output.|$|E
50|$|Project DReaM {{technology}} {{required the}} software code {{to be signed}} and run on trusted computing hardware, on which unauthorized or unsigned code cannot be run. This approach was criticized by journalist Cory Doctorow, who characterized Project DReaM as <b>crippleware.</b> Project DReaM was favorably mentioned by Mike Linksvayer in a 2008 article discussing its support for fair use and Creative Commons-licensed content.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} model called shareware {{has been in}} use for software (<b>crippleware</b> or freeware) since the 1980s. This is often in a time-limited or feature-limited ("lite") version to promote a paid-for full version. The model is particularly suited to software {{as the cost of}} distribution is negligible. Thus little is lost by giving it away for free (as long as significant cannibalization is avoided).|$|E
50|$|Trialware is {{software}} with {{a built-in}} time limit. The user can try out the fully featured program until the trial period is up, and then most trialware reverts to a reduced-functionality (freemium, nagware, or <b>crippleware)</b> or non-functional mode, unless the user pays the license fee and receives a registration code to unlock the program. Trialware has become the norm for online Software as a Service (SaaS).|$|E
50|$|Bandicam is shareware, {{meaning that}} it can be tested free of charge with limited {{functionality}} (It is often called <b>crippleware).</b> The free version of Bandicam places its name as a watermark at the top of every recorded video, and each recorded video is limited to 10 minutes in length. However users can adjust the screen margin with the video screen so that the watermark is off screen from the video.|$|E
50|$|Donationware is a {{licensing}} {{model that}} supplies fully operational unrestricted software {{to the user}} and requests an optional donation {{be paid to the}} programmer or a third-party beneficiary (usually a non-profit). The amount of the donation may also be stipulated by the author, or it may be left to the discretion of the user, based on individual perceptions of the software's value. Since donationware comes fully operational (i.e. not <b>crippleware)</b> with payment optional, it is a type of freeware.|$|E
5000|$|Deliberately limited {{programs}} are usually freeware versions of computer programs that lack {{the most advanced}} (or even crucial) features of the original program. Limited versions are made available {{in order to increase}} the popularity of the full program (by making it more desirable) without giving it away free. Examples include a word processor that cannot save or print and screencasting and Video editing software programs that apply a watermark (often a logo) onto the video screen. However, <b>crippleware</b> programs can also differentiate between tiers of paying software customers.|$|E
50|$|Syntrillium Software {{was founded}} in the early 1990s by Robert Ellison and David Johnston, both former Microsoft employees. Originally {{developed}} by Syntrillium as Cool Edit, the program was distributed as <b>crippleware</b> for Windows computers. The full version was useful and flexible, particularly for its time. Syntrillium later released Cool Edit Pro, which added the capability to work with multiple tracks, {{as well as other}} features. Audio processing, however, was done in a destructive manner (at the time, most computers were not powerful enough in terms of processor performance and memory capacity to perform non-destructive operations in real time). Cool Edit Pro v2 added support for real-time non-destructive processing, and v2.1 added support for surround sound mixing and unlimited simultaneous tracks (up to the limit imposed by the actual computer hardware). Cool Edit also included plugins such as noise reduction and FFT equalization.|$|E
5000|$|... dBASE II had {{an unusual}} guarantee. Customers {{received}} a <b>crippleware</b> {{version of the}} software and a separate, sealed disk with the full version; they could return the unopened disk for a refund within 30 days. The guarantee likely persuaded many to risk purchasing the $700 application. In 1981 the founders hired David C. Cole to be the chairman, president and CEO of their group of companies. The group was called [...] "Software Plus." [...] It did not trade under its own name, but was a holding company for the three startups: Discount Software, Software Distributors, and Ashton-Tate. Cole was given free rein to run the businesses, while George Tate primarily remained involved in Ashton-Tate. Lashlee was somewhat less involved {{on a day-to-day basis}} in Ashton-Tate by this time, although he was always aware of and up to speed on all three of the businesses, and was an active board member and officer of SPI.|$|E
