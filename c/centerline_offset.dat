Each tunnel has a bore approximately 17 ft in diameter, with the track <b>centerline</b> <b>offset</b> 8 in towards the outside from the bore centerline. The tunnels flank a gallery which contains maintenance and control equipment in the upper gallery, including a pressurized water line for firefighting. Each tunnel has 56 doors opening into the lower gallery, spaced approximately 330 ft apart, numbered consecutively from the San Francisco side of the tube. The doors are locked from the gallery side and can be opened inwards (toward the gallery) from the tunnel through emergency hardware. Between doors, the tunnel has narrow 2.5 ft wide walkways adjacent to the gallery space.|$|E
40|$|ERGO, a human {{modeling}} {{software for}} ergonomic assessment and task analysis, {{was used for}} the crew systems interface analysis of the International Space Station (ISS) Propulsion Module (PM). The objective of analysis was to alleviate passageway size concerns. Three basic passageway configuration concepts: (1) 45 " clear passageway without <b>centerline</b> <b>offset</b> (2) 50 " clear passageway, 12 " <b>centerline</b> <b>offset,</b> (3) 50 " clear passageway, no <b>centerline</b> <b>offset,</b> and were reviewed. 95 percentile male and female models which were provided by the software performed crew system analysis from an anthropometric point of view. Four scenarios in which the crew floats in microgravity through a 50 " no-offset passageway as they carry a 16 " x 20 " x 30 " avionics box were simulated in the 10 -weeks of intensive study. From the results of the analysis, concept (3) was the preferred option. A full scale, three-dimensional virtual model of the ISS Propulsion Module was created to experience the sense of the Intelligent Synthesis Environment and to evaluate the usability and applicability of the software...|$|E

40|$|For {{straight}} or {{spiral bevel}} gears of nominal spherical involute design, the resultant total force vector transmitted by the gear mesh, {{in the absence of}} friction, lies in the plane of tooth contact. This force vector can be characterized by three scalar components, two orthogonal force components lying in the plane of contact and the resultant moment taken about the nominal center of the zone of contact. Equations for these three generalized force components are derived. The equations are expressed in terms of tooth pair/gear body stiffnesses, bearing/bearing support flexibility influence coefficients, the shaft input torque, deviations of the tooth running surfaces from perfect spherical involute surfaces, and bearing <b>centerline</b> <b>offsets</b> from the positions occupied by the base cone axes of the perfect involute bevel gear counterparts to the actual gears under consideration. Inertial forces arising from transverse and axial vibrations of the gear bodies are assumed to be negligible in comparison with the bearing support reaction forces...|$|R
40|$|A CFD {{parametric}} {{study was}} performed to analyze axially opposed rows of jets mixing with crossflow in a rectangular duct. An isothermal analysis was conducted to {{determine the influence of}} lateral geometric arrangement on mixing for the cases of: (1) inline (jets' centerlines aligned with each other on top and bottom walls), and (2) staggered (jets' <b>centerlines</b> <b>offset</b> with each other on top and bottom walls) configurations. For a jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio (MR) of 2. 0, design parameters were systematically varied for jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratios (J) between 16 and 64 and orifice spacing-to-duct height ratios (S/H) between 0. 125 and 1. 5. Comparisons were made between geometries optimized for S/H at a specified J. Inline configurations had a unique spacing for best mixing at a specified J. In contrast, staggered configurations had two 'good mixing' spacings for each J, one corresponding to optimum inline spacing and the other corresponding to optimum nonimpinging jet spacing. Increasing J resulted in better mixing characteristics if each configuration was optimized with respect to orifice spacing. Mixing performance was shown to be similar to results from previous dilution jet mixing investigations (MR less than 0. 5) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsteady}} distorted flowfields generated within convoluted aeroengine intakes can {{compromise the}} engine performance and operability. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for a better understanding of the complex characteristics of the distorted flow at the exit of S-shaped intakes. This work presents a detailed analysis of the unsteady swirl distortion based on synchronous, high-spatial-resolution measurements using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. Two S-duct configurations with different <b>centerline</b> <b>offsets</b> are investigated. The high-offset duct shows greater levels of dynamic and steady swirl distortion and a notably greater tendency toward bulk swirl patterns associated with high swirl distortion. More discrete distortion patterns with locally high swirl levels and the potential to impact the engine operability are identified. The most energetic coherent structures of the flowfield are observed using proper orthogonal decomposition. A switching mode is identified that promotes the alternating swirl switching mechanism and is mostly associated with the occurrence of potent bulk swirl events. A vertical mode that characterizes a perturbation of the vertical velocity field promotes most of the twin swirl flow distortion topologies. It is postulated that it is associated with the unsteadiness of the centerline shear layer...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a 5754 Al alloy and T 40 {{were joined}} in butt {{configuration}} by focusing a fiber laser onto the titanium side, {{close to the}} weld <b>centerline</b> (<b>offset).</b> The keyhole was made entirely of titanium, and the fusion of the aluminum was achieved by heat conduction. Neither filler metal nor chamfering was necessary to produce a sound, dissimilar weld. The assembly was free from porosity and spatter defects. The mechanical properties were satisfactory. The energy input, the laser offset, and their interaction had statistically significant effects on the ultimate tensile strength. The findings of this investigation prove the robustness and suitability of fiber laser offset welding for Al–Ti weld fabrication...|$|E
40|$|When a total {{pressure}} probe {{is used for}} measuring flows with transverse {{total pressure}} gradients, a displacement of the effective center of the probe is observed (designated Delta). While this phenomenon is well documented in incompressible flow and supersonic laminar flow, there is insufficient information concerning supersonic turbulent flow. In this study, three NASA Lewis Research Center Supersonic Wind Tunnels (SWT's) were used to investigate pitot probe centerline displacement in supersonic turbulent boundary layers. The relationship between test conditions and pitot probe centerline displacement error was to be determined. For this investigation, ten circular probes with diameter-to-boundary layer ratios (D/delta) ranging from 0. 015 to 0. 256 were tested in the 10 ft x 10 ft SWT, the 15 cm x 15 cm SWT, and the 1 ft x 1 ft SWT. Reynolds numbers of 4. 27 x 10 (exp 6) /m, 6. 00 x 10 (exp 6) /in, 10. 33 x 10 (exp 6) /in, and 16. 9 x 10 (exp 6) /m were tested at nominal Mach numbers of 2. 0 and 2. 5. Boundary layer thicknesses for the three tunnels were approximately 200 mm, 13 mm, and 30 mm, respectively. Initial results indicate that boundary layer thickness, delta, and probe diameter, D/delta play a minimal role in pitot probe <b>centerline</b> <b>offset</b> error, Delta/D. It appears that the Mach gradient, dM/dy, is an important factor, though the exact relationship {{has not yet been}} determined. More data is needed to fill the map before a conclusion can be drawn with any certainty. This research provides valuable supersonic, turbulent boundary layer data from three supersonic wind tunnels with three very different boundary layers. It will prove a valuable stepping stone for future research into the factors influencing pitot probe <b>centerline</b> <b>offset</b> error...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) parametric study was performed to analyze axially opposed rows of jets mixing with crossflow in a rectangular duct. Isothermal analysis was conducted to {{determine the influence of}} lateral geometric arrangement on mixing. Two lateral arrangements were analyzed: (1) inline (jets' centerlines aligned with each other on top and bottom walls), and (2) staggered (jets' <b>centerlines</b> <b>offset</b> with each other on top and bottom walls). For a jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio (MR) of 2. 0, design parameters were systematically varied for jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratios (J) between 16 and 64 and orifice spacing-to-duct height ratios (S/H) between 0. 125 and 1. 5. Comparisons were made between geometries optimized for S/H at a specified J. Inline configurations had a unique spacing for best mixing at a specified J. In contrast, staggered configurations had two 'good mixing' spacings for each J, one corresponding to optimum inline spacing and the other corresponding to optimum non-impinging jet spacing. The inline configurations, due to their smaller orifice size at optimum S/H, produced better initial mixing characteristics. At downstream locations (e. g. x/H of 1. 5), the optimum non-impinging staggered configuration produced better mixing than the optimum inline configuration for J of 64; the opposite results were observed for J of 16. Increasing J resulted in better mixing characteristics if each configuration was optimized with respect to orifice spacing. Mixing performance was shown to be similar to results from previous dilution jet mixing investigations (MR less than 0. 5) ...|$|R

40|$|An initial-phase subsonic {{diffuser}} {{has been designed}} for the turbojet flowpath of the hypersonic x 43 B flight demonstrator vehicle. The diffuser fit into a proposed mixed-compression supersonic inlet system and featured a cross-sectional shape transitioning flowpath (high aspect ratio rectangular throat-to-circular engine face) and a <b>centerline</b> <b>offset.</b> This {{subsonic diffuser}} has been fabricated and tested at the W 1 B internal flow facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. At an operating throat Mach number of 0. 79, baseline Pitot pressure recovery {{was found to be}} just under 0. 9, and DH distortion intensity was about 0. 4 percent. The diffuser internal flow stagnated, but did not separate on the offset surface of this initial-phase subsonic diffuser. Small improvements in recovery (+ 0. 4 percent) and DH distortion (- 32 percent) were obtained from using vane vortex generator flow control applied just downstream of the diffuser throat. The optimum vortex generator array patterns produced inflow boundary layer divergence (local downwash) on the offset surface centerline of the diffuser, and an inflow boundary layer convergence (local upwash) on the centerline of the opposite surface...|$|E
40|$|A controlled, laser-generated, {{freestream}} perturbation {{was created}} in the freestream of the Boeing/AFOSR Mach- 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM 6 QT). The freestream perturbation convected downstream in the Mach- 6 wind tunnel to interact with a flared cone model. The geometry of the flared cone is a body of revolution bounded by a circular arc with a 3 -meter radius. Fourteen PCB 132 A 31 pressure transducers were used to measure a wave packet generated in the cone boundary layer by the freestream perturbation. This wave packet grew large and became nonlinear before experiencing natural transition in quiet flow. Breakdown of this wave packet occurred when the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations was approximately 10 % of the surface pressure for a nominally sharp nosetip. The initial amplitude of the second mode instability on the blunt flared cone is estimated to be on the order of 10 6 times the freestream static pressure. The freestream laser-generated perturbation was positioned upstream of the model in three different configurations: on the <b>centerline,</b> <b>offset</b> from the centerline by 1. 5 mm, and offset from the centerline by 3. 0 mm. When the perturbation was offset from the centerline of a blunt flared cone, a larger wave packet was generated on the side toward which the perturbation was offset. The offset perturbation did not show as much of an effect on the wave packet on a sharp flared cone as it did on a blunt flared cone...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) can be {{used for}} joining weld lands that vary in {{thickness}} {{along the length of the}} weld. An adjustable pin tool mechanism {{can be used}} to accomplish this in a single-pass, full-penetration weld by providing for precise changes in the pin length relative to the shoulder face during the weld process. The difficulty with this approach is in accurately adjusting the pin length to provide a consistent penetration ligament throughout the weld. The weld technique, control system, and instrumentation must account for mechanical and thermal compliances of the tooling system to conduct tapered welds successfully. In this study, a combination of static and in-situ measurements, as well as active control, is used to locate the pin accurately and maintain the desired penetration ligament. Frictional forces at the pin/shoulder interface were a source of error that affected accurate pin position. A traditional FSW pin tool design that requires a lead angle was used to join butt weld configurations that included both constant thickness and tapered sections. The pitch axis of the tooling was fixed throughout the weld; therefore, the effective lead angle in the tapered sections was restricted to within the tolerances allowed by the pin tool design. The sensitivity of the FSW process to factors such as thickness offset, joint gap, <b>centerline</b> <b>offset,</b> and taper transition offset were also studied. The joint gap and the thickness offset demonstrated the most adverse affects on the weld quality. Two separate tooling configurations were used to conduct tapered thickness welds successfully. The weld configurations included sections in which the thickness decreased along the weld, as well as sections in which the thickness increased along the weld. The data presented here include weld metallography, strength data, and process load data...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} flowfields {{generated by}} convoluted aero engine intakes are {{major sources of}} instabilities that can compromise {{the performance of the}} downstream turbomachinery components. Hence, there exists a need for high spatial and temporal resolution measurements that will allow a greater understanding of the aerodynamics. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry is capable of providing such fidelity but its application has been limited previously as the optical access through cylindrical ducts for air flow measurements constitutes a notable pitfall for this type of measurements. This paper presents a suite of S-PIV measurements and flow field analysis in terms of snapshot, statistical and time-averaged measurements for two S-duct configurations across a range of inlet Mach numbers. The flow assessments comprise effects of inlet Mach number and S-duct <b>centerline</b> <b>offset</b> distance. Overall, the work demonstrates the feasibility of using S-PIV techniques for determining the complex flow field at the exit of convoluted intakes with at least two orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than the traditional pressure rake measurements allow. Analysis of the conventional distortion descriptors quantifies the dependency upon the S-duct configuration and highlights that the more aggressive duct generates twice the levels of swirl distortion than the low offset one. The analysis also shows a weak dependency of the distortion descriptor magnitude upon the inlet Mach number across the entire range of Mach numbers tested. A statistical assessment of the unsteady distortion history over the data acquisition time highlights the dominant swirl patterns of the two configurations. Such an advancement in measurement capability enables a significantly more substantial steady and unsteady flow analyses and highlights the benefits of synchronous high resolution three component velocity measurements to unlock the aerodynamics of complex engine-intake systems...|$|E
