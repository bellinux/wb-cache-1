The finishing solution consisted of Durable Press agent containing the alkyl modified dihydroxy ethylene urea/melamine formaldehyde derivative, magnesium chloride, acetic acid and two softeners of functional polysiloxane active groups. The fabric was impregnated into the solution, padded and dried at 135 °C for 30 minutes. Then it was cured at 140 °C for five minutes.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{mechanical}} performance of metakaolin-based geopolymers reinforced with refractory aluminosilicate particles and fibers, after exposure to elevated temperatures. <b>Compressive</b> strength, <b>shrinkage</b> and flexural strength data {{reveal that the}} inclusion of refractory particles, both with and without additional refractory fibers, promotes improved post-exposure compressive and flexural strengths compared with samples without reinforcement. Specimens exposed to temperatures between 600 °C and 1000 °C exhibited reduced shrinkage with the inclusion of higher contents of particles and fibers, while retaining good mechanical strength. This behavior is attributed to the cracking control achieved in these materials, which contributes to the enhancement of their volumetric stability through the combined effect of a strong interaction between reinforcing particles and the matrix leading to crack deflection, and the potential densification of the matrix–fiber interface at increased exposure temperatures, rising the stiffness of the final composite. These results indicate that metakaolin-based geopolymer composites, if designed with the correct compatibility between matrix and filler characteristics, can act as an inexpensive castable composite refractory...|$|R

To achieve more effective and long lasting repair materials, it is essential that the properties of the repair materials and the substrate are compatible. This study aims at evaluating the mechanical properties of selected classes of repair materials that are commonly used in repair application within the Kingdom. A total of 114 specimens were cast to investigate some of the important properties of nine widely used local repair materials available in the market. The properties evaluated in this study are: drying <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>compressive</b> strength and modulus of elasticity. Out of each of the selected repair materials, six specimens for shrinkage and six specimens for compressive strength and modulus of elasticity measurements were considered in the study. Additional specimens made from cement paste were used as control samples for the study. Results of the present study show that all repair materials must be checked experimentally to confirm the properties given by the supplier before their use in any field application. The study also recommends that the selection of suitable repair material should be based on the type of application, as application changes properties requirement changes.

The paste mixtures were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG). BSF activated with lime and gypsum (LG) results in larger amounts of ettringite when compared with BFS activated with lime (L). Although the porosities of the L and LG mixtures were about the same, there was a greater pore refinement for the BFS activated with lime, {{with an increase in}} mesopores volume with age. The presence of ettringite and the higher volumes of macropores cause the compressive strength of BSF activated with hydrated lime plus gypsum to be smaller than that of BFS activated with lime. For both chemical activators, compressive strength developed slowly at early ages. Autogenous and drying shrinkage were greater for the BFS activated with lime, believed to result from the more refined porous structure in comparison with the mixture activated with gypsum plus lime.
