Therefore, the Returns on Investment (ROI) vary considerably across studies, regions and sectors. The objective {{of this study is}} to explain some of the variation in the average ROI of GI by conducting a meta-analysis of 82 <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> between 1994 and 2013. In a first site, CBAs are systematically reviewed and relevant information is extracted. Particular emphasis is given to investment conditions and study characteristics. In a second step, multivariate regression methods are used to assess the size, significance and direction of individual effects. The results suggest that regional factors have the largest impact on the profitability of GI. Returns in Australia and New Zealand, for example, are four times larger than in Europe. In addition, small-scale regional investments have a 2. 5 times lower return than large-scale international investments. Overall, the expected benefits of GI investments are approximately 3. 2 times larger than the costs...|$|R

Section 203 of UMRA is a bit more extensive in that it applies to all regulatory requirements that significantly affect small governments, and requires federal agencies to provide notice of the requirements to the government(s), enable the officials of the government(s) to provide their input on the mandate, and inform and educate the government(s) on the requirements for implementation of the mandate.|$|E

Pressure came in particular from the Campaign for Borders Rail on behalf of which Petra Biberbach in February 2000 presented a petition with 17,261 signatures to the Public Petitions Committee of the Scottish Parliament. The petition received the unanimous support of the Parliament's Rural Affairs Committee which submitted it to the Parliamentary Chamber for debate. The Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council, City of Edinburgh Council, Scottish Enterprise Borders, Borders Transport Futures, Railtrack and ScotRail bid for £1.9 million from the Scottish Executive's Public Transport Fund to allow a Parliamentary Order for reopening as far as Tweedbank to be taken forward.

According to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut fuer Qualitaet und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG) has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany.

Yet, little has been done to assess uncertainty associated with natural source emissions. Importantly, uncertainty estimates continue to be particularly relevant in the assessment of potential regulatory options, as confidence in emissions can lead to different <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments.</b> To address this problem, we employed the Monte Carlo technique to improve uncertainty estimates associated with mercury emissions from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Results demonstrate that uncertainties, as they are understood in the existing literature, are overestimated.

Since total land values are fundamentally related to parcel acreages and improvement values are related to improvement size, parcel and improvement areas were interacted with appropriate access variables and structural variables. Empirical results suggest that improvement type, freeway proximity, parcel location at key network points (e. g., corner parcels), and timing of construction and completion play key roles in property valuation.

The ValueSec project, financed by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7), considers security measures which properly affect risk, are cost effective, bring benefits and are free of different restrictions (political, social, legal, psychological, etc.).

Although {{much has been written}} on the impacts of FDI in developing countries, previous studies have generally ignored macroeconomic consequences in <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments.</b> These macroeconomic aspects can be particularly important in transitional economies like Viet Nam, where some of the tools for macroeconomic stabilization may be blunt or unavailable. First, capital inflow growth needs to be accommodated by real exchange rate appreciation. In dollarized economies like Viet Nam, the nominal exchange rate cannot be relied upon to deliver it, so inflation usually results. In these economies, it is also difficult for the central bank to conduct open market operations to sterilize large capital inflows or mop up excess liquidity. Again, this could feed inflation. The combination of a young and inexperienced banking system and an investment-hungry state-owned enterprises (SOE) sector only exacerbates the situation, and increases the risk of imbalances that could result in crisis. capital inflow; macroeconomic adjustment; FDI; real exchange rate; Viet Nam...|$|R

40|$|Curbing {{greenhouse}} gases emissions from transport in cities {{is a major}} challenge for climate policies. The pioneering works of Newman and Kenworthy suggest {{that many of these}} emissions could be avoidable, since they result from city densities and the share of road traffic in urban transport. However, implementing a change raises difficult questions. The respective roles of transport and land use policies are controversial. There is an intense debate about priorities between proponents of vehicle efficiency improvements, advocates of abrupt changes in mobility behaviours, and heralds of public transport. In Europe, the sustainable city is generally seen as the inversion of the urban sprawl process, coupled with the densification of inner suburbs thanks to new public transport infrastructure. Our analysis provides an argument in favour of this scenario, by noting that <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>assessments</b> of these projects should take into account the benefits of induced changes in urban densities, even for marginal extensions. But all factors impacting urban sprawl must also be properly valued. A stylised example of the model shows that the view a single pre-determined type of post-carbon city is thus far too simplistic.

The methods provided quantitative measurements of current and predicted future ecological conditions and evaluated the benefits and costs of alternative management strategies. The approach built upon The Nature Conservancy’s conservation action planning (CAP) methodology and tools developed by the national interagency LANDFIRE program. Our approach, which we call “Enhanced CAP, ” was designed to inform proposed management actions for the Bureau of Land Management and private land managers for a 76, 464 ha (188, 946 acre) project area in California’s Bodie Hills and northern Mono Lake Basin. Five of the area’s 15 ecological systems {{were found to be}} highly departed from their reference conditions. Using computer-based modeling and collaborative stakeholder participation, varied management scenarios were simulated for 20 years and 50 years. A combination of ecologically-based and wildfire protection management was found to meet the conservation objectives for the least cost for seven of the eight systems selected for management attention. The key to enhanced planning was our ability to use remote sensing to calculate current landscape ecological condition and use computer models to isolate managemen...|$|R
