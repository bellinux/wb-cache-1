40|$|A {{method of}} {{creating}} plasma channels with <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> and transverse profile for the guiding of short, {{high power laser}} pulses for efficient electron acceleration is proposed. The plasma channel produced by the hydrogen-filled capillary discharge waveguide is modified by a ns-scale laser pulse, which heats the electrons near the capillary axis. This interaction creates a deeper plasma channel within the capillary discharge that evolves on a ns-time scale, allowing laser beams with smaller spot sizes than would otherwise be possible in the unmodified capillary discharge.

In the present work we report about the systematic electrical characterization of such micro-channels {{as a function of}} several implantation conditions, namely: ion species and energy, implantation fluence. The current-voltage (IV) characteristics of the buried channels were measured at room temperature with a two point probe station. Significant parameters such as the sheet resistance and the characteristic exponent (alpha) of the IV power-law trend were expressed as a function of damage density, with satisfactory compatibility between the results obtained in different implantation conditions.

The design, construction, {{and testing of}} a bench-top helium-powered device capable of delivering powder to <b>controllable</b> <b>depths</b> within the dermis is presented. This device uses a jet of gas undergoing choked flow to entrain powder and subsequently penetrates through the skin for delivery of the powder. Different nozzle designs and orifice geometries are also explored. In vitro injection of polymer beads (1 - 5 [mu]im in diameter) into porcine tissue demonstrate the device's capability of drug delivery to depths of 260 to 5000 [mu]m. The jet parameters of nozzle orifice diameter and applied pressure are shown to affect injection depth, shape, and success rate.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} liquid crystal (LC) adaptive optics elements to provide full 3 dimensional particle control in an optical tweezer. These devices are suitable for single controllable traps, and so are less versatile {{than many of the}} competing technologies which can be used to control multiple particles. However, they have the advantages of simplicity and light efficiency. Furthermore, compared to binary holographic optical traps they have increased positional accuracy. The transmissive LC devices could be retro-fitted to an existing microscope system. An adaptive modal LC lens is used to vary the z-focal position over a range of up to 100 μm and an adaptive LC beam-steering device is used to deflect the beam (and trapped particle) in the x-y plane within an available radius of 10 μm. Furthermore, by modifying the polarisation of the incident light, these LC components also offer the opportunity for the creation of dual optical traps of <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> and separation...|$|E
40|$|K 9 {{glass is}} a {{material}} with promising properties {{that make it}} attractive for optical devices. Ion implantation is a powerful technique to form waveguides with <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> and refractive index profile. In this work, optical planar waveguide structures were fabricated in K 9 glasses by using 6. 0 -MeV C 3 +-ion implantation with a fluence of 1. 0 x 10 (15) ions/cm(2). The effective refractive indices of the guided modes were measured by using a prism-coupling system. The refractive index change in the ion-irradiated region was simulated by using the intensity calculation method. The modal intensity profile of the waveguide was calculated and measured by using the finite difference beam propagation method and the end-face coupling technique, respectively. The transmission spectra {{before and after the}} implantation showed that the main absorption band was not influenced by the low fluence dopants.

40|$|We {{describe}} work {{in which}} gold nanoparticles were formed in diamond-like carbon (DLC), thereby generating a Au-DLC nanocomposite. A high-quality, hydrogen-free DLC thin film {{was formed by}} filtered vacuum arc plasma deposition, into which gold nanoparticles were introduced using two different methods. The first method was gold ion implantation into the DLC film {{at a number of}} decreasing ion energies, distributing the gold over a <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> range within the DLC. The second method was co-deposition of gold and carbon, using two separate vacuum arc plasma guns with suitably interleaved repetitive pulsing. Transmission electron microscope images show that the size of the gold nanoparticles obtained by ion implantation is 3 - 5 nm. For the Au-DLC composite obtained by co-deposition, there were two different nanoparticle sizes, most about 2 nm with some 6 - 7 nm. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the implanted sample contains a smaller fraction of sp(3) bonding for the DLC, demonstrating that some sp(3) bonds are destroyed by the gold implantation.

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel method for the {{fabrication}} of three-dimensional buried graphitic micropaths in single crystal diamond with the employment of focused MeV ions. The use of implantation masks with graded thickness at the sub-micrometer scale allows the formation of conductive channels which are embedded in the insulating matrix at <b>controllable</b> <b>depths.</b> In particular, the modulation of the channels depth at their endpoints allows the surface contacting of the channel terminations with no need of further fabrication stages. In the present work we describe the sample masking, which includes the deposition of semi spherical gold contacts on the sample surface, followed by MeV ion implantation. Because of the {{significant difference between the}} densities of pristine and amorphous or graphitized diamond, the formation of buried channels has a relevant mechanical effect on the diamond structure, causing localized surface swelling, which has been measured both with interferometric profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The electrical properties of the buried channels are then measured with a two point probe station: clear evidence is given that only the terminal points of the channels are electrically connected with the surface, {{while the rest of the}} channels extends below the surface. IV measurements are employed also to qualitatively investigate the electrical properties of the channels as a function of implantation fluence and annealing. Comment: 27 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

Virtual worlds feature increasing geometric and shading complexi-ties, {{resulting in a}} constant need for effective solutions to avoid ren-dering objects invisible for the viewer. This observation is partic-ularly true {{in the context of}} real-time rendering of highly occluded environments such as urban areas, landscapes or indoor scenes. This problem has been intensively researched in the past decades, resulting in numerous optimizations building upon the well-known Z-buffer technique. Among them, extensions of graphics hardware such as early Z-culling [Morein 2000] efficiently avoid shading most of invisible fragments. However, this technique is not applica-ble when the fragment shader discards fragments or modifies their depth value, or if alpha testing is enabled [nVidia 2008].

40|$|Abstract — A {{principal}} characteristic of three dimensional user interfaces {{is that it}} contains information in the 3 rd axis. Visually, this information is presented as being placed further away from the screen or having depth. A consequence {{of this is that}} information can be occluded. Determining the optimal amount of depth levels for specifically sized icons is important in the design of 3 D user interfaces. This paper investigates the depth placement of objects of a three dimensional user interface on a tablet device at the early stage of the development process. We present mixed methods evaluation with a paper prototype with a focus on the users ' subjective experiences. Users were presented with concepts of different depth levels, with and without 3 D objects. The findings indicate that users ' preference was for depth levels 3 - 5. We recommend designing 3 D UIs with a <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> by starting with a few depth levels and increasing them automatically based on the amount of 3 D objects. Also, it is important to give a user a possibility to customize depth levels when needed. This paper provides user preference information on depth for 3 D UI designers and developers, especially {{in the context of a}} touch screen tablet device.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} topics in material science is the effect of geometric confinement on nanoscale magnetic structures. Confinement produces new phenomena not observed in bulk materials and has led to a large number of technologies. An important structure featuring a geometric confinement effect is a thin film multilayer. In particular, the exchange bias effect, which is present in some ferromagnet / antiferromagnet bilayers, is used in applications such as magnetic recording, sensing, and spintronic devices. Although exchange bias {{has been the focus of}} many experimental and theoretical investigations, the details of its mechanism are still elusive. Above all, the contributions of magnetic structures in regions away from the interface remain ambiguous. This dissertation studies the individual contributions of each region of the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayer on the exchange bias. We consider the exchange bias effect in magnetic thin films as defined by the three components of the spin structure : i) at the erromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interface, ii) in the antiferromagnetic layer, and iii) in the ferromagnetic layer. We performed experiments to address individually these three constituents and found that the exchange bias is significantly affected by the bulk of both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic layers. We used Ni/FeF₂ bilayers as a prototypical exchange bias system. First, we explored magnetization reversal in cross shaped nano-junctions using the planar Hall Effect. We demonstrated how to find the direction of magnetization rotation and obtained the angular distribution of the unidirectional anisotropy axes. Second, we investigated the contribution from the antiferromagnetic bulk using ion bombardment to induce <b>controllable</b> <b>depth</b> dependent defects. We unambiguously showed that the exchange bias can be tuned without altering the interface or the ferromagnetic layer. Third, we investigated the ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence on the exchange bias. We found a strong deviation from the inverse proportionality law and demonstrated the importance of the spin structure in the ferromagnetic layer. An incomplete domain wall model was used to quantitatively account for the experimental results. Our studies show that the bulk of the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic layers, together with the interface, are crucial ingredients in the establishment and the control of the exchange bia...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} use of {{periodic}} arrays of permanent magnetic films for producing magnetic lattices of microtraps for confining, manipulating and controlling small clouds of ultracold atoms and quantum degenerate gases. Using analytical expressions and numerical calculations we show that periodic arrays of magnetic films can produce one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) magnetic lattices with non-zero potential minima, allowing ultracold atoms to be trapped without losses due to spin flips. In particular, we show that two crossed layers of periodic arrays of parallel rectangular magnets plus bias fields, or a single layer of periodic arrays of square-shaped magnets with three different thicknesses plus bias fields, can produce 2 D magnetic lattices of microtraps having non-zero potential minima and <b>controllable</b> trap <b>depth.</b> For arrays with micron-scale periodicity, the magnetic microtraps can have very large trap depths (~ 0. 5 mK for the realistic parameters chosen for the 2 D lattice) and very tight confinement...|$|R

40|$|In powder {{metallurgy}} research field, Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Metal Powder Starch Consolidation (MPSC) are relatively new rapid forming techniques to fabricate complex and near net-shaped components. The working principles of DMLS are to melt and fuse metal powder layer by layer in computer controlled systems {{to pile up}} components like three dimensional printing. It has been for instance extensively used for mould inserts, die parts, and functional metal prototypes. Another, less explored method, starch consolidation is a pressureless direct casting method which consists principally of mixing powder slurry, casting into moulds, consolidation, drying, and sintering. With a strong focus on both methods, the study here combines several strong material technology sectors; powder, rapid forming, mechanical property testing and surface technology. It covers the processing chain from green body preparation, optimization of sintering, nitriding, post sinter heat treatment, to modeling and assessment of material behaviour for end-user applications. An iron based powder and a high vanadium high speed steel powder with low and high carbon contents {{were used in the}} DMLS and MPSC processes, respectively. The overall aim of the study is to synthesize near net-shaped powder-based components, to characterize pores and microstructure, and to establish a fundamental understanding of failure mechanisms of powder based materials in bending fatigue, thermal fatigue and wear.

40|$|AbstractThe {{profile of}} an ideal volume {{substitution}} solution can be defined by volume effect and safety. The volume effect should be stable and reliable, offer a constant plateau effect and be easily <b>controllable.</b> Many in <b>depth</b> characteristics has been offered by recognized societies [1] and includes: no tissue storage, no plasma accumulation, no influence on haemostasis, no influence on the immune system, no infectivity, no antigenicity, no allergenic potential, no proinflammatory properties, no toxicity, teratogenity or mutagenity, no influence on diagnostic tests, good compatibility with other medication, good tolerance, and complete elimination. Research has shown {{that it is possible}} to meet these objectives in the development of hydroxyethyl starches (HES) by optimizing the combination of concentration, the molecular weight, the degree and pattern of substitution.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{phenomenon}} of valveless pumping is studied {{in a ring}} consisting of two tubes, a flexible and a hard one filled with water. A non zero mean flow-rate is established via a reciprocating flat plate compressing and decompressing {{a portion of the}} flexible tube with a <b>controllable</b> frequency and <b>depth</b> of compression. Four parameters of the problem were examined, namely the frequency of the oscillating plate, its length, the depth of compression and the location where the tube is compressed. Four signals were simultaneously recorded, namely the flow-rate at the mid length of the hard tube, the static pressure at the tube’s ends and the displacement of the oscillating plate. Also, the tube cross-sectional area was measured versus the displacement of the oscillating plate for various values of the maximum depth of compression. Analysis of the obtained data showed that a unidirectional flow is established increasing the frequency of compression and it maximizes when the compression frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the hydraulic loop. The mean value of the flow-rate increases when the point of compression moves far from the mid length of the flexible tube, when the length of the reciprocating plate increases and when the depth of compression increases. With regard to the direction of the flow this is from the area of the tube compression {{towards the end of the}} hard tube which is located closer to the compression area...|$|R

The reactive ion etching (RIE) is main process for hard disk drive slider fabrication. This process is much more complicated to set its parameters to the slider with the right customer specification. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid response surface methodology (RSM) based on robust parameter design (RPD) concept and data mining (DM) for the multi-response optimization of a RIE process. The approach firstly, a designed experiment (DOE) was employed to collect the process data and to indicate the critical parameters of the process. Then, support vector regression (SVR) was used to establish the nonlinear multivariate relationships between process parameters and responses. Data obtained from DOE were used in the training process. Last but not least, the regression decision tree and the domain engineering knowledge were opted for the initial point of optimization algorithm as well. Finally, the reduced gradient search algorithm, a hill-climbing procedure and desirability function were adapted to the DOE Model. While grid search and desirability function were adapted to the SVR model to find the optimum parameter setting. The technique with the highest prominent accuracy performance was selected to build a RIE process model which is SVR. As a result, the optimum condition from the final model is effectively enabled to apply in the real production based on its confirmatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Painless, rapid, controlled, {{minimally}} invasive molecular transport across human skin for drug delivery and analyte acquisition is of widespread interest. Creation of microconduits through the stratum corneum and epidermis {{is achieved by}} stochastic scissioning events localized to typically 250 μm diameter areas of human skin in vivo. Methods Microscissioning is achieved by a limited flux of accelerated gas: 25 μm inert particles passing through the aperture in a mask held against the stratum corneum. The particles scize (cut) tissue, which is removed by the gas flow with the sensation of a gentle stream of air against the skin. The resulting microconduit is fully open and may be between 50 and 200 μm deep. Results In vivo adult human tests show that microconduits reduce the electrical impedance between two ECG electrodes from approximately 4, 000 Ω to 500 Ω. Drug delivery has been demonstrated in vivo by applying lidocaine to a microconduit from a cotton swab. Sharp point probing demonstrated full anaesthesia around the site within three minutes. Topical application without the microconduit required approximately 1. 5 hours. Approximately 180 μm deep microconduits in vivo yielded blood sample volumes of several μl, with a faint pricking sensation as blood enters tissue. Blood glucose measurements were taken with two commercial monitoring systems. Microconduits are invisible to the unaided eye, developing a slight erythematous macule that disappears over days.
