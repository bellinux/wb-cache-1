5000|$|HAN is a {{potential}} rocket propellant, both in the solid form as a solid propellant oxidizer, and in the aqueous solution in monopropellant rockets, including the Network Centric Airborne Defense Element boost-phase interceptor being developed by Raytheon. [...] It is typically bonded with glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), or <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (CTPB) and requires preheating to 200-300 °C to decompose. The catalyst is a noble metal, similar to the other monopropellants that use silver or palladium.|$|E
40|$|An {{object of}} this {{invention}} {{is to provide}} a composition of beryllium hydride and <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> which is stable. Another object of this invention {{is to provide a}} method for inhibiting the reactivity of beryllium hydride toward <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene.</b> It was found that a small amount of lecithin inhibits the reaction of beryllium hydride with the acid groups in carboxy terminated polybutadiene...|$|E
40|$|The calorimetric {{values of}} {{composite}} solid propellant based on polystyrene, polyphenolformaldehyde, poly(vinyl chloride) and <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> were determined using combustion calorimetry {{in order to}} assess the uncertainities in their measurements. The dependence of the calorimetric values on various propellant composition was obtained. The stoichiometry of oxidizer and fuel in the propellant for complete combustion obtained experimentally were compared with the theoretical stoichiometry calculated based on the oxidizer decomposition...|$|E
40|$|Keeping in {{view the}} {{prospects}} of biodegradable polymers, a polymer was synthesized by the condensation of <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (CTPB) of Mnsim- 5000 with glycerol and tested for its microbial susceptibility. The results of end group estimations and viscosity measurements indicated a quantitative reaction between the two reactants under experimental conditions. The clear-zone method was employed in this investigation to test biodegradability. Two strains of Serratia and three strains of Staphylococcus did show a clear zone surrounding the colony. However, the microbial growth was found to diminish after 4 or 5 days...|$|E
40|$|Heat-up times {{derived from}} {{studies on the}} {{ignition}} characteristics of a few model composite solid propellants, containing polystyrene, <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene,</b> plasticised polyvinyl chloride and polyphenol formaldehyde as binders, {{show that they are}} directly proportional to the mass of the sample and inversely proportional to the hear flux. Propellant weight-loss prior to ignition and high pressure ignition temperature data on the propellants, ammonium per chlorate, and binders show that the ignition is governed by the gasification of the binder pyrolysis products. The activation energy for the gasification of the pyrolysed polymer products corresponds to their ignition behaviour suggesting that propellant ignition is controlled by the binder...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{understand}} the curing reactions in <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (CTPB), which happens to be the most practical binder in advanced solid composite propellants. The curing of CTPB has been studied for different ratios of curing agents (MAPO and Epoxide) by gel content, molecular weight, crosslink density, and penetration temperature measurements, and the optimum composition of curators for effective curing of CTPB has been determined. Activation energy calculations on the curing of CTPB with 9. 5 % epoxide and 0. 5 % MAPO in the temperature range 75100 °C gave 14. 1 kcal/mol for which a diffusion-controlled or acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening mechanism has been suggested for the curing process in CTPB...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of three commercial samples of <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (PBCT) resins was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at heating rates varying from 2 ° to 100 °C/min. Kinetic {{parameters of the}} decomposition process at different heating rates were evaluated {{by means of the}} Fuoss method. 1 The decomposition process and the activation energy values are found to be dependent on heating rate. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the decomposition products shows that the pyrolysis products of PBCT resins are mainly low molecular weight hydrocarbons: ethylene, acetylene, butadiene, propadiene, vinylcyclohexene, etc. The rates of evolution of these hydrocarbon products vary with the carboxy content of the PBCT resin. Based on this, a carbonium ion mechanism has been suggested for the {{thermal decomposition}}. The data generated from this work are of importance for a consideration of the mechanism of combustion of composite solid propellants based on PBCT binders...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{first report}} in which the {{influence}} of the structure of polymeric binders, such as molecular weight (M), end-group functionality and cis-trans proportion, on the combustion behaviour of composite solid propellants (CSP) has been examined. In admixture with ammonium perchlorate (AP), dicarboxylic acids were used to simulate the commonly used telechelic polymers such as <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (CTPB) fuels. The burning rate varies exponentially with the M of the acids and embraces the values for CTPB. The end-group effect diminishes at higher M due to dilution of the acid groups. The dependence of on M is expressed as a newly defined molecular weight sensitivity of burning rate (σ_ m). The σ_m values can be divided into three regimes: I (118 200) for polymeric fuels. The σ_ m values in regimes I and II are explained by the selective tendency for anhydride formation; in regime III, fragmentation of the polymeric fuel occurs. In regimes I and II, volatilization of the acids occurs at lower temperatures than for their neat form and in regime II this volatilization is limited by the phase transition of AP. The volatilization rate decreases with increase in M, but the ratio of the condensed-phase to gas-phase heat release increases with M...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of viscoelastic filled polymers strongly depend on temperature and strain rate and vary for several orders of magnitude. During service life, a viscoelastic body, especially <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (CTPB) composite solid rocket propellant grain, {{is subjected to}} many stress-inducing loads. Its structural integrity analysis (hereafter: “structural analysis”), unlike elastic bodies, is quite complex and sometimes impossible under the action of just a single load. An even greater problem occurs when multiple different types of loads act simultaneously. This study {{is based on a}} complete uniaxial mechanical characterization of a viscoelastic CTPB composite rocket propellant, made in MTI- -Belgrade, whose results were used for the analysis of the propellant grain reliability. Through an example, this paper shows a behavior of the viscoelastic propellant grain when it is subjected to extremely different environmental loads at the same time. Similar explicit examples are difficult to found in the literature, except in the form of recommended principles for analysis. It is shown that the tensile strength under the action of fast load due to the pressure may be almost 20 times greater than the tensile strength under the slow temperature load. A probabilistic approach is presented in evaluation the reliability and service life. An example is shown for a rocket propellant grain as a viscoelastic body. The presented principles of the analysis can be applied to any arbitrary viscoelastic body in other areas...|$|E
