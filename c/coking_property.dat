40|$|M. Sc. (Geology) Abstract: The Soutpansberg Coalfield is hosted in the Karoo Basin in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The {{basis of}} this {{research}} is to understand coal quality, coal composition, petrographic variations, and depositional environments, of coal samples from the Soutpansberg Coalfield. The Soutpansberg coals are preserved within extensive horst and graben systems and faults have exerted major structural controls on the geology. There are three major faults, the Klein Tshipise, Tshipise, and Bosbokpoort Faults. On the southern side of the Tshipise Fault, which is ENE-SWS trending, the coal exhibits higher reflectance values and <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> compared to the coals occurring on the northern side of the Tshipise Fault, where lower reflectance values and limited <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> occur. Thirty five samples were collected across the coalfields of Limpopo, with the focus being the Makhado area either side of the Tshipise Fault. The coal samples were sampled from the Madzaringwe Formation in the Soutpansberg and Limpopo Coalfields. Chemical analyses (including proximate analyses, CV, and total sulphur), Free Swelling Index, petrographic analyses (maceral point, vitrinite reflectance and abnormal condition), and mineral analyses (XRD, SEM, EMPA) were conducted on the samples. The petrographic analyses were carried out using Zeiss Axio Imager M 2 M retrofitted with Hilgers Diskus Fossil software, at a magnification of x 500 under oil immersion. The samples were scanned automatically and analysed offline using Fossil Student. According to the UNECE classification, the rank of the coal north of the Tshipise Fault ranged from bituminous medium Rank C - A coal and coal samples south of the Tshipise Fault ranged from medium rank C to A. Most coal samples were characterised by relatively high ash, total sulphur, and volatile matter contents, and low moisture and calorific values. High FSI number was found to be associated with samples that had high volatile matter, lower ash content and higher calorific values. The maceral analysis indicated that the coal horizons are rich in vitrinite, with low inertinite and very low liptinite contents, considered to be characteristic of the Soutpansberg coals. Pseudovitrinite was observed, which is not a good indicator for <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{study was}} undertaken to establish what effect, if any, perchloroethylene has on coal <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> Stage 1 was a kinetic {{study in which}} the Gieseler fluidity of samples of a high fluidity coal was measured over a 64 -week period. Two of the samples were left untreated, with one stored in air and one immersed in water. The third sample was also stored in air, but was soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried immediately prior to fluidity testing. In Stage 2, seven different coking coals were studied, covering three different Australian coal measures and {{a wide range of}} coking rank. For each coal, a 40 kg clean coal composite was formed using laboratory water-based methods, a Reflux Classier for the 0. 038 – 0. 25 mm and 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm size fractions and a Mintek jig for the 2. 0 – 16 and 16 – 50 mm size fractions. This 40 kg composite was then subdivided into four sub-samples. Samples A and B were coked immediately, whereas Samples C and D were stored in open trays at ambient conditions for a month before coking. Samples B and D were soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried prior to coke testing, whereas Samples A and C were left untreated. Coal properties were measured prior to coking, and after coking the NSC Coke Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) were measured. In Stage 1 it was found that storage under water was able to maintain the sample fluidity better than refrigerated storage. The combined Stage 1 and 2 results showed that perchloroethylene had a detrimental effect on the <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> of many coals. Hence coking tests on clean coal composites formed using heavy organic liquids may often under predict a coal’s true <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> This could lead to many coal deposits being undervalued. Perchloroethylene had the largest detrimental effect on the fluidity, CRI and CSR of coals that started with relatively poor properties. Perchloroethylene had a negligible effect on coals with relatively good initial <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> There was no clear correlation with vitrinite reflectance. The three most seriously affected coals all had relatively high inertinite content. It is speculated that the higher porosity of inertinite might allow greater access and retention of perchloroethylene in the coal particles. The laboratory water-based methods were able to produce clean coal composites that matched the proximate, petrographic and coal swelling number properties of the coal preparation plant product. The dilatometer and fluidity results were lower than those of the coal preparation plant, but this {{can be explained by the}} up to three month delay between mining of the original sample and the coking of the composite. These delays were an unavoidable part of the research nature of this project and had nothing to do with the water based methods deployed. If these water-based methods of preparing clean-coal composites were to become standardized, then there is no reason why a well equipped coal testing facility could not receive a refrigerated bore core and produce a clean coal composite within the period of a week...|$|R
30|$|Rank {{and type}} of coal are {{fundamental}} factors that control coal characteristics such as the <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> {{as well as other}} numerous technological applications[3].

The coals that were explored and documented are lignites of high volatile matter content, weakly coking coals and medium-coking coals[6].

40|$|The {{vitrinite}} group macerals are {{the most}} important reactive component in the coking process, but reactivity can be reduced by weathering and oxidation [1]. Maceral reactivity, and its susceptibility to oxidation, is also dependent on rank. As a result, coals are not all susceptible to weathering to the same degree, suggesting that medium volatile, moderate vitrinite coals could be stockpiled for up to 8 weeks without any deterioration in coke quality. Understanding the factors affecting coking coal variability during mining can assist with producing consistent product over the life of mine.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The size distribution and strength of metallurgical coke are factors vital for the steady and high-efficiency operation of a blast furnace, since these factors govern stack penneability. Coke strength influences the size of lump coke {{not only because of}} size degradation by impact and abrasion during transfer to and descent in the blast furnace, but also because of its influence on the fracture which takes place in the coke layer during carbonisation and the effect this has on the initial mean size and size distribution of the feed coke. Therefore, the elucidation of the relationship between coke strength and the fissure fonnation phenomena is significant. In this study, therefore, the coke strength development during carbonisation has been examined in conjunction with various parameters, such as the degree of carbonisation of the coal, namely the extent or fraction of pyrolytic reaction, and the degree of graphitisation of the coke, as well as carbonisation temperature and heating regime. The porous structure of coke has also been examined with a view to establishing a relation between the porous structure and the <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> of the coal carbonised. The quality of coke porous structure was evaluated by parameters introduced in this study, i. e., the pore size distribution and pore rugosity factors. A poor porous structure is shown to be associated with high proportion of small pores and pores with a rough surface. These features are considered to stem from poor <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> and the consequent poor adhesion between coal particles. An attempt has also been made to establish a mathematical model capable of predicting the degree of fissuring of coke during carbonisation by utilising the understandings obtained in this study of the coke strength development during carbonisation and the effect of coal properties on coke strength. Coke samples large enough to facilitate the observation of the degree of fissuring in relation to various coal properties and heating conditions, were made to evaluate the mathematical model and introduce the concept. The concept that fissuring takes place when developing thennal stress exceeds the developing coke strength is demonstrated to be capable to evaluate the effects of coal properties and heating conditions on the degree of fissuring observed...|$|R
40|$|Coal mine fires due to {{spontaneous}} heating {{are a major}} problem in coal mining industry worldwide. In this process, coal reacts with oxygen of air at ambient temperature liberating heat, which if not properly dissipated may lead to increase in temperature, which in turn enhances the rate of reaction, ultimately culminating in open fire. Occurrences of {{spontaneous heating}} in mines are major cause of accidents, resulting in loss of lives and property. Development of spontaneous heating in any section/part of a mine creates problems for the workings of nearby areas. They also cause loss of coal reserves, sterilisation of resources, reduction of heating values and <b>coking</b> <b>properties,</b> and environmental pollution. Since, all coals do not show the same heating tendency on exposure to air, its assessment is essential to plan the production and storage capabilities in mines. Different experimental techniques are followed in different countries for assessment of the spontaneous heating tendency. However, any particular experiment does not yield a confirmatory result. Therefore, some researchers suggest to conduct multiple number of experiments in order to reach at a definite conclusion (Banerjee, 2000). In this study, an attempt has been made to study the spontaneous heating tendency of Indian coal seams by using different experimental techniques...|$|R
40|$|Four {{bituminous}} coals of {{the same}} rank but with different thermoplastic properties were oxidized at 40 and 50 °C for one month. The chemical changes due to oxidation were studied by applying Gieseler plastometry, the free-swelling index (FSI), thermogravimetric analysis and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In general, oxidation at 50 °C produced a greater impairment of <b>coking</b> <b>properties,</b> the different responses to oxidation depending on the parent coal. The main effects caused by oxidation were a loss of thermoplastic properties, a decrease in aliphatic hydrogen and {{a slight increase in}} groups with oxygen functionalities. Both the fresh and oxidized coals were carbonized in a movable-wall oven of 17 kg capacity {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes was tested by means of the JIS and ASTM standard methods.

40|$|The Reflux Classifier (RC) is a {{separation}} technique {{which has been}} used in the coal and mineral processing industries. It uses water as a medium, and is therefore a suitable preparation device for studies on coking coal as other separation techniques may change <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> The separation process was conducted by using a channel spacing of 3 mm between two adjacent plates (a deviation from the previous 1. 77 -mm spacing which promoted laminar flow). The 3 -mm channel gap which equated to nominal particle size of coking coal in coke oven charge could lead to a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the separation process. By changing water flow rate in the separation system, two coals, one coking coal and one thermal coal with particle size of − 210 + 100 μm, were separated into different fractions. The fractions contained vitrinite-rich and inetinite-rich concentrates with vitrinite concentration between 28 – 84 % for the coking coal and 20 – 75 % for the thermal coal. In both coals, telovitrinite and semifusinite were the two maceral components of which concentration varied the most. The products relative density and ash yield both decreased with increasing vitrinite content without any apparent changes in the particle size distribution.

However, the catalyst deactivation due to the sintering under moderate/high temperature operation and coke formation in hydrocarbon participating systems poses a challenge for their usage. Our work focuses on solving the above issues by designing and developing a series of metal core silica shell materials. The fundamental understanding of core shell materials is facilitated by systematic investigation via synthesis, characterization (XRD, TEM, BET, EDX) and catalytic tests (CO oxidation, ethylene hydrogenation, CO methanation and catalytic partial oxidation of methane). The synthesis and post-treatment methods for this newly developed core shell material are optimized and standardized. We demonstrate fine control over the key structural elements of nickel core silica shell material. Two different nickel core silica shell structures are obtained with the distinction of a pronounced cavity in the core. The synthesis route {{is not limited to}} nickel particles, but also applied for a range of other metals (e. g. Cu, Co, Pd). The pore size of silica shell is around 1 nm independent of the shell thickness and structure difference. The thermal stability of nickel particles as a function of particle size as well as silica support is thoroughly studied. The nickel particles in core shell materials are stabilized under 5 nm up to 1000 C with the comparison of strong sintering of unprotected nickel particles beyond 10 nm as low as 500 C. The stable core shell material not only shows its advantage for stable operation under high temperature reactive condition (> 800 C), but also possesses the highly <b>coking</b> resistant <b>property</b> in fuel participating reactions. Even though the presence of silica shell is beneficial for improving stability of nickel particles, it brings up significant mass transfer limitation when shell thickness is beyond 10 nm. We not only demonstrate the capability to synthesize the well controlled nanocatalysts with high temperature stability and minimal mass transfer limitation, but also understand the structure correlated reactivity in several reaction systems. Additionally, we highlight the correlation between sintering, mass transfer and <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> of the catalysts...|$|R

The objective was to determine in depth the {{physical and chemical properties}} of a series of natural and pure vitrinites of different rank, and the influence that the sedimentary and post-sedimentary conditions had on them. It is demonstrated that although vitrains are almost entirely made up of the huminite/vitrinite maceral group they have a different composition, thermal behaviour and physical properties. Thus, geochemical and textural properties of Blanzy–Montçeau vitrains can be considered to be representative of the telinite, the major component in both samples (75 % vol.) {{at the beginning of the}} bituminization stage (subbituminous/high volatile C bituminous coals). The characteristics of the Puertollano vitrains described here can also be attributed to the telocollinite (> 80 % vol.) for the high volatile C bituminous coal. Variations in physico-chemical properties between Puertollano and Blanzy–Montçeau vitrains are due to the differences in the initial composition of organic matter. Slight differences (i. e., bed moisture content or porosity) between vitrains from the two coal seams in the same basin can be attributed to their stratigraphic position. Several parameters such as S 2, HI, oil and extraction yield and fluorescent properties suggest that the Puertollano and Blanzy–Montçeau vitrains have a lower hydrocarbon potential. The relationships between geochemical and textural properties make it possible to distinguish between ‘normal' and perhydrous vitrains.

[EN] Metallurgical coke is an irreplaceable {{raw material}} {{used for the}} production of iron and steel. The shortage and high price of premium coals {{for the production of}} high quality coke, technological developments for the replacement of coke in the blast furnace by other fuels and reducing agents, and commitment of the society to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have redirected the focus of research towards alternative technologies that allow the production of high quality coke while reducing its costs and gas emissions to the environment. These new methods involve the modification of coal blends and the incorporation, as secondary raw materials, of organic industrial waste and biomass, classified as zero emissions of CO 2. Biomass and charcoal are products of great interest, the latter form a significant part of this work. Accordingly this work explores the addition of charcoal to coal blends for the production of coke and the production of Fe-Coque briquettes with unexpensive materials such as iron ore fines and coals with poor <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> In order to follow the modifications that coal undergoes during its transformation to coke, this doctoral thesis uses optical microscopy and other additional techniques to trace the transformations of coal macerals during the carbonization process, and to define their relation to their thermoplastic behavior with special emphasis on organic components, traditionally considered as inert. In order to achieve this goal, coals typically used in the production of metallurgical coke of different rank, maceral composition, chemical and thermoplastic properties, and geographic origin, are characterized by scan analysis at maceral level. As a result a threshold of inertinite reflectance was established.

Process conditions in pressurised gasification differ from conventional entrained flow combustion in pressure, atmosphere, peak temperature and heating rate, yet there is sparse literature concerning coal behaviour under pressurised conditions. Previous work suggests that bituminous coals can show enhanced plasticity at high pressures and this phenomenon may not be predicted by standard tests of <b>coking</b> <b>properties.</b> Previous modelling of char reactivity and burnout in combustion and gasification has failed {{to take account of}} the petrographic variability of coals. Current work to improve the predictive capacity of these models requires evaluation of the effects of different macerals and of char preparation pressure on char behaviour. Prior studies of whole coals subjected to high pressure and high temperature conditions have shown that daughter char morphology is influenced by particle heating rate, the size distribution of the feed coal, furnace pressure, feed rate, coal rank and the parent coal petrography. Chars were produced by pyrolysis at 1100 or 1300 °C and 1, 5, 8, 10 and 15 atm furnace pressure, and by combustion at 1100 °C and 1 atm furnace pressure, from a suite of East Australian bituminous coals. The characteristics of the chars and their parent feed coals were quantified using semi-automated image analysis, as well as petrographic, particle size and chemical analyses. Relationships between the morphology of the chars and properties of the parent coal and furnace pressure were established. Daughter char morphology and volatile yield was found {{to be related to the}} petrographic composition of the parent feed coals, their full reflectance profiles and the char preparation pressure. Chars derived from vitrinite-rich lithotypes and those prepared under high pressure conditions show larger mean diameters, porosities, sphericities and proportions of porous char types. Volatile yield is related to the vitrinite content of the lithotype. A parameter derived from full coal reflectograms proves to be effective for prediction of char morphology and trends in volatile yield. The Carbon Burnout Kinetic model is improved in its predictive value by including parent coal vitrinite content as an input parameter and could be further improved by utilising the full coal reflectogram parameter...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells {{consist of a}} complex {{multicomponent}} structure that relies heavily on inorganic materials chemistry to develop new compositions of enhanced functionality. In all aspects of both oxide ion and proton conducting based devices the structural and electrochemistry of ceramics is essential to future developments. In the preceding discussion we have highlighted a number of novel solutions for the electrolyte, anode and cathode functional components of SOFCs that overcome some of the materials limitations facing fuel cell developers. Much of this has concerned the reduction in operating temperature coupled with the durability of the materials {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions, including anode resistance to sulphur and <b>coking.</b> Enhanced <b>properties</b> may be achieved through the use of thin films of functional components, such as with yttria stabilised zirconia on SrTiO 3, but many questions as to the nature and origin of these enhancements remain. It is evident that there remains rich inorganic chemistry to be discovered and exploited in this vital technology area. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Directores: Ramón Álvarez García y Mª Antonia Díez Díaz-EstébanezThe {{environmental impact}} due to waste production, {{both domestic and}} industrial, has become a maximum priority of environmental policies in developed countries. Even though waste management has undergone a significant evolution in the last decades, the waste recovery continues being of great importance to achieve sustainable development and compatible with the environmental protection; so it has been necessary to allocate time and resources to develop processes to ensure that plastic recycling is an economically profitable process, and in this way, it helps to decrease the amount of residues designated to landfill disposal. As a result of recent European legislation for management and recovery of plastic wastes from packaging, is being promoted {{the development of new}} processes of mechanical and chemical recycling and energy recovery, in order to achieve the recycling objectives. Other type of wastes which gives good reasons for special attention are used oils, so common in our daily lives, and used in the operation of industrial machinery, automotive vehicles or transmission hydraulic systems, to mention some of the most significant examples. The loss of their properties after the continued use is unfortunately accompanied by the generation of residual oils, therefore, it is necessary to establish measures to minimize as much as possible the production of these hazardous wastes and promote that the generated wastes are managed by the alternatives which ensure environmental protection and health of people. The development of new recycling ways to allow the recovery of both types of residues is very important in order to keep as many options open, especially when an existing industrial process can be used and it is not necessary any operational variation made by the industry. In this sense, integrated steel plants can be considered as an option for those wastes with technical limitations for conventional recycling. The combination of the blast furnace route and coke plant in the steel industry, provide a way to expand feedstock recycling with economic, social and environmental benefits. In the present work we have studied the viability of this action via, the cocarbonization of the wastes with coal for the production of coke, which feeds the blast furnace to produce iron which subsequently will be transformed into steel. To achieve this general objective, the specific objectives focus on the study of the influence on the <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> of an individual coal and three coal blends used by the industry for blast-furnace coke production, of the six more common thermoplastics in the domestic wastes (LOPE, HOPE, PP, PS, PET and PVC), and six mixtures of them, covering a wide range of compositions. Also, nine lube-oils were used. Oils have paraffin nature except one of them which is a synthetic oil containing organic esters. Two oils mixtures were prepared based on their thermal behaviour and as reference materials a coal-tar and a coaltar pitch were used. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Rice starch {{contains}} {{two types of}} glucose polymers, mainly linear amylose and hyper-branched amylopectin. Waxy rice has been characterised {{by the lack of}} amylose, the proportion of which being {{one of the most important}} parameters measured for rice quality. Germplasm collection work conducted in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has previously demonstrated the diversity of this type of rice in terms of quality. The definition of a waxy rice variety is dependent on the meaning of amylose. The conventional method for determining amylose content has shown that waxy rice could have up to 5 % amylose. However, including a 0 % amylose standard in the standard curve causes the amylose content of these varieties to become 0 - 2 %. In this work, the absence of amylose in waxy rice has been determined through three different approaches. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS 1), the enzyme which synthesises amylose, was not detected in waxy rice. Long linear chains associated with amylose were also not detected by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The absence of these long chains affected functional properties of waxy rice, as indicated by the differences in viscosity curves between waxy and non-waxy rice. Moreover, these waxy varieties themselves exhibit differences in their viscosity curves, another indication of the diversity in <b>coking</b> <b>properties</b> in these varieties. A new approach, the ‘lnP(N) technique’, in analysing chain length distributions was applied to varieties with known mutations in two of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of amylopectin, and in determining gelatinisation temperature. It was determined that the presence of a novel feature, an interruption to linearity at DP 18 - 24, of the lnP(N) plot was found in rice samples with mutations in the alk gene, which codes for starch synthase (SS) IIa, and in samples with inactive branching enzyme (BE) IIb. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding for SSIIa have been associated with lowered gelatinisation temperature. On the other hand, non-functionality of BEIIb changes the amylopectin structure such that gelatinisation temperature is increased. The novel feature of the lnP(N) plot is found when either or both SSIIa and BEIIb are non-functional. Waxy rice starch has hot-water-soluble (HWS) and insoluble (HWI) components. It has been confirmed that the soluble polysaccharides are structurally different from phytoglycogen, and are similar to amylopectin. Structural differences between the two fractions, which can account for their differences in solubility, were determined. At the level of the chain length distribution, the HWI fraction contained long chains not found in the HWS fraction. Considerable amounts of sucrose and glucose were found in the HWS fraction. At another level of structure, the degree of branching of the HWS components was higher than in the HWI fraction. On the other hand, the whole molecules of the HWS fraction were smaller than those of the HWI fraction. These structural differences between the two fractions potentially affected their physical behaviour, particularly solubility. The amount of leached material appears to be a property of the method, as varying cooking conditions changed the amount of HWS components. This amount reaches equilibrium at certain conditions, indicating the limited amount of the HWS material. On the other hand, the HWI component contains molecules that are insoluble in water, rather than molecules that solubilise slowly. Given the stability of the HWS fraction in solution, the ratio of the HWS fraction to the HWI fraction could potentially be used in measuring quality if the amount of the HWS fraction is variety-specific. However, the quantity of the HWS fraction appears to be a feature of the starch, rather than of the variety. Nevertheless, the fact that the soluble fraction is structurally and thermodynamically different from the insoluble fraction could presumably be grounds to classify the soluble component as a group of molecules distinct from amylopectin...|$|R
40|$|A pilot-scale biomass-gasification-reforming system (feedstock of 150 - 300 kg/h, on a dry basis) was {{established}} to produce synthesis gas for liquid fuel synthesis. The design and operation of this-system were preliminarily discussed. Reforming of biomass raw fuel gas over NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts was investigated in a multi tube reformer. The anti <b>coking</b> and anti-sintering <b>properties</b> of NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts were Characterized. The {{results showed that the}} NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalyst with a pore channel size of 7 x 7 mm could continuously deal with biomass raw fuel gas containing large amounts of fly ash. NO channel blocking was observed for a long time running. The pressure drop, of the reformer was only below 700 Paeven under the conditions of fuel gas velocity of 1. 4 m/s and fly ash content of 330 g N- 1 m(- 3) in the raw fuel gas. The synthesis gas [H- 2 + CO > 60 vol %, H- 2 /CO ratio = 0. 9 - 1. 0, and lower heating value (LHV) > 10 MJ N- 1 m(- 3) ], could be produced by the biomass-gasification-reforming process under the conditions of total equivalence ratio (ERT) of 0. 27 (ERfirst of 0. 23, ERsecond of 0. 02, and ERthird of 0. 02) and steam/biomass (S/B) ratio of 0. 4. The cold gas efficiency was above 82 %. The characterization of the spent catalysts thermogravimetic (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analyses indicated that the NiO-MgO solid solution structure in the catalyst could restrain the active Ni- 0 centers from agglomeration and decrease carbon deposition. No serious alkali compound deposition {{on the surface of the}} catalyst was detected after the 60 h time-on-stream test. The pilot-scale biomass-gasification-reforming system exhibited excellent operation stability and flexibility...|$|R
