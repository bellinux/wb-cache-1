5|$|Russia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are {{all members}} of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an {{alternative}} military alliance. In 2009, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin did not rule out joining NATO at some point, but stated that Russia was currently more interested in leading a coalition as a great power.

40|$|Abstract In game theory, it is {{well known}} that being able <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{strategy}} before other players move can be beneficial. In this paper, we analyze how much benefit a player can derive from commitment in various types of games, in a quantitative sense that is similar to concepts such as the value of mediation and the price of anarchy. Specifically, we introduce and study the value of pure commitment (the benefit of <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pure strategy), the value of mixed commitment (the benefit of <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mixed strategy), and the mixed vs. pure commitment ratio (how much can be gained by <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mixed strategy rather than a pure one). In addition to theoretical results about how large these values are in the extreme case in various classes of games, we also give average-case results based on randomly drawn normal-form games...|$|R

5|$|Halloween is an American horror {{franchise}} {{that consists of}} ten films, novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game. The franchise predominately focuses on the fictional character of Michael Myers who was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sanitarium as a child {{for the murder of}} his older sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of Haddonfield, Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of Halloween, on which all of the films primarily take place.|$|E

Based on Scott McPherson's {{screenplay}} adaptation {{of his own}} 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mental asylum for setting fire to his mother's house.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} Lord Rothschild's 1971 {{proposal for}} market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should {{not interfere with}} funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32percent to 62percent.|$|E

5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{policy of}} neutrality, {{and the country}} would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was not {{satisfied}} with the reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{body was}} taken to Athens on the Amphitrite, escorted by a {{flotilla}} of naval vessels. For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the Danish and Greek flags, lay in the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens before his body was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tomb at his palace in Tatoi.

5|$|While MIT is {{a private}} institution, Walker's {{extensive}} civic activities as President set the precedent for future presidents to use the post to fulfill civic and cultural obligations throughout Boston. He served {{as a member of}} the Massachusetts Board of Education (1882–1890), Boston School Committee (1885–1888), Boston Art Commission (1885–1897), Boston Park Commission (1890–1896), Massachusetts Historical Society (1883–1897), and a trustee of the Boston Public Library in 1896. Walker was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of reforms in public and normal schools such as secular curricula, expanding the emphasis on arithmetic, reducing the emphasis on ineffectual home exercises, and increasing the pay and training of teachers.|$|E

40|$|We model rent seeking in {{litigation}} in weak legal systems as a Tulloch contest in which litigators may seek {{to influence the}} court directly through bribery {{as well as through}} the merit of the legal case that they bring. If the local firm has a competitive advantage in influencing the court then there is a strategic asymmetry between the players: the local firm regards expenditure by the foreign firm as a strategic complement, but the for-eign firm regards local expenditure as a strategic substitute. This leads to different attitudes to commitment: the local firm would like <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high level of effort to influence the court, the foreign firm <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low one. There is also an asymmetry in the commitment technology. It is not easy <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low level of bribery, but it is feasible <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high one: once a payment is made it cannot easily be recovered. We model the interaction as a two stage game: the players simultaneously <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> minimum level of effort, then they play a simultaneous Tulloch influ...|$|R

Later, Susan discovers that Mary Alice's husband, Paul (Mark Moses), had their son, Zach (Cody Kasch), <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> youth mental institution after he broke into the Van de Kamp house and decorated it for Christmas, Julie begins corresponding with Zach without Susan's knowledge and hides him in her room when he escapes from the institution. When Susan finds Zach in her home, she and Mike return him to Paul; however, Julie and Zach continue dating. Paul fabricates unconvincing lies to thwart Susan's efforts to discover his family's secrets too.|$|E
5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
