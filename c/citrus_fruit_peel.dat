40|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, dried <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> {{are widely}} used as remedies to alleviate some respiratory inflammatory syndromes and are considered as potential sources of anti-inflammatory components. Seven <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were selected for this study. We determined the inhibitory ability of citrus peel extracts on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and nitric oxide (NO), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated RAW 264. 7 cells. Among the tested citrus peels, Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and Tonkan (Citrus tankan Hayata) deserve special attention due to their outstanding inhibitory effect on PGE(2) and NO secretion. We have also examined the composition, flavanone glycosides and polymethoxy flavones. The polymethoxy flavone content, especially nobiletin, appears to correlate well with the anti-inflammatory activities of certain citrus peel extracts. Thus, our results suggest that polymethoxy flavones contribute crucially to the anti-inflammatory activity of citrus peels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|What is Balsam of Peru {{and where}} is it found? Balsam of Peru is a sticky {{aromatic}} liquid that comes from cutting the bark of the tree Myroxolon balsamum, a tree that is native to El Salvador. The "Peru " part of Balsam of Peru originates from {{when it was first}} named, El Salvador then being part of a Peruvian colony. Balsam of Peru smells of vanilla and cinnamon because it contains 60 - 70 % cinnamein (a combination of cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, benzyl benzoate, benzoic acid and vanillin). The other 30 - 40 % contains resins of unknown composition. It also contains essential oils similar to those in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peel.</b> These are all potential allergens. Balsam of Peru is not only used for its aromatic and fixative (i. e. delays evaporation) properties but also for its mild antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic attributes. It has 3 main uses: fragrance in perfumes and toiletries; flavouring in food and drink; healing properties in medicinal products.

30|$|Pectin is a natural, linear, {{heterogeneous}} polysaccharide industrially {{extracted from}} <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> and apple pomace (May 1990; Augustine et al. 2015 d). Pectin mainly consists of d-galacturonic acid (GalA) units joined in chains {{by means of}} α (1 – 4) glycosidic linkages with alternating side chains of α (1 – 4) D-gaIactose and d-arabinose (Augustine et al. 2013). The unique gel forming ability of polyuronates {{in the presence of}} calcium ions makes them ideal for drug delivery and wound dressing applications (Augustine and Rajarathinam 2012). The divalent calcium ions and the negatively charged carboxylate groups of the polyuronates forms intermolecular crosslinks resulting in an “egg-box” structure of rigid gel networks which are relatively stable under physiological conditions. Low methoxy (LM) pectins gels in the presence of divalent cations, such as Ca 2 + (Augustine et al. 2015 d).|$|R
40|$|The sterol {{regulatory}} element binding proteins (SREBPs) are key regulators for sterol homeostasis in most fungi. In {{the citrus}} postharvest pathogen Penicillium digitatum, the SREBP homolog {{is required for}} fungicide resistance and regulation of CYP 51 expression. In this study, we identified another SREBP transcription factor PdSreB in P. digitatum, and the biological functions of both SREBPs were characterized and compared. Inactivation of PdsreA, PdsreB or both genes in P. digitatum reduced ergosterol contents and increased sensitivities to sterol 14 -α-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and cobalt chloride. Fungal strains impaired at PdsreA but not PdsreB increased sensitivity to tridemorph and an iron chelator 2, 2 '-dipyridyl. Virulence assays on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> revealed that fungal strains impaired at PdsreA, PdsreB or both induce maceration lesions similar to those induced by wild-type. However, ΔPdsreA, ΔPdsreB or the double mutant strain rarely produce aerial mycelia on infected <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peels.</b> RNA-Seq analysis showed the broad regulatory functions of both SREBPs in biosynthesis, transmembrane transportation and stress responses.

Chlorophyllide a and another polar, dephytylated derivative accumulated in large amounts in senescing Citrus peel, particularly in fruit treated with ethylene. Ethylene also induced a 4 -fold increase in the specific activity of Citrus chlorophyllase (chlorophyll chlorophyllidohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 14). Detailed kinetics based on a hexane/acetone solvent partition system showed that the in vivo increase in dephytylated derivatives coincided with the decrease in total chlorophyll. Polar, dephytylated derivatives accumulated also in senescing Melia leaves. Senescing parsley leaves revealed a very different picture. The gradual disappearance of chlorophyll a was accompanied {{by an increase in}} pheophytin a and by the transient appearance of several phytylated derivatives. Only pheophytin a and an adjacent peak were left when all the chlorophyll a had disappeared.

40|$|Fermentation {{is one of}} {{bioconversion}} {{to produce}} profitable anaerobic microbes and to produce various enzymes. Lipases and cellulases are widely used enzymes so far. Cellulases {{play an important role}} in bioconversion of organic waste cellulosic materials to glucose, single cell proteins, animal feed, and ethanol. Lipases can also degrade fatty ester bond. Therefore, both enzymes are potential to be used in industry as well as in households. Fermentation of fruit peel waste is an attempt to produce cellulase and lipase that can be carried out in a simple way. Cellulase as says was performed using DNS (3. 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid) and acid-base titration for analysis of lipase using cooking oil as the substrate. The results showed that the highest cellulase activity was obtained from watermelon rind mixed with <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peel</b> of 0. 036 U/mL, and mixed of banana peel and citrus fruit, which was 0. 035 U/mL. The optimum lipase activity was at 30 oC, pH 7, and reaction time of 60 minutes. The highest lipase activity (1. 36 U/mL) was obtained from mixture of watermelon and orange rind.

40|$|One of {{untapped}} potentials of agro-wastes {{from the}} manufacture of lime juice squeezed lime juice (Jeniper) in Kuningan is lime peel. The waste is simply thrown away, whereas lime peel can be used or recycled into other products of economic value. A good way is to extract the compound limonene from <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peel,</b> then limonene is mixed with paraffin to produce aromatic candle that {{has a variety of}} advantages such as an insect repellent, air freshener, and as aroma therapy. Aromatic candles from that recycling have a scent that is not too overpowering so it does not cause excessive VOC but remain optimal in the expulsion of insects. In addition, this candle has the same form as candles in general, so the wax remains affordable price if commercialized. This study aims to determine the amount of limonene extract concentration of lime peel that can produce aromatic candle insect repellent (repellen). This study uses experimental design with 4 complete treatment randomized design that is the addition of extracts of limonene 0 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 4 %, and 0. 5 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was the isolation of a yeast strain, from <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peels,</b> able to produce a polygalacturonase by submerged fermentation with maceration activity of raw cassava roots. Among 160 yeast strains isolated from citrus peels, one strain exhibited the strongest pectinolytic activity. This yeast was identified as Wickerhamomyces anomalus by 5. 8 S-ITS RFLP analysis and confirmed by amplification of the nucleotide sequence. The yeast produced a polygalacturonase (PG) in Erlenmeyer shake flasks containing YNB, glucose, and citrus pectin. PG synthesis occurred during exponential growth phase, reaching 51 UE. mL- 1 after 8 hours of fermentation. A growth yield (Yx/s) of 0. 43 gram of cell dry weight per gram of glucose consumed was obtained, and a maximal specific growth rate (µm) of 0. 346 h- 1 was calculated. The microorganism was unable to assimilate sucrose, galacturonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, or citrus pectin, but it required glucose as carbon and energy source and polygalacturonic acid or citrus pectin as inducers of enzyme synthesis.

40|$|Citrus is {{the first}} tree crop in terms of fruit production. The colour of Citrus fruit {{is one of the}} main quality attributes, caused by the {{accumulation}} of carotenoids and their derivative C 30 apocarotenoids, mainly ?-citraurin (3 -hydroxy-?-apo- 8 ?-carotenal), which provide an attractive orange-reddish tint to the peel of oranges and mandarins. Though carotenoid biosynthesis and its regulation have been extensively studied in Citrus fruits, little is known about the formation of C 30 apocarotenoids. The aim of this study was to the identify carotenoid cleavage enzyme(s) [CCD(s) ] involved in the peel-specific C 30 apocarotenoids. In silico data mining revealed a new family of five CCD 4 -type genes in Citrus. One gene of this family, CCD 4 b 1, was expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of different Citrus species in a pattern correlating with the accumulation of C 30 apocarotenoids. Moreover, developmental processes and treatments which alter <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>peel</b> pigmentation led to changes of ?-citraurin content and CCD 4 b 1 transcript levels. These results point to the involvement of CCD 4 b 1 in ?-citraurin formation and indicate that the accumulation of this compound is determined by the availability of the presumed precursors zeaxanthin and ?-cryptoxanthin. Functional analysis of CCD 4 b 1 by in vitro assays unequivocally demonstrated the asymmetric cleavage activity at the 7 ?, 8 ? double bond in zeaxanthin and ?-cryptoxanthin, confrming its role in C 30 apocarotenoid biosynthesis. Thus, a novel plant carotenoid cleavage activity targeting the 7 ?, 8 ? double bond of cyclic C 40 carotenoids has been identified. These results suggest that the presented enzyme is responsible for the biosynthesis of C 30 apocarotenoids in Citrus which are key pigments in fruit coloration. The Author 2013...|$|E

Methods：New Zealand White Rabbits (2. 0 - 2. 5 Kg) were divided to three groups；group without treatment, group treated with 100 mg/kg/d or 500 mg/kg/d naringin, and group treated with 1 mg/kg/d or 20 mg/kg/d lovastatin. They were fed on 0. 25 % or 1. 0 % cholesterol-containing diet for 8 weeks and then sacrificed. Blood samples were collected for measurement of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, serum GOT and GPT. Aortas and livers were harvested for evaluation of fatty streak and pathologic examination. Results： 1) Feeding of 1 % cholesterol diet for eight weeks significantly increased the cholesterol level upto 20 folds. Neither lovastatin nor naringin did lower these marked hypercholesterolemia. But both naringin (500 mg/kg/d) and lovastatin (1 mg/kg/d) significantly reduced the area of fatty streak by 75 % and 58 %, respectively. Naringin was more effective in inhibition of fat infiltration into liver than lovastatin which showed hepatotoxicity as increase of serum GPT level (p< 0. 01). 2) Feeding of 0. 25 % cholesterol diet for eight weeks significantly increased the cholesterol level upto 17 folds.

Phenolic compounds in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> such as mandarin, lemon, orange and grapefruit were determined either in the juices or in the peel extracts. Total phenolic content was determined in a spectrophotometer at 685 nm using the adapted Folin-Ciocalteu method. Total flavonoid content was measured using LC/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). The effects of the <b>fruit</b> juices and <b>peel</b> extracts on the selected lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii NRRL B 5448, Lb. casei NRRL B 1922, Lb. acidophilus NRRL B 4495) were investigated. The tested lactic acid bacteria were significantly affected by chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, naringin and caffeic acid compared to the control samples (P≤ 0. 05). Antioxidant properties of fruit samples were also measured using the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) method. The phenolics positively affected the metabolism of bacteria, with the stimulatory effects of the assayed samples being influenced by the phenolic profile...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study As (V) was removed by <b>citrus</b> paradisi (grape <b>fruit)</b> <b>peel.</b> Kinetics of the {{adsorption}} reaction was analyzed by the Pseudo second order and Morris-weber equations. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models were utilized for {{understanding of the relationship}} between the arsenic ions and citrus paradisi peel adsorbent. The maximum measured uptake capacity of citrus paradisi was 37. 76 mg. g- 1 at pH 4. FT-IR characterization of unloaded and As (V) loaded citrus paradisi peel adsorbent showed the participation of carbonyl (CO) and hydroxyl (OH) groups in adsorption process. The proposed citrus paradisi peel adsorbent with optimized parameters was used for the removal of arsenic from arsenic contaminated real water samples...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{promising}} biofuel is bioethanol {{which can be}} produced from agricultural waste cellulosic biomass such as <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> waste. Bioethanol {{can be derived from}} <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> waste that is rarely used. Cellulosecontained in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> waste can be converted into ethanol through a process of chemical and biological. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) can be used in hydrolysis of cellulose material in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> waste to producesugars and batch fermentation by Saccharomyces cereviseae can be used to convert sugars into bioethanol. The purpose of this research were to determine the highest reducing sugar from acid hydrolisis with different acid concentration levels of 0, 3, 7, and 10 % and to know the highest levels of bioethanol and optimum incubation time. Extracts made from <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> waste without <b>peel.</b> <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were hydrolyse using a variation of 1 M H 2 SO 4 acid concentration of 0, 3, 7, and 10 % to produce reducing sugars. Reducing sugars were analyzed using the Nelson Somogyi method. The optimum reducing sugar is used for fermentation by yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a variation of the long incubation days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and bioethanol purified by distillation method. Acid hydrolysis resulted reduction sugar 3, 5 %, at an optimum concentration of 3 % is used for fermentation by yeast S. cerevisiae.

50|$|Some of {{the fruits}} {{that are used}} include {{seedless}} grapes, mulberries and other berries, bergamot, apricots, apples, pears, sour and sweet cherries, oranges and kumquats, lemons, grapefruit, tangerines, pomegranates, quinces, figs, prunes, etc. Even soft fruit like melon or watermelon can be thus prepared, although retaining a relatively firm texture is challenging. Other varieties include green, unripe walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and other nuts, or even flower petals like rose. Many fruits or parts of fruits that are normally inedible, such as the various citrus peels and blossoms, or sliced <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> with their <b>peel</b> intact, can be made into sweet, flavorful preserves, as can some vegetables such as baby eggplants or cherry tomatoes. A well-made spoon sweet retains the original shape, color, aroma and taste of the fruit.|$|R
40|$|We studied, under {{laboratory}} conditions, demographic {{parameters of}} adult Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (medfly), obtained from three sweet orange varieties, lemon, and bitter oranges. These data were combined with immature developmental rates and survival {{on the same}} hosts to estimate host-specific population parameters. Pairs of newly emerged adults from each citrus variety were held individually in transparent plastic cages, and females were allowed to oviposit in either red domes (artificial, pre-punctured plastic oviposition devices), or intact, whole <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> We found strong effects of larval host (<b>citrus</b> <b>fruits)</b> on adult longevity and fecundity. In all five citrus varieties, females did not manage to deposit eggs into fruit pulp. The proportion of eggs laid in either the flavedo or albedo area of the <b>fruit</b> <b>peel</b> differed depending on the citrus variety. In all cases except bitter oranges, females oviposited fewer eggs in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> than in the artificial oviposition substrates, suggesting that most <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> cause {{a significant reduction in}} the reproductive potential of medflies. Negative correlations were found between fecundity and (a) the density of oil glands, and (b) the amount of essential oils in the flavedo area of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> There was no correlation between fecundity and other fruit physical characteristics, such as resistance of <b>fruit</b> <b>peel</b> to pressure and thickness of the flavedo. Apparently, resistance of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> to medfly infestation is directly related to citrus essential oils. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was higher in bitter oranges than in the three sweet orange varieties tested. A negative r was estimated for flies that developed and oviposited in lemons, indicating a tendency for population decrease in this host. The suitability of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> for medfly development and the practical implications of our findings for management of medflies in citrus orchards are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{substances}} were {{extracted from}} buntan (<b>Citrus</b> grandis Osbeck) <b>fruit</b> <b>peel</b> (flavedo and albedo) using various solvent such as n -hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), butanol and methanol. The antimicrobial {{activity of the}} extracts was evaluated using the disc diffusion method, growth inhibition (%) with fungi growth and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Antimicrobial substance of EtOAc extracts of flavedo and albedo were fractionated using silica gel column chromatography (CC). Further purification to the albedo active fraction resulted in two active compounds, β-sitosterol (1) and oleic acid (2). Antibacterial activities of the compounds against Gram-negative and positive bacteria by using MIC and was 270 - 350 ppm in β-sitosterol and 150 - 350 ppm in oleic acid. Their extracts could well be useful to prevent oxidation in fruit juices and essential oils of food products {{as well as for}} health supplements...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{antioxidant}} {{activities of}} the water and ethanol extracts obtained from dried <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> (<b>Citrus</b> unshiu) <b>peel</b> were determined using chemical and biochemical in vitro assays. Chemical assays were used for evaluation of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and reducing power of both extracts and their total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents and antioxidant activities were investigated. Biochemical assays were performed to evaluate the inhibition activities of AAPH-induced rat RBC hemolysis and Fe 2 + -induced lipid peroxidation using rat brain tissue cells. Linear correlation between the antioxidant activities of both extracts were determined by chemical assays, and total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents was observed in concentration-dependent mode. Both extracts showed > 95 % DPPH radical scavenging and > 85 % hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and higher reducing capacity at the same level of 3200 ppm. In the inhibition activity of AAPH-induced hemolysis, water extracts showed a strong activity in concentration-dependent mode up to 1600 ppm with no statistical difference found between 1600 and 3200 ppm (P > 0. 05). In the inhibition activity of Fe 2 + -induced lipid peroxidation, ethanol extracts showed the higher inhibition percentage of lipid peroxidation than those of water extracts at the same concentration with no significant difference (P > 0. 05) found in the range of 800 to 3200 ppm. The extracts of dried Citrus unshiu peel may be considered as potential antioxidant ingredients of functional food depending on the conditions at which reactive oxygen species are implicated. </p...|$|R
