Traditionally, the increase of BLC was associated to the insufficient mitochondrial O 2 supply. However, recent studies showed that increase of BLC can be due the action of another agent such as epinephrine and inorganic phosphate. In the same way, the relationship between BLC and acute muscle fatigue has been supported by increase in <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> can restore the force in isolated and electrically stimulated muscle fibers. These findings suggest that utilization of the BLC on the estimative of lactic anaerobic metabolism should be used with caution and the relationship between BLC and acute muscle fatigue can only be a casual phenomenon...|$|E

In the myocardial tissue from nine vertebrate species, the non-bicarbonate buffer value did not correlate either with ability to develop tension under hypercapnic acidosis or with the indirectly estimated capacity for anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, differences in myocardial tolerance to acidosis must be explained either by an active pH regulation or by other compensatory mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Sp 1 is {{involved}} in the regulation {{of a wide variety of}} genes, including housekeeping genes and genes involved in tumor growth. Sp 1 is a member of the C 2 -H 2 zinc-®nger family and is important for protec-tion against <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> in cells that grow under hypoxic or acidic conditions, such as tumor cells. To obtain an insight into the molecular mech-anisms underlying pH-dependent transcription by Sp 1, both its DNA binding activity and its interaction with TATA binding protein (TBP) were investigated under various pH conditions. We show here that the DNA binding activity of Sp 1 increased and Sp 1 formed a stable interaction with TBP at low pH.

40|$|Metabolic stress {{disinfestation}} and disinfection (MSDD) is a {{new process}} for agricultural products under development at the University of California, Davis 1 - 3. MSDD is applied in a closed chamber and consists of a rapid sequence of alternating expansion (low pressure) and compression (high pressure) cycles originating mechanical forces (physical phase) {{at the end of}} which a low concentration of a volatile chemical (chemical phase) is applied at reduced pressure. Results have shown that MSDD is effective in controlling microbial and arthropod pests without detrimental effects to the host commodity. In arthropod pests, the magnitude and frequency of the alternating forces helps inducing irreversible damage to vital respiratory structures while eliminating air reserves. An extremely low oxygen environ (anoxia) is achieved rapidly, both externally and internally (cellular level), producing irreversible shifts in <b>cellular</b> chemistry (<b>acidosis).</b> The combined anatomical and physiological stresses is lethal to aerobic microbial and arthropod pests, therefore MSDD is capable of simultaneous disinfestation and disinfection effects.

40|$|International audienceLactate, {{indispensable}} substrate of mammalian intermediary metabolism, allows shuttling of carbons {{and reducing}} power between cells and organs {{at a high}} turnover rate. Lactate is, therefore, not deleterious, although an increase in its concentration is often a sensitive sign of alteration in energy homeostasis, a rise in it being frequently related to poor prognosis. Such an increase, however, actually signifies {{an attempt by the}} body to cope with a new energy status. Hyperlactatemia, therefore, most often represents an adaptive response to an acute energy disorder. Investigation of lactate metabolism at the bedside is limited to the determination of its concentration. Lactate metabolism and acid-base homeostasis are both closely linked to <b>cellular</b> energy metabolism, <b>acidosis</b> being potentially a cause or a consequence of cellular energy deficit...|$|R
40|$|PTH ameliorates acidosis-induced {{adverse effects}} in {{skeletal}} growth centers: The PTH–IGF-I axis. BackgroundChronic metabolic acidosis (CMA) exerts profound {{adverse effects on}} bone metabolism thereby leading to impaired skeletal linear growth. We have recently shown that CMA in vitro causes distinct morphological changes in skeletal growth centers along with inhibition of endochondral differentiation. In addition, CMA causes an end organ resistance to the anabolic effects of growth hormone (GH) and locally produced insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in skeletal growth centers. Given the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH related protein (PTHrP) {{on the development of}} cartilaginous bone, we sought to determine whether PTH has any effects on the changes induced by CMA in skeletal growth centers. The interaction between PTH and IGF-I in growth centers during neutral or acidic conditions were studied specifically. MethodsAn in vitro organ culture system using the murine mandibular condyle was employed as a model for endochondral active growth center. Condyles from six-day-old mice were cultured in BGJb medium of either neutral pH (pH ∼ 7. 4) or acidic pH (pH ∼ 7. 15) in {{the presence or absence of}} 10 - 10 mol/L 1 - 34 PTH. After 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of culture, the condyles were washed, fixed in formaldehyde, and processed for paraffin embedding. Histologic markers of the growth center were assessed. In addition, the protein level and mRNA expression for various markers of cartilage differentiation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. The abundance and expression levels of IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R) were assessed also. ResultsFollowing incubation for 72 hours in acidic conditions, there was a marked attenuation of the chondroblastic zone, suggesting a defect in the process of <b>cellular</b> differentiation. <b>Acidosis</b> also down-regulated endochondral differentiation markers (cartilage specific proteoglycans, collagen type II). This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of IGF- 1, IGF- 1 receptor and PTH receptors. PTH (10 - 10 mol/L) added to acidic cultures prevented the adverse effects of CMA on endochondral differentiation and increased the overall condylar growth, when compared to acidic conditions without PTH. PTH also up-regulated its own receptor in control as well as during acidic conditions, and increased the expression levels of IGF- 1 and IGF- 1 receptor in the acidotic condyle. Acidosis increased the expression of IGF-I binding protein- 4 (IGFBP- 4, an inhibitor of IGF-I activity), whereas coincubation with PTH during acidic conditions abrogated the up-regulation of IGFBP- 4. Addition of a neutralizing antibody to IGF-I-R during PTH treatment under acidic conditions resulted in the abrogation of the ameliorative effect of PTH on endochondral differentiation. The protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway was modulated negatively by CMA. However, PTH activated PKC-alpha under both control and acidic conditions. The phorbol ester, PMA (phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate), a PKC activator, mimicked the effect of PTH on chondrocyte differentiation. ConclusionParathyroid hormone at low concentration stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of cartilage cells and prevents the suppressive effect of acidosis on endochondral bone differentiation and on the IGF-I/IGF-I-R system in skeletal growth centers. Increased local production of IGF-I by PTH, which takes place even during acidotic conditions, mediates, at least in part, the ameliorative effect of PTH. Protein kinase C is probably one of the signaling pathways mediating the salutary effects of PTH on chondrocyte differentiation in growth centers. This study lends further credence to the notion that under certain conditions, PTH or PTHrP can exert anabolic effects in the skeleton. These findings may be of clinical-therapeutic significance in children and patients with CMA...|$|R

Similar effects, {{in terms of both}} metabolic changes (consistent with <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis)</b> and induced metallothionin (MT) production were observed in all animals. These changes appeared to be an adaptation of the liver to toxic insult rather than onset of a toxic effect, and, in common with previous studies, were more marked in bank voles than wood mice. This may have reflected the greater Cd intake and assimilation of the former but was not explained by differences in concentrations of free (non MT-bound) Cd; concentrations of which were negligible in both voles and mice.

40|$|Intestinal {{ischemia}} is {{a severe}} disorder {{with a variety}} of causes. Reperfusion is a common occurrence during treatment of acute intestinal ischemia but the injury resulting from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) may lead to even more serious complications from intestinal atrophy to multiple organ failure and death. The susceptibility of the intestine to IR-induced injury (IRI) appears from various experimental studies and clinical settings such as cardiac and major vascular surgery and organ transplantation. Whereas oxygen free radicals, activation of leukocytes, failure of microvascular perfusion, <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> and disturbance of intracellular homeostasis have been implicated as important factors in the pathogenesis of intestinal IRI, the mechanisms underlying this disorder are not well known. To date, increasing attention is being paid in animal studies to potential pre- and post-ischemia treatments that protect against intestinal IRI such as drug interference with IR-induced apoptosis and inflammation processes and ischemic pre-conditioning. However, better insight is needed into the molecular and cellular events associated with reperfusion-induced damage to develop effective clinical protection protocols to combat this disorder. In this respect, the use of ischemic post-conditioning in combination with experimentally prolonged acidosis blocking deleterious reperfusion actions may turn out to have particular clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of {{anthropogenic}} CO₂ is fuelling {{the decline}} of coral reef ecosystems. Increasing sea surface temperatures disrupt the endosymbiotic relationship between cnidarians and their single-celled dinoflagellate partners (genus Symbiodinium), while ocean acidification is known to impede calcification. At the cellular level, however, ocean acidification also {{has the potential to}} cause acidosis, with negative impacts on cell structure and function. Yet, despite the importance of intracellular pH (pHᵢ), the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Combining pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes with either confocal microscopy or flow cytometry enables the measurement of pHᵢ within live cells. Here, I employed these techniques to determine the relationship between symbiont photosynthesis and host- and symbiont pHᵢ under ocean acidification and thermal stress. The specific aims of the study were: (1) to design a protocol for measuring the pHᵢ of the Symbiodinium cell and to quantify the effect of the diel light cycle on the pHᵢ of both members of the endosymbiosis; (2) to determine the role of the symbiont in modifying host cellular responses to short-term CO₂-induced acidification; (3) to quantify how exposure to elevated temperature changes the responses of the host and the symbiont pHᵢ to short-term CO₂-induced acidification; and (4) to establish the relationship between photo-physiology and pHᵢ after longerterm exposure to CO₂-induced acidification. In Chapter 2, I used flow cytometry in conjunction with the ratiometric fluorescent dye BCECF to quantify pHᵢ in Symbiodinium cells and to monitor the effect of the diel light/dark cycle on pHᵢ. The pHᵢ of ITS 2 type B 1 cells (freshly isolated from the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella) was 7. 25 ± 0. 01 (mean ± S. E. M) in the light and 7. 10 ± 0. 02 in the dark. A comparable effect of irradiance was seen across a variety of cultured Symbiodinium genotypes (types A 1, B 1, E 1, E 2, F 1, and F 5) which varied between pHᵢ 7. 21 – 7. 39 in the light and 7. 06 – 7. 14 in the dark. Of note, there was a significant genotypic difference in pHᵢ, irrespective of irradiance, with this parameter being lowest in types E 2 and F 1. The pHᵢ of A. pulchella host cells was then measured using the SNARF- 4 F probe and confocal microscopy. Light-induced alkalinisation observed in the dinoflagellate cells was reflected in the pHᵢ of the host cells, with pHᵢ increasing from 6. 86 ± 0. 04 in the dark, to 7. 02 ± 0. 06 in the light. The inter-dependence of host cell pHᵢ on its symbiont is described in Chapter 3 using cells isolated from the coral Pocillopora damicornis. BCECF was used in conjunction with confocal microscopy to determine how host- and symbiont pHᵢ responds to pCO₂-driven seawater acidification under saturating irradiance, in symbiotic and nonsymbiotic states, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7. 8) and CO₂-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7. 8 - 6. 8). After 105 min of CO₂ addition, by which time the external pH (pHₑ) had declined to 6. 8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pHᵢ 0. 5 pH units above control levels. In contrast, in both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic host cells, 15 min of CO₂ addition (0. 2 pH unit drop in pHₑ) in the presence and absence of DCMU led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0. 4 pH units. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pHᵢ of nonsymbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pHᵢ recovered to control levels. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU, revealing that the photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> after exposure to high CO₂ / low pH. This raised the interesting possibility that bleached corals may be more sensitive to <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> than are their non-bleached counterparts, a hypothesis that was tested in Chapter 4. I exposed P. damicornis (a thermally sensitive coral) and Montipora capitata (a thermally resilient coral) fragments to four temperature treatments: 23. 8 (ambient), 25. 5, 28 and 31 °C. Host coral cells containing their symbionts were then isolated and subjected to CO₂-addition, designed to mimic predicted the VI CO₂ stabilisation scenario (pHₑ 7. 6) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014). Host cells in P. damicornis were much more susceptible to <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> under the highest temperature treatment (7. 40 ± 0. 07 at 23 °C to 6. 56 ± 0. 03 at 31 °C) than their counterparts in M. capitata (7. 35 ± 0. 07 at 23 °C to 6. 95 ± 0. 05 at 31 °C). A similar decrease was observed in the Symbiodinium cell, with pHᵢ dropping from 7. 45 ± 0. 02 to 6. 86 ± 0. 01 in P. damicornis, and from 7. 43 ± 0. 04 to 7. 14 ± 0. 03 in M. capitata after CO₂-addition, suggesting that thermally sensitive corals may be at the highest risk of <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Finally in Chapter 5, I describe the relationship between CO₂-driven acidification, photo-physiological performance and pHᵢ in A. pulchella. I exposed anemones to ambient (289. 94 ± 12. 54 μatm), intermediate (687. 40 ± 25. 10 μatm) or high (1459. 92 ± 65. 51 μatm) CO₂ conditions for two months, conditions that represent the IPCC IV and VI stabilisation scenarios (IPCC, 2014). At regular intervals I measured the maximum dark-adapted fluorescent yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), the gross photosynthetic rate, respiration rate, symbiont population density, and the light-adapted pHᵢ of both the symbiont and the host cell. I observed increases in all but one photo-physiological parameter (Pgross: R ratio). Increases in light-adapted symbiont pHᵢ were observed under both intermediate and high CO₂ treatments, relative to control conditions (pHᵢ 7. 35 ± 0. 03 and 7. 46 ± 0. 06 versus pHᵢ 7. 25 ± 0. 05, respectively). The response of light-adapted host pHᵢ was more complex, with no change observed under the intermediate CO₂ treatment, but a 0. 3 pH-unit increase under the highest CO₂ treatment (pHᵢ 7. 19 ± 0. 01 and 7. 48 ± 0. 02, respectively). This suggests that, rather than causing <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis,</b> the addition of CO₂ will enhance the organism’s photosynthetic performance, enabling the host-symbiont association to withstand the predicted ocean acidification scenarios. Overall, the results from this study provide new insight into the cellular interactions that underpin cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Moreover, they highlight the dynamic and species-specific nature of the cellular responses, reinforcing the need to incorporate species-specific acidification/warming interactions into models that are designed to predict the response of marine organisms to global climate change...|$|E

We aimed to evaluate the expression of the MCTs isoforms 1, 2, and 4 in a large series of cervical lesions (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) and assess its clinical-pathologic significance. The series analyzed included 29 chronic cervicitis, 30 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 32 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 49 squamous cells carcinomas, 51 adenocarcinomas, and 30 adenosquamous carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Analysis of the expression of MCT isoforms 1, 2, and 4 was performed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies. Immunoreactions were evaluated both qualitatively and semiquantitatively. We found a significant increase in MCT expression from preinvasive to invasive squamous lesions and from normal glandular epithelium to adenocarcinomas. This is the first study evaluating the significance of MCT expression in lesions of the uterine cervix, including invasive carcinomas, and the results found herein led us to believe that these membrane proteins are involved in the progression to invasiveness in uterine cervix carcinoma.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{a number of}} methods and {{solutions}} {{have been developed to}} preserve donor organs for transplantation. Collins et al first introduced the simple cold-storage technique to store and transport kidneys up to 30 hours. The development of the University of Wisconsin cold-storage solution (UW-CSS) in 1986 improved organ preservation and resulted in a better understanding in preservation related injury. Since its introduction, several UW-CSS-derived solutions have been tested, and important components for hypothermic preservation were identified. Pathophysiologic mechanisms in static hypothermic preserved organs are discussed, including hypothermia-induced cell swelling, compromised membrane function, adenosine triphosphate usage, <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis,</b> and prevention of precursor formation of reactive oxygen species. Counteracting these pathophysiologic mechanisms can be divided into components acting by two protective principles. The first is to create a physical environment, minimizing cellular and interstitial edema formation. The second mechanism involves biochemically active components that ideally enter the cell and remain effective during reperfusion. Some preservation solutions currently in use are discussed {{on the basis of these}} two protective mechanisms. In respect of these principles in preservation, new solutions in preservation are discussed. Although cold-storage solutions improved organ viability, maintaining or even improving organ quality during preservation remains an important goal. Future advances in preservation might be found in donor pretreatment, cytoprotection, or the use of dynamic preservation systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLife is {{the interplay}} between structural–functional {{integrity}} of biological systems {{and the influence of}} the external environment. To understand this interplay, it is useful to examine an animal model that competes with harsh environment. The dromedary camel is the best model that thrives under severe environment with considerable durability. The current proteomic study on dromedary organs explains a number of cellular mysteries providing functional correlates to arid living. Proteome profiling of camel organs suggests a marked increased expression of various cytoskeleton proteins that promote intracellular trafficking and communication. The comparative overexpression of α-actinin of dromedary heart when compared with rat heart suggests an adaptive peculiarity to sustain hemoconcentration–hemodilution episodes associated with alternative drought-rehydration periods. Moreover, increased expression of the small heat shock protein, α B-crystallin facilitates protein folding and cellular regenerative capacity in dromedary heart. The observed unbalanced expression of different energy related dependent mitochondrial enzymes suggests the possibility of mitochondrial uncoupling in the heart in this species. The evidence of increased expression of H+-ATPase subunit in camel brain guarantees a rapidly usable energy supply. Interestingly, the guanidinoacetate methyltransferase in camel liver has a renovation effect on high energy phosphate with possible concomitant intercession of ion homeostasis. Surprisingly, both hump fat tissue and kidney proteomes share the altered physical distribution of proteins that favor <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Furthermore, the study suggests a vibrant nature for adipose tissue of camel hump by the up-regulation of vimentin in adipocytes, augmenting lipoprotein translocation, blood glucose trapping, and challenging external physical extra-stress.

Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pHi to pCO 2 -driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from Pocillopora damicornis. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the response of pHi in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7. 8) and CO 2 acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7. 8 - 6. 8). After two hours of CO 2 addition, by which time the external pH (pHe) had declined to 6. 8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pHi by 0. 5 pH units above control levels. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO 2 addition (0. 2 pH unit drop in pHe) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0. 4 pH units. Despite further seawater acidification over {{the duration of the}} experiment, the pHi of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pHi recovered to control levels.

These treatments represented current CO 2 levels, in addition to CO 2 stabilisation scenarios IV and VI provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Anemones were exposed to each treatment for two months and sampled at regular intervals. At each time-point we measured a series of physiological responses: maximum dark-adapted fluorescent yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), gross photosynthetic rate, respiration rate, symbiont population density, and light-adapted pHi of both the dinoflagellate symbiont and isolated host anemone cell. We observed increases {{in all but one}} photo-physiological parameter (Pgross:R ratio). At the cellular level, increases in light-adapted symbiont pHi were observed under both intermediate and high CO 2 treatments, relative to control conditions (pHi 7. 35 and 7. 46 versus pHi 7. 25, respectively). The response of light-adapted host pHi was more complex, however, with no change observed under the intermediate CO 2 treatment, but a 0. 3 pH-unit increase under the high CO 2 treatment (pHi 7. 19 and 7. 48, respectively). This difference is likely a result of a disproportionate increase in photosynthesis relative to respiration at the higher CO 2 concentration.

40|$|The {{link between}} lactate {{generation}} and <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> {{has been questioned}} based {{on the possibility of}} H+ generation, independent of lactate production during glycolysis under physiological conditions. Here we test whether glycolytic H+ generation matches lactate production over a physiological pH and lactate range using ischemia applied to the hindlimb of a mouse. We measured the H+ generation and ATP level in vivo using 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemically determined intracellular lactate level in the hindlimb muscles. No significant change was found in ATP content by chemical analysis (P > 0. 1), in agreement with the stoichiometric decline in phosphocreatine (20. 2 ± 1. 2 mM) vs. rise in Pi (18. 7 ± 2. 0 mM), as measured by 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A substantial drop in pH from 7. 0 to 6. 7 and lactate accumulation to 25 mM were found during 25 min of ischemia. The rise in H+ generation closely agreed with the accumulation of lactate, as shown by a close correlation with a slope near identity (0. 98; r 2 = 0. 86). This agreement between glycolytic H+ production and elevation of lactate is confirmed by an analysis of the underlying reactions involved in glycolysis in vivo and supports the concept of lactic acidosis under conditions that substantially elevate lactate and drop pH. However, this link is expected to fail with conditions that deplete phosphocreatine, leading to net ATP hydrolysis and nonglycolytic H+ generation. Thus both direct measurements and an analysis of the stoichiometry of glycolysis in vivo support lactate acidosis as a robust concept for physiological conditions of the muscle cell...|$|E

Clearance and extraction experiments as well as measurement of cortical intracellular pH (pHi) were performed on Inactin–anesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats. Arteriovenous concentration differences and para-aminohippurate extraction were obtained by cannulating the left renal vein. Base production was monitored as bicarbonate released into the renal vein and urine; net base production {{was related to the}} renal handling of glutamine and ammonia as well as to renal oxygen consumption and pHi. After a 15 min control period, the left renal artery was snared for one–half hr followed by release and four consecutive 15 min reflow periods. During the control period, cortical cell pHi measured by [14 C]- 5, 5 -Dimethyl- 2, 4 -Oxazolidinedione distribution was 7. 07 ± 0. 08, and Q-O 2 was 14. 1 ± 2. 2 micromoles/min; neither net glutamine utilization nor net bicarbonate generation occurred. After 30 min of ischemia, renal tissue pH fell to 6. 6 ± 0. 15. However, within 45 min of reflow, cortical cell pH returned and exceeded the control value, 7. 33 ± 0. 06 vs. 7. 15 ± 0. 08. This increase in pHi was associated with a significant rise in cellular metabolic rate, Q-O 2 increased to 20. 3 ± 6. 4 micromoles/min. Corresponding with cellular alkalosis was a net production of bicarbonate and a net ammonia uptake and glutamine release; urinary acidification was abolished. These results are consistent with a nonexcretory renal metabolic base generating mechanism governing cellular acid base homeostasis following ischemia...|$|E

Advanced biophysical approaches revealed a critical role for structural rearrangements in the cytoplasmic loop and dimerization of the C-terminal tail, resulting in binding of the C-terminal tail to the cytoplasmic loop and Cx 43 gap junction channel closure during <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> This has spurred the development of Cx 43 -mimetic peptides and peptidomimetics that interfere with these loop/tail interactions, thereby preventing the closure of Cx 43 gap junctions, e. g. in the heart upon ischemia. Recently, we found that loop/tail interactions control Cx 43 -hemichannel activity but with an opposite effect. Binding of the C-terminal tail to the cytoplasmic loop is a requisite {{for the opening of}} Cx 43 hemichannels in response to different stimuli, like decreased extracellular [Ca(2 +) ], increased intracellular [Ca(2 +) ], positive membrane potentials or ischemia. Strikingly, peptides that favor the open state of Cx 43 gap junctions like the L 2 peptide inhibit Cx 43 -hemichannel opening. These tools now provide unprecedented opportunities to selectively inhibit Cx 43 hemichannels while maintaining Cx 43 gap junction communication, impossible to achieve with siRNA or knockdown approaches both affecting gap junctions and hemichannels. These tools not only are very helpful to unravel the role of Cx 43 hemichannels in complex biological systems, but also hold therapeutic potential to counteract excessive Cx 43 -hemichannel activity like in ischemia/reperfusion in the brain and the heart or to prevent Cx 43 hemichannel-mediated gliotransmitter release in the basal amygdala during memory consolidation in response to emotional events.

40|$|Acetic acid {{produces}} an irritating sensation {{that can be}} attributed to activation of nociceptors within the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the nasal or oral cavities. These sensory neurons sense a diverse array of noxious agents in the environment, allowing animals to actively avoid tissue damage. Although receptor mechanisms have been identified for many noxious chemicals, the mechanisms by which animals detect weak acids, such as acetic acid, are less well understood. Weak acids are only partially dissociated at neutral pH and, as such, some can cross the cell membrane, acidifying the cell cytosol. The nociceptor ion channel TRPA 1 is activated by CO 2, through gating of the channel by intracellular protons, making it a candidate to more generally mediate sensory responses to weak acids. To test this possibility, we measured responses to weak acids from heterologously expressed TRPA 1 channels and trigeminal neurons with patch clamp recording and Ca 2 + microfluorometry. Our results show that heterologously expressed TRPA 1 currents can be induced by a series of weak organic acids, including acetic, propionic, formic, and lactic acid, but not by strong acids. Notably, the degree of channel activation was predicted by the degree of intracellular acidification produced by each acid, suggesting that intracellular protons are the proximate stimulus that gates the channel. Responses to weak acids produced a Ca 2 +-independent inactivation that precluded further activation by weak acids or reactive chemicals, whereas preactivation by reactive electrophiles sensitized TRPA 1 channels to weak acids. Importantly, responses of trigeminal neurons to weak acids were highly overrepresented in the subpopulation of TRPA 1 -expressing neurons and were severely reduced in neurons from TRPA 1 knockout mice. We conclude that TRPA 1 is a general sensor for weak acids that produce intracellular acidification and suggest that it functions within the pain pathway to mediate sensitivity to <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis...</b>|$|E

Aerobic glycolysis allows a rapid growth of tumor cells, with high rates of glucose consumption and lactic acid production, leading to <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Metabolic reprogramming renders cancer cells dependent on specific metabolic enzymes or pathways that could be exploited in cancer therapy. The development of treatments that target tumor glucose metabolism is receiving renewed attention, with several drugs targeting metabolic pathways currently in clinical trials. However, the search for suitable targets may be limited by the high plasticity of the metabolic network that can induce compensatory routes. Moreover, deregulated glucose metabolism has been also shown as a prominent feature associated with resistance to either classical chemotherapy or oncogene-targeted therapies, strengthening the clinical potential of combining these therapies with glycolysis inhibitors. The aim of this review is to compare the advances of the different therapeutic strategies targeting the glucose “addiction” of tumor cells, highlighting the potential of these findings to be translated into effective weapons against cancer. Further, we will also present and discuss recent evidence for the involvement of glucose metabolism as a compensatory response to the use of drugs that target different signaling pathways, in which combination with glycolysis inhibitors are potentially useful...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acidic pH on the {{kinetics}} of Ca 2 +-ATPase isoforms from intracellular membranes of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, cerebellum and blood platelets were studied. At neutral pH, all four Ca 2 +-ATPase isoforms exhibited similar Ca 2 +-concentration requirements for half-maximal rates of Ca 2 + uptake and ATP hydrolysis. A {{decrease in the}} pH from 7. 0 to 6. 0 promoted a decrease in both the apparent affinity for Ca 2 + [increasing half-maximal activation (K 0. 5) ] and the maximal velocity (Vmax) of Ca 2 + uptake. With skeletal muscle vesicles these effect were 5 to 10 times smaller than those observed {{with all the other}} isoforms. Acidification of the medium from pH 7. 0 to 6. 5 caused the release of Ca 2 + from loaded vesicles and a decrease in the amount of Ca 2 + retained by the vesicles at the steady state. With the vesicles derived from skeletal muscle these effects were smaller than for vesicles derived from other tissues. The rate of passive Ca 2 + efflux from skeletal and cardiac muscle vesicles, loaded with Ca 2 + and diluted in a medium containing none of the ligands of Ca 2 +-ATPase, was the same at pH 7. 0 and 6. 0. In contrast, the rate of Ca 2 + efflux from cerebellar and platelet vesicles increased 2 -fold after acidification of the medium. The effects of DMSO, Mg 2 + with Pi and arsenate on the rate of Ca 2 + efflux varied among the different preparations tested. The differences became more pronounced when the pH of the medium was decreased from 7. 0 to 6. 0. It is proposed that the kinetic differences among the Ca 2 +-ATPase isoforms may reflect different adaptations to <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis,</b> such as that which occurs during ischaemia...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of acidosis during intense exercise {{has traditionally been}} explained by the increased production of lactic acid, causing {{the release of a}} proton and the formation of the acid salt sodium lactate. On the basis of this explanation, if the rate of lactate production is high enough, the cellular proton buffering capacity can be exceeded, resulting in a decrease in cellular pH. These biochemical events have been termed lactic acidosis. The lactic acidosis of exercise has been a classic explanation of the biochemistry of acidosis for more than 80 years. This belief has led to the interpretation that lactate production causes acidosis and, in turn, that increased lactate production is one of the several causes of muscle fatigue during intense exercise. This review presents clear evidence that there is no biochemical support for lactate production causing acidosis. Lactate production retards, not causes, acidosis. Similarly, there is a wealth of research evidence to show that acidosis is caused by reactions other than lactate production, Every time ATP is broken down to ADP and Pi, a proton is released. When the ATP demand of muscle contraction is met by mitochondrial respiration, there is no proton accumulation in the cell, as protons are used by the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation and to maintain the proton gradient in the intermembranous space. It is only when the exercise intensity increases beyond steady state {{that there is a need}} for greater reliance on ATP regeneration from glycolysis and the phosphagen system. The ATP that is supplied from these nonmitochondrial sources and is eventually used to fuel muscle contraction increases proton release and causes the acidosis of intense exercise. Lactate production increases under these cellular conditions to prevent pyruvate accumulation and supply the NAD+ needed for phase 2 of glycolysis. Thus increased lactate production coincides with <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> and remains a good indirect marker for cell metabolic conditions that induce metabolic acidosis. If muscle did not produce lactate, acidosis and muscle fatigue would occur more quickly and exercise performance would be severely impaired...|$|E
40|$|In the hypothermically {{preserved}} heart, ischemic myocardial damage may progress further {{depending on}} the elapsed time of storage. Reperfusion following prolonged cold storage {{has been shown to}} cause irreversible cellular damage which did not exist during the preservation period. Consequently, the potential strategy to prevent this reperfusion injury may {{play a crucial role in}} enhancing the efficacy of myocardial preservation, thereby allowing a prolonged time-constraint for heart transplantation. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the effect of controlled reperfusion using blood cardioplegia (BCP) infused during the initial reoxygenation period. Twenty-one isolated canine hearts were subjected to 24 hours of 4 ℃ preservation in Collins C 2 solution modified by adding mannitol (18 g/l) and were reperfused with an ex vivo apparatus using a support dog. Three groups were categorized as the following, based upon the difference in the reperfusion method; Group I (n= 7) : Reperfusions were undertaken with unmodified blood at the perfusion pressure of 40 to 50 mmHg and the blood was rewarmed gradually from 20 ℃ to 36 ℃ (unmodified reperfusion). Group II (n= 7) : The hearts were initially reperfused with 500 ml of BCP at 20 ℃ and subsequently rewarmed with unmodified blood (BCP addition). Group III (n= 7) : The hearts were initially reperfused with 1000 ml of BCP which was gradually rewarmed from 20 ℃ to 30 ℃ prior to unmodified blood perfusion (BCP rewarming). The consecutive metabolic alterations in the myocardium were assessed and the post-reperfusion left ventricular functions were evaluated by means of the intraventricular isovolumetric balloon technique. The results indicated that there was no consistent difference in myocardial creatine phosphate (CP) and water content among the 3 groups. However, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was depleted to 33. 2 % of the preischemic level during 24 -hour preservation and showed a significant restoration with the BCP reperfusion, namely to 44. 8 ± 13. 3 % in Group II and to 64. 1 ± 19. 5 % in Group III. The left ventricular diastolic compliances determined following 60 -minute reperfusion were 0. 26 ± 0. 15 in Group I, 0. 47 ± 0. 34 in Group II and 1. 14 ± 0. 52 ml/mmHg in Group III, respectively. The values were directly reflected in the left ventricular performance. The left ventricular peak systolic pressure obtained at the end-diastolic pressure of 15 mmHg in each of the specimens correlated well with the ATP level just prior to reperfusion by unmodified blood. This study concluded that controlled reperfusion, using BCP rewarming appeared to be a useful adjunct to the resuscitation of prolonged simply-preserved hearts based upon the following principles: (1) lowering energy demands by maintaining electromechanical arrest during the initial reoxygenation phase, (2) reducing ionic calcium diffusion force into the cell, (3) counteracting postischemic edema by elevation of perfusate osmolarity, (4) reversing of <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis</b> by buffering, (5) delivering sufficient oxygen to meet the postischemic extra oxygen demands for cellular reparative process by means of a prolonged continuous BCP perfusion and (6) increasing the rate of metabolic recovery by myocardial rewarming...|$|E
40|$|Winterkill, {{in putting}} greens and fairways of annual {{bluegrass}} (Poa annua L.) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), {{is a common}} phenomenon in North-Central Region of United States and in other temperate areas. Extensive research in controlled environments has evaluated injury mechanisms in creeping bentgrass and annual bluegrass. A large {{number of studies have}} evaluated winter injury in other turfgrass species and in cereal grasses. Most agree that damages can be explained by factors such as intracellular and extracellular ice formation, cellular dehydration and hydration, plant desiccation, macro scale tissue and organ rupture, diseases, anoxia, <b>cellular</b> <b>acidosis,</b> oxidative stress and retarded growth. Despite the vast amount of information generated during several decades of research, winterkill in creeping bentgrass and annual bluegrass is a problem that still leaves golf course superintendent with many unanswered questions.;It is proposed that, to minimize winterkill, it is necessary to understand the high complexity of the system at field level and not only in controlled environments.;The purpose of this research was to quantify the relative injury on putting greens as it relates to snow cover, ice formation, desiccation, crown hydration, and freeze/thaw cycles. Our approach was to evaluate the relative amount of injury that is associated with various scenarios of winter, instead of focusing solely on the mechanisms that cause the injury. Also, it is of interest to determine not only what condition causes the most winter injury, but when during the season does damage occur and if it is worth the expense or effort to try and minimize the injury by taking action.;This study was conducted at the Iowa State University (ISU) Horticulture Research Center and at ISU Veenker Memorial golf course, both in Ames Iowa. The species evaluated were creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L) and annual bluegrass (Poa annua L). Ten possible winter scenarios; dry/open, wet, ice continuous, snow continuous, impermeable artificial cover and ice continuous, ice removal, ice/melt freeze, snow removal/melt freeze, an artificial permeable turf cover, and artificial permeable turf cover with snow, were created on two Iowa putting greens in January, February and March of 2003, 2004, and 2005. Dry weight yield produced by samples collected in the field and grown on controlled chambers was used to indicate the amount of winter injury. Hourly temperatures were registered through the length of the study. Growing degree days (GDD) and stress degree days (SDD) were calculated with temperature data.;Creeping bentgrass was not killed under any treatment. Continuous ice cover of 66 days caused creeping bentgrass bleaching but never resulted in any turf kill or decline in creeping bentgrass cover. Annual bluegrass was susceptible to winter injury when exposed to ice encasement. Damages by ice formation occurred during the first 15 days after encasement. The formation and type of ice {{is more important than the}} duration of ice cover in predicting annual bluegrass winter injury when ice is present. In both species, the treatments that offered a better visual quality at the end of the winter period were those that had a better protection such as impermeable-ice, permeable-snow, and snow treatments. However, the visual results did not necessarily mirror on those results of biomass production.;In regard to temperatures and insulation characteristics of winter practices, greens without any protective layer suffer almost twice the amount of stress degrees that snow covered plots. As accumulative units, SDD 0 °C had larger mean separation than any of the temperature variables; as such it was a better descriptor of intensity or risk of damage than temperatures alone. In the north central region of the United States, the use of artificial covers combined with snow blankets provided the best insulation and therefore the best condition for turf survival and early spring turf quality.;Keywords. winterkill, annual bluegrass, creeping bentgrass, ice, temperature, stress degree day...|$|E
