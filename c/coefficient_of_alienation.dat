The paper {{deals with}} {{models for the}} {{prediction}} of bank distress in the Republic of Croatia based on official financial data. Eight financial ratios were calculated (three liquidity ratios, four profitability ratios and one capital adequacy ratio) for 38 banks – 2 / 3 of all banks, and 90 % of bank assets in Croatia. Information for banks refers to 1998 financial year because it was characterized by the crisis in Croatian banking industry. To classify distressed and no distressed banks, multidimensional scaling method (MDS) was used. Satisfactory results were obtained (based on low raw stress coefficient, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and Shepard diagram) with four-dimensional map. MDS classifies 13 banks as distressed - three banks rehabilitated before 1998, four rehabilitated after 1998, two banks went bankrupt in 1999, and two went bankrupt in 2002, two banks solved serious distress thru turnaround management after 1998. This classification in four-dimensional space was then orientated by multiple regressions of each ratio as dependent variable, and four dimensions as independent variable. Liquidity ratios were firmly associated with first, and less with second and fourth dimension, profitability ratios were associated with second dimension, and capital adequacy with second and fourth dimension. After that, backward-stepwise discriminant analysis was performed. This analysis revealed that profitability ratios are better discriminators between distressed and non distressed banks than liquidity ratios. Final result had four variables of discrimination, and posterior classification was successful. Logit model (Hooke-Jeeves method was used) revealed similar results. Final conclusion {{is that we can}} have confidence in officially published financial data of banks in Croatia and use them for classifying and prediction of banks with respect to the level of distress...|$|E

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} concepts <b>of</b> the world, <b>alienation</b> {{is starting to}} become a more and more interesting topic, equally so to the science, art, philosophy, politics and theology. Some authors claim the alienation to be the synonym {{for the state of}} mind {{the contemporary}} man. A strong interest in the problems <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as expressed by the recent ideas is accompanied by the emergence of a great variety of interpretations of this concept. Dean Dwight assessed thirteen possible correlates <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> It is not unusual, as in the new considerations <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> many influences from the near and far tradition are present, as well as the results of the new original research and thinking. Besides, as the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> is not interesting exclusively to the philosophy, from various fields new solutions and different concepts are coming. All this makes modern discussion on alienation not only more complex, but more interesting at the same time. Starting from the fact that alienation is many-faceted phenomenon, the sociologist tried to assess its main qualifications. These efforts resulted in the well known systematization of the meanings <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> given by D. Dwight, M. Seeman, J. P. Clark and others. Contemporary sociology gives other solutions too. Especially promising is the recognition of the general characteristic of the modern concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> revealed through the comparison with the traditional concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a whole, The traditional theory is dominated by the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> which gets the meaning {{in the context of the}} global society and the history as a whole. Alienation is meaningful primarily on the macro-level and concerns the human existence in totality. At the same time, mainly the positive aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> are stressed by the traditional approach. Contrary to such a conception <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> the modern analyses start predominantly from the micro-level approach, i. e. point oyt the individual and psychological aspects. Simultaneously, alienation acquires mostly pejorative meanings, representing deprivation, loss, disconnection, estrangement and so on. Even the interpretations of some significant traditional theories on alienation have quite another, contemporary significance in modern analyses. (Hegel’s concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a lack of power.) In relation to the traditional one, the contemporary concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> emerges as an unique thesis, stressing mainly negative and predominantly psychological aspects of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} how Melvin Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> (1959) and modern alienation research manifest in Irvine Welsh’s “Trainspotting”. This {{is an important}} novel, {{not only because of}} its commercial success, but also because it depicts a specific marginalised subculture. Postmodernism and systems theory approaches, as well as changes in the social and political spheres have motivated researchers such as Geyer (1996), Kalekin-Fishman (1998) and Neal and Collas (2000) to reinterpret Seeman’s theory. This article attempts to incorporate this new theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the analysis of contemporary fiction. Seeman identifies five aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> namely powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation and self-estrangement. Following Neal and Collas (2000), in particular, this article omits self-estrangement, but shows how the other four aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have changed since Seeman’s formulation. It is argued that “Trainspotting” depicts a specific occurrence <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in modern western society, besides normlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation, highlighting Seeman’s concept of powerlessness, in particular. The article further argues that applying Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the study of contemporary literature provides a fresh theoretical approach that contributes to the understanding of how fiction engages with its environment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{explanatory}} power and limitations of the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in educational research. Psychological studies of the phenomena associated with alienation (burnout, extrinsic motivation, cynicism, etc.) are limited by the context of individual mind, whereas the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> refers {{to a set of}} processes unfolding at both individual and sociocultural levels. The paper demonstrates the heuristic possibilities offered by the cultural-historical activity approach to meaning and meaning regulation in the analysis of alien-ation phenomena. The author reviews the findings of empirical studies <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in education, as well as existing theoretical works discussing the genesis <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and ways to overcome it. According to these works, the ongoing growth of the body of human knowledge results in increasing alienation in the educational context, but individual activity aimed at finding the meaning of collective action and of one’s place in it may help to overcome the challenge <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Despite being too abstract to serve as a tool for designing psychological studies, the category <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> may be useful for their interpretation, helping to integrate psychological findings into the interdisciplinary context, in order to review and improve existing educational institutions and practices...|$|R
40|$|This work aims at elucidating Christa Wolf’s {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> her examination <b>of</b> this topic, her {{own experience}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> {{as well as the}} subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> through the literary figures in her Medea. Stimmen. The introduction provides explanations concerning the history <b>of</b> the term <b>alienation</b> and shows that the research on Christa Wolf barely considered the crucial importance <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> for her work and neglected the autobiographical statements of the author on that topic. In the first chapter, {{some of the most important}} cultural and political events in the GDR and those occurring shortly after the reunification of Germany have been analyzed in order to understand which influence these events had on the literary work of Christa Wolf. This analysis aims at identifying which degrees <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> were present at given times and at deciphering the alienation experience in details. In this context, autobiographical and biographical relations, diaries, interviews, essays and other works of Christa Wolf were considered. Under the aspect <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the second chapter considers the adaptation of myth by Christa Wolf, compares her dealing with the Cassandra- and Medea myth and tries to make apparent similarities and differences in her concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> The aim is to show which function the myth fulfills in this context and in which aspect the myth is used for projections <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> those two myth adaptations seems necessary in order to find out if a shift took place in the perception of the author concerning alienation. The third chapter refers to the theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by the sociologist Melvin Seeman. Seeman transferred the term <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from the sociological context to the socio-psychological context and at the end of the 50 ties developed a scheme of five categories of subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> According to his understanding there are five common meanings of this term: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement. Seeman’s theory led to many controversies, mainly because the choice of his five categories and their relation to each other was questioned. After a short introduction of Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the importance <b>of</b> his theory for the analysis of literary figures will be discussed. The fourth chapter aims at interpreting the <b>alienation</b> features <b>of</b> the literary figures in Medea. Stimmen on the basis of the classification by Melvin Seeman. Contrary to the prevalent belief that Christa Wolf’s Medea is a non-alienated figure, that judges, decides and acts with a great degree of determination, this work defends the thesis that not only Medea but rather all figures are alienated in different degrees. The theory by Melvin Seeman serves as a basis for the analysis of the different forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> experience <b>of</b> the literary figures. Under consideration of two important aspects, the political and cultural alienation, feelings, emotions and behavior of the figures will be explained. The plot of the novel is told from the perspective of the six figures: Medea, Jason, Agameda, Akamas, Glauke and Leukon. This serves as a basis for the literal analysis. The conclusion serves to compare the experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> the author with those of her literary figures...|$|R

I reconstruct Marx's conception of human nature to show how it informs his theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> and how the latter ultimately anchors his socio-economic-historical analysis of capitalist society and his conception of freedom.

40|$|The extreme {{concepts}} {{in the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have been analysed in this paper. Such concepts can be found both in the traditional {{as well as in}} the contemporary theories. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> considered from the global and from the predominantly positive aspects, characterizes the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy such a concept becomes expressed as an extreme. Hegel is interested in the general situation, in logic, and in evolution of the historical process; the historical process itself is happening by means <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> in other words, by means of changing the passions (partial interests and activities) into idea and intellect (general, common, social contents). Hegel does not seem to be interested in the problems of an individual, such problems being of no interest at his time after all, for the liberal capitalism does not produce the problematic but self-confident and strong personalities. Hegel is not aware of the destructive, self-destructive moments in the process <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Consequently, the alienation becomes exclusively positive process for Hegel, it becomes a specific process of the human self-creation in the history. The individual side of the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> has been worked out in more detail with Marx. With Marx as well as with Lenin the destructive side of the negativism, building not only the history but also representing a great danger for the human existence, has been rather emphasized. In this way the extreme of Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s concept has been lessened. On the other hand, in the contemporary theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> there is a collision between the extreme and complete concepts. Different from the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> the contemporary concept emphasizes, on the whole, the individual and negative aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In the philosophy of existentialism such a concept has been expressed to an extreme. Quite different from such an extreme term, a lot of modern authors have been pointing out the drawbacks and extremes in the contemporary concepts, (e. g. L. Feuer’s criticism) and they have been trying to realize the complete approaches to the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> This question particularly becomes explicit in the works of E. Fromm and W. Mills. Thus some definite contours of the complete approaches as well as the criticism of the extreme concepts <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> can be traced both in the traditional and contemporary theories. From what has been said about the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by now, it becomes evident that its complete research must include the global and the individual, the positive and the negative aspects of the problem at the same time. As an example of such an approach, the isolation and the lack of power have been analysed in the research. The analysis has clearly pointed out that these, as well as other forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> can and must be analysed as the complete social-individual and positive-negative phenomena...|$|R
