50|$|Though other styles {{also use}} that term, the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capo, {{because it can}} be {{operated}} by one hand in one single squeezing motion, is typically the quickest capo to apply or move on the instrument; other capos can be quicker and easier to remove from the instrument. One disadvantage to the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capo is that the pressure of the spring is not adjustable. The spring applies its maximum pressure to hold the strings down, which could {{have an effect on the}} tuning of some guitars if not applied properly.

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G <b>clamps</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>clamps.</b> A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel <b>spring</b> <b>clamps</b> is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the susceptibility of the MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) devices to shock, tests were performed using haversine shock pulses with widths of 1 to 0. 2 ms in the range from 500 g to 40, 000 g. The authors chose a surface-micromachined microengine because it has all the components needed for evaluation: springs that flex, gears that are anchored, and <b>clamps</b> and <b>spring</b> stops to maintain alignment. The microengines, which were unpowered for the tests, performed quite well at most shock levels with a majority functioning after the impact. Debris from the die edges moved at levels greater than 4, 000 g causing shorts in the actuators and posing reliability concerns. The coupling agent used to prevent stiction in the MEMS release weakened the die-attach bond, which produced failures at 10, 000 g and above. At 20, 000 g the authors began to observe structural damage in some of the thin flexures and 2. 5 -micron diameter pin joints. The authors observed electrical failures caused by the movement of debris. Additionally, they observed a new failure mode where stationary comb fingers contact the ground plane resulting in electrical shorts. These new failure were observed in the control group indicating that they were not shock related...|$|R
40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to clamped parts. There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring clamping force involved the use of load washers or miniature load cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated <b>spring</b> <b>clamps</b> have also been used. Load washers and miniature load cells constitute additional clamped parts in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. <b>Spring</b> <b>clamps</b> can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing the clamping force and the circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all housed on the clamp. In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package. The advantage of unitary packaging of such a system is that it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>clamps</b> are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R
40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} {{are very}} attractive for aerospace structures {{due to their}} high specific strength and stiffness, enhanced toughness and high temperature resistance. One of the manufacturing methods used to produce thermoplastic composite parts is press forming. Press formed parts typically have constant thickness and fibre orientation. However, composite parts may be optimized by tailoring the stiffness and strength, thereby reducing structural weight. In this thesis, the processing techniques for this manufacturing method were developed by investigating the feasibility of a multiple step forming approach {{for the production of}} parts with variable thickness and fibre orientation. This manufacturing approach was proven from both a formability and structural integrity viewpoints. By using an efficient blankholder system with <b>clamps</b> and <b>springs,</b> thermoplastic composite laminates can be multiple step formed into three-dimensional shapes with no occurrence of visual forming defects such as wrinkling, fibre buckling or ply folding. Furthermore, good quality bonds can be achieved between laminates formed and co-consolidated in different steps. To achieve a high degree of bonding between GF/PEI composite laminates, the co-consolidation process window was estimated to be between 270 ºC and 300 ºC. The use of a post-consolidation stage in a hot press was needed to improve the degree of bonding between co-consolidated laminates formed in different steps, which led to very long production cycle times. For future research, the maximum temperature limit of the metal mould should be increased and tooling active cooling mechanisms must be incorporated to allow the mould to be rapidly cooled down, thereby decreasing production cycle times. With these implementations, a better insight on the feasibility of the process in an industrial environment may be gained.

50|$|Clark then {{examined}} the prosecution history and prior art of {{both sets of}} patents involved in the case. In the Graham case, the '798 patent was originally rejected by the patent examiner as being insufficiently distinguished from the previous '811 patent. The only two claims which differed between the two patents were (1) the stirrup and the bolted connection of the shank to the hinge plate do not appear in '811; and (2) {{the position of the}} shank is reversed, being placed in patent '811 above the hinge plate, sandwiched between it and the upper plate. One argument which Graham raised before the court, but had not raised before the USPTO, was that in the new '798 design, the flexing of the plow shank was limited to the points between the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> and the tip of the plow shank, absorbing the shock of hard objects on the ground more efficiently. The court rejected this argument and invalidated the '798 patent for two reasons: first, Graham had not raised this “flexing” argument before the USPTO, and second, the parts in the '798 patent served the same purposes as those in the prior art.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, <b>spring</b> <b>clamp,</b> pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|R
40|$|Consider a {{collection}} of elastic wires folded according to a given pattern induced by a sequence of fractal plane curves. The folded wires can act as elastic springs. Therefore {{it is easy to}} build up a corresponding sequence of simple oscillators composed by the elastic <b>springs</b> <b>clamped</b> at one end and carrying a mass at the opposite end. The oscillation periods of the ordered sequence of these oscillators are related following a power law and therefore display a fractal structure. The periods of each oscillator clearly depend on the mechanical properties of the wire, on the mass at the end and on the boundary conditions. Therefore there are infinitely many possibilities to design a dynamical fractal sequence in opposition to the well defined fractal dimension of the underneath geometric sequence. Nevertheless the geometric fractal dimension of the primordial geometric curve is always related somehow to the dynamical fractal dimension characterizing the oscillation period sequence. It is important to emphasize that the dynamical fractal dimension of a given sequence built up after the geometry of a primordial one is not unique. This peculiarity introduces the possibility to have a broader information spectrum about the geometry which is otherwise impossible to achieve. This effect is clearly demonstrated for rando...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe give a {{theoretical}} {{design for a}} locally resonant two-dimensional cylindrical structure involving a pair of C-shaped voids in an elastic medium which we term as double `C' resonators (DCRs) and imbedded thin stiff bars, that displays the negative refraction effect in the low frequency regime. DCRs are responsible for a low frequency band gap which hybridizes with a tiny gap associated {{with the presence of}} the thin bars. Using an asymptotic analysis, typical working frequencies are given in closed form: DCRs behave as Helmholtz resonators modeled by masses connected to <b>clamped</b> walls by <b>springs</b> on either side, while thin bars behave as a periodic bi-atomic chain of masses connected by springs. The discrete models give an accurate description of the location and width of the stop band {{in the case of the}} DCR and the first two dispersion bands for the periodic thin bars. We then combine our asymptotic formulae for arrays of DCR and thin-bars to design a composite structure that displays a negative refraction effect and has a negative phase velocity in a frequency band, and thus behaves in many ways as a negative refractive acoustic medium (NRAM). Finite element computations show that at this frequency, a slab of such NRAM works as a phononic flat superlens whereas two corners of such NRAM sharing a vertex act as an open resonator and can be used to confine sound to a certain extent...|$|R
