Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s, {{the state}} {{government}} had planned to build a freeway interchange and bridge over {{the site of the}} fort, prompting concerned locals and Russell W. Fridley, director of the Minnesota Historical Society, to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>to</b> examine how to preserve the fort. Eventually, the state agreed to build a tunnel underneath the fort, thus preserving the old structures. In 1960, A.R. Nichols, a landscape architect, submitted plans for a 2400 acre park on the site. Based on a much earlier plan, this design would become the basis for the final form of the park. This caught the interest of Thomas C. Savage who wrote State Parks director U.W. Hella. Hella urged Savage to form an association of interested citizens which became the Fort Snelling State Park Association, putting money and public relations effort into the promotion of the park's establishment. While there was widespread support for preserving the old fortifications, some local landowners were not enthused about plans to purchase additional lands, claiming that the price the government proposed to pay was not adequate. In response, the Park Association began to raise funds privately to buy out {{at least some of the}} owners. A second consideration was whether or not the federal government would grant the actual fort property to the state as surplus land.|$|E

Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine compared the group's performance on the album to [...] "a third-rate Beastie Boys supported by a cut-rate Faith No More, all tempered with the sensibility that made GWAR cult heroes—only with...more sexism and jokes that...wind up sounding racist". The follow-up EP, Beverly Kills 50187, sold well and gained a larger audience. During a live performance of the song [...] "The Juggla", Bruce addressed the audience as Juggalos, and the positive response resulted in the group using the word thereafter. The word {{has been the subject of}} criticism from both Ben Sisario of Rolling Stone and Allmusic's Erlewine, who suggested the term is similar to the racial slur jigaboo.|$|E
