40|$|Abstract—EU and UK Government {{targets for}} minimising and {{recycling}} household waste {{has led the}} responsible authorities to research the alternatives to landfill. In the work reported here the local waste collection authority (Charnwood Borough Council) has adopted the aspirational strategy of becoming a “Zero Waste Borough ” to lead the drive for public participation. The work concludes that the separate collection of food waste {{would be needed to}} meet the two regulatory standards on recycling and biologically active wastes. An analysis of a neighbouring Authority (Newcastle-Under-Lyne Borough Council (NBC), a similar sized local authority that has a successful weekly food waste collection service was undertaken. Results indicate that the main challenges for Charnwood Borough Council would be gaining householder co-operation, the extra <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> and organising alternative treatment. The analysis also demonstrated that there was potential offset value via anaerobic digestion for CBC to overcome these difficulties and improve its recycling performance...|$|E
40|$|For {{ordinary}} life policyholders {{who want to}} pay more frequently than annually, insurers construct schedules of modal premium factors that reflect additional charges for the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> forgone interest, and premiums uncollected or refunded {{in the year of}} death. Competition within the industry forces convergence of such schedules. On the other hand, if such factors for a given company reflect its own experience (in expense, interest, mortality, and persistency), the differences between companies will force schedules apart. Analysis of a large group of life insurers over the 1972 - 1982 - 1992 period shows that modal premium factors are dustered closely, that they are becoming more dispersed over time, and that the mean factors are increasing as a percentage of premiums. These findings are consistent with the viewpoint that modal premium factors are beginning to reflect individual company experience and that the companies increasingly are able to cover the additional costs of business written on other than an annual basis...|$|E

40|$|A {{model to}} examine the choice by {{jurisdiction}} whether to finance roads with taxes or tolls is developed. The idea of decentralized, local control and multiple jurisdictions distinguishes this analysis from one where a central authority maximizes global welfare. Key factors posited to explain the choice include the length of trips using the roads, {{the size of the}} governing jurisdiction, the elasticity of demand to revenue instruments, and the transaction <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> - which dictate the size and scope of the free rider problem associated with financing. Spatial complexity in this problem results from the fact that jurisdiction residents use both local and non-local networks, and each jurisdiction�s network is used by both local and non-local residents. The central thesis argues that, since jurisdictions try to do well by their residents who are both voters and travelers, the effects of a revenue instrument on local residents is a key consideration in the choice of that revenue instrument. Decentralization of control and lower toll collection costs are identified as conditions under which tolls would more likely become the preferred revenue instrument for highways. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{scientific}} fields analyzing {{and modeling}} social networks {{have focused on}} manually-collected datasets where the friendship links are sparse (due to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection)</b> but relatively noise-free (i. e. they indicate strong relationships). In online social networks, where the notion of “friendship ” is broader than what would generally be considered in sociological studies, the friendship links are denser but the links contain noisier information (i. e., some weaker relationships). However, the networks also contain additional transactional events among entities (e. g., communication, file transfers) {{that can be used}} to infer the true underlying social network. With this aim in mind, we develop a supervised learning approach to predict link strength from transactional information. We formulate this as a link prediction task and compare the utility of attribute-based, topological, and transactional features. We evaluate our approach on public data from the Purdue Facebook network and show that we can accurately predict strong relationships. Moreover, we show that transactional-network features are the most influential features for this task...|$|E
40|$|Breeding or {{improved}} pork {{quality has}} been the focus of much research in recent years and some of the results have already been put into practice. The realized genetic response in pork quality to selection within lines has generally been limited, however, compared with the responses obtained for other traits. The relatively limited progress has been caused by lack of incentive to producers from industry, lack of clear definition of pork quality, high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> of pork quality estimates, and consequently limited availability of phenotypic measures. The discovery of the HAL gene has greatly helped the elimination of alleles with a negative effect on pork quality. There are now proposals to integrate traditional and molecular breeding methods to improve pork quality. Implementation of such an integrated breeding strategy requires close cooperation between breeding organizations and slaughterhouses. This cooperation should help to provide clear incentives to producers and for the collection of data needed for the selection of optimal breed Aine combinations and the creation of genetic improvements...|$|E
