Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called [...] "Full English breakfast". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of [...] "Mrs Beeton", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter" [...] has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: [...] "bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer" [...] included sardine toast, <b>cold</b> <b>tongue,</b> kedgeree and rissoles, and [...] "Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)" [...] included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.|$|E

40|$|The coupled atmosphere-ocean {{system in}} the {{equatorial}} eastern Pacific and Atlantic exhibits a distinct annual cycle that is reflected in contrasting conditions at the times of the two equinoxes. The contrasts are so strong that they dominate the annual march of zonally averaged outgoing long wave radiation for the equatorial belt. The March equinox corresponds to the warm season when the equatorial <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic area absent. With the onset of summer monsoon convection over Colombia, Central America, and West Africa in May-June, northward surface winds strengthen over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic, the equatorial <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> reappear, and the marine convection shifts from the equatorial belt to the intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs) along 8 deg N. On the basis of observational evidence concerning the timing and year-to-year regularity of the surface wind changes during {{the development of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>tongues,</b> it is argued that (1) the increase in the northward surface winds in response to the onset of the northern summer monsoon may be instrumental in reestablishing the <b>cold</b> <b>tongues,</b> and (2) positive feedbacks involving both the zonal and meridional wind components contribute to the remarkable robustness of the cold tongue-ITCZs complexes in both oceans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{decrease}} in cloud cover over higher latitudes—a {{decrease in}} the extratropical albedo—especially over the Southern Ocean, can result in an extratropical and tropical warming with {{the intensity of the}} equatorial <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> in the Pacific and Atlantic basins decreasing. These results, obtained by means of a coupled ocean–atmosphere model of intermediate complexity that allow the prescription of atmospheric cloud cover, are relevant to future global warming, and also to conditions during the Pliocene some 3 million years ago. The mechanisms responsible for the response of the tropics to changes in the extra-tropics include atmospheric and oceanic connections. This tropical adjustment can be interpreted from the constraint of a balanced heat budget for the ocean: A change in the albedo of the Southern Hemisphere causes the ocean to lose less heat there, so that it has to gain less heat in the tropics. As a consequence the <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> are reduced, particularly in the eastern Pacific where a {{decrease in the}} zonal tilt of the equatorial thermocline significantly weakens the east-west sea surface temperature gradient. The total adjustment time scale of the equatorial Pacific to the extratropical perturbation is of the order of interdecadal to centennial time scales, and thus represents a new mechanism of rapid climate change...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{possibility of a}} correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) and cloud patterns was investigated using cloud photos from the satellites NMBUS II and ESSA VI (1968). Five types of correlation were found to exist: the correlation between status and the California Current and upwelling areas in a warm air mass, between clearing and the California Current and upwelling areas in a cold air mass, between stratus and the upwelling areas under favorable conditions, between frontal clouds and warm tongues of surface water, and between vortices and <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> of surface water. A sixth type of correlation was between the surface isobaric pattern and the orientation of <b>cold</b> and warm <b>tongues</b> of surface water. Finally, the divergence of the surface isobars was found not to correlate with the stratus pattern. An awareness of the physical conditions off the coast was vital to seeing and understanding these correlations.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{and spatial}} variations of chlorophyll concentrations, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), wind fields and wind-induced Ekman pumping in the Sulu Sea are investigated using {{a set of}} new remote sensing measurements from October 1997 to December 2004. The results show the seasonality of chlorophyll, wind fields and SST and reveal the phytoplankton blooming events in the Sulu Sea basin during the northeast monsoon season. In summer, chlorophyll concentrations were relatively low (0. 2 mg/m(3)) throughout the entire basin, and phytoplankton bloomed southward to the central basin, while chlorophyll concentrations reached high levels (1 mg/m(3)) {{in the center of}} the blooms. One peak was observed during the northeast monsoon season each year. SSTs have significant negative correlations with chlorophyll concentrations; i. e., high and uniformly distributed in summer but lower with an obvious <b>tongue</b> of <b>cold</b> waters southward to the central basin in winter. The seasonal variation of chlorophyll concentrations and SST distribution were associated with the seasonally reversing monsoon. The winter phytoplankton blooming and the <b>tongue</b> of the <b>cold</b> waters were correlated to the vertical upwelling cold and nutrient-rich waters drawn by the northeast wind, with the center of the blooms and the location of <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> coinciding with the maximum of the wind speeds and the Ekman pumping velocities.

40|$|Analysis of 12 years (1985 – 1996) of {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) imagery covering {{the shelf and}} slope off the northeast US coast has revealed the presence of persistent fronts in winter over the middle shelf. Ongoing work shows that similar fronts occur in other coastal regions, suggesting that these fronts are of more than regional interest. The satellite data from the US east coast make clear that these fronts, which are found with highest frequency {{in the vicinity of}} the 50 m isobath, separate cool water inshore from warmer outer shelf water. The temperature step across the fronts, a measure of the frontal strength, is negatively correlated with estimates of heat flux (latent plus sensible) indicating that winter surface cooling plays an important role in their formation. Although, generally, the fronts are oriented parallel to the bottom topography, the region around Nantucket Shoals is a location where fronts oriented in the cross-isobath direction occur more often than elsewhere, suggesting that this area is one of enhanced cross-isobath flow. The cross-isobath flow manifests itself in the form of <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> extending south and west from the shallowest part of the shoals. Historical hydrographic data from the shelf in winter indicate that the fronts typically have a salinity signal, with water on the inshore sides of the fronts having lower salinity and resulting lower density due to the controlling influence of salinity on density. Weak vertical stratification is often present inshore of the fronts suggesting that the fronts may represent the offshore edg...|$|R

40|$|At all longitudes oceanic {{evaporation}} {{rates are}} {{lower on the}} equator than at latitudes {{to the north and}} south. Over the oceanic <b>cold</b> <b>tongues</b> this is related to the presence of cold water and divergence of heat by the ocean circulation. Herein is investigated why there is also a minimum over the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Model results confirm the recent suggestion of Sobel that deep convective clouds over the warm pool reduce the amount of solar radiation coming into the ocean that the evaporation has to balance. The results also confirm that this is only a partial explanation. Less evaporation over the warm pool than in the trade wind regions is also caused by an interaction between the ocean heat transport and the distribution of surface wind speeds. Low wind speeds over the warm pool reduce the latent heat flux and increase the SST, and stronger wind speeds in the off-equatorial regions of the Tropics increase the latent heat flux and cool the SST. Consequently, the wind speed distribution increases the meridional temperature gradient and increases the poleward ocean heat transport. Low latent heat fluxes over the warm pool can be sustained because the incoming solar radiation is partially offset by ocean heat flux divergence. Large values under the trade winds are sustained by ocean heat flux convergence. Climate models are used to show that, in equilibrium, wind speeds can only influence the latent heat flux distribution through their coupling to the ocean heat transport. In the presence of ocean heat transport, advection of moisture in the atmospheric boundary layer from the subtropics to the equator also increases the evaporation under the trade winds, but this has a much smaller effect than the wind speed or the cloud–radiation interactions. 1...|$|R
