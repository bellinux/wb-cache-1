30|$|One such study {{compared}} {{the accuracy of}} the In- <b>Check</b> <b>Dial</b> versus Inhalation Profile Recordings from the Diskus™ inhaler in a group of patients with asthma and COPD; the difference between Diskus™_In Check and PIF_ Diskus™ was 3.9 (11.9) L/min (Broeders et al. 2003). The margin of error around the absolute difference is relatively large. Furthermore, not all clinicians have ready access to an In-Check Dial, especially in underdeveloped countries.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{available}} {{dry powder}} inhalers (DPIs) for drug delivery to the lungs require turbulent energy to generate and disperse aerosol {{particles in the}} respirable range ≤ 5 μm during inhalation. The patient's inspiratory effort together with the resistance inside the device creates this energy. Different inhalers provide varying degrees of resistance to inhalation flow and require different inhalation techniques for the generation and delivery of drug fine particles in respirable size range to the lungs. The aim of this research programme was to identify the influence of inhalation flow, inhalation volume {{and the number of}} inhalations per dose on the ex-vivo dose emission and the in-vitro aerodynamic dose emission characteristics of the salbutamol Accuhaler®, Easyhaler®, and Clickhaler® and the terbutaline Turbuhaler® DPIs. A high-performance liquid chromatography method for the assay of salbutamol sulphate and terbutaline sulphate in aqueous samples was modified and accordingly validated. In-vitro dose emission of the four different DPIs was measured using the pharmacopoeia method with modifications to simulate varying inhalation flows within patient and between patients. The ranges of the total emitted dose (% nominal dose) at the inhalation flow range of 10 - 60 Lmin- 1, following one and two inhalations per metered dose for 2 L and 4 L inhaled volumes were as follows: the Accuhaler (52. 64 - 85. 11; 61. 88 - 85. 11 and 59. 23 - 85. 11; 62. 81 - 85. 11); the Easyhaler (68. 35 - 91. 99; 79. 94 - 91. 99 and 73. 83 - 92. 51; 80. 40 - 92. 51); the Clickhaler (46. 55 - 96. 49; 51. 12 - 96. 49 and 51. 18 - 101. 39; 59. 71 - 101. 39) as well as the Turbuhaler (46. 08 - 88. 13; 51. 95 - 88. 13 and 48. 05 - 89. 22; 48. 64 - 89. 22). The results highlight that the four inhalers have flow-dependent dose emission property to a varying degree using 2 L and 4 L inhaled volumes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the total emitted dose between a 2 L inhaled volume and a 4 L inhaled volume at each inhalation flow. Furthermore, the total emitted dose from the Easyhaler®, Clickhaler®, and Turbuhaler® was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) greater with two inhalations than one inhalation per metered dose across the range of inhalation flow (10 - 60) Lmin- 1. This effect was only observed at inhalation flow less than 30 Lmin- 1 with the Accuhaler®. Overall there is a significant difference in the total emitted dose. The ex-vivo dose emission of the four different DPIs has been determined using the In- <b>Check</b> <b>Dial</b> device to train twelve non-smoking healthy adult volunteers to inhale at slow (30 Lmin- 1) and fast (60 L min- 1) inhalation flows through the device with its dial set corresponding to each inhaler. Subsequently each volunteer inhaled at the trained inhalation flows through each active inhaler. The local ethics committee approval was obtained prior to the study and all volunteers gave signed informed consent. The results obtained demonstrate that the studied inhalers have flow-dependent dose emission, thereby enhancing confidence in the use of the In-Check Dial® to identify a patient's inhalation flows through a variety of DPIs. Also the total emitted dose determined by ex-vivo methodology was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) greater with two inhalations than one inhalation per metered dose. The results of the in-vitro aerodynamic dose emission characteristics highlight that the fine particle dose (FPD) from the four studied inhalers is flow dependent. Also the minimum inhalation flow to generate the (FPD) with the appropriate characteristics for lung deposition has been identified to be 20 L min⁻¹ for the Accuhaler®, Easyhaler® and Clickhaler®, while that for the Turbuhaler® is about 30 L min⁻¹. Also the inhalation volume above 2 L and the number of inhalations for each dose have respectively no significant (p≤ 0. 05) influence on the FPD emitted from the four studied inhalers. The results support the present instructions to patients using these inhalers to inhale once for each dose as fast as they can. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The traditional method is to use riveting pier gauge, <b>checking</b> template, feeler, <b>dial</b> gauge with auxiliary bracket[1] and so on. Inspectors labor intensity is relatively large, and test accuracy is not high. Therefore, the author designed a new type of measurement element, It can achieve the accurate measurement of pier diameter and height of the rivet, improving measurement accuracy and efficiency. The Overall Composition of the Measuring Element Element Structure. The composition of measurement unit is as shown in Figure 1. Element is mainly composed of measuring tool, displacement sensors, data acquisition card, software modules and other components. Software modules run on the computer, Data transfer through the data acquisition card with RS 232 serial data transmission line[2, 3]. Displacement sensors and measuring instruments connected with a regulating rod.

30|$|The beam having simply {{supported}} boundary conditions {{was set up}} in the loading frame with sufficient care taken to ensure that the specimen was correctly positioned in the loading frame and the midpoint of the beam was in line with the centre line of the loading hydraulic jack. The specimen was heavily gauged, as shown in Fig.  2, in an attempt to identify a primary mode of failure, i.e. either buckling load for the web post, the formation of plastic hinges, or local buckling of the flange. Prior to application of load on the specimen, all the dial gauges were calibrated properly. Before the actual test, a small preload not exceeding 5  % of the expected ultimate load was applied slowly and removed to eliminate any slack in the support system so that the specimen would be properly seated on the supports. The loading and unloading process was repeated a few times and this procedure also helped to <b>check</b> whether the <b>dial</b> gauges functioned properly. Readings were initialised after ensuring that all instruments worked satisfactorily. The specimen was loaded first up to 20  % of the expected failure load and then unloaded to zero value. It was observed that the deflection readings reached the initial values when unloaded. The procedure was repeated up to 35  % of the expected failure load and the specimen was finally loaded to failure by increasing the load gradually by a predetermined increment. The five dial gauges were installed, three for measurement of vertical deflection placed at L/ 4, L/ 2 and 3 L/ 4, respectively, and two for measurement of lateral deflection of top and bottom flange, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2. The beam was then tested to failure. After the maximum load was attained and unloading occurred with increase in beam deflection, the load was then removed. The ultimate load and the mode of failure for each of the specimens were noted. The same test procedure was adopted for all the specimens.|$|R
