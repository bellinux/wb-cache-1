5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a <b>customer</b> <b>to</b> order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for recreational diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the <b>customer</b> <b>to</b> sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the <b>customer</b> <b>to</b> have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E

5|$|Stations {{are divided}} into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the <b>customer</b> <b>to</b> buy additional value for stored-value tickets. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 {{was ordered}} by two other airlines: Aerolíneas Argentinas took {{delivery}} of six Comet 4s from 1959 to 1960, using them between Buenos Aires and Santiago, New York and Europe, while East African Airways received three new Comet 4s from 1960 to 1962 and operated {{them to the}} United Kingdom and to Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The Comet 4A ordered by Capital Airlines was instead built for BEA as the Comet 4B with a further fuselage stretch of 38in (97cm) and seating for 99 passengers. The first Comet 4B flew on 27 June 1959 and BEA began Tel Aviv to London-Heathrow services on 1 April 1960. Olympic Airways {{was the only other}} <b>customer</b> <b>to</b> order the type. The last Comet 4 variant, the Comet 4C, first flew on 31 October 1959 and entered service with Mexicana in 1960. The Comet 4C had the Comet 4B's longer fuselage and the longer wings and extra fuel tanks of the original Comet 4, which gave it a longer range than the 4B. Ordered by Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines, Misrair (later United Arab Airlines), and Sudan Airways, it was the most popular Comet variant.|$|E

In June 2014, the consortium announced that they had completed delivery of the 200th NH90; at that point, the backlog of orders was reported as reaching out to 2020. In order to alleviate delays and reduce the complexity of manufacturing {{a large number of}} NH90 variants, NH Industries proposed the adoption of a simplified baseline airframe which could be configured to the individual customer's requirements. Between 2004 and 2016, the production lead times for the NH90 had reduced from 18 months to 7.5 months.|$|E

This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store <b>to</b> allow <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> the left.|$|R
