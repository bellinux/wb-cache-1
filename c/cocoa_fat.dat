40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{quantification}} of the effect of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>fat</b> content on the wetting characteristics and surface free energy of different chocolate compositions. On the market, there are many different types of chocolate products which differ both in the sensory and physico-chemical properties together with their raw material compositions and the contents of the individual components. This paper focuses on differences in the use of different types of fats - cocoa butter, milk fat, equivalents or cocoa butter substitutes in chocolate products. Studied samples (prepared at Carla, Ltd. Company) were followed by static contact angles of wetting measurements and by calculated surface free energies. There were investigated the effects of fat content and used fat types of the chocolate products on their final wettabilities and resulting surface free energies. There was found a linear dependence between total fat content and the surface free energy, which was gradually increasing with increasing fat content. Additionally, there were performed TG DTG and NIR spectrometry measurements of the tested materials with the aim to determine the melting point of studied fats used, as well as to determine and identify individual fat components of chocolate products which may affect the resulting value of surface free energy. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences...|$|E

Rimbun Cooperative is a {{business}} unit operating a chocolate factory producing several chocolate products such as <b>cocoa</b> <b>fat,</b> cocoa powder, 3 in 1 instant drinks (sachets), and chocolate bars. This research aims to measure standard times of operators in all working stations of the chocolate factory. These standards comprised the standards in roasting, peeling, pasting, pressing, powdering, powder sieving, powder mixing, dough mixing, refining, and chonching working stations. The data were directly collected using Time Study method with Stop Watch. The samples were randomly selected with five (5) repetitions; and the standard times were measured using Westinghouse Method to quantify performance and allowance factors. The result shows that standard times of operators in each working station are as follows: roasting (36 minutes), peeling (193 minutes), pasting (276 minutes), pressing (78 minutes), powdering (17 minutes), powder sieving (14 minutes), powder mixing (36 minutes), dough mixing (17 minutes), refining (30 minutes), and chonching (30 minutes). In peeling, pasting, powdering, powder sieving working stations, standard times of operators cannot be separated with working times of machines because the operators are required to run the machines (sequence). In general, standard times of operators, after calculation, are larger than direct records because during the working times, operators would not or could not use allowance factors for personal uses, such as for going to bathroom, drinking, and socializing with their colleagues as means to reduce stress or boredom...|$|E
40|$|The biggest {{cause of}} {{loss in the}} {{chocolate}} industry {{is the development of}} fat bloom in chocolate products. Resistance to fat bloom and deterioration is highly linked to the crystal structure of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>fat</b> in chocolate. A chocolate with a stable crystal structure gets properties such as increased resistance to heat and fat bloom, good moulding, a glossy surface and a good snap. In order to achieve a structure with these properties the chocolate must undergo a pre-crystallization process. The most common precrystallization process today is the conventional tempering but a novel and simpler process is the use of seedpowder. The aim of this Master of science thesis was to investigate the potential and usage of three different seedpowders (cocoa butter βVI, cocoa butter βV and chocolate βV) for optimal pre-crystallization of chocolate. Evaluation of the powders was done with respect to reproducibility and robustness of the process, generated crystal structure of the chocolate as well as fat bloom development and fat migration during storage. The results showed that all seedpowders can be used for pre-crystallization of chocolate and depending on the production and what the chocolate will be used for different seedpowder is preferred. The cocoa butter βVI offer a less temperature sensitive production resulting in less powder needed and easier moulding. The cocoa butter βV showed slightly better resistance to fat migration, which is a desired property in chocolate pralines. The chocolate βV powder on the other hand does not change the composition of the chocolate...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} consumer preferences by school-aged children and selected quality indicators of new, highly nutritive grain bars designed as a snack during school break. Consumer acceptance was evaluated by the scaling method using a five-point mimic hedonic scale. Triacylglycerols (TAG) and fatty acids (FA) composition was assayed in fats extracted from the designed bars (fresh and stored) by gas chromatography. Contents of oxidation and hydrolysis products were determined using peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AnV), and acidic value (AV). The antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract from bars was measured by scavenging 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and Folin-Ciocalteau methods. The overall liking of bars was high (4. 05 pts on average in the 5 -point scale). The majority of children (71 %) scored the designed bars as tasty and very tasty. The designed products contained 22. 3 % of fat with about 44 g/ 100 g FA of valuable fatty acids, e. g., short-chain saturated fatty acids (SCSFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and odd and branched chain fatty acids (OBCFA), recommended for young organisms. The content of CN 52, CN 54, CN 50 and CN 46 triacylglycerols (TAGs) (about 49 g/ 100 g TAG) was due to both milk and <b>cocoa</b> <b>fat.</b> Storage of bars did not influence their content of oxidation and hydrolysis products, resulting from a substantial content of total phenolics (TPC) (53. 64 mg GAE/ 100 mL of extract) and DPPH scavenging activity at the level of 24 %.

40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this tariff escalation, it maintains, citing the cases of rice and cocoa, is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits semi-milled and milled rice imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % of EU rice exports are of semi-milled or milled rice, and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit of export refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular tariff peak on chocolate, arising partly from tariff escalation and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no tariff escalation, but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more exports of cocoa paste and <b>cocoa</b> <b>fat,</b> butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending tariff escalation for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels. Such a market development would greatly undermine the value of the removal of tariff escalation. Although the EU imports {{raw materials}} from developing countries with zero or [...] ...|$|E
