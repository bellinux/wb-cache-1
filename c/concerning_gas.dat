25|$|Initial {{disputes}} <b>concerning</b> <b>gas</b> {{debts and}} non-payment appeared {{immediately after the}} collapse of the Soviet Union. As a result of disputes over non-payments by Ukraine, Russia suspended natural gas exports several times between 1992 and 1994. This led to the illicit diversion of Russian natural gas exports from transit pipelines by Ukrainian companies and institutions in September 1993 and November 1994. The diversion of gas was acknowledged by Ukraine, while accusations of other diversions were disputed. In September 1993, at a summit conference in Massandra, Crimea, Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to forgive Ukrainian debts in return for control of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. After a strong negative reaction from politicians in Kiev, the idea was abandoned. An intergovernmental agreement was drafted on gas issues, including a clause stating Ukraine would permit Gazprom to participate in the privatization of Ukrainian enterprises in gas and other sectors. In March 1994, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister agreed with Russia that Gazprom could acquire a 51% stake in the pipeline system. In early 1995, Russia and Ukraine agreed to create a joint company, Gaztransit, to operate Ukraine's natural gas transit infrastructure in exchange for the cancellation of a substantial portion of Ukraine's debts to Russia. These agreements were never implemented, and in November 1995, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, adopted a law prohibiting the privatization of oil and gas assets.|$|E

He called the election on a minor high, only weeks after the beginning of construction on the Adelaide-Darwin Railway, a major infrastructure project that had been planned for decades. However, his chances suffered a blow when a planned deal <b>concerning</b> <b>gas</b> from the Timor Sea, {{in which he had}} played a central role and which would have produced significant employment opportunities in the territory, ran into difficulties and had to be postponed. The deal was finalised shortly after the election. He also caused did himself no favours by not opposing a CLP party decision to preference the far-right-wing One Nation Party - which was considerably unpopular in the territory's large ethnic community - over the left-wing Australian Labor Party in five seats around Katherine. This had the effect of allowing ALP Opposition Leader Clare Martin to claim {{that the only way to}} resist One Nation influence was to vote for the ALP. Several weeks later, Burke apologised for the decision, admitting that the tactic had backfired and had cost him a number of votes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. One of {{the most}} {{important}} obstacles to widespread the use of biogas by injecting it on the natural gas grid or using it in fuel cells is related to the strict requirements <b>concerning</b> <b>gas</b> quality, as some detrimental compounds like hydrogen sulphide must be almost completely removed for these uses. Nowadays H 2 S is mainly removed by expensive physical-chemical methods. The objetive of this study is the devolpment of a cost-effective biotrickling filter for treating biogas containing high concentrations of H 2 S (2000 ppmv) in order to reduce it to less than 3 ppmv. With this intention a laboratory trickle bed filter was set up. It was found that for H 2 S inlet concentrations up to 900 ppmv the H 2 S outlet concentration was 99 %. ...|$|E

The halo density profile is derived from the primordial cosmological conditions and its gravitational contraction produced by the disk is included. Several features of the spiral galaxies at different redshifts are predicted, and the main factors which influence on these features are found.
