He referred to the changes underway in the agricultural system as {{the creation of a}} new mode of production and called it the socialist commodity economy. Party theorist Du Runsheng supported Wan's position, saying, [...] "a principle of Marxism is that every change in the relations of ownership is an inevitable outcome of the development of new productive forces which can no longer fit in with the old relations of ownership". He also said:Today's household undertakings are very different in nature. Since land is owned by the public, they are restricted by the <b>collective</b> <b>economy</b> in many ways. They represent a level of management in the co-operative economy, and constitute an organic component part of the entire socialist economy... It is feared that the household contracting system will promote the conservative idea of private possession among the peasants. This fear is not without grounds. However, we must be able to see the other side of the matter, which also happens to be the prevailing aspect. Today's peasants are different from those of the past. They are now new-type labourers under the socialist co-operative system.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{traceable}} specific {{references to}} economy in early Traditionalist writings, produced during {{the twilight of}} Spanish feudalism. The first incursions into the area came upon implementation of revolutionary roots and gradual emergence of bourgeoisie. Some early Traditionalist theorists voiced in defense of certain features of historical regime, especially huge religious landholdings, subject to massive expropriation project launched by the Liberal governments. In conditions of Spanish agricultural economy these landholdings were normally accessible to rural masses by means of specific and rather affordable agreements. New bourgeoisie owners reformatted usage of the plots on a purely commercial basis; the result was emergence of Traditionalist “sentimientos radicalmente anticapitalistas”, directed against the new “agrarismo militante”. Similarly unwelcome was the 1834 abolishment of guilds, bodies advocated even 100 years later. Finally, opposition to doing away with feudalism-rooted local customs, fiscal exemptions or other local tariffs, and popular rather than theoretical hostility to urbanization and industrialization by large pitted Traditionalism against the bourgeoisie realm.Few non-Carlist Traditionalists accepted desamortización and in line with nascent capitalist order declared individual private property an inviolable foundation of a society; their efforts, typical for the mid-19th century, are summarized as attempts to fuse capitalist impulse with hierarchical structures of predominantly rural society. Gradually private property got fully embraced as a cornerstone of especially the rural economy, with mid-size family holdings in Vascongadas and Navarre presented as an ideal economic milieu. However, it has never marginalized the concept of <b>collective</b> <b>economy,</b> be {{it in terms of}} ownership, usage or administration. In rural conditions it resulted in focus on commons like pastures, meadows and forests; in industrial terms it evolved into an attempt to replicate rural family order in the setting of an industrial enterprise, with employers and employees united in a joint management formula. With Rerum novarum accepted as a substitute for own Traditionalist socio-economic recipe, {{in the first half of}} the 20th century some pundits have already declared that there was no other possible way of production than capitalism, though they might have also advocated redistribution of wealth as means to solve social problems. During Francoism key Carlist theorists lamented vertical sindicates as pathetic distortion of the gremial system, but it seems that apart from Juanistas, also they accepted “premisas del neocapitalismo”, at least in the controlled free-market ambience. Present-day Traditionalist leaders at times admit their “odio al capitalismo” and declare return to the old regime, though its designation remains highly vague; an official party program demonstrates technocratic approach, pointing towards a regulated and common-good oriented free market economy.|$|E

Using matching methods and instrumental variable techniques, the authors find that tobacco club membership causes an increase of between 40 - 74 percent in output per acre and an increase of between 45 - 89 percent in tobacco sales per acre. Instead, neither the land share allocated to tobacco nor the unit value obtained by the producers is affected by club membership.

Using this as a base, the paper introduces two new measures of commuting efficiency based on measuring the <b>collective</b> commuting <b>economy</b> of individuals for the journey to work: commuting economy and normalised commuting economy. It is argued that because the average random commute has an intrinsically behavioural interpretation, the measures introduced yield more explicit explanations of the overall nature of travel behaviour within the constraints set by land use geography and the spatial distribution of the transport network. The framework is applied for two different years, 1991 and 2001, and for different modes of transport.

30|$|Finally, {{push for}} the {{construction}} of rural social security system based on farmland circulation. The <b>collective</b> <b>economy</b> was widely accepted in rural areas before 1978. In this system, farmers depended on their land as the means of social insurance. Even after the reform of farmland management in 1978, farmland has served as unemployment insurance for rural residents. At the same time, most migrant workers are not included in China’s urban social insurance system. As shown in the questionnaire, it is the migrant workers themselves rather than their urban employers who pay for the social insurance. Then, with the centralization of farmland in circulation, how will migrant workers without farmland support themselves in their old age? Thus, the lack of social insurance in rural areas hinders farmland circulation and labor transfer. Therefore, a multi-level social insurance system for rural residents, including health insurance, stipend, and other basic insurance, is a necessary condition for labor to transfer from agriculture to other sectors.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the consequences of decollectivization (1978 - 1984) in rural China, a fundamental institutitional change that replaced Maoist <b>collective</b> <b>economy</b> with the Household Responsibility System, for the conditions of Chinese rural poverty. It first examines how decollectivization reshaped the spheres of prodution, exchange and distribution in Chinese rural economy, and discovers that it produced some adverse impacts on poverty reduction in rural China. The author then conducts a critical evaluation of official rural poverty statistics and reestimates the post- 1978 Chinese rural poverty reduction performance. The results show that Chinese rural poverty might not have been reduced by much, or even worse, might well have increased since decollectivization. The research findings presented in this dissertation challenge the conventional wisdom that decollectization made a great contribution to poverty reduction in rural China. This dissertation study has an implication for poverty studies: institutional changes that seem to work well in generating economic growth may not work for promoting poverty reduction. ...|$|E

30|$|Note {{that the}} {{ownership}} structure of Wenzhou’s TVEs also varies across different regions. For example, the Liushi District of Yueqing (before the 1990 s District was an administrative level between the county {{level and the}} township level) was the most developed area of private enterprises, whereas Hongqiao District was stronger in <b>collective</b> <b>economy</b> in the 1980 s. Historically, the guerrilla cadres in Hongqiao maintained tight control over this area (after the 1970 s {{all members of the}} CCP Committee of Hongqiao District were guerrilla cadres) and were thus able to control some economic resources in local governments. In contrast, the position of party secretary in Liushi District had long been held by southbound cadres or cadres from other towns of Yueqing. Guerrilla cadres served as vice-district-level (or below) officials for a long period. Nevertheless, local guerrilla cadres always protected the local interests, with the result that the district party secretary often found it difficult to control these local cadres and tended to have short tenures. These facts suggest that the difference in the local informal power configuration is important for understanding the historical differences in the ownership structure of TVEs.|$|E

The present monograph contributes to filling in this gap and provides progress towards {{the creation of a}} formalized social capital theory. Starting with the basic concepts {{of social capital}} of Bourdieu [1983] and Coleman [1988] we derive a general definition of social capital. Social capital is a property of relationships among individuals that are a resource actors can use and benefit from. Because neither Bourdieu's nor Coleman's concepts are appropriate as a general social capital theory the more current concepts of Putnam [2000], Burt [1992] and Lin [2001] are contested for this purpose. The discussions show that we can distinguish between cultural social capital (generalized trust, norms of reciprocity) and structural social capital (networks) and that we should focus on one of the two. Thus, we focus the latter but we take into account that cultural social capital is a preconditions as well as an outcome of structural social capital.
