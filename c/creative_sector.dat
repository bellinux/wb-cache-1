5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital <b>Creative</b> <b>sector.</b> As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on the Internet, video game companies Big Viking Games and Digital Extremes, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.|$|E

25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the <b>creative</b> <b>sector</b> (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and {{eccentrics}} strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E

30|$|The {{power and}} {{potential}} of the Brazilian creative economy is clear. The data presented above demonstrate its gradual growth and strengthening despite its being limited to an economy generated by formalized organizations that are recognized as legal entities. In practice, many entrepreneurs and professionals in <b>creative</b> <b>sectors</b> operate in the informal economy, which was not captured by these surveys. The impact of <b>creative</b> <b>sectors</b> in Brazil is thus underestimated as to their real economic movement. The informality {{in most of these}} cases occurs due to the immaturity of legal and institutional frameworks of these sectors {{and as a result of}} the relative lack of public policies and investments needed for the strengthening of the Brazilian creative economy, whether at the federal, state or municipal level.|$|R

30|$|Creative {{economies in}} any {{language}} {{are concerned with the}} generation or exploitation of knowledge and information primarily for monetary value. They are not new but with advances in technology they are now packaged in new skins (Hesmondlalgh [2002]). Eleven <b>creative</b> <b>sectors</b> have been identified and they include advertising, architecture, music, visual and performing arts, publishing, radio and television among others (DCMS [2001]). The three key issues emerging from these <b>creative</b> <b>sectors</b> are that they have a potential for job and wealth creation; that they are based on the knowledge and use of a mother tongue in a multilingual setting; and that they are not hindered by restrictive language policies since they occur in contexts that are not under such controls. These three issues create a very conducive environment {{for those who want to}} use mother tongues for economic value.|$|R
