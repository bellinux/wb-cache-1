40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an integrity evaluation of Tanks W- 8 and W- 9, part of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT), in the South Tank Farm at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), together with a plan for monitoring those tanks for potential releases during the GAAT CERCLA treatability study and waste removal activities. This work was done in support of an ORNL plan to use W- 8 and W- 9 as <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks</b> during remediation of the other tanks in the North and South Tank Farms. The analysis portion of the report draws upon both tank-internal measurements of liquid volume change and tank-external measurements of the change in electrical conductivity of the groundwater in the dry wells adjacent to each tank. The results of the analysis show that both W- 8 and W- 9 are liquid-tight and are suitable for use as <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks.</b> The recommended monitoring plan will utilize the dry well conductivity monitoring method as the primary release detection tool during the CERCLA activities. This method is expected to be able to detect releases of less than 0. 5 gal/h with a 95 % probability of detection, most of the time. The results described here validate three prior independent efforts: a liquid integrity assessment made in 1995, a structural integrity assessment made in 1995 by experts in the field of gunite tanks, and a structural integrity assessment made in 1994 using a three-dimensional, finite-element computer model. This work, along with the three prior efforts, shows that Tanks W- 8 and W- 9 are structurally sound and liquid-tight. Based upon this work it is concluded that these tanks are suitable for use as <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks</b> during the GAAT CERCLA treatability study and waste removal actions and it is recommended that the tanks be monitored for potential releases during this period using the methods described in this report...|$|R
40|$|A {{treatability}} {{study and}} waste removal program are being implemented for the Gunite ad Associated Tanks Operable Unit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This report documents the instrumentation and monitoring efforts to establish baseline conductivity conditions. The simulated liquid release (SLR) testing reported here demonstrates {{the effectiveness of}} the Conductivity-monitoring method (CMM) as a liquid-release detection method for <b>consolidation</b> <b>Tanks</b> W- 8 and W- 9 and Tank W- 10 in the South Tank Farm (STF). The results show the remarkable sensitivity of the CMM to even very small simulated releases from the tank. The SLR testing for DW- 8, DW- 9 and DW- 10 show that the dry well conductivity monitoring will be effective in detecting potential releases from the tanks during waste removal operations. The data in this report also make clear statements about the inferred integrity of the tanks, tank pads, and drain system: (1) the data substantiate earlier work and show that Tanks W- 8, W- 9, and W- 10 are not leaking; (2) the data show that the pads under Tanks W- 8, W- 9, and W- 10 are integral and connected to the dry wells; (3) the STF drain system appears to be functioning properly. This report presents these results and describes the release monitoring plan for the <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks</b> and during waste removal operations at all of the tanks in the STF...|$|R

25|$|Upgrading of {{the first}} Activated Sludge plant to use the 'Simplex' system took place between 1970 and 1973. Because of the {{proximity}} of the M60 motorway and the risk that deep excavations might damage it, seven of the final settling tanks were built above ground. Effluent from the Activated Sludge plant was raised up {{to the level of the}} tanks by screw pumps, and the increased hydraulic head improved their performance. The upgrade also included five primary settlement tanks and eight sludge <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks.</b> Two new sludge boats were purchased in 1971 and 1972, and a new dock was constructed on land which had formerly been used for secondary beds.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{was intended to}} enhance the understanding of penetrometer behaviour in normally consolidated clay. The effects of varying penetration rate and clay shear strength were studies {{and the distribution of}} pore pressures determined. The meet these objectives laboratory testing was undertaken. Penetration tests were to be performed in tanks of clay consolidated from slurry and maintained under known stresses. An initial series of tests examined the effect of stiff tank walls. These showed unexpectedly high radial boundary stresses were generated with tank to probe diameter ratios of 50 : 1. This finding dictated laboratory tests with small scale penetrometers in the largest practical size of tank. Field tests with small scale and full size penetrometers demonstrated an absence of scale effect in the penetrometer pore pressures and total stress data. Two <b>consolidation</b> <b>tanks</b> of 580 mm diameter and one of 1000 mm diameter were built with the facility for maintaining constant stresses on top of the sample during penetration. Piezocone penetrometers of 5 cm 2 and 1 cm 2 cross-section were built. Penetration tests were performed from 2 cm/s to 3 m/s with hydraulic insertion equipment. At lower rates the total cone resistance factor Nkt was shown to be 10. 3 ± 0. 9 in normally consolidated kaolin. The corresponding pore pressure factor NΔu was 8. 25 ± 1. 0 at the cone shoulder. A hundredfold increase in the penetration rate increased the Nkt factor by 40 % but the NΔu factor was unchanged. Various subsidiary points emerged. The type of strength test used for comparison with penetrometer data is significant. Major strength reductions occur on sample depressurization. These were demonstrated with vane and triaxial tests. Baligh and Levadoux’s method for determining ch from pore pressure dissipation around penetrometers matched experimental data. Ratios of excess pore pressures on the cone face and shoulder show some promise in the evaluation of OCR...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the thermal hydraulic analysis performed {{to provide a}} technical basis in support of <b>consolidation</b> of <b>tank</b> C- 106 waste into tank AY- 102. Several parametric calculations were performed using the HUB and GOTH computer codes. First, the current heat load of tank AY- 102 was determined. Potential quantities of waste transfer from tank C- 106 were established to maintain the peak temperatures of consolidated sludge in tank AY- 102 to remain within Operating Specification limits. For this purpose, it was shown that active cooling of the tank floor was essential and a secondary ventilation flow of 2, 000 cfm should be maintained. Transient calculations were also conducted to evaluate the effects of ambient meteorological cyclic conditions on sludge peak temperature, and loss of ventilation systems. Detailed calculations were also performed to estimate the insulating concrete air channels cooling effectiveness and the resulting peak temperatures for the consolidated sludge in tank AY- 102. Calculations are were also performed for a primary and secondary ventilation systems outage, both individually and combined to establish limits on outage duration. Because of its active cooling mode of operation, the secondary ventilation system limits the outage duration...|$|R

This current tank selection and sequence provides retrieval systems supporting the Privatized waste processing plant and sustains the ability to provide final remediation of several watch list DSTs via treatment. The ITRS is configured to support changing program needs, as constrained by available budget, by maintaining the flexibility for exchanging tanks requiring mixer pump-based retrieval systems and shifting the retrieval sequence. Preliminary design was configured such that an adequate basis exists for initiating Title II design of a mixer pump based retrieval system for any DST.
