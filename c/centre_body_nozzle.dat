40|$|A {{technique}} for incorporating distributed aerodynamic normal forces and aeroelastic coupling effects into a stability analysis {{model of a}} launch vehicle is presented. The formulation augments the linear state-space launch vehicle plant dynamics that are compactly derived as a system of coupled linear differential equations representing small angular and translational perturbations of the rigid <b>body,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and sloshing propellant coupled with normal vibration {{of a set of}} orthogonal modes. The interaction of generalized forces due to aeroelastic coupling and thrust can be expressed as a set of augmenting non-diagonal stiffness and damping matrices in modal coordinates with no penalty on system order. While the eigenvalues of the structural response in the presence of thrust and aeroelastic forcing can be predicted at a given flight condition independent of the remaining degrees of freedom, the coupled model provides confidence in closed-loop stability in the presence of rigid-body, slosh, and actuator dynamics. Simulation results are presented that characterize the coupled dynamic response of the Ares I launch vehicle and the impact of aeroelasticity on control system stability margins...|$|R

40|$|Along {{the coast}} of Western Australia, where {{upwelling}} is largely suppressed by the southward flowing Leeuwin Current, meso-scale eddies may be significant for the input of nutrients and overall productivity of the region. Eddies forming near the continental shelf also provide a potential mechanism for the entrainment of coastal water, and may therefore act as offshore transport mechanisms for planktonic organisms. In October 2003, a cruise was undertaken on the RV Southern Surveyor to investigate the dynamics of two eddies, located about 500 km offshore, that had been generated off the Western Australian coast. Primary production patterns, nutrient cycling, oceanographic and biological characteristics of both eddies (one cold-core and one warm-core) were investigated over a 23 day period, using {{a wide range of}} methods including a continuous physiochemical sampler (“Seasoar”). Larval fish were obtained from the <b>centre,</b> <b>body</b> and perimeter of each eddy using oblique bongo net tows and depth-stratified EZ net tows. The larval fish assemblage was mostly composed of oceanic families, such as Myctophidae, Phosichthydae and Gonostomatidae. The cold-core eddy showed few differences between its <b>centre,</b> <b>body</b> and perimeter in terms of larval density and larval fish assemblage structure. The warm-core eddy, however, showed much lower densities of larvae in the centre, compared to both the body and perimeter, and to the cold-core eddy.

40|$|In many coastal oceans, eddies and jets occur predictably {{under certain}} conditions, {{and are a}} common {{mechanism}} for entraining coastal water across the continental shelf. Eddies may therefore act as transport mechanisms for planktonic organisms and larvae. In October 2003, a cruise was undertaken on the RV Southern Surveyor to investigate the dynamics of two eddies located more than 500 km off the Western Australian coast. Primary production patterns, nutrient cycling, oceanographic and biological characteristics of both eddies (one cold-core upwelling, and one warm-core downwelling) were investigated over a 23 day period, using oblique and depth stratiﬁed plankton tows, continuous physiochemical samplers (“Seasoar”), sediment traps and other methods. Larval ﬁsh were collected from plankton samples taken in the <b>centre,</b> <b>body</b> and perimeter of each eddy, during both day and nighttime, with both oblique bongo, and depth stratiﬁed EZ Net tows.
