H 577 P BSE 2015 Xuexi, 238 leaves :illustrations; 30 cmThis thesis {{presents}} an interactive building energy demand management {{strategy for the}} interaction of commercial buildings with a smart grid and facilitating grid optimization. A simplified building thermal storage model is developed for predicting and characterizing power demand alteration potentials of individual buildings together with a model for predicting the normal power demand profiles of buildings. The implementation details of the interactive strategy for the complex building <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>systems</b> are also investigated for ensuring their controllability and energy efficiency. To analyze and quantify the power demand and the demand alteration characteristics of commercial buildings in a smart grid, a dynamic simulation platform for the complex building <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>systems</b> was built by considering passive and active building thermal storages. To formulate the interactive building energy demand management strategy, simplified models of the simulation platform were employed (e. g., chillers, pumps, air handling units, etc.) or developed (e. g., the simplified building thermal storage, pricing mechanism, etc.). A genetic algorithm-based (GA) method is also developed to identify {{the parameters of the}} simplified building thermal storage model. The simulation test results show that commercial buildings can contribute significantly and effectively in power demand management or alterations with building power demand characteristics identified properly. The demand alterations from building demand side can help effectively in releasing the grid power imbalance under an interactive operation. To design and develop a fast chiller power demand response control strategy for smart grid applications (e. g., make use of the power demand of HVAC systems as operating reserves for relieving grid power imbalance), the chiller sequence control and the control logic of the building <b>central</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>systems</b> need to be rearranged. Compared with conventional indoor temperature set-point reset strategy, the developed strategy can provide an accurate estimation of power demand reduction in advance, and enable a fast response fulfilling the operation requirements of the grid on the premise of indoor thermal comfort. Simulation tests are also conducted to estimate the potential of reserve and investigate the impact on the thermal comfort when adopting the developed strategy. The resulting imbalance distributions of the chilled water flow rate and the indoor and air temperature caused by the chiller demand limiting control strategy are also investigated and solved. Based on the simplified building thermal storage model, online and offline applications of active thermal storages (e. g., PCM tank and chilled water tank, etc.) in buildings for smart grid are discussed and tested on the simulation platform. Lastly, the software tools (i. e., TRNSYS and MATLAB) and implementation details for conducting online and offline application tests are presented. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

Two independent systems, each comprised of a primary-secondary-tertiary distribution network and cooled by a 12, 300 kW (3, 500 RT) steam-turbine driven centrifugal chiller, were modeled as control volume networks using steady-state rate balances for energy, exergy, and cost. An extensive set of measurements, collected over the 2006 cooling season, was used as the input data for the models. Results show that while the steam turbines are the largest source of exergy destruction, mixing in the distribution loops is the dominant source of exergy unit cost at low cooling loads, and refrigeration cycle losses dominate costs at high loads. Recommendations include: (1) Convert the chilled water distribution to an all-variable-speed, direct-coupled configuration; (2) During low cooling loads use only one chiller; (3) During high cooling loads, increase the flow rate of water through the evaporators; (4) Favor speed control over inlet guide vanes for capacity modulation; (5) Better insulate steam piping; and (6) Consider replacing the steam turbines with variable speed motors...|$|R
