30|$|Putnam et al. {{reported}} a combined technique using the Maquet and valgus tibial osteotomy. An oblique incision is used and a bilateral retinacular release with a Maquet-type tibial tubercle osteotomy (Ferguson) performed. The tibiofibular joint is separated. A closing wedge osteotomy is carried out, completed with an osteotome after pre-drilling. The extracted bone {{is used to}} elevate the TT.

30|$|Radiographs on day {{of planned}} pin removal after CRPP for type 2 supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} consistently showed stable fracture alignment and visible fracture callus in this cohort.

Despite 22  % of children having <b>casts</b> <b>applied</b> after pin removal, there was no instance where pin removal was delayed at the 3 – 4  week post-operative visit because of radiographic findings.
