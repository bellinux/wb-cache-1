40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} an association between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation seems {{to play an important}} role in the observed health effects. However, the predominant particle component(s) that drives the inflammation is still not fully clarified. In this study representative coarse (2. 5 – 10 μm) and fine (0. 1 – 2. 5 μm) particulate samples from a western, an eastern, a northern and a southern European city (Amsterdam, Lodz, Oslo and Rome) were collected during three seasons (spring, summer and winter). All fractions were investigated with respect to cytokine-inducing potential in primary macrophages isolated from rat lung. The results were related to the physical and chemical parameters of the samples in order to disclose possible connections between inflammatory potential and specific characteristics of the particles. Results Compared on a gram-by gram basis, both site-specific and seasonal variations in the PM-induced cytokine responses were demonstrated. The samples collected in the eastern (Lodz) and southern (Rome) cities appeared to be the most potent. Seasonal variation was most obvious with the samples from Lodz, with the highest responses induced by the spring and summer samples. The site-specific or seasonal variation in cytokine release could not be attributed to variations in any of the chemical parameters. <b>Coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> from all cities were more potent to induce the inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumour necrosis factor-α than the corresponding fine fractions. Higher levels of specific elements such as iron and copper, some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and endotoxin/lipopolysaccaride seemed to be prevalent in the <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions.</b> However, variations in the content of these components did not reflect the variation in cytokine release induced by the different <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions.</b> Addition of polymyxin B did not affect the particle-induced cytokine release, indicating that the variations in potency among the <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> are not explained by endootoxin. Conclusion The inflammatory potential of ambient PM demonstrated heterogeneity in relation to city and season. The <b>coarse</b> particle <b>fractions</b> were consistently more potent than the respective fine fractions. Though a higher level of some elements, PAH and endotoxin was found in the <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions,</b> the presence of specific components was not sufficient to explain all variations in PM-induced cytokine release. </p...|$|R

40|$|From {{research}} on PM 2. 5 and PM 10 in 2007 / 2008 in the Netherlands, {{it was concluded}} that the <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> (PM 2. 5 - 10) attributed 60 % and 50 % respectively, to the urban-regional and street-urban increments of PM 10. Contrary to Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries which exhibit significant seasonal variation in the <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> of particulate matter (PM), in the Netherlands the <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> in PM at a street location is rather constant during the year. Non-exhaust emissions by road traffic are identified as the main source for coarse PM in urban areas. Non-exhaust emissions mainly originate from re-suspension of accumulated deposited PM and road wear related particles, while primary tire and brake wear hardly contribute to the mass of non-exhaust emissions. However, tire and brake wear can clearly be identified in the total mass through the presence of the heavy metals: zinc, a tracer for tire wear and copper, a tracer for brake wear. The efficiency of road sweeping and washing to reduce non-exhaust emissions in a street-canyon in Amsterdam was investigated.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of fragmentation of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) by the Los Angeles test. The standard testing procedure for the Los Angeles index requires the measurement of the mass passing 1. 6 mm after 500 revolutions of the drum. Questions arise on {{the significance of this}} measure for RCA as the resistances of the mortar, of the original aggregate and of their interface simultaneously affect the measurement result. In order to clarify the interpretation of such a measure, three aspects were investigated: the influence of the number of revolutions, the evolution of the full particle size distribution and the distribution of mortar in the fractions after the test. The results suggested that the fracture mechanisms are similar between recycled and natural aggregates with some quantitative differences. RCA was less resistant to fragmentation and displayed a non linear evolution of mass passing 1. 6 mm with the number of revolutions. During fracture of RCA, mortar progressively accumulates in smaller <b>fractions,</b> with <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> asymptotically behaving like natural aggregates. The analysis of the rate of breakage of the <b>coarsest</b> <b>fraction</b> appeared to be a richer indicator of crushability as a function of time and composition than the amount of the mass passing 1. 6 mm: its typical evolution allows estimating a rate of breakage which correlates well with indirect measures of composition (water absorption and density).

Over the last 1500 kyr, <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> records display high-amplitude oscillations with an irregular wavelength {{on the order of}} approximately 500 kyr. These oscillations can be correlated throughout the entire equatorial Indian Ocean, from the Seychelles area eastward to the Ninetyeast Ridge, and into the Arabian Sea. Changes in grain size mainly result from changes in carbonate dissolution as evidenced by the positive relationship between <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> content and a foraminiferal preservation index based on test fragmentation. The well-known `'mid-Brunhes dissolution cycle'' represents the last part of this irregular long-term dissolution oscillation. The origin of this long-term oscillation is still poorly understood. Our observations suggest {{that it is not a}} true cycle (it has an irregular wavelength) and we propose that it may result from long-term changes in Ca++ flux to the ocean. Sites 722 and 758 deltaO- 18 records provide a high-resolution stratigraphy that allows a detailed intersite comparison of the two <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> records over the last 1500 kyr. Site 722 (2030 m) lies above the present and late Pleistocene lysocline. The lysocline shoaled to the position of site 758 (2925 m) only during the interglacial intervals that occurred between about 300 and 500 ka (Peterson and Prell, 1985 a). Despite these supralysoclinal positions of the two sites, short-term changes in <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> contents are correlatable from one site to another and probably result from regional (or global) dissolution pulses. By stacking the normalized <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> records from sites 722 and 758, we constructed a Composite <b>Coarse</b> <b>Fraction</b> Index (CCFI) curve in which most of the local signals cancelled out. The last 800 kyr of this curve appear to compare extremely well with the Composite Dissolution Index curve from core V 34 - 53 (Ninetyeast Ridge), which unambiguously records past variations of carbonate dissolution in the equatorial Indian Ocean (Peterson and Prell, 1985 a). In the late Pleistocene the CCFI variations are mainly associated with glacial-interglacial changes. They show strong 100 and 41 kyr periodicities but no clear precession-related periodicities. As proposed earlier by Peterson and Prell (1985 a), the lack of precession frequencies may suggest that the regional carbonate dissolution signal is driven by changes in deepwater circulation. We cannot totally reject the possibility, however, that low temporal resolution and/or bioturbation degrade somehow the precessional signal at ODP sites 722 and 758. In contrast, spectral density of dissolution cycles in the giant (53 m long) piston core MD 900963 (Maldives area) displays clear maxima centered on the precession frequencies (23 and 19 kyr- 1) as well as on the 29 -kyr- 1 frequency but shows little power at the 100 -kyr- 1 frequency. These high-frequency changes most probably result from changes in surface productivity associated with monsoon variability. Dissolution at this site may be ultimately controlled by the oxidation of organic matter which appears to be incorporated into the sediments in greater quantity during periods of weak SW monsoon and/or increased dry NE monsoon...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for dust (especially wood dust) determination in workplace aerosols {{includes a}} parallel impactor with 6 stages, with round jet 1 -nozzle impactors each of flow rate 10 L/min; a light scattering device and optical cells for time resolution, and a 2 -stage virtual impactor placed {{ahead of the}} optical cells to seperate the fine dust and enhance the concentration of the <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction.</b> Measurements in the workplace at a furniture plant agreed within 10 % with measurements given by the Gravikon VC 25 G. The amount of respirable dust was approximately 10 %. Approximate 50 % of the total dust was in the size range 10 - 50 mu. m. Peaks in dust concentration during operation of a belt grinder were mainly due to the <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> of the dust, whereas {{the profile of the}} fine dust was nearly uniform...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an experimental study performed on the mechanical behavior of concrete manufactured with ceramic recycled aggregates (CRA), from precast ventilation ducts, that once made have been rejected by defective. The ultimate objective is to use these wastes to manufacture prestressed concrete joists used in building floors. The <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> and the fine fraction have been considered. The work has been carried out in three phases: characterization of the material, characterization of concrete with CRA and manufacturing and testing of prestressed joists. With the results obtained it is determined the influence of the ceramic recycled aggregate on the properties analyzed. There are not enough studies about prestressed elements that include the replacement of the aggregate in the fine fraction. In view of the results obtained could both of fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>fraction</b> can be used in these applications...|$|E
30|$|At {{the plunge}} point, the river has already dropped its <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> (gravel and sand) {{upstream}} as delta-plain facies. The remaining fine fractions in muddy suspension {{move forward on}} the open shelf as hyperpycnal flows. Plunging would occur only if suspended sediment concentration in the river exceeds the critical value of 35 − 45 kg·m−[*] 3 (Imran and Syvitski 2000; see Mulder et al. 2003 for differences in values between equatorial and subpolar rivers).|$|R
40|$|The acid {{insoluble}} <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> of the glacial-interglacial {{sequence of}} Hole 552 A in the NE Atlantic {{are made up}} of varying amounts of terrigenous detritus, biogenic silica, and pyroclastic material, principally volcanic glass. Volcanic ash content varies significantly over the entire interval, and the three North Atlantic ash horizons of Ruddiman and Glover (1972) can be recognized satisfactorily. The terrigenous detritus is of mixed metamorphic-basaltic type and probably originated on the Greenland landmas...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{significance}} of Los Angeles test when being used with RCAs, three aspects were investigated: {{the influence of the}} number of revolutions, the evolution of the full particle size distribution and the distribution of mortar in the fractions after the test. The standard testing procedure for the Los Angeles index requires the measurement of the mass passing 1. 6 mm after 500 revolutions of the drum. Questions arise on the significance of this measure for RCA as the resistances of the mortar, of the original aggregate and of their interface simultaneously affect the measurement result. In order {{to clarify the}} interpretation of such a measure, three aspects were investigated: the influence of the number of revolutions, the evolution of the full particle size distribution and the distribution of mortar in the fractions after the test. The results suggested that the fracture mechanisms are similar between recycled and natural aggregates with some quantitative differences. RCA was less resistant to fragmentation and displayed a nonlinear evolution of mass passing 1. 6 mm with the number of revolutions. During fracture of RCA, mortar progressively accumulates in smaller <b>fractions,</b> with <b>coarse</b> <b>fractions</b> asymptotically behaving like natural aggregates. The analysis of the rate of breakage of the <b>coarsest</b> <b>fraction</b> appeared to be a richer indicator of crushability as a function of time and composition than the amount of the mass passing 1. 6 mm: its typical evolution allows estimating a rate of breakage which correlates well with indirect measures of composition (water absorption and density). The possible existence of an asymptote in the rate of breakage of the <b>coarsest</b> <b>fraction</b> suggests that {{it can be used to}} estimate at the same time the resistance of the recycled aggregate and of its original natural component, and probably give an estimate of the amount of mortar...|$|R
