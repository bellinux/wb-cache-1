50|$|They {{are called}} proanthocyanidins as they yield anthocyanidins when depolymerized under {{oxidative}} conditions. Different types of condensed tannins exist, {{such as the}} procyanidins, propelargonidins, prodelphinidins, profisetinidins, proteracacinidins (from mesquitol), proguibourtinidins or prorobinetidins. All of the above are formed from flavan-3-ols, but flavan-3,4-diols, called (leucoanthocyanidin) also form <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> oligomers, e.g. leuco-fisetinidin form profisetinidin, and flavan-4-ols form condensed tannins, e.g. 3',4',5,7-flavan-4-ol form proluteolinidin (luteoforolor).

50|$|One {{method for}} {{improving}} nitrogen utilisation by ruminants and reduce greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O), without altering their nitrogen and energy value, {{is to use}} forages that contain condensed tannins, such as sainfoin. The nutritive value of sainfoin, despite its lower nitrogen content than lucerne, is high. Future research, on the nutritional impact of condensed tannins is likely not only be based on <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> content, but also include structure-activity considerations.The results obtained, with sheep at maintenance fed a diet containing only sainfoin will be tested with producing animals, for example growing sheep and cattle, lactating ewes, goats or cows. In producing animals the diet will comprise different forage sources and supplement feeds. Sainfoin is seldom used as a pure crop and is generally introduced in pasture in a grass-legume mix with cocksfoot (Dactylis), ryegrass (Lolium) or with other legumes such as red clover, white clover or lucerne. Results have shown {{the choice of the}} variety is important. A variety like Esparcette, characterised by the highest <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> content, may provide beneficial effects with a lower proportion in a mixture with other legumes. Preserving legumes, as silage, {{is a good way to}} provide an on-farm source of home-grown energy and protein, offers advantages over traditional haymaking, being less weather-dependent, and allows a high quality of forage during the harvesting period.

Normal supplementation rate of Calliandra calothyrsus is around 20-40%.In Uganda, Calliandra calothyrsus is mostly mixed with other fodder for cows (grasses, tree species…). Calliandra calothyrsus leaves do not contain any toxic compounds but high condensed tannins concentrations, which could limit the digestibility for ruminants. It {{has been shown that}} moderate <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> concentrations (2-4% dry matter) can enhance the protein metabolism for ruminants.

Calliandra calothyrsus should not be used in grazing regions only, because the risk that animals destroy the tree bark is high, which leads to a high tree mortality. Animals should eat freshly cut Calliandra leaves that were cut between 0 and 1 meter. Apparently, dry leaves seem to be less palatable to animals. Some beneficial effects of using Calliandra calothyrsus as fodder have been observed in Uganda, where farmers noticed an increase in milk production.

South African cultivars have not been profiled for their phenolic content and antioxidant activity to highlight their potential benefits. Thus, South African sorghum cultivars representing different sorghum types were evaluated for total phenolic content, <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> content and antioxidant activity and the effect of cultivar on their antioxidant activity. The presence of phenolic antioxidants in the different sorghum cultivars, created an opportunity to develop a sorghum product as a vector of the antioxidants. Cookies were a product of choice due to their shelf stability and high nutrient density. Sorghum cookies were produced from 70 %, 90 % and 100 % extraction rate flours. The effects of flour extraction rates and cultivar on the total phenolic content, <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> content and antioxidant activity of the cookies were determined. Consumer sensory evaluation was used to evaluate sorghum cookie acceptability against a wheat flour cookie. Total phenolic content of the cultivars, determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method was 0. 20 to 1. 42 g catechin equivalents (CE) / 100 g. The total phenolic content was 3 to 7 times higher in <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> cultivars than in tannin-free cultivars. Using the modified Vanillin-HCl method, condensed tannins were only measurable in the <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> cultivars. They ranged between 5. 16 and 8. 39 g CE/ 100 g. Subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> cultivars measured by the ABTS radical scavenging assay was up to 4 times higher than in the tannin-free cultivars. The high phenolic content and antioxidant activity of <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> cultivars was attributed to the contribution of condensed tannins. Therefore, <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> cultivars are a major source of antioxidants compared to tannin-free cultivars. For each sorghum cultivar, cookies of 100 % extraction rate flours had 2 to 3 times higher total phenolics compared to those of 70 % extraction rate flours, while antioxidant activity was 2 to 10 times higher. Cookies of the <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> sorghum had 2 to 5 times more phenolics compared to those of condensed tannin-free sorghum. Antioxidant activity was 145 to 227 ìMol Trolox equivalents (TE) /g in cookies of <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> sorghum compared to 10 to 102 ìMol TE/g in those of condensed tannin-free sorghum. Processing sorghum flours to cookies seemed to reduce phenolic and antioxidant activity, but considering the flour component in the formula, cookie antioxidant activity was slightly higher than that of flours. The texture of all sorghum cookies was less acceptable compared to that of wheat cookies. The consumers showed a slight overall liking of the condensed tannin-free sorghum and wheat flour cookies. The cookies from <b>condensed</b> <b>tannin</b> flours were neither liked nor disliked. Since generally wheat flour is used for making cookies, the similarities in the overall liking of the condensed tannin-free sorghum cookies and the wheat flour cookies indicate strong potential of sorghum flour for cookie making. Therefore, sorghum cookies have a potential as a functional ready-to-eat snack, with target consumers such as school children in feeding schemes to improve their health and nutrition status.
