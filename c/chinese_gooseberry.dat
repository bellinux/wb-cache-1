50|$|As {{the local}} {{popularity}} of this fruit increased, New Zealanders discarded the local Chinese {{name for the}} fruit (yáng táo) {{in favor of the}} name <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry.</b> Among the exporters was the prominent produce company Turners and Growers, who were calling the berries melonettes, because the local name for the fruit, <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> had political connotations due to the Cold War, and to further distinguish it from real gooseberries, which are prone to a fungus called anthracnose. An American importer, Norman Sondag of San Francisco, complained that melonettes was as bad as <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> because melons and berries were both subject to high import tariffs, and instead asked for a short Maori name that quickly connoted New Zealand. In June 1959, during a meeting of Turners and Growers management in Auckland, Jack Turner suggested the name kiwifruit which was adopted and later became the industry-wide name. In the 1960s and 1970s, Frieda Caplan, founder of Los Angeles-based Frieda's Finest (aka Frieda's Inc./Frieda's Specialty Produce) {{played a key role in}} popularising kiwifruit in the United States, convincing supermarket produce managers to carry the odd-looking fruit.|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of flower {{development}} in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (Actinidia chinensis) and the effects of various environmental factors on that development. As well, the flower distribution patterns of various staminate vines and pistillate cultivars were surveyed. Flower initiation in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> takes place late in the seasonal cycle, occurring just before the resumption of shoot growth in the spring (mid-late September). Once initiation commences, development of the flower structure is rapid and, like that of other angiosperms, staminate and pistillate flowers develop from a potentially henrB. phrodite prinordium. Lateral flower buds are initiated in both pistillate and staminate cultivars, giving a compound dichasium. In some pistillate cultivars (especially Hayward) however, many of these lateral flower buds cease development soon after their initiation and abort. Chilling studies with cuttings showed that the <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> does not have an absolute lON temperature requirement for flowering, although chilling does enhance flowering by preventing the premature abortion of flower buds. There is also a low chilling requirement for bud break which chilling enhances; buds {{are in a state of}} dormancy over the winter, ie. bursting apparently being prevented by unfavourable conditions. Defoliation, shading, and tipping treatments on newly emerging shoots were found to exemplify patterns of growth. 	Floral development in single node cuttings was enhanced by continuous defoliation, inhibited by severe shading, and unaffected by tipping. Leaf production and growth, shoot elongation and thickening, and new bud developrrent were also affected by such treatments. These effects, were generally related to the severity of the treatment and to the length of time the treatments were applied. Similar treatments on individual shoots on vines in the field had little effect on reproductive growth possibly due to the translocation of assimilates to and from the treated shoots. The effects of chilling, defoliation, shading, and tipping are discussed in terms of hormonal, carbohydrate and nutritional responses. A survey of the flowering characteristics of 14 unnamed staminate vines of unknown origin showed that these fell into 3 groupings, none of which were similar to the cultivars Tomuri and Matua.

The changes of physical characters (length, diameter, weight, firmness), chemical components (soluble solids, starch, sugar, titratable acidity), percentage dry matter and mineral nutrients (phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium) were investigated on developing fruits throughout the growth at the intervals of 10 or 20 days. The influence of KT- 30 on seed development and on the endogenous hormones in young fruits were also investigated. Additionally, the quality and storage performance of treated fruits were evaluated. The treatment was made by dipping the fruit into 10 ppm KT- 30 solution 20 days after anthesis. 1. The treatment of KT- 30 promoted fruit growth significantly, that is, fresh weight and dry weight of the treated fruits were about 2 and 1. 8 times as large as those of control fruits, respectively, at 160 days after anthsis. 2. There was no difference in the growth curves between the control and treated fruits, each of which showed double sigmoid pattern. 3. There were little or no significant changes in the activities of auxin-like and gibberellin-like substances between the control and treated young fruits. 4. Fruit firmness, percentage dry matter, contents of soluble solids and some mineral nutrients, especially calcium, in the treated fruits were lower than those in control one, although nonstructural carbohydrate (starch + sugars) content was higher in treated fruits than that in the control throughout the growth. 5.

A fruit-specific cDNA library was established and screened by differential hybridisation {{and using a}} synthetic oligonucleotide. Two of ten actinidin clones identified were characterised by sequence analysis. The two very similar cDNAs code for proteins with approximately 90 % sequence homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin, {{as well as an}} additional 25 amino acids following the mature carboxyl terminus. The larger clone in addition has coding potential for 57 residues of an amino-terminal extension with considerable homology to amino-terminal sequences of other cysteine proteinases. From size determinations of both mRNA (1. 4 kb) and immunoprecipitated in vitro translation product (39 kDa) it was estimated that actinidin is synthesised as a precursor approximately 15 kDa larger than the mature protein. Features of the prosegment primary sequence are considered with regard to a possible mechanism of inactivation of the proteinase, by analogy with other proteolytic zymogens. The presence of three potential glycosylation sites, one within the carboxy-terminal and two in the amino-terminal extension are consistent with subcellular location of the enzyme within membrane-bound organelles. Results from a Southern blot show that actinidin is encoded by a multigene family of up to ten members.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the mechanisms underlying fruit {{growth and development}} of <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (Actinidia chinensis Planch.), the effects of four growth regulators on fruit growth and development were examined. In addition, the mechanism of KT- 30 action on fruit growth and development and the methods to improve the undesirable qualities found in the KT- 30 -promoted large fruits were studied. The results obtained were as follows: 1. In the treatments of fruits with four growth regulators, KT- 30, GA_ 3, IAA, and ABA, carried out in stage Ⅱ of the fruit growth cycle (12 weeks after anthesis), no effects {{were found on the}} fruit growth and bevelopment. 2. Girding of the base of bearing branches increased fruit weight of 17 g in the KT- 30 treated fruits and of 16 g in the untreated fruits. 3. The effects of KT- 30 on the enlargement of fruit size varied with the treatment time and concentrations. KT- 30 applied to buds one to three weeks before anthesis greatly promoted enlargement of the ovaries but did not promote enlargement of the ovaries after pollination. KT- 30 applied to buds one day before anthesis promoted enlargement of the fruits moderately, while treatments of fruits two to four weeks after anthesis promoted it greatly. 4. The firmness of KT- 30 -treated fruits decreased as the concentration of KT- 30 increased and as the size of the KT- 30 -treated fruit increased. The percentage of fruits with rib, which appeared after anthesis, increased as the concentration of KT- 30 increased. It becomes clear that the development of the rib is due to ununiformity of the KT- 30 solution on the fruit surface. 5. Application of a solution of 5 ppm KT- 30 mixed with 200 ppm GA_ 3 to the fruits 2 weeks after anthesis resulted in the increase of the fruit firmness, dicrease of the percentage of fruits with rib and increase of fruit size. キウイフルーツ(Actinidia chinensis Planch.) 果実の生育機構を明らかにするために数種の生長調節物質が果実の生育に及ぼす影響を調査し,またKT- 30 処理による果実生育促進作用の機構とKT- 30 処理に伴う品質劣化の改善法について検討し,以下のことが明らかとなった. 1. ステージⅡ(開花後 12 週目) に処理した生長調節物質(KT- 30,GA_ 3,IAA,ABA) は果実の生育に影響を与えなかった. 2. 結果枝基部に環状剥皮処理を行った場合,KT- 30 処理果で 17 g,無処理果で 16 gの増加が見られた. 3.

40|$|Actinidin is a plant thiol {{protease}} {{which is}} {{isolated from the}} fruit of Actinidia chinensis, the <b>chinese</b> <b>gooseberry.</b> Determination of the primary amino acid sequence of actinidin was undertaken to extend the limited structural information available on this group of enzymes, and therefore enable {{a better understanding of}} their physical and chemical properties. The order of arrangement of the 220 amino acid residues in the primary sequence of actinidin was determined from the sequences of the tryptic peptides. S-carboxy[14 C 2]methyl actinidin was digested with trypsin, and the twelve tryptic peptides produced were initially separated into seven fractions by gel chromatography on Sephadex G- 50. The first four fractions contained tryptic peptides that were purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The last three fractions contained peptides that were sufficiently small to enable purification by paper techniques, and these peptides were sequenced directly by the dansyl-Edman method. Further degradation of the tryptic peptides purified on DEAE-cellulose with either chymotrypsin, thermolysin, pepsin or Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease was necessary to provide smaller peptides that could be sequenced by the dansyl-Edman method. S. aureus V 8 protease was particularly useful in the determination of amide residues, because of the enzyme specificity for the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid. The fourth tryptic peptide in the sequence of actinidin could not be located in the tryptic peptide elution profiles of either the Sephadex G- 50 or DEAE-cellulose columns. The sequence of this peptide was determined from a tryptic peptide obtained by digestion of maleylated carboxymethyl actinidin. The N-terminal of actinidin was determined by the dansyl Edman method, and the C-terminal by analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments, and by digestion with carboxypeptidase A. Radioactively labelling the active site cysteine residue with iodo[14 C 2]acetic acid, and subsequent purification of the radioactive tryptic digest peptide, enabled the isolation of the tryptic peptide containing the active site cysteine residue. Further digestion of this peptide with chymotrypsin and determination of the sequence of the smaller radioactive peptide provided the sequence about the active site cysteine residue. Alignment of the tryptic peptides to reconstruct the primary sequence of actinidin was accomplished with information from cyanogen bromide fragments, information from tryptic peptides of maleylated carboxymethyl actinidin, and information from the three dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure of actinidin determined by Dr E. N. Baker. The low proportion of basic residues and high proportion of acidic residues in actinidin are in agreement with the enzyme being an acidic protein. Colorimetric analysis of the tryptophan residue content, using 2 -nitrophenylsulphenyl chloride, confirmed the presence of six tryptophan residues in the sequence of actinidin. The amino acid sequences about the seven cysteine residues and the single histidine residue in actinidin were very similar to the analogous sequences in papain and other plant thiol proteases. Furthermore, comparison of the primary sequence of actinidin with that of papain, and the fragments of sequence available for other plant thiol proteases, indicated a considerable homology throughout the sequences of these proteins...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the mechanisms underlying fruit {{growth and development}} in <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (Actinidia chinensis Planch. cv. Monty), physiological and histological studies of seeded and hormone-induced parthenocarpic fruits were carried out. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Although non-pollination led to flower drop, treatments of 40 ppm KT- 30 and 500 ppm GA_ 3 at anthesis induced parthenocarpic fruits. The KT- 30 -induced seedless fruits developed into larger fruits than the seeded ones because of the active cell division and enlargement of their cells. However, some of the GA_ 3 -induced seedless fruits abscised from 8 weeks after anthesis and the others developed into very small fruits because of the inactive cell devision and small cell size. 2. Both seedless and seeded fruits followed double sigmoid growth curves and had the same growth cycles. This indicates that competition of nutrient absorption between seed {{and other parts of}} fruit is not the main factor of the intervening slow growth phase in stage Ⅱ and that fruit growth cycle in 2 ̆ 7 Monty 2 ̆ 7 is constant irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} seeds or hormonal treatments. However, fruit growth cycle in 2 ̆ 7 Monty was found to vary to some extent on account of the 2 ̆ 7 environmental conditions in the year, since fruit growth cycle varied year by year. 3. The young seeds collected from seeded fruits 3 and 4 weeks after anthesis showed very high auxin activities. Changes of auxin activities in KT- 30 -induced seedless fruits were the same as those in seeded fruits from which the seeds were removed. However, auxin activities in KT- 30 -inducecd seedless fruits were higher than those in the seeded fruits without seeds 6 and 8 weeks after anthesis. GA_ 3 -induced seedless fruits showed very low auxin activities. These results indicate that KT- 30 treatment promotes auxin synthesis in young fruits and that the auxins produced promotes cell division and enlargement of cells in the fruits. 4. Development of ventral bundle was great in seeded fruits, moderate in KT- 30 -induced seedless fruits and very slight in GA_ 3 -induced seedless fruits. These results indicate that the development of ventral bl 1 ndle is closely associated with seed development and that in the KT- 30 -induced fruits it is closely related to the transportation of metabolites such as plant hormones. Development of vascular bundle in pedicel was slightly greater in KT- 30 -induced seedless fruits than in seeded fruits, while in GA_ 3 -induced seedless fruits it was slight. 5. In regard to the quality of KT- 30 -induced seedless fruits, several problems such as morphological abnormality arose. キウイフルーツ(Actinidia chinensis Planch. cv Monty) の果実の生長と発育のメカニズムを明らかにするために,有核果とホルモンで誘起した無核果を供試して生理学的並びに組織学的な調査を行い,以下の結果を得た. 1. キウイフルーツ 2 ̆ 7 モンティ 2 ̆ 7 は無受粉では単為結果しなかったが,開花日のKT- 30 (40 ppm) とGA_ 3 (500 ppm) 処理によって単為結果した. KT- 30 で誘起した無核果は,有核果よりも細胞分裂と細胞肥大が活発で大きく肥大し,GA_ 3 で誘起した無核果は細胞分裂や細胞肥大が劣り,小果となるかまたは開花後 8 週目以後に落果した. 2. 有核果と無核果はいずれも 2 重S字型生長曲線を示し,生長周期も同じであった. このことは果肉と種子の間の栄養分競合がステージⅡにおける果実の緩慢生長の主要因ではないこと,生長周期が種子やホルモン処理の有無に関係なく一定していることを示している. しかし,果実の生長周期には年次変動が認められたことから,環境条件によって変化することが明らかになった. 3. 開花後 3 - 4 週日の若い種子は非常に高いオーキシン活性を示した. KT- 30 で誘起した無核果は,種子を取り除いた有核果と同様なオーキシン活性の変化を示したが,開花後 5 週目から 8 週目にかけてより高いオーキシン活性を示した. GA_ 3 で誘起した無核果は非常に低いオーキシン活性を示した. これらの結果から,KT- 30 処理は幼果においてオーキシン合成を促進して,細胞分裂や細胞肥大を促進していることが示唆される. 4. 腹束は有核果で最も発達し,KT- 30 で誘起した無核果においてもかなり発達したが,GA_ 3 で誘起した無核果ではほとんど発達していなかった. これらのことは,腹束の発達が特に種子の発達に関係していることを示唆するが,KT- 30 で誘起した無核果においてはホルモンなどの代謝産物の活発な移動と関係していると考えられる. 果梗の維管束は有核果と比較して,KT- 30 で誘起した無核果においてやや発達しており,GA_ 3 で誘起した無核果ではあまり発達していなかった. 5. KT- 30 で誘起した無核果の品質に関して,形態的に異常が出ることなどいくつかの間題点が見いだされた...|$|E
40|$|In 1987 and 1988, fruit {{growth and}} {{variations}} of endogenous growth hormones in <b>Chinese</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (Actinidia chinensis Planch. cv. Monty) were examined {{to demonstrate the}} fruit growth cycle {{and its relation to}} endogenous hormones. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Fruit growth measured by volume, fresh weight and dry weight followed a double sigmoid curve, and was divided into three stages; i. e., stage Ⅰ (anthsis to 8 weeks after anthesis) characterized by rapid growth of fruit and seed, stage II (8 - 14 weeks after anthesis) characterized by slow growth of fruit and rapid growth of embryo, and stage I characterized by second growth and maturing of fruit. 2. The activities of 2 auxin-like substances A Ⅰ (Rf 0. 3 - 0. 5) and A Ⅱ(Rf 0. 7 - 0. 9), 2 gibberellin-like substances GA Ⅰ (Rf 0. 2) and GA Ⅱ(Rf 0. 5 - 0. 6), Cytokinin, and ABA-like substances (probably ABA) were detected in developing fruit. 3. In stage Ⅰ, very high activities of GA Ⅰ and GA Ⅱ, and the highest activities of cytokinin and ABA were detected in fruit 1 week after anthesis, but after this time their activities decreased rapidly. The highest activities of A Ⅰ, A Ⅱ, and GA Ⅰ were detected in fruits 2, 4 and 5 weeks after anthesis respectively, but after these times their activities decreased rapidly. It is inferred from these results that in fruit just after anthesis its growth may be regulated by the combinations of GA Ⅰ, GA Ⅱ and A Ⅰ with functions to prevent abscission, Cytokinin with a function to promote cell division and ABA with a function to promote abscission, and that in fruit after this time its growth may be promoted by A Ⅰ, A Ⅱ and GA Ⅰ with functions to expand cell wall and activate cell metabolizm. 4. Since all hormones, except auxins detected just before stage Ⅰ, exhibited very low activities throughout stage Ⅱ, it is comfirmed also from these hormone levels that the intervening slow growth phase (stage Ⅱ) exists in the process of Chinesis gooseberry fruit growth. In addition, since remarkable growth of embryo and increase in dry weight of seed and fruit occured also in stage Ⅱ, another internal factors resulted in the intervenig slow growth phase are considered to be competition of nutrient absorption between fruit {{and other parts of the}} tree and, espacially, between seed and other parts of the fruit. 5. Relatively high activeties of A Ⅰ and A Ⅱ were detected just before and at the begining of Stage Ⅲ, whereas after this time they decreaced rapidly. Conversely, ABA level was low at the beginning of stage Ⅲ, Whereas it increased as the fruit becomes mature. No hoemones other than A Ⅰ, A Ⅱ and ABA were conspicuous in stage Ⅲ. It is inferred from these results that second growth of fruit in stage Ⅲ is mainly regulated by A Ⅰ and A Ⅱ with functions to expand cell wall, and that after the cessation of second growth ABA activates the metabolism related to maturation of fruit and, subsequently, promotes ripening of fruit. Another internal factor resulted in second growth of fruit is considered to be increase in intake of dry matter in the pericarp, since dry weight of fruit remarkably increase up to 19 weeks after anthesis in stage Ⅲ. 6. In stage Ⅰ, auxin levels were higher in the innerpericarp than the outerpericarp, whereas ABA level was higher in the outerpericarp than the innerpericarp. However, no differences in ABA and gibberellin levels were detected between the inner and outerpericarp during stage I and throughout the three stages respectively. Some of these results indicate that, so far as first growth is concerned, fruit growth is dependent on hormones produced by the developing seeds and the others indicate that fruit growth is dependent on hormones synthesized by the fruit flesh itself. Relationships between fruit growth cycle and endogenous hormones have been resolved to such an extent as shown in the present study. However, final clarification of growth cycle is difficult to obtain from these results until we have a picture of the mechanism of action of each class of hormone synthesized in each organ of the fruit tissue and each that synthesized in pollen tube within a pistil. 1987 年から 1988 年にかけて,キウイフルーツ 2 ̆ 7 モンティ 2 ̆ 7 の果実の生長周期と内生ホルモンの消長を調査し,以下のことが明らかになった. 1. 果実の生長は容積,新鮮重,乾物重で見た場合二重S字型生長曲線を示し,三つのステージに分けられた. ステージⅠ(開花～開花後 8 週目) は果実と種子(胚乳) の急速生長,ステージⅡ(開花後 8 週目～ 14 週目まで) は果実の緩慢生長と胚の発達,ステージⅢは果実の第 2 生長と成熟よって特徴づけられた. 2. 果実から二つのオーキシン様物質AⅠ(RfO. 3 - 0. 5) とAⅡ(RfO. 7 - 0. 9),二つのジベレリン様物質GAⅠ(Rf 0. 2) とGAI(Rf 0. 5 - 0. 6),サイトカイニン及びABA(Rf 0. 6 - 0. 8) 活性を検出した. 3. ステージIにおいて,開花後(1 週目) に高いGAⅠ･GAⅡ活性,サイトカイニン活性及びABA活性が認められ,これらの活性はその後急速に減少した. さらに, 2 週目に最も高いAⅠ活性, 4 週目に最も高いAⅡ活性, 5 週目に最も高いGAⅠ活性が認められ,これらの活性はその後急速に減少した. 以上の結果から,開花直後の果実の生長はGAⅠ･GAⅡ･AⅠによる着果促進,サイトカイニンによる細胞分裂促進,ABAによる落果促進等のホルモンバランスの上に支配されており,その後の生長はAⅠ･AⅡ･GAⅠによる細胞肥大促進によるところが大きいものと推察される. 4. ステージⅡにおいて,ステージⅢ直前のオーキシン活性を除けば,これらのホルモンレベルはすべて低い活性を示したことから,ホルモンレベルの点からもキウイフルーツ果実の生長停滞期(ステージⅡ) が存在することが確認された. また,ステージⅡにおいても胚の生長が著しく,種子と果実における乾物重増が見られることから,他の内的要因としては,栄養生長部と果実の間の養分競合や,特に,種子と果実の養分競合もこの生長停滞の原因となっているものと考えられる. 5. ステージⅢにおいて,初期に比較的に高いAⅠ･AⅡ活性が認められ,その後減少した. またABA活性は初期には低かったが,果実の成熟に伴ってしだいに高くなった. 他方,他のホルモンの活性はほとんど認められなかった. これらのことから,ステージⅢにおいて,第 2 生長は主にAⅠとAⅡによる細胞肥大促進や細胞代謝の活性化,その後はABAによる成熟に関する代謝の活性化と成熟促進によるところが大きいものと推察される. 6. ステージⅠにおいて,オーキシンレベルは外果皮より内果皮において高く,一方ABAレベルは内果皮より外果皮において高かった. しかし,ステージⅡにおけるABAレベルと 3 つのステージを通じてのGAレベルには内･外果皮による違いはみられなかった. これらの結果の一部は第 1 生長に関しては発育種子で合成されるホルモンに負うところが大きいことを,他の結果は果実の生長が果実自身で合成されたホルモンに負うところが大きいことを示唆している. 本研究では果実の生長周期と内生ホルモンの関係をある程度まで解明できたが,果実の各器官や花柱内花粉管において合成される個々のホルモンの作用機構をさらに明らかにすることにより,果実の生長周期をより明確に論じることが可能になるものと思われる...|$|E
