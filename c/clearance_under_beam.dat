25|$|The bridge {{marks the}} gateway to New York Harbor.

2500|$|The {{bridge is}} {{affected}} by weather {{more than any other}} bridge in the city because of its size and isolated location close to the open ocean; it is occasionally closed, either partially or entirely, during strong wind and snow storms. Additionally, the bridge's two towers are the tallest structures in New York City outside of Manhattan, and are taller than the tallest non-Manhattan building, the [...] One Court Square in Queens; its towers are also taller than the [...] towers of the next tallest New York bridge, the George Washington Bridge. Because of the bridge's location, cruise ships and container ships that dock in New York City must be built to accommodate the <b>clearance</b> <b>under</b> the bridge. For example, the RMS Queen Mary2 was designed with a flatter funnel to pass under the bridge, and has [...] of <b>clearance</b> <b>under</b> the bridge during high tide.|$|R

The operation principle of the BPM is based on waveguides coupling through small slots to the beam field. Tests in laboratory as well as <b>under</b> <b>beam</b> conditions have proven the functionality of the design. Ten BPMs will be in operation for the next run of the TTF FEL starting in July 2000.

50|$|Torshälla boat harbour is {{reachable}} by {{boat from}} Lake Mälaren through the river Torshällaån and is mostly used by leisure boats and tourist boats. The Eskilstunaån river, upstream of the now-defunct locks in Torshälla Canal, is only partially navigable, {{due to the}} very low <b>clearance</b> <b>under</b> the several fixed bridges which have been built over the river since the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|While most gravel {{roads are}} {{all-weather}} roads {{and can be}} used by ordinary cars, dirt roads may only be passable by trucks or four-wheel drive vehicles, especially in wet weather, or on rocky or very sandy sections.

50|$|The {{construction}} of Dedaye Bridge across Toe River started on 10 June 2000. The bridge {{is equipped with}} reinforced concrete piers, RCD bole piles and steel frame. It is 4088.3 ft long and 28 ft wide, and has six-foot-wide pedestrian lanes on both sides. The <b>clearance</b> <b>under</b> the bridge is 36 ft high and 350 ft wide. The bridge can bear 60-ton loads.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1914, it was {{reported}} that the locks would be used again by a sternwheeler, to move paving material from Portland to McMinnville for the Montague-O’Reilly Company, which had been awarded a paving contract in McMinnville.

50|$|For an {{organisation}} to {{be termed}} as charity it requires Income tax <b>clearances</b> <b>under</b> 12 A Clause of Income Tax Act. Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act defines ‘charitable purpose’ to include ‘relief of the poor, education, medical relief and {{the advancement of}} any other object of general public utility’.

50|$|On {{the lower}} {{reaches of the}} river, {{especially}} in the several impoundments behind the dams, there is significant recreational watercraft usage, both powered and sail, as well as personal water craft, although no provisions for specific <b>clearances</b> <b>under</b> bridges have been made, and the dams do not have locks, so portaging or trailered transport is required to move craft from one reach to another.|$|R

30|$|It will be {{interesting}} to compare our data with the recent work of Schneider et al. [28], in which, gold nanorods in water have been observed <b>under</b> electron <b>beam</b> irradiation.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} primary {{function}} of grant of recognition and release of financial assistance, the Central Zoo Authority also regulates the exchange of animals of endangered category Listed under Schedule-I and II of the Wildlife Protection Act) among zoos.

50|$|As {{with all}} {{stations}} on the railway, {{there is only}} one platform, {{on the north side of}} the line, and the coaches have doors on that side only. This is due to tight <b>clearances</b> <b>under</b> the bridges. There are also sidings, a water tower and coaling stage.
