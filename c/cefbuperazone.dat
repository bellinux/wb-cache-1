40|$|<b>Cefbuperazone</b> was {{compared}} with other currently available and investigational antibiotics against 278 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli by an agar dilution method. <b>Cefbuperazone</b> and cefotetan were equally active against Bacteroides fragilis, with 8 % of the organisms tested found to be resistant to 32 micrograms of either drug per ml. Cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefmetazole were less active against these strains; cefoxitin, moxalactam, piperacillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole were more active. None of the agents were consistently active against {{any of the other}} anaerobic gram-negative bacilli except imipenem, for which the minimum concentration required to inhibit 90 % of all strains tested was 4 micrograms/ml. A 10, 000 -fold increase in inoculum size caused an increase in the MIC of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone but not of <b>cefbuperazone,</b> cefotetan, or cefoxitin. Investigation of the mechanism of resistance to cephalosporin-like agents demonstrated a correlation between the level of resistance and beta-lactamase activity. <b>Cefbuperazone,</b> cefotetan, and cefoxitin were not hydrolyzed, had lower MICs, and were less affected by changes in inoculum size than were cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone...|$|E

BMY- 28142 was the most active cephalosporin against the majority of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms studied. Its spectrum of activity was very similar to that of cefotaxime. However, BMY- 28142, <b>cefbuperazone,</b> cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and moxalactam were equivalent in activity and rate of killing against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.

This paradoxical antibacterial activity was not observed with cefoperazone and <b>cefbuperazone.</b> The induction of beta-lactamase by cefmenoxime and the rate of hydrolysis of cefmenoxime in the culture broth were proportional to the initial concentration of this antibiotic. At high initial concentrations, cefmenoxime was rapidly inactivated. On the other hand, neither cefoperazone nor <b>cefbuperazone</b> was inactivated irrespective of concentration. We conclude that cefmenoxime induces beta-lactamase in P. vulgaris, perhaps accounting for its paradoxical antibacterial effect...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, <b>cefbuperazone,</b> ceftazidime, cefpimizole, flomoxef, and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30. 3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21. 6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with <b>cefbuperazone,</b> which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, cefminox, <b>cefbuperazone,</b> ceftazidime, and cefpimizole were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and <b>cefbuperazone,</b> a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and {{compared with the}} activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. Both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. All organisms except a single strain of Fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either Sch 34343 or imipenem. Overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly Lactobacillus species, Clostridium difficile, and Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. <b>Cefbuperazone</b> demonstrated only modest activity against {{a wide spectrum of}} anaerobic bacteria. It had excellent and selective activity against B. fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the B. fragilis group. Both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against C. difficile and Lactobacillus spp. Although <b>cefbuperazone</b> was more active against Bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and all Bacteroides spp. other than B. fragilis and B. vulgatus...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of inducible cephalosporinase on levels of secondarily administered beta-lactam antibiotics in exudates using experimentally infected rat granuloma pouches. Cefoperazone or cefmetazole was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight to rats at 2 and 8 h after infection of rat pouches with Serratia marcescens W- 24, which possesses an inducible type I beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase). Subsequently, cefotaxime or <b>cefbuperazone</b> was administered at an intravenous dose of 100 mg/kg to rats at 24 h postinfection. Levels of cefotaxime in the pouch exudates of the cefmetazole-pretreated group were lower {{than those in the}} control group, which was infected but not pretreated with antibiotics. This was due to the inactivation of cefotaxime by extracellular cephalosporinase which was induced by cefmetazole and which remained in the rat pouches. However, cefotaxime concentrations were not reduced in the cefoperazone-pretreated group because of the low inducibility of cefoperazone against cephalosporinase production. On the other hand, <b>cefbuperazone</b> concentrations were similar in all groups (control, cefoperazone pretreated, and cefmetazole pretreated), because <b>cefbuperazone</b> is more stable against this enzyme than cefotaxime is. In conclusion, concentrations of secondarily administered beta-lactam antibiotics are affected by inducibly produced cephalosporinase at the infection site when a good inducer like cefmetazole is administered beforehand...|$|E

Agents Chemother. 31 : 865 - 869, 1987), {{we reported}} {{that many of}} the 7 -aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, such as cefmenoxime, showed paradoxically reduced activity against Proteus vulgaris at higher concentrations, whereas these paradoxical effects were not observed for other types of cephalosporins, such as <b>cefbuperazone</b> and cefoperazone. In this study, we compare the therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime with that of <b>cefbuperazone</b> and explore the in vivo paradoxical effect of cefmenoxime by using an experimental infection model in mice. In an intraperitoneal infection with P. vulgaris 11, the survival rate with cefmenoxime was increased to 43 % at 3. 13 mg/kg but was lower at higher doses. On the other hand, <b>cefbuperazone</b> did not show such a paradoxical therapeutic effect. In mice infected with P. vulgaris 11, cefmenoxime levels in both serum and peritoneal washings were rapidly reduced and beta-lactamase activities in the peritoneal cavity were increased at higher cefmenoxime doses. These findings suggested that high levels of cefmenoxime at the infection site induced increased production of beta-lactamase, which then rapidly inactivated the antibiotic. We conclude that the paradoxical therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime against P. vulgaris occurs by the same mechanisms as the in vitro effect and that the high beta-lactamase inducibility and low beta-lactamase stability may account for the paradoxical therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime against P. vulgaris...|$|E

40|$|Suckling {{and adult}} mice were {{infected}} intragastrically with different doses of viable Listeria monocytogenes. The 50 % lethal dose for the intragastric infection was 10 (3. 7) CFU for suckling mice, while adult mice were highly resistant and the 50 % lethal dose {{was more than}} 10 (9. 3) CFU. When adult mice were infected intragastrically with 5 x 10 (8) CFU of L. monocytogenes, no mice died. However, 35 % of adult mice died when they were treated with cyclosporin A 1 day before infection. Although mice did not die when treated with an L. monocytogenes-resistant broad-spectrum cephalosporin, sodium <b>cefbuperazone,</b> before and during infection, the number of L. monocytogenes bacteria increased in the feces. The sodium <b>cefbuperazone</b> treatment of mice resulted in superinfection, i. e., a marked decrease of Escherichia coli and an increase of Enterococcus spp. in the intestines. Furthermore, host resistance against the intragastric infection markedly decreased when the mice were treated with both drugs. The growth of L. monocytogenes was augmented in the spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and feces, and the mortality of the mice was 65 %.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the inhibitory effects of 5 -fluorouracil antineoplastics, cephem antibiotics containing the methyltetrazolylthiol (MTT) group and antidiabetics on aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in vivo and in vitro. In in vivo experiments, rats were given a 100 mg/kg dose of drugs (10 mg/kg for glibenclamide) orally or intraperitoneally. When each drug was administered singly immediately after an oral administration of 1. 5 g/kg ethanol, only carmofur, an antineoplastic, produced marked increases in blood acetaldehyde concentrations. This action was also noted when ethanol was ingested 15 h after administration. The remaining drugs did not increase blood acetaldehyde concentrations. When rats were treated with carmofur at 12 h intervals for 3 consecutive days and were given 1. 5 g/kg ethanol after the final treatment, blood acetaldehyde concentrations were elevated more significantly than with a single administration of carmofur. Furthermore, daily administration of cephem antibiotics containing the MTT group, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefoperazone and <b>cefbuperazone,</b> significantly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations. Daily administration of sulfonylurea antidiabetics, chlorpropamide and acetohexamide, slightly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations.
