40|$|Adrenomedullin (AM) was {{detected}} in all tissues examined {{with the highest}} concentrations in adrenal gland, lung and <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium.</b> High concentrations of pre-proadrenomedullin mRNA were also detected in the lung, <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium,</b> adrenal gland, thoracic aorta and mesenteric artery {{for the first time}} by solution-hybridization-RNase protection assay. The molecular forms of rat AM in various tissues and plasma were also characterized by Biogel P 30 gel filtration chromatography. We found no significant difference in immunoreactive AM levels between the veins draining the kidney, the lung and the adrenal and the systemic arterial blood. The very low peptide/mRNA ratio and the AM/precursor ratio in the mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta suggest that blood vessels may be the main source of plasma AM.

40|$|Sinus node {{dysfunction}} and high-degree {{heart block}} {{are the major}} causes for electronic pacemaker implantation. Recently, genetically modified mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs, also known as "mesenchymal stem cells") were demonstrated to generate pacemaker function in vivo. However, experimental approaches typically use open thoracotomy for direct cell injection into the myocardium. Future clinical implementation, however, essentially requires development of more gentle methods to precisely and efficiently apply specified stem cells at specific cardiac locations. In a "proof of concept" study, we performed selective power-controlled radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) with eight ablation pulses (30 W, 60 seconds each) to induce heat-mediated lesions at the auricles of the <b>cardiac</b> right <b>atrium</b> of four healthy foxhounds. The next day, allogeneic MSCs (4. 3 x 10 (5) cells per kilogram of body weight) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs) were infused intravenously. Hearts were explanted 8 days later. High numbers of SPIO-labeled cells were identified in areas surrounding the RFCA-induced lesions by Prussian blue staining. Antibody staining revealed SPIO-labeled cells being positive for the typical MSC surface antigen CD 44. In contrast, low levels of calprotectin, an antigen found on monocytes and macrophages, indicated negligible infiltration of monocytes in MSC-positive areas. Thus, RFCA allows targeting of MSCs to the <b>cardiac</b> right <b>atrium,</b> adjacent to the sinoatrial node, providing an opportunity to rescue or generate pacemaker function without open thoracotomy and direct injection of MSCs. This method presents a new strategy for cardiac stem cell application leading to an efficient guidance of MSCs into the myocardium.

The level of gene expression as well as transport activities of this membrane structure is changed un-der pathological conditions like ischemic injury, myocardial infarction or diabetes. In this work we focused on the question whether the adrenergic modulation aects gene expression of the NCX in rat hearts. NCX mRNA levels were studied in the left <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> (divided into ganglionic and nonganglionic part) and also in the left ventricle of rats treated with 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in control and stressed conditions.

This eect was not altered under combined administration of 6 -OHDA and single immobilization stress. These data suggest that an activation of the adrenergic system can potentiate gene expression of the cardiac NCX...|$|E

40|$|Background. The heart can {{synthesize}} epinephrine. Homogenates of rat heart, {{which contain}} the enzymes phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and nonspecific N-methyl-transferase (NMT), methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> contains primarily PNMT and the cardiac ventricle contains both PNMT and NMT. Methods and Results. Rats {{were given the}} glucocorticoid dexamethasone at doses ranging from 0. 2 to 20 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours later, cardiac atria, ventricle, skeletal muscle, and adrenal had increases in PNMT activity {{to as much as}} 230 % 1 of baseline. NMT activity was unchanged. Longer-term treatment with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone daily for 12 days increased cardiac PNMT activity about fivefold and also increased atrial epinephrine levels. Dexamethasone did not alter ventricular epinephrine levels but increased levels of both PNMT and catechol-O-methyltrans-ferase, the major catabolic enzyme for epinephrine. After dexamethasone treatment, greater volumes of anti-PNMT antiserum were needed to decrease PNMT enzymatic activity, indicating that dexamethasone treatment resulted in greater amounts of PNMT and did not just activate existing PNMT molecules.

40|$|Background: Cerebral microcirculation after {{head injury}} is {{heterogeneous}} and temporally variable. Regions {{at risk of}} infarction such as peri-contusional areas are vulnerable to anaemia. However, direct quantification of the cerebral microcirculation is clinically not feasible. This study describes a novel experimental head injury model correlating cerebral microcirculation with histopathology analysis. Objective: To test the hypothesis that cerebral microcirculation at the ischaemic penumbrae is reduced over time when compared with non-injured regions. Methods: Merino sheep were instrumented using a transeptal catheter to inject coded microspheres into the left <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium,</b> ensuring systemic distribution. After a blunt impact over the left parietal region, cytometric analyses quantified cerebral microcirculation and amyloid precursor protein staining identified axonal injury in pre-defined anatomical regions. A mixed effect regression model assessed the hourly blood flow results during 4 hours after injury. Results: Cerebral microcirculation showed temporal reductions with minimal amyloid staining except for the ipsilateral thalamus and medulla. Conclusion: The spatial heterogeneity and temporal reduction of cerebral microcirculation in ovine models occur early, even after mild head injury, independent of the intracranial pressure {{and the level of}} haemoglobin.

40|$|THE NATRIURETIC peptide {{family of}} hormones {{contributes}} to the control of body fluid homeostasis and blood pressure regulation through their combined actions on vasculature, kidneys, and adrenal glands (1). The three bestknown members of this family are atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (2), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (3), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (4). ANP and BNP are produced predominantly by the <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> and ventricle, respectively, in response to increased atrial and ventricular transmural pressure. These two natriuretic peptides have pronounced hypotensive, diuretic, and natriuretic effects (1). Plasma levels of ANP and BNP are markedly elevated in heart failure (5) and after myocardial infarction (MI) (6), and are powerful predictors of ventricular dysfunction and mortality (7). Moreover, within heart tissue, gene expression of both ANP and BNP is reportedly up-regulated in animal models of MI and heart failure (8 – 11) and in human heart disease (12, 13). Although ANP is expressed primarily in the atria in adults, the ventricle is the major site of both ANP and BNP expression in embryos (14).

40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide is a peptide {{regulating}} {{salt and}} water balance, originally {{isolated from the}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium,</b> where it is synthesised {{as part of a}} precursor molecule in specialised myocardial cells. The myocardium extends into the extrapulmonary part of the pulmonary veins in many species, including man. In some small mammals, however, such as the rat, mouse, and bat, it extends further to veins in the peripheral parts of the lung. Since this myocardial layer is continuous with that in the atrium, we have looked for the possible expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene in this tissue in rats. Strong immunoreactivity was seen for both the peptide and the N terminal sequence (cardiodilatin) of its precursor in extrapulmonary veins and in intrapulmonary veins extending into the lung as far as the second branching point, where it was localised in the dense cored granules by electron microscopy; in situ hybridisation showed atrial natriuretic peptide messenger RNA at identical sites. Chromatography and radioimmunoassay of extracts of extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary veins showed most of the atrial natriuretic peptide immunoreactivity to be in the uncleaved (precursor molecule) form. Thus the peptide is synthesised in veins both outside and inside the lung, and these extra-atrial sites may be an important additional source of circulating atrial natriuretic peptide...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors are calcium-releasing {{channels}} localized on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. IP 3 receptors {{mediate the}} calcium mobilizing {{effect of a}} wide range of hormones, cytokines, and neurotransmitters and play an important role in variety of cell functions. The aim of this work was to study, how partial depletion of catecholamines affects the gene expression and protein levels of the type 1 IP 3 receptors in rat heart. The type 1 IP 3 receptor mRNA levels were studied in the left <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> and ventricle of rats treated with 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in control and stressed conditions. The 6 -OHDA produces anatomical and functional denervation resulting in decreased levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline. We also used corticoliberin (CRH) knockout mice, where secretion of adrenaline is significantly suppressed. Administration of 6 -OHDA significantly decreases mRNA levels of the type 1 IP 3 receptor in both, the left atrium and the left ventricle, while the gene expression of the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA 2) was unaffected. CRH knockout mice possess markedly lower levels of the type 1 IP 3 receptor mRNA compared to wild-type mice in both, control and stressed conditions.

40|$|Aims: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess isolated and combined effects of nandrolone and resistance training on the blood pressure, cardiac electrophysiology, and expression of the beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors {{in the heart of}} rats. Main methods: Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and submitted to a 6 -week treatment with nandrolone and/or resistance training. Cardiac hypertrophy was accessed by the ratio of heart weight to the final body weight. Blood pressure was determined by a computerized tail-cuff system. Electrocardiography analyses were performed. Western blotting was used to access the protein levels of the beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors in the right atrium and left ventricle. Key findings: Both resistance training and nandrolone induced cardiac hypertrophy. Nandrolone increased systolic blood pressure depending on the treatment time. Resistance training decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, as well as induced resting bradycardia. Nandrolone prolonged the QTc interval for both trained and non-trained groups when they were compared to their respective vehicle-treated one. Nandrolone increased the expression of beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors in the right atrium for both trained and non-trained groups when they were compared to their respective vehicle-treated one. Significance: This study indicated that nandrolone, associated or not with resistance training increases blood pressure depending on the treatment time, induces prolongation of the QTc interval, and increases the expression of beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors in the <b>cardiac</b> right <b>atrium,</b> but not in the left ventricle.

40|$|Background: The gene Coiled Coil Domain Containing 80 (Ccdc 80) {{is widely}} {{expressed}} in normal human tissues, at particularly high levels in heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Its role is well defined in tumor suppression, axon path finding, glucose homeostasis, bone marrow stromal cells and adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, it {{plays a role}} in embryonic development of lens and muscle, but no clear-cut data are available about the role of Ccdc 80 in heart development and in heart disease. Aims: To define if Ccdc 80 is expressed during embryonic development of zebrafish heart and if its functional block causes alterations of heart structure or contractility; to define the expression pattern of Ccdc 80 protein in normal heart vs cardiomyopathies in humans (samples taken from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy – DCM) and rodents (samples taken from right ventricle heart failure induced by monocrotaline – MCT). Results: In zebrafish Ccdc 80 is widely expressed in the forming heart, during all the developmental stages; Ccdc 80 -morphants show defects in the developing heart, with impaired <b>cardiac</b> looping, <b>atrium</b> enlargement, blood stasis and peripheral congestion. These phenotypical alterations, similar to heart failure, are due to a disorder of the late phase of cardiac development, after myocyte differentiation. In normal human and rats, Ccdc 80 mRNA, analized by Northern blot technique, showed a higher expression in atria compared to ventricles, while the Ccdc 80 protein (108 Kd), analized by Western blot, showed similar expression levels in atria and ventricles. Ccdc 80 protein showed different expression patterns, in atria and ventricles with a cytoplasmic localization and co-localization with sarcomeric proteins at immunofluorescence analysis. In pathological samples (DCM and MCT rats) Ccd 80 protein showed evident overexpression and different isoforms, related to protein phosphorylation and secreted protein isoform, suggesting a different feature in pathological conditions compared to normal. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that Ccdc 80 has an indispensable role for correct heart development.

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Answer to rhythm puzzle This {{is clearly an}} abnormal ECG for a 19 -year-old man. Initially there is sinus rhythm with a rate that is slightly under 60 beats/min. With 210 msec the PQ interval is prolonged. The QRS complex has a rightward axis and is 120 msec wide. The ST-T segments seem normal. After 2 sinus complexes a pause follows that in length roughly equals 2 × the PP interval of the previous 2 sinus complexes. The next, also long, RR interval is roughly similar in length. Thereafter sinus rhythm, slightly irregular, with 1 : 1 conduc-tion resumes during 3 complexes. As stated, the combination of findings is obviously un-usual in a 19 -year-old man. At all <b>cardiac</b> levels (<b>atrium,</b> AV node/conduction system, ventricle) conduction of the elec-trical impulse is hampered. The pauses are most likely caused by exit block out of the sinus node (i. e. SA block), another level at which conduction is hampered. And the combined findings, including the family history, suggest {{the presence of a}} loss-of-function sodium channel mutation, which was indeed found. Cardiac sodium channel function is crucial for proper conduction of the cardiac impulse at all cardiac levels and loss-of-function mutations give rise to a variety of familial syndromes, including familial conduction disease [1]. SA block is also frequently observed in this setting. In a recent rhythm puzzle [2], the ECG of the same patient, during atrial flutter, the cause of his complaints of palpitations, was presented. Also on this ECG all conduc-tion parameters were decreased leading to an unusual flutter rate and a higher than expected degree of AV block.

40|$|Summary: Nerve {{growth factor}} is a {{neurotrophic}} protein {{which is known}} to act on sympathetic and sensory neurons and on the magnocellular cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. We quantified nerve growth factor in human tissues and body fluids by two methods, a rapid and sensitive two-site immunoenzymometric assay and a bioassay using dissociated chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. The two-site immunoenzymometric assay detects nerve growth factor in concentrations as low as 0. 5 — 2. 5 ng/ 1. Using a monoclonal antibody to mouse nerve growth factor, {{we found that the}} signal of the antibody for recombinant human nerve growth factor is about 60 — 90 % of the signal for mouse nerve growth factor. As a control for the specificity of our data, a bioassay for nerve growth factor was performed and the results showed a good correlation.

Marcel Deckker, New York (1989). ] Resistively coupled cell pairs show five regimes of behavior as a function of coupling conductance: (1) independent oscillation for G, < 1 pS; (2) primarily quasiperiodic oscillation for 1 = G, < 116 pS; (3) windows of periodic behavior which undergo period doubling bifurcation to chaos for 116 6 G, < 212 pS; (4) frequency entrainment for G, 2 212 pS; (5) waveform entrainment for G, 3 50 nS.

A biophysically detailed two-dimensional network model of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> has also been implemented on the CM- 5 supercomputer. The model is used to study effects of spatially localized inhibition of the Na-K pump. Na overloading produced by pump inhibition can induce spontaneous, propagating ectopic beats within the network.

Four of the channels, RK 1 to RK 4, are similar or identical to Shaker-like K+ channels previously identified in rat brain cDNA libraries. Major differences among RK 1 to RK 4 {{exist in the}} amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions and in amino acids representing potential extracellular sequence between the S 1 and S 2 hydrophobic domains. RK 5 encodes a unique channel of 490 amino acids having six hydrophobic domains but only five basic residues in the putative voltage-sensing domain.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were first to analyze neurocognitive {{outcomes}} of patients after open-chamber cardiac surgery to determine whether carbon dioxide pericardial insufflation reduces incidence of neurocognitive decline (primary end point) as measured 6 weeks postoperatively and second to assess the utility of carbon dioxide insufflation in cardiac chamber deairing as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography. MethodsA multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial compared neurocognitive outcomes in patients undergoing open-chamber (left-sided) cardiac surgery who were assigned carbon dioxide insufflation or placebo (control group) in addition to standardized mechanical deairing maneuvers. ResultsOne hundred twenty-five patients underwent surgery and were randomly allocated. Neurocognitive testing showed no clinically significant differences in z scores between preoperative and postoperative testing. Linear regression was used to identify factors associated with neurocognitive decline. Factors most strongly associated with neurocognitive decline were hypercholesterolemia, aortic atheroma grade, and coronary artery disease. There was significantly more intracardiac gas noted on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in all <b>cardiac</b> chambers (left <b>atrium,</b> left ventricle, and aorta) at all measured times (after crossclamp removal, during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and at declaration of adequate deairing by the anesthetist) in the control group than in the carbon dioxide group (P < . 04).

Results: The early and late surgical mortalities, all unrelated to thromboembolism, were 10. 8 % (11 / 102) and 5. 8 % (6 / 104), respectively. Of the 85 survivors, 46 (54 %) were maintained on long-term warfarin therapy, 8 (9 %) on aspirin prophylaxis while 31 (37 %) were not on chronic anticoagulation. Four (4. 5 %) patients, two with and two without warfarin prophylaxis, developed thromboembolic complications at 0. 14 to 7. 7 years after the Fontan procedure (0. 74 %/patient-year). Three had a grossly dilated right atrium after atriopulmonary connection, two of whom had atrial fenestrations. The other had atrial tachycardia. Freedom from development of thromboembolic complications (mean±S. E.) at 1, 5 and 10 years after surgery was 97 ± 19 %, 96 ± 2. 5 % and 92 ± 4. 2 %, respectively. When compared with those on long-term warfarin therapy, patients without chronic anticoagulation were followed-up longer (p= 0. 001), {{more likely to have}} undergone atriopulmonary connection (p< 0. 001), less likely to have fenestrations (p= 0. 02) and cardiac arrhythmias (p= 0. 02) but not predisposed to increased risk of thromboembolism (p= 1. 00). Conclusion: The study supports the contention that chronic anticoagulation may not be required for majority of ethnic Chinese Fontan patients. Nonetheless, it may perhaps be considered in those with grossly dilated right <b>atrium,</b> <b>cardiac</b> arrhythmias and residual right-to-left shunts. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Atrial brillation is an {{important}} cardiovascular disease causing <b>cardiac</b> malfunction. Theleft <b>atrium</b> and pulmonary veins are the structures most a ected. Radio-frequency catheterablation {{has now become a}} standard procedure for correcting atrial brillation. The procedureis minimally invasive and pre-planning the procedure is essential. It is normally required toimage the atrium. Segmentation of the left atrium and pulmonary veins from medical imagesis {{an important}} problem and a necessary step for further analysing the left atrium. This dissertation describes techniques for segmenting the left atrium from MR angiographyimages. It also describes methods for extracting sub-atrial structures of the atrium such as thecentral atrial body and pulmonary veins. As pulmonary veins of the left atrium have complexvessel networks, the centrelines of these vessels are extracted allowing for better visualisationand compact representation. Furthermore, the dissertation describes a framework for analysingthe atrium. The pulmonary drainage trees are reconstructed using graph structures. Importantatrial characteristics relevant to catheter ablation procedures are quanti ed. These includeatrial anatomy and ostial diameters. The methods described in the dissertation are evaluated on real patient datasets and comparedagainst manual approaches. A comparative study of the proposed left atrium segmentationalgorithm with an existing approach showed that the proposed approach yields better segmentations. Furthermore, results show that the proposed techniques for pulmonary drainagereconstruction correctly compute and classify atrial anatomy in the majority of cases. Thecomputation of ostial diameters also show close agreement with gold-standard measurements. A series of studies performed to investigate the e ect of user parameters on the quality ofisegmentation and measurements obtained show reproducibility of results. It is envisaged thatthe methods proposed will improve the e cacy of catheter ablation by providing useful andaccurate atrial characteristics and information.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were twofold: (1) to {{determine}} the in vivo dose-response relationship in the conscious, unstressed rat between the plasma insulin concentration and total body glucose uptake, and between plasma insulin and suppression of endogenous glucose production; and (2) to develop a physiologic compartmental model to describe the kinetics of plasma glucose in the rat in the basal state. In order to perform repeat insulin clamp studies in the same rat, chronic catheters were implanted in the aortic arch (via the carotid artery) and in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> (via the jugular vein), exteriorized, and fixed {{to the back of the}} skull with a dental cement cap. Insulin was infused at rates of 1. 2, 2. 4, 4. 8, 12, and 24 mU/min. kg, and the plasma glucose was held constant at the basal level by a variable glucose infusion (euglycemic insulin clamp). The resulting steady-state plasma insulin concentrations ranged from 40 to 1, 300 microU/mL. The dose-response curve for glucose uptake was sigmoidal in shape: in the basal state, total glucose utilization averaged 6. 8 mg/min. kg at an insulin concentration of 9 microU/mL, half-maximal glucose uptake (18. 3 mg/kg. min) occurred at a plasma insulin concentration between 70 and 80 microU/mL, and maximal uptake (36. 6 mg/kg. min) was seen at an insulin level in excess of 100 microU/mL. Residual endogenous glucose production was evaluated by a prime-continuous infusion of (3 - 3 H) -glucose. The dose-response curve for suppression of endogenous glucose output also was sigmoidal...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of the new third-generation cephalosporin, ceftizoxime, into extravascular fluid was determined in a rabbit model using four subcutaneous Visking chambers per rabbit. Ceftizoxime was given im at a dosage of 50 mg/kg every 3 h for 8 doses. Serum peak level was 52 - 4 mg/ 1 and Visking chamber peak was 20 - 7 mg/ 1 after the first dose and 28 - 2 mg/ 1 after the eighth dose. Chamber area under the curve (AUC) was 44 % of serum AUC after the first dose and 79 - 4 % of serum AUC after the eighth dose. Ceftizoxime data from tissue and body fluid penetration studies in humans were reviewed and compared with similar studies of other third-generation /Mactams and cefazolin. Ceftizoxime concentrations in fluid-filled spaces (pleural fluid, ascites, amniotic fluid), secretory fluids (bile, sputum), and body tissues (prostate, uterus, gallbladder, <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium,</b> bone) were usually well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of susceptible pathogens. Mean levels in prostatic fluid and aqueous humour were between 1 and 2 mg/ 1 after a single 1 g dose, {{which is likely to}} be adequate for some but not all potential pathogens. Mean levels in breast milk and uninflamed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were below 0 - 5 mg/ 1 after single doses of 1 and 2 g respectively, whereas inflamed CSF contained a mean concentration above 3 - 5 mg/ 1 after multiple doses of 30 mg/kg. In comparison with cefotaxime, the only other third-generation cephalosporin comparably studied to date, ceftizoxime generally achieved higher extravascular levels when the same dosage was given...|$|E
40|$|Many cell {{signalling}} pathways {{are driven by}} changes in cytosolic calcium. We studied {{the effects of a}} range of inhibitors of connexin channels on calcium signalling in cardiac cells and HeLa cells expressing connexins. Gap 26 and 27, peptides that mimic short sequences in each of the extracellular loops of connexin 43, and anti-peptide antibodies generated to extracellular loop sequences of connexins, inhibited calcium oscillations in neonatal cardiac myocytes, as well as calcium transients induced by ATP in HL- 1 cells originating from <b>cardiac</b> <b>atrium</b> and HeLa cells expressing connexin 43 or 26. Comparison of single with confluent cells showed that intracellular calcium responses were suppressed by interaction of connexin mimetic peptides and antibodies with hemichannels present on unapposed regions of the plasma membrane. To investigate how inhibition of hemichannels in the plasma membrane by the applied reagents was communicated to calcium store operation in the endoplasmic reticulum, we studied the effect of Gap 26 on calcium entry into cells and on intracellular IP 3 release; both were inhibited by Gap 26. Calcium transients in both connexin 43 - and connexin 26 -expressing HeLa cells were inhibited by the peptides suggesting that the extended cytoplasmic carboxyl tail domain of larger connexins and their interactions with intracellular scaffolding/auxiliary proteins were unlikely to feature in transmitting peptide-induced perturbations at hemichannels in the plasma membrane to IP 3 receptor channel central to calcium signalling. The results suggest that calcium levels in a microenvironment functionally connecting plasma membrane connexin hemichannels to downstream IP 3 -dependent calcium release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum were disrupted by the connexin mimetic peptide, although implication of other candidate hemichannels cannot be entirely discounted. Since calcium signalling is fundamental to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, connexin hemichannels emerge as therapeutic targets open to manipulation by reagents interacting with external regions of these channels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: S-nitrosocysteine is {{a carrier}} form of nitric oxide {{that can be}} {{delivered}} intravenously. S-nitrosocysteine is rapidly metabolized by plasma (half-life = 2 - 3 seconds), forming nitric oxide and cysteine. With its short half-life and potent vasodilatory properties, S-nitrosocysteine may be useful as a pulmonary vasodilating agent in cases of postoperative and chronic pulmonary hypertension. Objective: Our objective {{was to determine the}} hemodynamic properties of S-nitrosocysteine on the pulmonary and systemic circulations to assess its potential utility as a pulmonary vasodilatory agent. Methods: Eleven adult swine were anesthetized. Thermodilution (Swan-Ganz; Baxter International, Inc, Deerfield, Ill) and arterial catheters were inserted. Flow probes were placed around the coronary, renal, superior mesenteric, and iliac arteries. Incremental infusion doses of S-nitrosocysteine (5 - 80 nmol · kg– 1 · min– 1) were delivered into the right <b>atrium.</b> <b>Cardiac</b> output, right and left heart pressures, heart rate, Pao 2, and iliac, renal, coronary, and mesenteric blood flow rates were recorded at baseline and at each infusion dose of S-nitrosocysteine. Results: Low-dose S-nitrosocysteine infusion decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (15 %, P =. 013) without a significant reduction in mean systemic artery pressure. Higher dose infusions produced further dose-dependent declines in pulmonary vascular resistance and measurable reductions in systemic vascular resistance (P =. 01). At an S-nitrosocysteine dosage of 40 nmol · kg– 1 · min– 1, there was a significant reduction in renal (P. 2) or coronary (P >. 2) blood flow. Cardiac output remained constant up to infusion rates of 40 nmol · kg– 1 · min– 1 (P >. 2). Doses higher than 5 nmol · kg– 1 · min– 1 resulted in a substantial dose-dependent reduction in Pao 2 (P <. 001), suggesting dilation of atelectatic areas of the lung. Conclusion: S-nitrosocysteine is a potent vasodilatory agent capable of overcoming the hypoxic vasoconstrictive response of the lung. Our results suggest it may prove useful as a pulmonary vasodilatory agent at low doses. Higher dose infusions reduce mean systemic pressure and lead to compensatory reductions in renal and mesenteric blood flow without a decrease in cardiac output.

40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} N, N-bis(phenyl-carbamoylmethyl) dimethylammonium {{chloride}} (QX- 572) in man were studied. A controlled study {{was performed to}} rule out a possible influence of the catheterization procedure as such on the results. Ten patients with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation were studied: based on clinical data the patients were divided into 2 groups of 5. Randomly {{it was decided that}} one group should constitute a control group receiving saline while the second group received QX- 572, MG/KG BODY WEIGHT. In both groups the administration was performed as a slow intravenous infusion during 30 minutes. Heart rate, pressures in brachial artery and right <b>atrium,</b> <b>cardiac</b> output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance were determined before, during, and up to 30 minutes after completion of placebo or QX- 572. These variable remained stable in the control group while QX- 572 produced an increase in heart rate most pronounced {{at the end of the}} infusion period. A transient decrease in systolic and mean brachial artery pressure during the infusion, and during the same period a decrease in right atrial pressure. Cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were unchanged by QX- 572 but they were not measured during the infusion when the changes in pressures were most pronounced. QX- 572 was thought to act as a peripheral vasodilator during the infusion. Left ventricular contractility was studied by means of pressure curves obtained from a catheter tip manometer placed in the left ventricle. The first derivative of the isovolumic left ventricular pressure at the highest level (45 mmHg) common to all patients was used (dp/dt- 45). No significant difference could be observed when comparing mean changes of dp/dt- 45 for the two groups. In the control group there was a slight but significant increase in dp/dt- 45 during the time of observation. In the QX- 572 group the results varied between individuals. Two of the patients differed from all other patients in the control and QX- 572 groups showing a decrease in dp/dt- 45 which, when most pronounced at the end of the infusion period, was - 31 and - 28 per cent of the preinfusion levels, respectively. This decrease probably reflects reduction of contractility. It was concluded that QX- 572 in a dose of 8 mg/kg body weight did not have any major haemodynamic drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of equipotent {{isoflurane}} and halothane anaesthesia. Six adult horses were investigated on two separate occasions at least 4 weeks apart. On both occasions anaesthesia was induced by ketamine 2. 2 mg/kg bwt given 5 min after i. v. administration 100 microg/kg bwt romifidine. Anaesthesia was maintained either by halothane or isoflurane (end-tidal concentrations 0. 9 - 1. 0 % and 1. 3 - 1. 4 %, respectively). Horses were ventilated by intermittent positive pressure to maintain PaCO 2 between 40 - 50 mmHg. Haemodynamic variables were measured using catheter-mounted strain gauge transducers in the left and right ventricle, aorta, and right <b>atrium.</b> <b>Cardiac</b> output (CO), velocity time integral (VTI), maximal aortic blood flow velocity (Vmax) and acceleration (dv/dt(max)), left ventricular pre-ejection period (PEP) and ejection time (ET) were measured from aortic blood flow velocity waveforms obtained by transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography. Flow velocity waveforms were recorded from the femoral arteries and veins using low pulse repetition frequency Doppler ultrasound. Time-averaged mean velocity (TAV), velocity of component a (TaVa), velocity of component b (TaVb) and early diastolic deceleration slope (EDDS) were measured. Pulsatility index (PI) and volumetric flow were calculated. Microvascular blood flow was measured in the left and right semimembranosus muscles by laser Doppler flowmetry. Maximal rate of rise of LV pressure (LVdp/dt(max)), CO, Vmax, dv/dt(max), ET, VTI were significantly higher at all time points during isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane anaesthesia. Pre-ejection period and diastolic aortic blood pressure were significantly less throughout isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane. Isoflurane anaesthesia was associated with significantly lower systemic vascular resistance than halothane anaesthesia. Femoral arterial and venous blood flow were significantly higher and EDDS and PI were significantly lower during isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane anaesthesia. In addition during both halothane and isoflurane anaesthesia, femoral arterial flow was higher and EDDS and PI lower in the left (dependent) artery compared to the right (nondependent) artery. This study supports previous work demonstrating improved left ventricular systolic function during isoflurane compared to halothane anaesthesia. This improvement was still evident after premedication with a potent-long acting alpha 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, romifidine, and induction of anaesthesia with ketamine. There was also evidence of increased hindlimb blood flow during isoflurane anaesthesia. However, there were differences observed in flow between the left and right hindlimb during maintenance of anaesthesia with each agent, suggesting that there were differences in regional perfusion in anaesthetised horses caused by factors unrelated to agents administeredPeer reviewe...|$|R
