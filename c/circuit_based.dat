5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed.

As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement.

25|$|When Harlan {{began his}} service, the Supreme Court faced a heavy {{workload}} that consisted primarily {{of diversity and}} removal cases, {{with only a few}} constitutional issues. Justices also rode circuit in the various federal judicial circuits; though these usually corresponded to the region from which the justice was appointed, due to his junior status, Harlan was assigned the Seventh <b>Circuit</b> <b>based</b> in Chicago. Harlan rode the Seventh Circuit until 1896, when he switched to his home circuit, the Sixth, upon the death of its previous holder, Justice Howell Edmunds Jackson.|$|E
25|$|One {{younger brother}} was Naval aviator and Polar {{explorer}} Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd (1888-1957). His other younger brother, Thomas Bolling Byrd (1890-1968) became an infantry captain during World War I. His uncle Henry De La Warr Flood {{served in the}} House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress from Appomattox County, Virginia, (1901 to 1921).

2500|$|Like Wilko, it {{had been}} appealed from the Second Circuit, where William Timbers, who had argued before the Court for the SEC as amicus in Wilko, wrote for a panel that {{reversed}} the district court's holding that the 1934 Act claims were arbitrable. He allowed that the Allegaert precedent he upheld might not survive higher review. [...] "Although Scherk and Byrd may cast some doubt on whether the Supreme Court, if presented with the issue, would hold claims under [...] to be non-arbitrable, it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this <b>Circuit</b> <b>based</b> on mere speculation." ...|$|E
2500|$|It took a {{year from}} Byrd {{for one of the}} {{circuits}} to consider one of these cases. In McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, the Second Circuit followed the Supreme Court in ordering state-law claims arbitrated and the federal ones litigated. It believed that public policy and precedent were on the side of resolving the latter judicially. [...] "Although Scherk and Byrd may cast some doubt on whether the Supreme Court, if presented with the issue, would hold [...] claims ... to be non-arbitrable," [...] wrote William Homer Timbers, [...] "it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this <b>Circuit</b> <b>based</b> on mere speculation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shearson {{had asked}} the court to {{overrule}} those precedents in its briefs and arguments, citing White's Byrd concurrence, but Timbers demurred. While he allowed that the Supreme Court might accept that argument, [...] "it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this <b>Circuit</b> <b>based</b> on mere speculation," [...] he wrote. [...] "We think that the orderly administration of justice will be best served if we as one of the inferior courts follow Supreme Court precedent and adhere to the settled law of this Circuit, and a fortiori the district courts should do likewise." [...] At the end of his opinion he said in a footnote {{that it would have been}} easier to decide the issue if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had submitted an amicus curiae brief giving its perspective on arbitration.|$|E

This type of circuits requires a rather long time of simulation and large simulator memory. Therefore, we developed a method of hybrid simulation so as to find a response to these shortcomings. We conceived a non-linear electromechanic model for the used MEMS, in order to simulate the intermodulation of the Tchebychev filter that was made. Then, we present the steps followed to conceive and optimize a metamaterial <b>circuit</b> <b>base</b> on MEMS RF varactors.
