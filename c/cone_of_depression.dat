50|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> also can be {{affected}} when the cone intersects a source of water, such as a lake or stream. In such cases, water from the lake or stream supplies water to the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and therefore the cone will not expand as far in this direction. Conversely, if the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> contacts a barrier, such as massive bedrock ridge, a clay body, or {{the edge of the}} aquifer, the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> will decline to greater depths in order to supply water to the well.|$|E
50|$|We {{typically}} {{think of}} a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> as being a circular feature surrounding the pumped well. However, aquifer characteristics can affect {{the shape of the}} <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> For example, if there is a steep ground-water gradient in the area of pumpage, the cone will tend to be shorter in the upgradient direction and elongated in the downgradient direction. This is because the water is already flowing towards the well from the upgradient direction, so the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> doesn’t need to extend as far out to obtain water, whereas the water is flowing away from the well in the downgradient direction, so the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> needs to reach further to obtain water.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{occurs in}} an aquifer when {{groundwater}} is pumped from a well. In an unconfined aquifer (water table), {{this is an}} actual depression of the water levels. In confined aquifers (artesian), the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> is {{a reduction in the}} pressure head surrounding the pumped well.|$|E
50|$|Water levels or {{pressures}} can be contoured {{similar to}} elevation on topographic maps. Contour maps often show “bulls-eyes” around pumped wells {{that represent the}} <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> In huge municipal wells, these <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> often can extend many miles from the pumped well. For many domestic wells, the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> often {{are too small to}} even show up on such maps.

30|$|The {{equipotential}} {{lines of}} {{the central part of}} MAIWF as shown in Fig.  8 are curved in an open trench with flow from all directions especially in the area of Gabal El-Hadid City (Fig.  8). This may be attributed to the concentration of wells in these parts with heavy uncontrolled pumping (more than 1, 200 production wells). This open trench with flow from all directions appears at all time intervals related to the three proposed scenarios. But it divides into <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> as a result of heavy pumping (Fig.  8). These <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> change the general groundwater flow direction from east–west to local flow direction of SW–NE as mentioned before.|$|R
50|$|Groundwater pumping {{has altered}} {{historical}} groundwater {{flow in the}} Sankoty aquifer. The flat geography of the area leads to groundwater flows that are perpendicular to the Illinois River, however municipal groundwater pumping in the Peoria, Illinois area {{and to a lesser}} degree agricultural pumping elsewhere over the aquifer has led to numerous <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} shape (slope) of the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> depends on many factors. The pumping rate in the well will affect {{the size of the}} cone. Also, the type of aquifer material, such as whether the aquifer is , sand, silt, {{fractured}} rocks, karst, etc., also will affect how far the cone extends. The amount of water in storage and the thickness of the aquifer also will determine the {{size and shape}} of the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cones of {{depression}} {{can be very}} useful when dealing with contaminant plumes in ground water. Often, a well can be placed near a contaminant plume and pumped at a sufficient rate to create a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> This <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> can act to capture the contaminant flow (essentially pulling {{it out of the}} aquifer). The pumped water can then be treated. The use of capture wells has been helpful in protecting water supply wells and for isolating contaminants near spills, landfills, and other sources.|$|E
50|$|Aquifers {{are also}} an {{important}} source for the groundwater that feeds into wells. The groundwater must go through these aquifers {{to get to the}} well. However, the well has an effect on the aquifers as well. Pumping through much water through these wells can cause a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> around the well.|$|E

This study intends to simulate the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in the shallow aquifer across the entire NCP during the whole period from 1960 to 2011. During the simulation, the dominant role of anthropogenic activities is emphasized and carefully taken into account using a Neural Network Algorithm.

50|$|As a well is pumped, the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{will extend}} out and will {{continue}} to expand in a radial fashion until a point of equilibrium occurs. This usually is when the amount of water released from storage equals the rate of pumping. This also can occur when recharge to the aquifer equals the amount of water being pumped.|$|E
50|$|As {{the water}} {{flows into the}} well, the water levels or {{pressure}} in the aquifer around the well decrease. The amount of this decline becomes less with distance from the well, resulting in a cone-shaped depression radiating away from the well.

5000|$|A {{deep well}} {{typically}} {{consists of a}} borehole fitted with a slotted liner and an electric submersible pump.

Deep wells work best in soils with a permeability of k = [...] m/s to [...] m/s; the amount of drawdown that a well can achieve is limited only by the size of the fish pump.|$|E
30|$|It {{is obvious}} that the {{pressure}} profile for the optimum alternative is smoother than for the «actual» one. In this case, the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> production wells are smaller and, as a result, they work for a longer time at the final stage of reservoir development. The range of pressure differential in the whole reservoir is less and the pressure over the most area of the reservoir is higher for the optimum alternative than for «actual» one (see Fig.  7). The optimization of reservoir development thus leads to the pressure equalizing inside the area and, as a result, to the stabilization of recharge area of each well.|$|R

30|$|The {{groundwater}} flow direction is directed mainly from south to north direction (regional flow) with low hydraulic gradient. An opposite flow direction is observed {{from north to}} south direction where Ismailia canal represents the main recharging source for the Quaternary aquifer. The predicted {{groundwater flow}} direction based on the model result shows to concentric directions in case <b>of</b> the resulted <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> in the low eastern areas and in the cultivated areas north the 10 th of Ramadan city. As a result of high discharge, there are two <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in the northeast and west direction and still increase over 10, 20, 30  years. In addition, the water table contours (equipotential lines) show a general trend more or less parallel to the Ismailia canal. Moreover, their latitudes decrease as they go far from it. This indicates that Ismailia canal represents a recharge front for the Quaternary deposits, and it is considered the main factor of recharge as same as a Suez freshwater canal. The groundwater levels in this area are always lower than the surface water level in Ismailia canal and other irrigation canal, indicating influent conditions around the eastern drainage natural systems. On the other hand, it is noticed that the northeastern areas are appearing as an open trench with flow from all directions towards the central low-lying areas due to the concentration of wells in these parts with heavy uncontrolled flow. Far from the over-pumping locations, the contour line configuration is almost without notable changes.|$|R
50|$|When two cones of {{depression}} intersect one another, {{they tend to}} have a combined effect on drawdown and result in water levels or pressures much lower than a single <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> would produce. This can be an important consideration when planning well placement and pumping rates. In the case of water supply wells, whether for domestic use or irrigation, wells typically are placed far enough apart in order to avoid intersecting cones {{of depression}}. This way, drawdown in the aquifer is minimized. However, in the case of dewatering for mines and landfills where the goal is to lower water levels and pressures, wells often are placed close together in order to reduce head in the aquifer to the maximum amount.|$|E

Since the late 1960s, saline water intrusion has been evident along the coastal areas of Metro Manila, stretching from Las Pinas to Malabon.

According to a joint study by MWSS and JICA in 1991, most groundwater samples from Metro Manila’s coastal areas were salinized. However, compared to the early 1980s, saline intrusion was found to have improved conditions because of the conversion of water source from groundwater to surface water upon the completion of the Manila Water Supply Project II in 1987. Aside from excessive withdrawal of groundwater, seepage of brackish water along the Pasig River is another cause of saltwater intrusion because of seawater movement during tides.|$|R

In Florida, sinkholes are mainly classified as cover subsidence sinkholes that result in a gradual collapse with possible surface signs, and cover collapse sinkholes, which collapse in a sudden and often catastrophic manner. The future development of a reliable sinkhole prediction system will have the potential to minimize the risk to life, and reduce delays in construction due to the need for post-collapse remediation. In this study, different versions of small-scale sinkhole physical models experimentally used to monitor the water levels in a network of wells. This information is then used in a spatial-temporal analysis model to study the behavior of the system until the sinkhole collapses. The ultimate goal is to use this process in a reverse manner to monitor an existing network of installed groundwater wells to study the fluctuations in the water levels and use the spatial-temporal analysis to predict potential sinkhole collapses. The groundwater levels are monitored using sensors that are hooked up to a high-resolution data acquisition system.

40|$|The aquifer test, {{involving}} a production well and several observation wells near a stream, {{is one of}} the effects of induced streambed infiltration on water levels in aquifers. In presently available analytical treatments of flow problems associated with induced infiltration, recharge by the influent seepage of surface water is commonly simulated by use of a hypothetical image well. The assumption is made that water levels in the aquifer will behave the same whether recharge occurs over an area or through an image well. Electric analog computers, in which the streambed is simulated as an area of recharge in accordance with natural conditions instead of as a recharging image well, were used to appraise the accuracy of estimated effects of induced infiltration on water levels based on the image well theory. Electric analog computers for two aquifer test sites for which field data are available were constructed. The selected aquifer tests involve the two extreme aquifer-stream situations, i. e. the case where the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> spreads beneath and beyond the entire streambed and the case where the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> spreads only part way beneath the streambed. The analog computers consist of analog models and excitation-response apparatus. The analog models are regular arrays of resistors and capacitors and are scaled-down versions of aquifer-stream situations. The excitation-response apparatus consists of a power supply, waveform generator, pulse generator and an oscilloscope. It is concluded that, during induced infiltration aquifer tests, the image-well theory closely describes drawdowns on the land sides of streams {{with a high degree of}} accuracy whether the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> spreads beneath and beyond or only part way beneath the streambed. Drawdowns beneath or beyond the streambed and the streambed areas of infiltration based on the image-well theory are not those which are observed in the field.

A three-dimensional model with 5437 elements and seven layers based on the geological and geothermal data was built using the AQUA 3 D package designed for solving flow and heat transport problems. Production history of forty five wells and pressure monitoring data from six wells were used for calibration. The calibrated model was then used to predict the geothermal system response of the geothermal field.
