30|$|The DoE {{was done}} under three {{different}} illumination conditions: dark, light and dark/light cycle (16 : 8  h), respectively. The results obtained showed both dark/light cycle and <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> were suitable for PHB accumulation.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} we studied some behavioral and immunological parameters of adult gastropod mollusk, Biomphalaria tenagophila, which have been reproducing for several generations under laboratory conditions. One group of gastropods was kept on a 14 -h light/ 10 -h dark cycle, corresponding to a regular circadian cycle, and another group was exposed to continuous light for 48 h. Animals were studied along (behavioral groups) or immediately after (immunological groups) 48 h of regular circadian cycle or continuous light conditions. Stopping/floating, dragging and sliding were the behavioral aspects considered (N = 20 for regular cycle; N = 20 for <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination)</b> and number of hemocytes/µl hemolymph was the immunological parameter studied (N = 15 for regular cycle, N = 14 for <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination).</b> Animals under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> were more active (sliding = 33 episodes, dragging = 48 episodes) and displayed a lower number of hemocytes (78. 0 ± 24. 27 /µl) when compared with mollusks kept on a regular circadian cycle (sliding = 18 episodes, dragging = 27 episodes; hemocytes = 157. 6 ± 53. 27 /µl).

40|$|To {{reduce the}} level of CO 2 content in air, effort on {{converting}} CO 2 to useful products is required. One of the alternatives includes CO 2 fixation to produce biomass using Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg. Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg is applied for production of food supplement. Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg is also easy to handle due to its superior adaptation. Currently, Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg has been analyzed by some experts for its cellular composition, its ability to produce high quality biomass {{and the content of}} essential nutrition. A series of experiments was conducted by culturing Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg using Beneck medium in bubbling column photobioreactor. The main variation in this experiment was photoperiodicity, where growth of Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg was examined during photoperiodicity condition. The difference between CO 2 gas concentration of inlet and outlet of the reactor during operational period, was compared to the same experiment under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> Under photoperiodicity of 8 and 9 h/d, the culture cell densities (N) were approximately 40 % higher than under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> Final biomass density of Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg at 9 h/d illumination was 1. 43 g/dm 3, around 46 % higher than under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> Specific carbon dioxide transfer rate (qCO 2) in photoperiodicity was 50 - 80 % higher than under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> These experiments showed that photoperiodicity affects the growth of Chlorella vulgaris Buitenzorg The specific growth rate (μ) by photoperiodicity was higher than that by continuous ilumination while the growth period was two times longer. Based on the experiments, it can be concluded that photoperiodicity might save light energy consumption. The prediction of kinetic model under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> as well as under photoperiodicity illumination showed that Haldane model became the fitted kinetic model...|$|R

40|$|Platymonas subcordiformiswas {{found to}} produce {{hydrogen}} via photolysis of seawater (Guan et al., 2004). In {{order to improve}} hydrogen production, the effect of light-dark-light treatment on the duration and yield of hydrogen evolutionwas investigated in the process reg ulated by CCCP. CCCPwas found to inhibit the photosystem II (PS II) activity, therefore creating an anaerobic environment essential for the onset of hydrogen evolution (Ran et al., 2006). In our system, a fuel-cell operated by hydrogenwas integrated into the photobioreactor for both on-line monitoring of the rate of hydrogen evolution and the reduction of potential hydrogen feedback inhibition by consuming hydrogen in situ. During the first 15 h of hydrogen evolution stage, a period of dark treatment followed the initial light illumination with three testing regimes (9 h/ 6 h; 6 h/ 9 h; 3 h/ 12 h) were investigated, with <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> as the control. After the dark treatment, all the cultures were subjected to <b>continuous</b> light <b>illumination</b> until the hydrogen evolution stopped. Three peaks of hydrogen evolution rate were found under all three lightdark- light treatments, in contrast to only one peak rate observed under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> In addition, hydrogen production duration was extended from 40 h under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> to 120 h. The highest hydrogen yield of 78 ml/l achieved using a light-dark-light treatment of 9 h/ 6 h/ to the end,was {{similar to that of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> These results indicate that the diurnal alternation of solar energy may be suitable for hydrogen production by marine green algae without sacrificing hydrogen yield, and that artificial night-time illumination may be unnecessary to total cell productivity. 中国科学院,中国工程院,中国教育部,中国科技部,中国国家发改...|$|R

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of microalgae under different light conditions (continuous or intermittent) are essential information for photobioreactor design and operation. In this study, we constructed a thin-layer (10 mm) flat plate photobioreactor device with a light/dark (L/D) alternation system {{to investigate the}} growth of Spirulina platensis under two different light regimes: (1) <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> {{in a wide range}} of light intensities (1. 00 - 77. 16 mW cm(- 2)); (2) intermittent illumination in medium frequency (0. 01 - 20 Hz). Specific growth rate and light efficiency based on biomass production were determined for each round of experiment. Four regions (light limited region, intermediate region, light saturated region and light inhibition region) were recognized according to the results under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination.</b> Under intermittent illumination, when L/D frequency increased from 0. 01 Hz to 20 Hz, specific growth rate and light efficiency were enhanced. However, the enhancement was different, depending on the applied light intensity and light fraction.

Under <b>continuous</b> <b>illumination</b> the long-lived state can be accumulated, leading to close to full conversion of the reaction centers into this state. The lifetime of this accumulated state varies from a few minutes {{up to more than}} 20 min, and depends on the illumination history. Surprisingly, the lifetime and quantum yield do not depend on the presence of the secondary quinone, QB. Under oxygen-free conditions the accumulation was reversible, no changes in the normal recombination times were observed due to the intense illumination. The long-lived state is responsible for most of the dark adaptation and hysteresis effects observed in room temperature experiments.
