60|$|Theseus first {{fastened}} {{one end of}} his coil {{of string}} to a pointed rock, {{and then began to}} look about him. The labyrinth was dark, and he slowly walked, holding the string, down the broadest path, from which others turned off to right or left. He counted his steps, and he had taken near three thousand steps when he saw the pale sky showing in a small <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> in the rocky roof, above his head, and he saw the fading stars. Sheer walls of rock went up on either hand of him, a roof of rock was above him, but in the roof was this one open place, across which were heavy bars. Soon the daylight would come.|$|E
60|$|Near {{the horizon}} {{the sun was}} {{smouldering}} dimly, almost obscured by formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility. The man pulled out his watch, the while resting his weight on one leg. It was four o'clock, and as the season was near the last of July or first of August,--he {{did not know the}} precise date within a week or two,--he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest. He looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the Great Bear Lake; also, he knew that in that direction the Arctic <b>Circle</b> <b>cut</b> its forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens. This stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River, which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the Arctic Ocean. He had never been there, but he had seen it, once, on a Hudson Bay Company chart.|$|E

The citole roses are not as elaborate as the lute roses would be in later centuries. This type is visible in the images from the Queen Mary Psalter and the Ormesby Psalter.|$|E
30|$|The data {{collected}} included the grade, gender, handedness, hospital, exercise {{and time of}} day they did the exercise, the number of <b>circles</b> they <b>cut</b> between 0 – 30 and 30 – 60  min {{and the number of}} mistakes on each <b>circle</b> they <b>cut.</b> A mistake was defined as a cut in the line marking the inner or outer circles. This was done for both SS and SILS.|$|R

The participants also filled out questionnaires at the same intervals as for the first exercise mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} not {{actually}} consecrated until 1200, by Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln. There is a 13th or 14th century consecration cross consisting of interlaced <b>circles</b> <b>cut</b> into the western column {{of the bell}} tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established. The fair continues to this day, held on the Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday following 1 September, which is St Giles' Day. St Hugh also expanded the St Mary Magdalen's Church to the south in 1194.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{satisfying}} view is from the north. The work presents an open, more fully readable composition {{of two or three}} peaks with legs and clouds that seem to float in front of the mountains. There is a large <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> through one of the mountain sheets, offering, from this view, needed relief from the massive stabile. The arch-shaped legs are reminiscent of flying buttresses and, like flying buttresses, they provide both support and aesthetic pleasure.|$|E
50|$|Church of St Michael and All Angels is {{a parish}} church located on Riverside in Felton, Northumberland, England. Built circa 1200, its many {{alterations}} and additions have {{caused it to}} be almost encased within another church. Some unusual features are that the nave and an aisle appear roofless, {{as well as a}} window with geometrical tracery that features an eight petalled flower patterned central <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> from a single stone. Dedicated to Saint Michael, it is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Mushroom Records {{went out of}} business. Ownership rights to Heart's two albums for Mushroom were {{purchased}} by Capitol Records who re-issued the recordings. The 1978 release was also pressed as a picture disc featuring the album cover. The back cover indicates {{that it is a}} special limited edition of 100,000 copies. The original cover had a <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> out of it. This circle was sent to record stores to be hung in the store for promotion of the album.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the museum}} was {{conceived}} primarily as a space for temporary exhibitions, in the German kunsthalle model. However, in 1974, the museum began acquiring a permanent collection of contemporary art objects created after 1945. [...] The MCA expanded into adjacent buildings to increase gallery space; and in 1977, following a fundraising drive for its 10th anniversary, a three-story neighboring townhouse was purchased, renovated, and connected to the museum. [...] In 1978, Gordon Matta-Clark executed his final major project in the townhouse. In his work Circus Or The Caribbean Orange (1978), Matta-Clark made <b>circle</b> <b>cuts</b> in the walls and floors of the townhouse next-door to the first museum.|$|R
5000|$|Although Check My Ears {{was only}} {{released}} on CD, it kept in tone with the Vinyl releases, as the back insert had a <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> out {{to link up}} the letters 'UR' which appeared on the CD itself to 'T' and 'N' which appear {{on the left and}} right sides of the cutout. The CD itself also had only a small circle label in the middle, while all 7" [...] singles were released on clear vinyl with small circle labels as well. The Inlay cover also folded out to show the covers of the Facedown, Beretta and [...] "Beeswax" [...] singles.|$|E
5000|$|The dancers {{of honor}} {{stay in the}} circle the whole time while other dancers from outside the <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> in 'on the fly'. Dancers [...] "break in", or [...] "steal", {{their way into the}} middle by {{breaking}} the connection of the dancers and inserting themselves such that the person of honor continues dancing without missing a beat. Some scenes do this in an organized fashion (such as a line), however, many do so without rules. Such birthday jams are common in swing dance and hustle communities in the United States but not unusual in salsa or tango. While nerve-wracking for beginning dancers the jams do help to meet the local crowd.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth peril {{brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Convention by the Executive Committee was one which proved to be a nemesis for the SVM throughout its existence. There was a tendency for a breach to form between student volunteers and religiously oriented non-volunteers on college campuses. The volunteers were accused of taking on a tone of superiority and segregating themselves from the general religious associations. Nearly a decade later, Robert Speer again reported to the Executive Committee: [...] "I have found an apparent chasm between the volunteers and the rest of the students in the institution. The Volunteer Band is a little <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> off from the students and often without a bond of sympathy between it and the students." ...|$|E

2500|$|As one of {{the premier}} bishops of the Kingdom of England Hugh more than once {{accepted}} the role of diplomat to France for Richard and then for King John in 1199, a trip that ruined his health. He consecrated St Giles' Church, Oxford, in 1200. There is a cross consisting of interlaced <b>circles</b> <b>cut</b> into the western column of the tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established and continues to this day each September. While attending a national council in London, a few months later, he was stricken with an unnamed ailment and died two months later on 16 November 1200. [...] He was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{the iconic}} nature of many Zeppelin riffs made them a popular target for sampling, {{initially}} unauthorised but later {{sanctioned by the}} surviving band members, to mixed reactions from fans. Hip-hop group the Beastie Boys sampled Bonham's crushing beat from [...] "When the Levee Breaks", and also borrowed parts of [...] "The Ocean" [...] for [...] "She's Crafty". For the movie Godzilla, guitarist Jimmy Page collaborated with P. Diddy, reworking the famous riff from [...] "Kashmir" [...] in the song [...] "Come With Me"—Page also has a brief vocal part in this song. Tool has covered [...] "No Quarter" [...] and a riff from the song {{can be found in}} Sublime's [...] "Smoke Two Joints". Another band featuring Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan, A Perfect <b>Circle,</b> <b>cut</b> When the Levee Breaks for their eMOTIVe album in 2004. The rock/comedy duo Tenacious D strategically used pieces of [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] in the original version of their song [...] "Tribute".

40|$|We {{investigate}} several geometric {{methods for}} dividing an irregular mesh into pieces of roughly equal size with few interconnecting edges. All these methods {{are based on}} cutting a mesh with a line (in two dimensions) or a hyperplane (in any dimension). Line cuts have often been used in practice, but their quality varies widely. Until now, no theory has existed to predict the effectiveness of any line-cut algorithm. We make two main contributions: First, we give rigorous (and tight) bounds {{on the quality of}} line cuts for meshes of bounded aspect ratio in terms of a parameter we call grading that measures the nonuniformity of the mesh. Our bound on line cut quality differs from the known bound on <b>circle</b> <b>cut</b> quality by a factor that grows only as the 1 =d power of the logarithm of the mesh grading. Second, we give an upper bound on the quality of an exact 50 : 50 line cut. This is the first proof of a cut size guarantee for any exact bisection induced by a single geometric cut. We use these [...] ...|$|E
