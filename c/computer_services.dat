25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994.

40|$|Abstract — Cloud {{computing}} {{is a new}} cost-efficient computing {{paradigm in}} which information and computer power can be accessed from a Web browser by customers. Understanding the characteristics of <b>computer</b> <b>service</b> performance has become critical for service applications in cloud computing. For the commercial success of this new computing paradigm, the ability to deliver Quality of Services (QoS) guaranteed services is crucial. In this paper, we present an approach for studying <b>computer</b> <b>service</b> performance in cloud computing. Specifically, {{in an effort to}} deliver QoS guaranteed services in such a computing environment, we find the relationship among the maximal number of customers, the minimal service resources and the highest level of services. The obtained results provide the guidelines of <b>computer</b> <b>service</b> performance in cloud computing that would be greatly useful in the design of this new computing paradigm. I...|$|R
