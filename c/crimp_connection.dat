5000|$|F-crimp {{is a more}} {{mechanically}} robust <b>crimp</b> <b>connection</b> {{compared to}} the common barrel-crimp type readily available at retail locations (Radio Shack, Home Depot, etc.). It also has an optional second crimp section that crimps to the insulation, providing strain relief. Because of these characteristics, automobiles use F-crimp almost exclusively. F-crimp was devised to {{eliminate the need for}} soldered connections—crimping can be preferred to soldering in mass production because it is easier to reproduce reliable connections. These connections, when made with ratcheting application tooling, provide a solderless, [...] "gas-tight" [...] connection. F-crimp connections are never soldered as application of solder can lead to fracturing of the wire conductor.|$|E
40|$|Crimping is a {{mechanical}} joining technique to manufacture electrical connectors by squeezing the clip's crimp barrel onto the conductor. Primarily, crimped connections have to fulfill mechanical and electrical functions. The {{increasing number of}} electrical components in automobiles makes crimp connections very important parts, the reliability of which must be assured. Simulation of crimping process and operation is an efficient tool to optimize crimped connectors and {{to reduce the amount}} of expensive testing during development of new crimps. A three dimensional finite element model validated with crimp experiments is used to simulate the crimp process. Tensile tests on clip and wire material were performed to determine the parameters of the material models employed in the process simulations. The calculations lead to various process dependent results like crimp force, contact pressure and final stress state allowing to estimate the performance of the <b>crimp</b> <b>connection.</b> Thus, a significant reduction in cost and development time can be achieved...|$|E

50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} stranded copper wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber. For portable applications, common lampcord was used, twisted in pairs for mechanical reasons. Cables were often soldered {{in place at}} one end. Other terminations were binding posts, terminal strips, and spade lugs for <b>crimp</b> <b>connections.</b> Two-conductor ¼-inch tip-sleeve phone jacks came into use in the 1920s and '30s as convenient terminations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crimp</b> <b>connections</b> {{are used}} {{typically}} to fix connectors, such as BNC connectors, to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the connector. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the cable for crimping.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to assess quantitatively wire crimp terminations is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating at right angles to the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. To demonstrate the technique, the case of incomplete compression of <b>crimped</b> <b>connections</b> is ultrasonically tested, and the results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the nondestructive ultrasonic measurement technique consistently predicts good crimps when the ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A quantitative measure {{of the quality of the}} <b>crimped</b> <b>connection</b> based on the ultrasonic energy transmitted is shown to respond accurately to crimp quality. A wave propagation model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying this technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented. The instrument is based on a two-jaw type crimp tool suitable for butt-splice type connections.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess wire <b>crimp</b> <b>connections</b> is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating through the junction of a crimp connector and wire is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which previously has been used to assess crimp wire junction quality. Various crimp junction pathologies (missing wire strands, incorrect wire gauge, incomplete wire insertion in connector) are ultrasonically tested, and their results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the ultrasonic measurement technique consistently (as evidenced with pull-testing data) predicts good crimps when ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A physics-based model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying the technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a new measurement technique to quantitatively assess the condition of wire <b>crimp</b> <b>connections.</b> This ultrasonic (UT) method transmits high frequency sound waves through the joint under inspection. The wire-crimp region filters and scatters the ultrasonic energy as it passes through the crimp and wire. The resulting output (both time and frequency domains) provides a quantitative measure of the joint quality that is independent and unaffected by current. Crimps of poor mechanical and electrical quality will result in low temporal output and will distort the spectrum into unique and predictable patterns, depending on crimp "quality". This inexpensive, real-time measurement system can provide certification of crimps as they are made and recertification of existing wire crimps currently in service. The measurements for re-certification do not require that the wire be disconnected from its circuit. No other technology exists to measure in-situ the condition of wire joints (no electrical currents through the crimp are used in this analytical technique). We discuss the signals obtained from this instrument, and correlate these signals with destructive wire pull tests...|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or <b>crimped</b> <b>connection.</b> The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. Cable clamps and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel technical solution that is aimed {{to improve the quality of}} cable crimp terminations in the electronics industry. The automotive, aero and military vehicle industries are of special interest due to their stringent requirements for guaranteed quality assurances in relation to their safety-critical products. The emphasis is on handheld crimping tools, where a new scheme for measuring the relevant crimp force is proposed using a small embedded computer to process information; so as to make an on-instrument statement regarding the crimp process quality. The thesis includes a detailed review of the current technical practices in the cable termination business, with a particular emphasis on the quality estimations for <b>crimped</b> <b>connections</b> using the <b>crimp</b> force monitoring (CFM) scheme. A comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art crimp force monitoring schemes and technologies is presented. A gap in the tool chain is identified whereby the industry has a preference for the use of hand tools in some selected processes; but the CFM scheme cannot be currently integrated directly with such hand tools. The bulk of the work in this thesis is thus focused on the development of a technical solution that will address this need for integration of hand tools with the CFM scheme. The concept is to develop a fully embedded subsystem that can be attached directly to a hand tool and this system will perform all of the signal processing and the statistical analysis so that each crimped joint can be trusted to meet the relevant stated quality parameters. In the course of development work a fully functional prototype subsystem is developed for the CFM solution, for application to hand tools. Analytical and statistical measurement and assessment algorithms were developed to a standard, which allows a final quality rating to be applied to <b>crimped</b> joint <b>connections.</b> Such algorithms are designed to be embedded directly onto the instrument’s microcomputer. The new system has been evaluated and tested in the course of this research project and it has currently been accepted by a number of industries for a planned volume qualification assessment...|$|R

40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} a vehicle's weight, the {{application}} of space frame structures has been increasing. This innovative lightweight design concept is already commonly applied in the low volume production of cars. Due to the high stiffness and low mass, extruded aluminum profiles are particularly suitable for the manufacturing of such structures. But the potential for great weight reduction using space frames is curtailed by the difficulties associated with manufacturing the space frames. These structures have complex demands on joining technologies, and conventional processes often are pushed to their technological limits. A promising alternative to connect extruded aluminum profiles without heating or penetration is joining by electromagnetic crimping. Compared to adhesive bonding and welding, the process also requires a less extensive preparation of the joining zone. This technique {{is characterized by the}} use of pulsed magnetic fields to form a profile made of an electrically conductivity material into form-fit elements, like grooves, of the other joining partner. Thereby, an interlock is generated which enables the load transfer. A fundamental process understanding of the manufacturing and the load transfer of form-fit connections manufactured by electromagnetic crimping is developed in this thesis. Based on analytical, experimental, and numerical studies, major parameters are identified and their influence on the joining process and the achievable joint strength is analyzed. For the analytical investigations a continuous approach describing the manufacturing of the connections as well as the load transfer is introduced here. This model also facilitates the process and joining zone design of electromagnetically <b>crimped</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use <b>crimping</b> of <b>connection</b> terminals. However, {{this equipment}} often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during crimping. A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for crimping, so the terminal can be crimped without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R
50|$|Return Loss is the {{measurement}} (in dB) {{of the amount}} of signal that is reflected back toward the transmitter. The reflection of the signal is caused by the variations of impedance in the connectors and cable and is usually attributed to a poorly terminated wire. The greater the variation in impedance, the greater the return loss reading. If 3 pairs of wire pass by a substantial amount, but the 4 pair barely passes, it usually is an indication of a bad <b>crimp</b> or bad <b>connection</b> at the RJ45 plug. Return loss is usually not significant in the loss of a signal, but rather signal jitter.|$|R

(The phrase [...] "IDC connector" [...] is widely used, {{even though it is}} redundant—an example of RAS syndrome.) Most commonly termination is done {{at both ends of the}} cable, although sometimes (for example, when making a lead that needs to change wiring between the two connectors) only one end will be IDC terminated, with the other end being terminated in a regular <b>crimp</b> or solder-bucket <b>connection.</b> Although it is sometimes possible to dismantle and re-use IDC connectors, they are not designed to allow this to be done easily.|$|R
