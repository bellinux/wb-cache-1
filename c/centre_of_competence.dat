40|$|On {{national}} {{as well as}} on EU level, {{research funds}} should be directed substantially towards organic farming in order to improve the economic and ecological performance of organic farming. The impact of research funds is very high in this field of food production, because, as yet, the potential of organic farming has been scarcely tapped by research. Integrating organic farming research into conventional research structures means disintegrating organic farming itself. Therefore, special attention should be given to how research activities are organised. National or regional <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> (hubs) are needed in order to provide and maintain an appropriate quality of research. These hubs can be organised as real or virtual centres. Evaluation procedures for most national and EU research funds do not consider adequately the unique approach and methodology of organic farming research...|$|R

40|$|The {{global economy}} becomes more {{dependent}} on knowledge, on growth of production effectiveness and on harmonized interaction of all components of innovation system. It is necessary to develop smart specialization strategies for regions to increase innovation potential of regions and the whole country. In the innovation sector Riga region is the most competitive region of Latvia. In Latvia only 20 % of enterprises are involved into innovative activities. The financing from state budget for science and research is less than in developed EU countries. One of the essential problems {{in the development of}} innovations in Latvia is insufficient cooperation between entrepreneurs and scientists. To promote and develop innovations in Latvia and its regions, it is necessary to increase government and private investments in the research and development; to develop innovation incubators, <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> in the regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{launching}} of the EuNICE-Test project was announced {{two years ago}} at the first DELTA Conference [1]. This project is now completed and the present paper describes the project actions and outcomes. The original idea was to build a long-lasting European Network for test engineering education using both test resource mutualisation and remote experiments. This objective is fully fulfilled and we have now, in Europe, five <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> able to deliver high-level and high- specialized training courses in the field of test engineering using a high-performing industrial ATE. All the centres propose training courses on digital testing, three of them propose mixed-signal trainings and three of them propose memory trainings. Taking into account the demand in test engineering, the network is planned to continue in a stand alone mode after project end. Nevertheless a new European proposal with several new partners and new test lessons is under construction...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{showing how}} the Research and {{innovation}} Act of July 1999 modifies (stimulates?) {{the role of}} the local governments, this question being declined in several sub-interrogations dealing with the articulation between the legal framework, the local <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and the regional administration. Which form takes the implementation of these devices at the regional level? How do the often divergent interests of the various actors of the innovating projects coordinate each other thanks to these structures? Do the regions support the links between firms and public research? Which kinds of firms profit from these devices? Do the structures of support for innovation at the regional level deploy their activities at this scale? How these devices help to create a network <b>of</b> relationships between <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> skills, firms, and innovators Lastly, are these new structures becoming 'hybrid' i. e. mixing financial and scientific constraints? Taking as an example the case of Auvergne, we will seek to show in what sense the organisational mode of the innovation which prevails there can be interpreted using the model of 'triple helix' proposed by Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz.

40|$|Organic farming has rapidly {{developed}} in the EU in the 1990 s. Although funding for organic research seems to increase with growing public awareness and political pressure, the current funding volume lags behind. The following aspects are discussed to effectively expand research in organic farming in the future: Why research and innovation specific to organic farming is needed. What are the appropriate research priorities? Is there need for specific “organic” research methodologies? How is research in organic farming best organised? Based on a literature review on the topic, a summarising evaluation of the status-quo of research on organic food production is given. The need for specific organic farming research is justified primarily because problems are different due to the organic farming definition, and because synergy effects may result for conventional farming, as well. Research priorities differ widely between stakeholders and regions and should, therefore, be defined jointly. A need for organic research methodologies has been identified. Core <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> assisted by advisory boards consisting of representatives of all stakeholder groups are proposed as an ideal research infrastructure for organic farming...|$|R
40|$|In the {{beginning}} the space programs were self standing national activities, often in competition to other nations. Today space flight {{becomes more and}} more an international task. Complex space mission and deep space explorations are not longer to be stemmed by one agency or nation alone but are joint activities of several nations. The best example for such a joint (ad-) venture at the moment is the International Space Station ISS. Such international activities define complete new requirements for the supporting ground segments. The world-wide distribution of a ground segment is not any longer limited to a network of ground stations with the aim to provide a good coverage of the space craft. The coverage is sometimes – like for the ISSanyway ensured by using a relay satellite system instead. In addition to the enhanced down- and uplink methods a ground segment is aimed to connect the different <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> all participating agencies/nations. From the space craft operations point of view such transnational ground segments are required to support distributed and shared operations in a predefined decision/commanding hierarchy. This has {{to be taken into account}} in the technical topology as well as for the operational set-up and teaming. Last not least increases the duration of missions, which requires a certain flexibility of the ground segment and long-term maintenance strategies for the ground segment with a special emphasis on nonintrusive replacements. The Russian space station MIR has been in the orbit for about 15 years, the ISS is currently targeted for 2020, to be for over 20 years in space...|$|R
