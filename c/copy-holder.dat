5000|$|Cooke disappears {{from the}} {{historical}} record after 1641; his last known work was Sir Edward Coke's The Complete <b>Copy-Holder</b> (1641).|$|E
50|$|After 1767, {{based on}} the {{regularisation}} of copy-holders, ordered by Maria Theresa, the central government arrangements regulated the compilation of the Urbarium in a unitary manner. <b>Copy-holder</b> plate {{was attached to the}} urbarium, which included the names of landlords and villagers,their land, quantity and composition of their annual surrender. Urbarium of Szederkény was prepared and authenticated by József Ragályi and Joan Baroy de Fáy, on 14 June 1771. In 1898, it was decreed that all Hungarian village's name had to be regularised. The village was located close to river Tisza and its name was modified to Tiszaszederkény on 1 January 1905.|$|E
50|$|Todd {{received}} her education in Washington, D.C. and taught herself typewriting {{to earn a}} living. Her first job was at the Patent Office, but left two years later {{to work in the}} office of the governor of Pennsylvania (she claims in her article that she became the first woman to receive an appointment in the executive department of that state). Then she went back to New York to continue her work with patents, began to study law, and became a member of the first Woman's Law Class of New York University (circa 1890). In 1896, she was issued a patent for a typewriter <b>copy-holder</b> (number 553292) which she shared with George W. Parker. Todd later worked as a secretary to the director-general of the Women's National War Relief Association during the Spanish-American War.|$|E
60|$|There was no exaggeration in Marian's {{definition}} of Flintcomb-Ash farm as a starve-acre place. The single fat {{thing on the}} soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squires's tenantry, the village of free- or <b>copy-holders,</b> and the absentee-owner's village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The worried girl {{took the}} money and went home, and told her uncle {{that it was no}} house no husband for her. Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the money, for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now bestir himself; for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not wish to make her unhappy, since she was so determined. It was much to the Squire's {{annoyance}} that he found Sargent had moved in the matter at last; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents were prepared (for on this manor the <b>copy-holders</b> had writings with their holdings, though on some manors they had none). Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to the agent's house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and handed over as a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by Sargent, and sent back to the Squire.|$|R
