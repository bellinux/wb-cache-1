Reference prices are the standards against which the purchase price of a product is judged. Since both the external and internal reference prices have been extensively researched by scholars of marketing in western countries such as the US and UK, this paper focus on consumers reactions to <b>comparative</b> price <b>advertising</b> in the Chinese market which is most attractive emerging market in the world. The research adopts three independent variables: internal reference price, the presence of time limit restriction {{and the presence of}} former price (ARP), among which the IRP is a covariate variable. Five dependent variables are measured in the research: consumers perceived believability, transaction value, acquisition value, purchase intention and search intention. This paper aims to answer the three main questions: 1. 	Whether or not Chinese Consumers use the internal reference price (IRP) in their evaluation of a comparative price promotion? 2. 	How does the presence of time limit affect Chinese consumers perception of price offers? 3. 	How does the presence of ARP affect Chinese consumers perception of price offers...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a simple}} {{game in which}} two sellers supply goods whose quality cannot be {{assessed}} by consumers even after consumption, but can be verified with some probability by a public authority. Sellers may induce a perspective buyer into a bad purchase through <b>comparative</b> deceptive <b>advertising.</b> The central contribution of {{the paper is the}} characterization of a class of pooling equilibria in which low-quality sellers deceive a buyer that is Bayes-rational and makes his purchase decision {{on the basis of the}} available information. The analysis of these equilibria suggests that high-quality firms should pursue more intensive advertising campaigns than their low-quality competitors. Surprisingly, we find conditions under which sellers' expected profit is higher in pooling equilibria than in the separating equilibrium in which quality is reflected by prices and there is no need to waste resources in advertising. Hence, we show that there are plausible cases in which firms should be ex-ante willing to tolerate some degree of deceptive advertising by low-quality competitors. In addition, although in these equilibria the buyer purchases low-quality goods with positive probability, his expected utility can be higher than in a separating equilibrium in which he purchases the high-quality good for sure. In this sense, the model also offers an argument in favor of a lenient regulatory approach to deceptive advertising...|$|R

Analyzing the gender of the primary character and voiceover, as well as the age, associated product categories, home- or work setting, and the working role of the primary character, we concluded that gender stereotypes in TV advertising can be found around the world. A multilevel model further showed that gender stereotypes were independent of a country’s gender indices, including Hofstede’s Masculinity Index, GLOBE’s Gender Egalitarianism Index, the Gender-related Development Index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Global Gender Gap Index. These findings suggest that gender stereotyping in television advertising does not depend on the gender equality prevalent in a country.

It is hypothesized that (a) when the attribute under consideration is typical (atypical), among comparison brand committed informants, a non-comparative ad is more (no more) persuasive than a comparative ad, (b) when the attribute under consideration is typical, among comparison brand non-committed informants, a comparative ad is more persuasive than a non-comparative ad, and (c) when the attribute under consideration is atypical, among comparison brand non-committed informants, a comparative ad is likely to be more persuasive than a non-comparative ad, but the effect will be weaker than {{in the case of a}} typical attribute. Hypothesis (a) is supported while (b) has directional support. The results support a three-way interaction between consumer commitment, attribute typicality, and type of advertisement.

40|$|Cooperative {{advertising}} is often {{defined as an}} arrangement whereby a manufacturer pays {{for part of the}} expenditures of local advertising undertaken by a retailer who is responsible for selling products made by the manufacturer. Besides local advertising, manufacturers are interested in reinforcing the brand image in the eyes of potential consumers by national advertising.

This paper employs two game-theoretic models to analyze cooperative advertising problem in a manufacturer-retailer supply chain without considering the ambiguous interaction between national branding and local advertising. Recent change in power shifting from manufacturers to retailers relaxes the leader-follower relationship and leads to a simultaneous-move game. The results show that manufacturer’s subsidy policy is affected by the gaming structure.

It pressions, and references to Chinese culture, which confirms Han's 1991 finding about Chinese newspaper advertising language. Ten linguistic strategies are identified, which include creative use of idioms and proverbs, puns, metaphors, and direct and indirect requests. Compared with American advertising, Chinese advertisements rarely attack competitors directly by comparing price, effectiveness, or side effects, preferring more subtle and indirect comparisons while avoiding extreme self-indulgent promotion language. American influence Chinese advertising is observed although the mixing of English is still rare. In addition, an examination of the strategies adopted by American companies in China reveals an ongoing nativization process in which American companies employ more Chinese cultural and linguistic elements in their advertising. These features of advertising language reflect a changing society, in which the individualistic consumer ideologies compete with the more collective traditional ideologies in public discourse. 1...|$|R

40|$|Investigative {{journalism in}} Montreal is healthy and robust, despite a North American media {{landscape}} in flux, where newspapers {{across the continent}} have closed or significantly reduced staff. Newsroom budgets have shrunk across the continent, and the migration of print content to the web has not brought with it a <b>comparative</b> level of <b>advertising.</b> This thesis is a case study that researched how Montreal’s investigative journalism environment has fared {{in light of the}} perceived newspaper crisis. The case study consists of a quantitative analysis of Montreal’s La Presse and The Gazette newspapers, which revealed that since 2009, investigative journalism articles increased in both papers. Additionally, through interviews with eight of Montreal’s mostprominent investigative journalists, I discovered three main reasons why the city has become a welcoming environment {{for one of the most}} costly and time-consuming journalistic projects: the rise of Radio-Canada’s Enquête program, which created a successful model for an investigative unit; a surge in whistleblowers coming forward and willing to risk their well-being; and finally, strong market competition and an adversarial newsroom culture. Investigative journalists in Montreal have uncovered severe cases of scandal and moral transgressions committed by Quebec’s elected officials and business leaders. Montreal’s investigative reporting has led to the resignations of big-city mayors and the arrests of prominent businessmen and members of criminal organizations. I demonstrate in this case study that there is a measurable increase of investigative work in the recent past and my interviews suggest that there is a perception among journalism stakeholders that investigative journalism is working well in Montreal...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on {{the economics of the}} Internet. The first chapter begins with presenting the advertising spending patterns of US local restaurants that have different ratings on Yelp. com. Rating information on Yelp includes display ratings and review distributions. The Yelp's rounding algorithm creates a discontinuity in display ratings. Therefore, I use a regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of a higher display rating on local restaurants' advertising spendings. I find a significantly negative effect of display rating for highly-rated restaurants on advertising. However, when the display rating is constant between two steps, the relationship between local restaurant advertising spending and average rating is significantly positive. The second chapter uses a game-theoretic model to analyze competing firms' advertising and pricing decisions. Here customer reviews are available and firms may build up loyal customer bases. I find that highly-rated firms are more likely to advertise more, i. e., online reviews complement <b>advertising.</b> <b>Comparative</b> static results can explain the results found in the first chapter. Intuitively, when the capacity of a local business becomes limited, a jump in the display rating will reduce the complementary effect of online reviews on advertising. I also analyze an extension of the model, where an entrant and an incumbent interact. I find that customer reviews undo the "fat-cat" effect of a large incumbent with lots of loyal customers. The third chapter proposes a new explanation for adoption failure or delay in markets with network effects. In the model, consumers and software providers play a dynamic adoption game. Each group of players choose between two incompatible technologies. Consumers may wait, but firms may not. Although efficiency requires one technology to be adopted by all consumers and firms right away, there is a "market split and adoption delay" equilibrium. In this equilibrium some consumers choose to wait at first and firms split between the two technologies. The model is motivated by the 56 K modem market, in which competition between two technologies appears to have led to adoption failure, until an industry standard setting organization coordinated the market on an alternative standard...|$|R
