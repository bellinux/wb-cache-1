50|$|Standard {{test methods}} are {{available}} for measuring the oxygen transmission rate of packaging materials. Completed packages, however, involve heat seals, creases, joints, and closures which often reduce the effective barrier of the package. For example, the glass of a glass bottle may have an effective total barrier but the screw cap closure and the <b>closure</b> <b>liner</b> might not.|$|E
50|$|Many {{closures}} need to {{have the}} ability to adjust to slight manufacturing variation in the container and the closure structure. Some closures are made of flexible material such as cork, rubber, or plastic foam. Often an o-ring or a <b>closure</b> <b>liner</b> (gasket made of pulp or foam cap liner) is used. Linerless closures often use a deformable plastic rim or structure to maintain the seal.|$|E
50|$|Often, barrier {{testing is}} {{conducted}} {{on a sheet}} of material. Calculations based on that can be useful when designing completed structures, clothing, and packages. Seams, creases, access points, and heat seals are critical to end-use performance. For example, the glass of a bottle may have an effective total barrier, but the screw cap closure and the <b>closure</b> <b>liner</b> might not. Performance verification and validation of complete containers, structures, or irregular objects is often recommended.|$|E
50|$|Plastisol is the {{standard}} lining material used in metal closures for vacuum packing glass bottles and jars. Plastisol is a flowed-in compound, usually a dispersion of PVC resins in plasticizers. It forms a solid, self-bonding, sealing gasket in the <b>closures.</b> Plastisol <b>liners</b> are used in metal twist-off and metal continuous thread screw caps for use on hot-pack food products where the preservation of a vacuum is essential.|$|R

40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) geomembranes will be utilized within the <b>liner</b> and <b>closure</b> cap of the proposed On-Site Disposal Cell (OSDC) at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The likely longevity (i. e. service life) of HDPE geomembranes in OSDC service is evaluated within the following sections of this report: (1) Section 2. 0 {{provides an overview of}} HDPE geomembranes, (2) Section 3. 0 outlines potential HDPE geomembranes degradation mechanisms, (3) Section 4. 0 evaluates the applicability of HDPE geomembrane degradation mechanisms to the Portsmouth OSDC, (4) Section 5. 0 provides a discussion of the current state of knowledge relative to the longevity (service life) of HDPE geomembranes, including the relation of this knowledge to the Portsmouth OSDC, and (5) Section 6. 0 provides summary and conclusions relative to the anticipated service life of HDPE geomembranes in OSDC service. Based upon this evaluation it {{is anticipated}} that the service life of HDPE geomembranes in OSDC service would be significantly greater than the 200 year service life assumed for the OSDC <b>closure</b> cap and <b>liner</b> HDPE geomembranes. That is, a 200 year OSDC HDPE geomembrane service life is considered a conservative assumption...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the place of}} art and design {{in the life of the}} Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O). In particular, the thesis examines P&O’s art and design in the context of the company’s evolving role in the networks of the British Empire and Commonwealth from the company’s foundation in 1837 to the <b>closure</b> of its <b>liner</b> service in 1969. This contributes a different perspective to existing debates which have not yet focused on the role of everyday corporate art and design in Victorian maritime empire, the persistence of maritime empire in twentieth century art and design, or the impact of decolonisation on Britain’s maritime identity and culture after 1949. Drawing on P&O’s business archive held at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, the thesis illustrates the case for a nuanced view of imperialism and culture beyond the simple monoliths of good and evil, and beyond generic characterisation as either corporate pride or propaganda. The research demonstrates how Britain’s imperial-maritime culture adapted a variety {{of art and design}} forms and functions at different times and places in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It reveals a story of imperial change, instability and uncertainty, as much as it does corporate power, order and control. The extended post-colonial timeframe identifies how melancholic and nostalgic imperial echoes persist and return in corporate narratives long after the formal end of the Empire...|$|R
