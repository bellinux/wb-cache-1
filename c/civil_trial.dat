5|$|After leaving politics, Gregorio {{began an}} {{attorney}} mediation practice in San Francisco in 1985. He founded the non-profit, Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center in San Mateo, California in 1986. In 1989, {{he created the}} first law partnership that focused exclusively on the mediation of <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> matters. The firm is known as Gregorio, Haldeman & Rotman and is located in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the {{law school}} {{established}} the Center for Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution program. In 1992, the Collins Legal Center went through an award-winning renovation and expansion that ended with a dedication ceremony and speech by former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or <b>civil</b> <b>trial.</b> Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the judge, the Royal Court includes the Jurats. They are unpaid lay people, aged 40 or more, who have been elected by an electoral college. They hold the office {{until the age of}} 72. The Jurats decide issues of fact in criminal and <b>civil</b> <b>trials</b> (except criminal assizes, when a jury is empanelled), hand down sentences in criminal trials and award damages in <b>civil</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with {{no possibility of}} a <b>civil</b> <b>trial.</b> The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E
5|$|Joel Enterprises of Richmond {{was listed}} as one of Vick's larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a {{contract}} with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel's cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's <b>civil</b> <b>trial,</b> she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

40|$|The current {{dearth of}} <b>civil</b> <b>trials</b> {{may result from}} two {{converging}} trends in civil practice: twentieth-century procedural reforms and associated changes in the organization and financing of legal practice. The procedural reforms required greater pre-trial investigation of facts. Pre-trial investigation often required litigants to make regular investments of substantial capital, access to which was facilitated by changes {{in the organization of}} plaintiffs’ practices. Together, these procedural reforms and changes in practice structure provide a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon of declining rate and number of <b>civil</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Many {{state court}} civil cases produce quick default {{judgments}} or pretrial settlements, but even considering only cases that {{actually go to}} trial, state courts are the dominant forum for civil cases.

25|$|Sweden has no {{tradition}} of using juries in most types of criminal or <b>civil</b> <b>trial.</b> The sole exception, since 1815, is {{in cases involving}} freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution. The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.|$|E
25|$|The {{more severe}} {{penalties}} available in criminal law {{also means that}} it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson had committed the crime of murder; but in a later <b>civil</b> <b>trial,</b> the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, {{shortly after}} Mahony became Bishop of Stockton, California, a parent {{wrote to the}} diocese accusing Father Oliver O'Grady, a priest of the diocese, of molesting his two sons.

In 1984, a police investigation into accusations against O'Grady was closed after a diocesan lawyer promised that O'Grady would be kept away from children. In December of that year Mahony had O'Grady transferred to another parish. Mahony was promoted to Archbishop of Los Angeles the following year. In 1998 he testified in a <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> against the Diocese of Stockton, in which a jury awarded $30 million to two of O'Grady's victims.

25|$|Following her <b>civil</b> <b>trial,</b> Hutchinson needed also {{to face a}} {{trial by}} the clergy, and this could not take place until the {{following}} March. In the interim, she {{was not allowed to}} return home, but instead was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld, which was located in Roxbury, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, yet she was rarely able to see her children because of the winter weather, which was particularly harsh that year. She was frequently visited by the various ministers; modern writer Eve LaPlante claims that they came with the intention of reforming her thinking and also to collect evidence to use against her in the forthcoming church trial. LaPlante also claims that Winthrop was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her.|$|E
