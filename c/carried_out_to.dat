5|$|After Leonard I.

Testing was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated.

Annual monitoring is <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> determine fish populations. Almost equally as common are the introduced redfin European perch, with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden perch. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and golden perch, as well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout.|$|E
