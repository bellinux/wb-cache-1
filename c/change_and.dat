After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} inter-temporal linkage between call rate changes, {{consumer}} price index (CPI) <b>changes,</b> <b>and</b> real gross domestic product (GDP) changes in Japan based on the Taylor rule of monetary policy. In our analysis, we consider two sample periods, namely, the former is before zero-interest rate policy and the latter is after it. According to our empirical results, first, {{we find that the}} relations between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> GDP <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> those between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> CPI <b>changes</b> are weak before zero-interest rate policy. Second, we also find that after zero-interest rate policy, mutual inter-temporal relations between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> GDP <b>changes</b> are seen as the US Taylor rule suggests, although the linkage between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> CPI <b>changes</b> is not seen. Hence after zero-interest rate policy, regarding call rates and GDP, the relations suggested by US Taylor rule are found in Japan...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{both the}} linear and nonlinear causal relationships between crude oil price <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> stock market returns for the United States. In particular, the study applied {{a battery of}} unit root tests to ascertain the time series properties of crude oil price <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> stock market returns. The linear and nonlinear causality tests were conducted through the standard VAR and the M-G frameworks, respectively. The results from both the linear and nonlinear unit root tests indicate that crude oil price <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> stock market returns are level stationary. The results from the standard VAR model provide evidence of bidirectional causality between crude oil price <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> stock market returns. The results from the M-G causality test support the finding of nonlinear bidirectional causality between crude oil price <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> stock market returns...|$|R
