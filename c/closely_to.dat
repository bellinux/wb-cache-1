5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Bradford Colliery was a {{coal mine}} in Bradford, Manchester, England. Although {{part of the}} Manchester Coalfield, the seams of the Bradford Coalfield {{correspond}} more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> those of the Oldham Coalfield. The Bradford Coalfield is crossed {{by a number of}} fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault, which was reactivated by mining activity in the mid-1960s.|$|E

5|$|HD 205739 was flagged {{originally}} as {{a candidate}} hosting a Hot Jupiter, which is a large gas giant that orbits <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> its star, although later observations suggested that the planetary candidate orbited further {{out over the next}} 3.5 years of observation.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6 is {{a yellow}} giant {{situated}} in the constellation Cygnus. The star lies {{within the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, which discovered it as part of a NASA-led mission to discover Earth-like planets. The star, which is slightly larger, more metal-rich, slightly cooler, and more massive than the Sun, is orbited by at least one extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized planet named Kepler-6b that orbits <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> its star.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} {{languages}} spoken on Java are Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese.

5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes {{as many as}} three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2â€“4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
50|$|These snakes were {{formerly}} thought <b>to</b> be <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> {{two other}} genera, Tropidophis and Trachyboa; all four genera were united {{in the family}} (Tropidophiidae) based {{on the presence of}} a tracheal lung and the absence of a left lung. However, Ungaliophis and Exiliboa are now known <b>to</b> be more <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> booid snakes, whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa are known <b>to</b> be more <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> the South American red pipesnake Anilius.

5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> Wagner's original {{productions of}} his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> Bevin's original budget.|$|E
50|$|Trimusculids are {{not very}} <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> the siphonariids, another family of marine {{air-breathing}} false-limpets. The trimusculids are in the clade Eupulmonata, and are quite <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> air-breathing land snails.|$|R
25|$|Despite its name, the {{electric}} eel is not <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> the true eels (Anguilliformes), {{but is a}} member of the neotropical knifefish order (Gymnotiformes), which is more <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> the catfish.|$|R

5|$|Phylogenetic studies {{conducted}} by Senter, et al. (2012) and Turner, Makovicky, and Norell (2012) confirmed that Archaeopteryx was {{more closely related}} to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit, et al. (2013) recovered Archaeopteryx as {{more closely related to}} dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna. The authors used {{a modified version of the}} matrix from the study describing Xiaotingia, adding Jinfengopteryx elegans and Eosinopteryx brevipenna to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of Xiaotingia, the analysis conducted by Godefroit, et al. did not find Archaeopteryx to be related particularly <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> Anchiornis and Xiaotingia, which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.|$|E
5|$|Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger, {{and also}} flightless, {{member of the}} genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is {{believed}} to have split, along with the great auk, from a common ancestor. Pinguinus alfrednewtoni lived in the western Atlantic, while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the great auk took over its territory. The great auk was not related <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, Mancalla, Praemancalla, and Alcodes.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E

40|$|Falconer (1989) {{made the}} {{statement}} that traits <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> fitness generally experience greater inbreeding depression than traits less <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> fitness. However, he did not provide statistical support for this statement. In {{a review of the}} literature I provide statistical support for Falconer's (1989) statement by showing that life history traits (<b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> fitness) display more severe inbreeding depression than morphological traits (less <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> fitness). Because inbreeding depression is greater in traits <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> fitness, it may impact the success of colonization. In an investigation of the influence of inbreeding in a colonizing wing dimorphic species of cricket, Gryllus firmus, I have provided further empirical support for Falconer's (1989) statement, in addition to showing that inbreeding does not affect the equilibrium morph frequencies between two the morphs of G. firmus...|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop is tied <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> Soundgarden, since Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led {{to the expansion of}} Sub Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden was one of the only Seattle bands that he liked along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage in the 2015 documentary , Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing Outshined.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E

50|$|By an {{analysis}} published in 2005, Parotocinclus {{is not a}} monophyletic genus. P. jumbo is not <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> P. maculicauda, but is positioned, instead, as a basal lineage of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae. Additionally, P. collinsae is not <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> Parotocinclus maculicauda and may be more <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> the genus Hypoptopoma and four other genera. P. jumbo and P. collinsae may eventually be transferred to new genera. P. bidentatus and P. muriaensis form a monophyletic pair of sister taxa that is more <b>closely</b> related <b>to</b> a subset of species of Parotocinclus (which includes P. maculicauda) than to any other genus of the tribe Otothyrini.|$|R
