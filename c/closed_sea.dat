It attempts to show how some of the past claims have remained over the years and how some of the others have progressed to claims of historic waters. In the final section an attempt is made to show some method for resolving some of the problems that have been shown by projecting a regime which might be used to satisfy both the Soviet Union and the United States for future control of these seas and like seas of other nations...|$|R

Further to that paper, aim of present study is to deepen the subject and try to make the comparison more exhaustive. Reliability of the structural behaviour of the vessel has been assessed by means a comprehensive calculation procedure, which allows determining the entire stress fields acting on the ship structure and the “Structural Response Operator” (SRO) in way of significant structural details...|$|R

5000|$|From 30 BC to 117 AD the Roman Empire came to {{surround}} the Mediterranean by controlling {{most of its}} coasts.

[...] In classical law the ocean was not territorial. However, since the Middle Ages maritime republics like the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice claimed a [...] "Mare clausum" [...] policy in the Mediterranean. Also Nordic kingdoms and England, required passage rates, monopolies on fishing and blocked foreign ships in their neighboring seas.|$|E
50|$|The Golden Chersonese {{appears in}} the map of Ptolemy, which gives some {{geographical}} locations on the peninsula. The earliest surviving maps of Ptolemy however came {{from the end of}} the 13th century. Note that Ptolemy, like many early geographers, believed the Indian Ocean to be a <b>closed</b> <b>sea,</b> and maps based on Ptolemy's work show Golden Chersonese to be located within a closed basin. To the east of the Golden Peninsula is the Great Gulf which is enclosed further east by the border of terra incognita (unknown lands). Arab geographers were aware that the idea of the Indian Ocean as a close basin was mistaken by the 8th century, for example in the work of al-Khwārizmī, Book of the Description of the Earth. They showed that the Indian Ocean may be linked to the World Oceans by connections, with the eastern limit of the inhabited world beyond the Malay Peninsula being the Island of the Jewel in the Sea of Darkness. The Ptolemaic eastern shore became the Dragon's Tail peninsula.|$|E

5000|$|Besides {{the local}} and, {{up to that}} time, {{unimportant}} ports of Trieste and Fiume, the plan also encompassed the integration of Croatian territories, which had been seized from the Ottoman Empire {{during the second half}} of the 17th century: the Gulf of Bakar, Senj and Karlobag where the Habsburgs met the competition of the local powerful landlords who started to develop as ports some of the coastal towns they owned. The Zrinski (Zriny) were the most powerful landowners in Croatia and most of the land that surrounded Fiume (as well as the city of Bakar (Buccari) was in their hands. They developed the port of Buccari, the best natural harbour in the area, comparatively well connected with the hinterland. Alliance with Venice and much lower taxes explain the success of Buccari, where soon the rise in traffic vastly outnumbered that of the Habsburg port of Fiume. Buccari had a lazaretto, founded by a Venetian company. The other family were the Frankopan (Frangipane) who owned and developed the port of Kraljevica (Portorè). These developments came to an abrupt end with the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy. After the end of the rebellion in 1673, that resulted in their defeat all these possessions were confiscated and put under the control of the Hungarian Aulic Chamber, soon transferred to the Imperial Chamber of Inner Austria. The destruction of the most powerful feudal families and their economic might ensured that no similar event would take place during the feudal era. Between Vienna and the Adriatic ports there were no feudal lords capable of competing or disturbing the plans of economic development. One of the big obstacles for the implementation of these policies was the Venetian monopoly on the Adriatic which effectively prevented ships form other countries to fare freely on this <b>closed</b> <b>sea</b> at the time known also as the [...] "Gulf of Venice". Success was achieved under Charles VI. In 1717 after another victorious campaign against the Ottomans (but this time with Venice as its ally) the Adriatic sea was promptly declared free for trade, with Venice no longer opposing it; in 1718 peace was concluded with the Ottoman Empire and a commercial treaty brought important commercial liberties to the Ottoman and Habsburg subjects; in 1719 Trieste and Fiume were declared Free Ports of the Empire of the Habsburgs.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{attempts}} of a centralised economic {{policy in the}} Austrian lands arose immediately after the Thirty Years' War. The Bohemian towns had petitioned Ferdinand to refine its own raw materials into more finished goods for export, and Johann Joachim Becher, the most original and influential of the Austrian cameralists, became the leading force in attempting this conversion. Emperor Leopold I sent him {{on a mission to}} the Netherlands, and Becher was made councillor of commerce (German: Commerzienrat) at Vienna in 1666 where he inspired the creation of a Commerce Commission (Kommerzkollegium) in Vienna. He led the reestablishment of the first postwar silk plantation on the Lower Austrian estates of Hofkammer President Sinzendorf. Becher then subsequently helped create a Kunst- und Werkhaus in which foreign masters trained non-guild artisans in the production of finished goods. By 1672 he had promoted the construction of a wool factory in Linz. Four years later he established a textile workhouse for vagabonds in the Boemian town of Tabor that eventually employed 186 spinners under his own directorship.An edict by Leopold I in 1689 had granted the government the right to monitor and control the number of masters and cut down on the monopoly effect of guild operations. [...] Even previous to this, Becher, who was against all forms of monopoly, surmised that a third of the Austrian lands’ 150,000 artisans were [...] "Schwarzarbeiter" [...] who were not in a guild.Becher sought to balance between the need to reinstate postwar levels of population and production both in the countryside and the towns. Yet, by leaning more seriously on trade and commerce Austrian cameralism helped to transfer attention to the troubles of the monarchy’s urban economies. Before his death Ferdinand II had already taken some corrective steps by attempting to ease the debts of the Bohemian towns and to put limits on some of the land-holding nobility’s commercial rights.Austrian markets had to be opened to world commerce. One of the big obstacles for the implementation of these policies was the Venetian monopoly on the Adriatic which effectively prevented ships form other countries to fare freely on this <b>closed</b> <b>sea</b> at the time known also as the “Gulf of Venice”. Success was achieved under Charles VI. In 1717 after another victorious campaign against the Ottomans (but this time with Venice as its ally) the Adriatic Sea was promptly declared free for trade, with Venice no longer opposing it. In 1718 peace was concluded with the Ottoman Empire and a commercial treaty brought important commercial liberties to the Ottoman and Habsburg subjects. On March 18, 1719 Trieste and Fiume were declared Free Ports (punti franchi) of the Empire of the Habsburgs, with the freihafenpatent. The Oriental Company moved its headquarters from Antwerp to Trieste on the same year.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} focused on finding an optimal {{strategy}} for enhancing the consensus on negotiations over the legal status and regime problems of the Caspian Sea, which has {{caused a lot of}} abortive strives since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The strategic planning process begins with finding a set of major <b>closed</b> <b>sea</b> that has similar geographical features alike Caspian Sea. Then based on expert ideas and background review, it generates a series of fundamental criteria that have influenced the <b>closed</b> <b>sea</b> delimitation. Through a committee of practical experts with diversified professional backgrounds, these criteria were evaluated and classified into internal strengths and weaknesses of the alternative <b>closed</b> <b>sea,</b> as well as external opportunities and threats to them. The Delphi technique also was used to establish expert consensus on key strategies that are important for delimitating the Caspian Sea. In the next section, the decision makers (DMs) determined the factors weight based on the vast amount of information concerning the <b>closed</b> <b>sea</b> delimitation conditions. Then these factors have been weighted based on the Caspian Sea coastal countries' conditions. Finally, this paper assesses the strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) of these criteria, and develops an optimal strategic plan for the Caspian Sea delimitation that can enhance the consensus on Caspian Sea legal regime in future negotiations...|$|E
