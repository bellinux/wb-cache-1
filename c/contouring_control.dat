In this paper, a <b>contouring</b> <b>control</b> method for biaxial feed drive systems is presented, which transforms tracking errors in each feed drive axis into errors that are reference to a moving frame around the desired position. The method is extended to include a referenced adjustment function for reducing inherent contour errors in the moving frame approach. Because friction is a major disturbance in motion control of feed drive systems, a friction compensation method for the <b>contouring</b> <b>control</b> systems is proposed. Since properties of friction cannot be predicted accurately, an estimation method of the friction model parameters is developed, and a robust controller for the estimation errors is designed.

40|$|Abstract—Cogging {{force is}} an {{important}} source of disturbances for linear-motor-driven systems. To obtain a higher level of <b>contouring</b> motion <b>control</b> performance for multi-axes mechanical systems subject to significant nonlinear cogging forces, both the coordinated control of multi-axes motions and the effective compensation of cogging forces are necessary. In addition, the effect of unavoidable velocity measurement noises needs to be sufficiently attenuated. This paper presents a discontinuous projection based desired compensation adaptive robust contouring controller to address these control issues all at once. Specifically, the presented approach explicitly takes into account the specific characteristics of cogging forces in the controller designs and employs the task coordinate formulation for coordinated motion controls. Theoretically, the resulting controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and stead-state contouring accuracy even in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. In addition, the controller also achieves asymptotic output tracking when there are parametric uncertainties only. Comparative experimental results obtained on a high-speed Anorad industrial biaxial precision gantry are presented to verify the excellent contouring performance of the proposed control scheme and the effectiveness of the cogging force compensations.

25|$|The {{operating}} room (OR) {{time required to}} harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts {{is greater than the}} usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such <b>controlled</b> <b>contouring</b> selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation {{to the size of the}} nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant.

In this paper, a novel task polar coordinate frame (TPCF), moving along the desired contour, is proposed to naturally calculate and control the estimated contouring error by the circular approximation, a second-order approximation. The dynamics in the world Cartesian coordinate frame is transformed into radial and angular dynamics in the local polar coordinate frame. By the feedback linearization technique and an input feedforward compensation, the closed-loop dynamics are decoupled {{in terms of the}} estimated contouring error and the angular error, respectively. Proportional-plus-derivative controllers can be assigned to stabilize the individual axis dynamics in the TPCF. By tuning the control parameters, different strengthening on estimated contouring error and angular error can be imposed explicitly and directly. Various experiments on an XY-stage biaxial system with typical contours, a circle and a figure-" 8," were conducted.

40|$|Abstract—To improve overall {{contouring}} performance, it is {{no longer}} possible to neglect dynamic coupling phenomena that occur during contouring operations, especially for linear motor driven systems which often move at high speeds. This paper studies the high performance <b>contouring</b> <b>control</b> of a linear motors driven high-speed/acceleration industrial biaxial gantry. The gantry dynamics is first transformed into a task coordinate frame. A discontinuous projection based adaptive robust controller (ARC) which explicitly takes into account the dynamic coupling effect is then constructed to improve the contouring performance under both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. To reduce the effect of measurement noise, a desired compensation ARC (DCARC) scheme is also presented, in which the adaptive model compensation part depends on the desired contour and parameter estimates only. Comparative experimental results of the proposed algorithms along with a well tuned PID controller are obtained on a high-speed industrial biaxial gantry driven by linear motors. The results verify that both the proposed schemes outperform the PID controller and can achieve good contouring performance even in the presence of parametric uncertainties and uncertain disturbances, and the desired compensation ARC achieves the best contouring performance.

40|$|In {{machining}} applications, {{instead of}} tracking error (the {{difference between the}} actual position and the desired position), contouring error (the minimum distance from the actual position to the desired trajectory) characterizes product quality. In this paper, we propose a generalized moving task coordinate frames based <b>contouring</b> <b>control</b> for parallel kinematics machines, whose dynamics is in general coupled and strongly nonlinear. The Orthopod, a 3 degree-of-freedom purely translational parallel kinematics machine, is introduced as a control plant. The Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation is used to model the system dynamics. The developed dynamic model in Cartesian space is transformed and parametrized by tangential error, normal error, and binormal error in moving task coordinate frames. The contouring error is then approximated by the normal error and the binormal error, which is the projection of tracking error to the normal plane at the desired position. By employing the structural properties of the transformed dynamics, a special feedback linearization, the computed torque control is applied. It leads to a stabilization problem for a second-order linear time-invariant system. Coulumb plus viscous friction model is used to compensate friction effects. Friction parameters are identified by least-squares approach. For comparison purpose, the tracking error based computed torque control is also carried out. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed control scheme not only leads to improved contouring accuracy, but also produces smaller and smoother control input torques, which may contribute to smaller vibration.

Using a dynamical {{model of the}} vehicle, control inputs are computed by receding horizon based controllers, where {{the objective is to}} maximize progress on the track subject to the requirement of staying on the track and avoiding opponents. Two different control formulations are presented. The first controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path planner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The second controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) following the ideas of <b>contouring</b> <b>control.</b> Linear time varying models obtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control NLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time. The resulting QPs have a typical MPC structure and can be solved in the range of milliseconds by recent structure exploiting solvers, which is key to the real-time feasibility of the overall control scheme. Obstacle avoidance is incorporated by means of a high-level corridor planner based on dynamic programming, which generates convex constraints for the controllers according to the current position of opponents and the track layout. The control performance is investigated experimentally using 1 : 43 scale RC race cars, driven at speeds of more than 3 m/s and in operating regions with saturated rear tire forces (drifting).

40|$|High-speed {{machining}} technology {{is becoming increasingly}} important in mod-ern manufacturing industry. With the requirement of high speed to yield high productivity, the precision and accuracy requirement {{becomes more and more}} stringent. In this thesis, research is focused on high-precision trajectory tracking control for high performance motion systems. The dimensional accuracy of the finished part is mainly determined by the contouring error which is different from the conventional tracking error. However, {{it is not easy to}} compute for arbitrary curves. In this work, a simplified contouring error model is presented to approximate the actual contouring error. By defining the Frenet-Serret frame attached to the desired trajectory, the task coordinate frame is obtained. The tracking error can be projected to the task coordinate frame where the tangential and normal errors are defined to approximate the contouring error. Based on the contouring error model, two control schemes on a general class of motion control systems are developed in the task frame: Coordinated posi-tion control and adaptive control. Coordinated position control is a feedback linearization method derived in the task frame to achieve the desired contouring error dynamics. This control scheme requires the exact knowledge of system dy-namics. To enhance the robustness of the controller, adaptive <b>contouring</b> <b>control</b> is proposed in the task frame. This control algorithm is able to handle bounded external disturbances and system parameter variations while maintaining supe-rior contouring tracking performance. Stability analysis was presented together with remarks on selecting controller gains. Experiments are implemented on an AC motor driven X-Y table to test the control algorithms. To provide the knowledge of systems dynamics, modelling and identification methodology for the experimental platform are presented in detail along with the identification experiments. Experimental results of the proposed control schemes indicate significant improvement of the contouring accuracy when compared with other conventional control algorithms under the same high speed.
