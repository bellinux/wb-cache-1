5000|$|Early in the 1980’s {{almost two}} decades before the {{positive}} psychology field was christened, Cooperrider began to question the deficit-based <b>change</b> <b>field</b> and the root metaphor that “human systems are problems to be solved,” and he observed that the pervasive problematizing perspective was constraining and limiting, just as industrial-era machine metaphors were also limiting. Cooperrider and Srivastva, in their earliest work at the number one heart center the world, the Cleveland Clinic, engaged in a radical reversal of the traditional problem-analytic approach. Influenced by the writings of Albert Schweitzer on “reverence for life,” they determined that organizations are not institutional machines incessantly in need of repair and that deteriorate steadily and over time. Rather organizations are, fundamentally, living systems and centers of human relatedness, alive and embedded in amplifying networks of infinite strengths. Instead of problems-to-be-solved, human systems are mysteries-to-be-appreciated; {{in a very real}} way they are products of the miracle of human interaction and relatedness. And the more we study “what gives life” versus “what’s wrong” the more we move in the direction or become what we study. Instead of studying low morale, for example, we should study human flourishing in the workplace “because human systems move in the direction of what they study.” The simple act of observation in a human system changes the phenomenon itself. In physics it’s called the Heisenberg Effect. But in human systems it’s even more powerful. Cooperrider called it “the exponential inquiry effect” to indicate how our first questions, like the early stage of a snowball, can grow into exponential tipping point movements. That's why he writes: “We live in worlds our questions create.” ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{correlation}} between abrupt permanent <b>changes</b> of magnetic <b>field</b> during X-class flares observed by the GONG and HMI instruments, and the hard X-ray (HXR) emission observed by RHESSI, to relate the photospheric <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> to the coronal restructuring and investigate {{the origin of the}} <b>field</b> <b>changes.</b> We find that spatially the early RHESSI emission corresponds well to locations of the strong <b>field</b> <b>changes.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> occur predominantly in the regions of strong magnetic field near the polarity inversion line (PIL). The later RHESSI emission does not correspond to significant <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> as the flare footpoints are moving away from the PIL. Most of the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> start before or around the start time of the detectable HXR signal, and they end {{at about the same time}} or later than the detectable HXR flare emission. Some of the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> propagate with speed close to that of the HXR footpoint at a later phase of the flare. The propagation of the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> often takes place after the strongest peak in the HXR signal when the footpoints start moving away from the PIL, i. e. the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> follow the same trajectory as the HXR footpoint, but at an earlier time. Thus, the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> and HXR emission are spatio-temporally related but not co-spatial nor simultaneous. We also find that in the strongest X-class flares the amplitudes of the <b>field</b> <b>changes</b> peak a few minutes earlier than the peak of the HXR signal. We briefly discuss this observed time delay in terms of the formation of current sheets during eruptions. Comment: accepted for publication in the Ap...|$|R

40|$|Organizations need {{to change}} {{constantly}} for their survival and success, and project management has been extensively used to implement organizational change. However, studies show only less than 20 percent of organizational change projects actually succeed. This may indicate {{the lack of a}} valid model for project managers to successfully implement and manage organizational change projects since what is currently available is a wide range of organizational change models that neither are in a project management context nor pay adequate emphasis on the people-side of change. Under these circumstances, this paper has attempted to build an integrated change model in a project management context. To construct such a change model, we integrates widely cited change models in the organizational <b>change</b> <b>field</b> and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) (Prochaska, DiClemente, 1984, 1994) in the individual behavior <b>change</b> <b>field</b> with th...|$|E
40|$|Theories {{have long}} implicated {{magnetic}} reconnection in {{many aspects of}} coronal activity including the general process of coronal heating. Magnetic reconnection is fundamentally a <b>change</b> <b>field</b> line topology resulting from some non-ideal term in the generalized Ohm’s law. Such a non-ideal effect may dissipate energy directly, or it may not, but it will topologically <b>change</b> <b>field</b> lines at a rate proportional to the integrated electric field,. In any model where magnetic reconnection heats the corona the heating rate will scale with this rate of reconnection. We find that the observed scaling between heating power and reconnection rate is consistent with models where photospheric motions stress the coronal fields quasi-statically and reconnection releases the energy suddenly, but does not necessarily dissipate it. Such models are, in particular, consistent with the observation that X-ray luminosity of a structure scales almost linearly with the magnetic flux of that structure. Key words: Magnetic reconnection. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEven though {{critique}} to IPCC {{is certainly}} not new, the climate controversies of 2009 and 2010 brought this critique again to the fore in public media. The paper contributes to this ongoing debate, and investigates empirically {{the impact of the}} four Assessment Reports of the IPCC on scientific publications and science, through scientometric analyses of cited references to IPCC reports. The results indicate, among other things, that the aggregate impact of IPCC reports on scientific publications has increased through each consecutive assessment report, independently from the increase of the climate <b>change</b> <b>field,</b> showing a pattern which suggests that the references are quite generic. Both disciplinary distribution and geographical distribution {{of the impact of the}} reports are skewed, the former towards geophysical sciences, the latter towards western/developed countries. However, this skewness is decreasing over time. Given the increasing impact further away from the climate <b>change</b> <b>field,</b> it is important that the IPCC becomes more transparent about its internal processes and main conclusions...|$|E
