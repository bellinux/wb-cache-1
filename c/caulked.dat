25|$|The Fish Commission chose {{a design}} by C. W. Copeland of the United States Lighthouse Board, and the Pusey and Jones Company built the ship at Wilmington, Delaware. Fish Hawk had a fore-and-aft two-masted {{schooner}} rig, coal-fired steam propulsion, and twin screws, and {{was intended for}} coastal work rather than oceanic research. She had an iron hull sheathed with about 3 inches (76.2mm) of yellow pine, <b>caulked</b> and coppered. Above the main deck she was of wooden construction. The pilot house, captain's quarters, and a laboratory were on a promenade deck extending along the entire length and across the entire width of the ship.|$|E
25|$|Integration {{with the}} setting extends even to small details. For example, where glass meets stone walls no metal frame is used; rather, {{the glass and}} its {{horizontal}} dividers were run into a <b>caulked</b> recess in the stonework so that the stone walls appear uninterrupted by glazing. From the cantilevered living room, a stairway leads directly down to the stream below, and in a connecting space which connects the main house with the guest and servant level, a natural spring drips water inside, which is then channeled back out. Bedrooms are small, some with low ceilings to encourage people outward toward the open social areas, decks, and outdoors.|$|E

Reluctantly, Ahab orders the harpooneers {{to inspect the}} casks. Queequeg, sweating all day below decks, develops a chill and soon is almost mortally feverish. The carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness. Yet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health. Henceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later <b>caulked</b> and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caulk</b> {{can refer}} {{either to the}} <b>caulking</b> {{substance}} or {{to the process of}} applying it. <b>Caulking</b> as a term has spread to the building trade, meaning the activity of closing up joints and gaps in buildings.

50|$|<b>Caulks</b> Creek is {{a stream}} in St. Louis County in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is a {{tributary}} of Bonhomme Creek. <b>Caulks</b> Creek has {{the name of the}} local <b>Caulk</b> family.|$|R
50|$|Backer rod, {{also called}} backer {{material}} or back-up rod, is a flexible foam product used behind <b>caulking</b> to increase elasticity, reduce consumption, force the <b>caulking</b> {{into contact with}} the sides of the joint creating a better bond, determine the thickness of the <b>caulking,</b> and define the cross-section hour-glass shape of the <b>caulk.</b> The backer rod also acts as a bond breaker to keep the <b>caulking</b> from sticking {{to the bottom of the}} opening called a three-sided bond; with the <b>caulking</b> only adhering to the sides of the opening in an hour-glass shape it can flex more easily and is less likely to tear. Backer rods can also be used to reduce consumption of the <b>caulking</b> by filling part of the joints.|$|R
25|$|In {{its natural}} post-glacial state, the river's valley was flat-bottomed: it had formed {{the bed of}} the glacial Lake Ancholme, on an outwash delta, as the ice retreated, and {{consequently}} was fenny. There is evidence that boats have used the river from early times, for there have been three significant archaeological finds of ancient boats. Logboats have been found at Brigg and Appleby, and a planked boat was found at Brigg in 1888. Professor McGrail conducted a re-excavation of the site in 1974, to discover the bottom of a flat-bottomed boat, made from oak planks, sewn together and <b>caulked</b> with moss. The boat was thus similar in construction to the Ferriby Boats found on the northern shore of the Humber, but was some 500 years younger, being carbon-dated to around 800BC.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the {{portside}} hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore <b>caulked,</b> a section of wood around the transom removed, and the repair block inserted and the transom finished.|$|E
25|$|Within {{an hour of}} {{receiving}} this alarming report some Indians brought word that Jean Ribault with two hundred men was {{in the neighborhood of}} the place where the two French ships had been wrecked. They were said to be suffering greatly, for the Trinity had broken to pieces farther down the shore, and their provisions had all been lost. They had been reduced to living on roots and grasses and to drinking the impure water collected in the holes and pools along their route. Like the first party, their only hope lay in a return to Fort Caroline. Le Challeux wrote that they had saved a small boat from the wreck; this they <b>caulked</b> with their shirts, and thirteen of the company had set out for Fort Caroline in search of assistance, and had not returned. As Ribault and his companions made their way northward {{in the direction of the}} fort, they eventually found themselves in the same predicament as the previous party, cut off by Matanzas Inlet and river from the mainland, and unable to cross.|$|E
50|$|Traditional <b>caulking</b> {{was made}} from {{combining}} the fibers of cotton and oakum, a type of hemp rope fiber soaked in pine tar. The sticky <b>caulk</b> mixture would be driven into a wedge-shaped seam between the wooden boat hull planks, with a <b>caulking</b> mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a <b>caulking</b> iron to create a watertight seal.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in {{construction}} materials, such as <b>caulking</b> used around windows and expansion joints, may constitute {{a source of}} PCB contamination in the building interiors and in surrounding soil. Several studies of soil contamination have been conducted around buildings where the <b>caulking</b> has been removed by grinding or scraping. The PCBs in soil may have been generated {{in the process of}} removing the <b>caulking,</b> but natural weathering and deterioration of the <b>caulking</b> may have also been a source. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to measure PCB levels in soil surrounding buildings where PCB-containing <b>caulk</b> was still in place, and to evaluate the mobility of the PCBs from <b>caulking</b> using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 1311). DISCUSSION: We found soil PCB contamination ranging from 3. 3 to 34 mg/kg around buildings with undisturbed <b>caulking</b> that contained 10, 000 – 36, 200 mg/kg PCBs. The results of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (leachate concentrations of 76 – 288 mg PCB/L) suggest that PCBs in <b>caulking</b> can be mobilized, apparently as complexes with dissolved organic matter that also leach off the <b>caulking</b> material. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Although these new findings are based on a small sample size, they demonstrate the need for a national survey of PCBs in building materials and in soil surrounding these buildings. Because the buildings constructed during the time the PCB <b>caulking</b> was in use (1960 s and 1970 s) include schools, hospitals, and apartment buildings, the potential for exposure of children is a particular concern. It is necessary to reconsider the practice of disposing of old PCB <b>caulking</b> removed during building renovations in conventional landfills, given the apparent mobility of PCBs from the <b>caulking</b> material. Disposal of some <b>caulking</b> material in nonhazardous landfills might lead to high PCB levels in landfill leachate...|$|R
25|$|The Pequod is now heading {{southeast}} toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard {{from the}} mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin {{be used as}} a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and <b>caulked.</b> Next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, calls himself a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.|$|E
500|$|McNish {{used the}} mast of {{another of the}} boats, the Stancomb Wills, to {{strengthen}} the keel and build up the small 22foot (6.7m) long boat, so it would withstand the seas during the 800mile (1480km) trip. He <b>caulked</b> it using a mixture of seal blood and flour, and, using wood and nails taken from packing cases and the runners of the sledges, he built a makeshift frame which was then covered with canvas. Shackleton was worried the boat [...] "bore a strong likeness to stage scenery", only giving the appearance of sturdiness. He later admitted that the crew could not have lived through the voyage without it.|$|E

500|$|Riou {{gave the}} note to Mr Clements, {{the master of}} the Guardian, who was given command of the launch.

The Guardian was nearly awash by now with 16 feet of water in the hold, but a bumping noise on the deck attracted attention, and on investigation was found to be a number of casks that had broken free and were floating in the hold, trapped under the lower gundeck. [...] Realising that this was providing extra buoyancy, Riou had the gun deck hatches sealed and <b>caulked,</b> while another sail was sent under the hull to control the flooding. Having now created a substitute hull out of his deck, Riou raised what little sail he could and began the long journey back to land, with the pumps being continuously manned.|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} <b>caulking</b> {{the home}} to reduce air infiltration and increase energy efficiency. Where to <b>caulk,</b> types of <b>caulking</b> materials, and techniques for <b>caulking</b> are presented. Is your home an energy waster? Even in a well-insulated home, energy can be wasted through air infiltration. One-third to one- half of a typical fuel bill {{is the result of}} air infiltration. Air leaks around doors and windows, foundations, chimneys, exterior plumbing, or other parts of the structure. In the winter, air heated by your furnace is lost to the outside; in summer, hot outdoor air puts an extra load on your air conditioner. Weatherizing your home by <b>caulking</b> and weatherstripping can effectively reduce energy waste. In fact, the cost of <b>caulking</b> and weatherstripping can usually be paid back in energy savings in only one or two years. This makes weatherizing one of your best investments in energy conservation. Weatherizing to limit air infiltration also reduces drafts as well as noise and dust, making your home more comfortable. Even better, it is something that you, the homeowner, can easily do...|$|R
50|$|In riveted {{steel or}} iron ship construction, <b>caulking</b> was {{a process of}} {{rendering}} seams watertight by driving a thick, blunt chisel-like tool into the plating adjacent to the seam. This {{had the effect of}} displacing the metal into a close fit with the adjoining piece. Originally done by hand much like wooden vessel <b>caulking,</b> pneumatic tools were later employed.

500|$|Above the orlop lay {{the main}} deck which housed the {{heaviest}} guns. The {{side of the}} hull on the main deck level had seven gunports on each side fitted with heavy lids {{that would have been}} watertight when closed. This was also the highest deck that was <b>caulked</b> and waterproof. Along the sides of the main deck there were cabins under the forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to the carpenter, barber-surgeon, pilot and possibly also the master gunner and some of the officers. The top deck in the hull structure was the upper deck (or weather deck) which was exposed to the elements in the waist. It was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns. Over the open waist the upper deck was entirely covered with a coarse netting as a defence measure against boarding. Though very little of the upper deck has survived, {{it has been suggested that}} it housed the main living quarters of the crew underneath the sterncastle. A drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible [...] "piss-dale", a general urinal to complement the regular toilets that would probably have been located in the bow.|$|E
500|$|After launching, {{the sisters}} were {{transferred}} to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed.

The monitor [...] accidentally rammed Admiral Lazarev in Kronstadt harbor on 22 October 1871. The former was only slightly damaged, but the latter had a [...] hole punched in its hull. Water poured in and the ship took on a list of 8° and nearly capsized before other ships in the harbor could use their pumps to reduce the flooding. The ship's watertight bulkheads proved to be poorly <b>caulked</b> and sealed and the commission that investigated the accident recommended that the bulkheads be tested during construction by intentionally flooding them. The Navy ignored this recommendation, which directly led to the loss of the coast-defense ship [...] in 1897. Another recommendation which was followed was to attach all of the ship's pumps to the bilges to allow a flooded compartment to be pumped out as quickly as possible. This modification was tested aboard Admiral Lazarevin 1872 and became standard practice for the navy.|$|E

She was refitted at Deptford on the River Thames for the sum of £2,294, almost the price of the ship itself. The hull was sheathed and <b>caulked</b> to protect against shipworm, and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins, a powder magazine and storerooms. The new cabins provided around [...] of floorspace apiece and were allocated to Cook and the Royal Society representatives: naturalist Joseph Banks, Banks' assistants Daniel Solander and Herman Spöring, astronomer Charles Green, and artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan. These cabins encircled the officer's mess. The Great Cabin {{at the rear of the}} deck was designed as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society. On the rear lower deck, cabins facing on to the mate's mess were assigned to Lieutenants Zachary Hickes and John Gore, ship's surgeon William Monkhouse, the gunner Stephen Forwood, ship's master Robert Molyneux, and the captain's clerk Richard Orton.

A document written by Thomas Cromwell in 1536 specifies that the Mary Rose and six other ships were [...] "made new" [...] during his service under the king, though it is unclear which years {{he was referring to}} and what [...] "made new" [...] actually meant. A later document from January 1536 by an anonymous author states that the Mary Rose and other ships were [...] "new made", and dating of timbers from the ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536. This would have coincided with the controversial dissolution of the monasteries that resulted in a major influx of funds into the royal treasury. The nature and extent of this repair is unknown. Many experts, including Margaret Rule, the project leader for the raising of the Mary Rose, have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from clinker planking to carvel planking, and that it was only after 1536 that the ship took on the form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in the 20th century. Marsden has speculated that it could even mean that the Mary Rose was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th-century ships, with a rounded, rather than square, stern and without the main deck gunports.|$|E
