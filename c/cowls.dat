A pilothouse that had been added on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. Benningtons mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation <b>cowls</b> were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18months of inactivity, Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet <b>cowls</b> and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; {{it was found that the}} DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of flight tests with three different airplanes using several types of low-drag <b>cowling</b> for radial air-cooled engines. The greater part of the tests were made with a Curtiss XF 7 Cc- 1 (Sea Hawk) with a 410 horsepower. Wasp engine, using three fuselage nose shapes and six types of outer <b>cowling.</b> The six cowlings were: a narrow ring, a wide ring, a wide <b>cowling</b> similar in the original NACA <b>cowling,</b> a thick ring incorporating an exhaust collector, a single-surface <b>cowling</b> shaped like the outer surface of the exhaust-collector <b>cowling,</b> and polygon-ring <b>cowling,</b> of which the angle of the straight sections with the thrust line could be varied over a wide range...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the external <b>cowl</b> angle, and hence the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag, were investigated on a two-dimensional model. One method used at both on- and off-design Mach numbers was {{the addition of a}} <b>cowl</b> visor that had the inner surface parallel to the free stream at 0 deg angle of attack. The other method investigated consisted in replacing the original <b>cowl</b> by a flatter <b>cowl</b> that also provided internal contraction. Both the visor and the internal-contraction <b>cowl</b> reduced the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag 64 percent or more. The visor had little effect on inlet performance at the design Mach number except to reduce the stability range slightly. At off-design, the visor caused an increase in critical pressure recovery...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving oast {{house is}} at Golford, Cranbrook near Tunbridge Wells. It dates from {{sometime in the}} 17th Century and closely mirrors the first documentary evidence on oasts soon after their introduction of hops into England in the mid 16th century. Early oast houses were simply adapted barns but, by the 18th Century, the distinctive tall buildings with conical roofs had been developed to increase the draught. At first these were square but around 1800 roundel kilns were developed {{in the belief that}} they were more efficient. Square kilns remained more popular in Hereford and Worcester and came back into fashion in the south east in the later 19th Century.

40|$|Adjustable <b>cowling</b> flaps, an {{adjustable}}-length <b>cowling</b> skirt, and {{a bottom}} opening with adjustable flap were tested as means {{of controlling the}} rate of cooling-air flow through an air-cooled radial-engine <b>cowling.</b> The devices were tested in the NACA 20 -foot tunnel on a model wing-nacelle-propeller combination, through an airspeed range of 20 to 80 miles per hour, and with the propeller blade angle set 23 degrees at 0. 75 of the tip radius. The resistance of the engine to air flow through the <b>cowling</b> was simulated by a perforated plate. The {{results indicated that the}} adjustable <b>cowling</b> flap and the bottom opening with adjustable flap were about equally effective on the basis of pressure drop obtainable and that both were more effective means of increasing the pressure drop through the <b>cowling</b> than the adjustable-length skirt.

500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford twin-choke carburettor. The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp <b>cowls.</b> All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E

The name variant Spens first {{appears as}} Simon del Spens, dated 1300, in the [...] "Charters of Gisburn Priory", Yorkshire, England, {{during the reign of}} Edward I. Spence, another form of Spens, means both [...] "the place where {{provisions}} are kept" [...] and the [...] "clerk of the kitchen". This form of the name was popular in both the north of England and in Scotland. In Fife the word referred to [...] "a spare room beside the kitchen", and in England to a [...] "yard, enclosure or buttery"—simply an abbreviation of despencer referring to the household store. The principal Scottish family of Clan Spens descend from one of the ancient Earls of Fife. John [...] "Dispensator or Le Dispenser" [...] appeared in a list of the tenants and vassals of Walter fitz Alan High Steward of Scotland in the period 1161–1171.

500|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Genesis planet are the alien worms that rapidly evolve from microbes on Spock's coffin. The creatures start as small, slimy crawlers, then grow to lengths of [...] The small worms were created by injecting molten [...] "Hot-Melt" [...] vinyl into epoxy polymer molds that were immediately put into cold water to create a translucent product. The resulting hundred or so creatures were painted and coated with methacyl, a slippery, slimy coating. Each worm was attached to an elevated platform by a piece of fishing line; the lines were tied to rods underneath the set. Offscreen helpers pushed the rods or pulled fishing line to create motion; the scene required many takes because the fishing line would periodically flash at the camera. The larger worms proved more problematic, with filming taking place at ILM and Paramount Stage15. Similar to The Wrath of Khans parasitic Ceti eels, the worms featured cobra-like <b>cowls</b> and a ringed mouth of teeth. ILM built one of the worms with more articulation than the others; Ralston operated the creature {{through a hole in}} the set floor with his hand stuck inside the creature. The other worms were animated using pneumatic bladders that caused air to pass through hoses in sequence, creating an undulating motion. During the scene the worms attack Kruge, who kills one of them. The usual method for achieving the effect of the creature wrapping itself around Kruge would have been to film the sequence in reverse, but this posed problems: the slime coating Kruge would have been out of place with reverse filming, and multiple takes would ruin the Klingon makeup Lloyd wore. ILM's solution involved rigging the worm with fishing lines that were pulled in a choreographed fashion by multiple off-screen helpers to simulate the wrapping movement. When small pieces of the Klingon uniforms caught or snapped the fishing lines, Ralston resorted to steel cables.|$|E
