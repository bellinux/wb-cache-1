Selena states that she stops herself from making a mistake that <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> his chance of a fair trial.|$|E

He told NHK Television that about 200billion yen that was remaining from the budget for the concurrent fiscal year that would end on 31 March {{would be used to}} fund the immediate recovery efforts. Additional measures could also hurt Japan's public debt (which is already the highest in the world). This additional spending <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> demand for government bonds.|$|E

In the {{following}} weeks before the flag was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, were arrested for removing or attempting to remove the flag as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. The attempts to remove the flag were criticized by several S.C.

The board openly distrusted the German and feared the international complications that <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> the core business. Schäffer's victorious reports of his treaty with Kuamualii were delivered to Saint Petersburg in August, and around the same time European newspapers picked up rumors of Russian expansion in the Pacific. The directors of the Company now considered supporting Schäffer, but government approval depended on the opinion of foreign minister Karl Nesselrode who in turn relied on the opinion of Count von Liven, the ambassador in London.|$|E

Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, or helping players stay in a safe area by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in any way, they should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game.

500|$|The pilot director, David Nutter, {{was looking}} through {{pictures}} of actors and stumbled on Tom Welling's image. When {{he asked about}} Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did {{not want him to}} do the role because it <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part. Welling's initial fears were quelled after reading the script, when he realized that the show was not about Clark [...] "... being a super hero ...," [...] but more about the character attempting to live a normal life as a teenager.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2015, {{just over}} two weeks after its wide release, Universal pulled the film from 2,072 theaters in the United States. Variety said the film {{suffered}} from fierce competition {{at the box office}}, possible public weariness with Jobs and the low profile of Fassbender in the title role, and that the underperformance at the box office <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> the film's award chances. After his film was pulled from wide release in the U.S., Danny Boyle expressed disappointment at the box office performance of Steve Jobs, while suggesting that Universal expanded the film's release [...] "too wide too soon" [...] and that the studio's move was [...] "arrogant".|$|E

From a young age, he {{exhibited}} the substantial hand strength required for finger billiards. When he {{was less than a}} year old, he <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> his mother with his grip; she gave him chunks of bread to squeeze instead. Adams was large for his age, and in 1863, he disguised his youth, and joined the Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers, with whom he served [...] for three years, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War. After being discharged, Adams worked as a carpenter from 1872 to 1875, and then became a traveling salesman for the American Sterling-Silver Company.|$|E

500|$|The Florida State {{defense was}} {{considered}} key to reining in Tech quarterback Vick. The Seminoles allowed less than 100rushing {{yards per game}} on average, and intercepted 22passes during the regular season. The Seminoles were ranked 15th nationally in pass defense {{at the end of}} the regular season but had allowed increasing amounts of pass yardage in the latter games of the season. Despite that fact, the Florida State defense's main concern was Michael Vick's ability to run the football. Said Florida State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews: [...] "A guy like that usually gives us problems, considering the type of (43 gap) defense we run. When a quarterback gets out of the pocket, that <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> us for big yardage." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{diplomatic}} philosophy {{behind the}} League represented {{a fundamental shift}} from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Great Powers of World War I (France, the UK, Italy and Japan were the {{permanent members of the}} executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that [...] "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} the poorest {{performance}} of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, {{considered one of the}} nations best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy candidate coming into the game, was [...] "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". The Daily Texan predicted that the game <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking at the numbers from what Reggie Bush did last week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season one returned {{for the second}} season, including Daniel Baldwin, Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Andre Braugher, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Melissa Leo, Jon Polito and Kyle Secor. The only permanent cast member not to return was Wendy Hughes, who previously played medical examiner Carol Blythe; her absence was never explained on-screen. While {{the rest of the}} cast was contractually obliged to return, many of them had offers for other films, television shows or plays, and the logistics of arranging their schedules so all of them could return for the show was difficult. In an interview, Fontana claimed the cast was contractually entitled to be paid for 13 episodes but they all agreed to take less money and come back for the shortened-season. The uncertainty over whether Homicide would be renewed or not created a great deal of stress for some cast members. Polito said of the feeling, [...] "Where is limbo? It's in Baltimore." [...] Baldwin in particular expressed frustration with NBC for failing to renew the show for a full season and said he feared the uncertainty <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> his film career: ...|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it <b>could</b> <b>hurt</b> his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
