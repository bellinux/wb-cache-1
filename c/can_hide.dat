5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> behind cover, vault over obstacles, and shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that can be manipulated to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the emphasis is on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> under to avoid visual detection.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E

5|$|Miles, Richard, and Ben {{go back to}} {{the barracks}} to get some C4 that Ben {{secretly}} kept in his closet behind the bookcase. When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E

5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E

25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is blacked out to show he cannot be seen. Often, {{even if he is}} seen, if he <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for a certain amount of time, however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} considered good practice to make all data private or protected, and to make public only those functions {{that are part of}} a minimal interface for users of the class.

25|$|In addition, {{off-balance}} sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> {{the extent of}} leverage of the securitizing firm, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an under-pricing of credit risk. Off-balance sheet securitizations also played {{a large role in}} the high leverage level of U.S. financial institutions before the financial crisis, and the need for bailouts.|$|E
25|$|B. {{constrictor}} flourishes in a {{wide variety}} of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid semidesert country. However, it prefers to live in rainforest due to the humidity and temperature, natural cover from predators, and vast amount of potential prey. It is commonly found in or along rivers and streams, as it is a very capable swimmer. Boa constrictors also occupy the burrows of medium-sized mammals, where they <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> from potential predators.|$|E

Blood tests should reveal that the horse's CPK concentration and AST levels are normal before the horse is returned to work.|$|E
25|$|One {{point that}} the French had a major problem with was the concept of sanctuary. As long as the revolutionaries who are {{fighting}} a guerilla war have a sanctuary, in which they <b>can</b> <b>hide</b> out, recoup after losses, and store supplies, {{it is almost impossible}} for any foreign enemy to ever destroy them. In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Báº±ng.|$|E
