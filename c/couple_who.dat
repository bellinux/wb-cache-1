6000|$|He {{had spoken}} {{loud enough for}} the waiter to hear him. Arnold's look of perplexity was {{instantly}} reflected {{on the face of}} Mr. Bishopriggs. The head-waiter at Craig Fernie possessed an immense experience of the manners and customs of newly-married people on their honeymoon trip. He had been a second father (with excellent pecuniary results) to innumerable brides and bridegrooms. He knew young married couples in all their varieties:--The <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> try to behave {{as if they had been}} married for many years; the <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> attempt no concealment, and take advice from competent authorities about them. The <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> are bashfully talkative before third persons; the <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> are bashfully silent under similar circumstances. The <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> don't know what to do, the <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> wish it was over; the <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> must never be intruded upon without careful preliminary knocking at the door; the <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> can eat and drink in the intervals of [...] "bliss," [...] and the other <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> can't. But the bridegroom who stood helpless on one side of the door, and the bride who remained locked in on the other, were new varieties of the nuptial species, even in the vast experience of Mr. Bishopriggs himself.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} effect of {{congruent}} religious orientations, religious problem-solving styles, and marital stress on the marital satisfaction of religious couples.

Moreover, this congruent orientation was expected to mediate marital stress. Congruent styles of religious problem-solving were also predicted to mediate marital stress. More specifically, <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> employed a collaborative approach to religious problemsolving were expected to demonstrate higher marital satisfaction than <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> employed other styles of religious problem-solving. Results confirmed that marital stress was inversely related to marital satisfaction. Intrinsic religious orientation and religious problem solving styles also predicted marital satisfaction for husbands and wives, even after controlling for social desirability.
