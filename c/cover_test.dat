40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{using the}} Mercury language to implement and design ILP algorithms, presenting our own ILP system IMP. Mercury provides faster execution than Prolog. Since Mercury is a purely declarative language, run-time assertion of induced clauses is prohibited. Instead IMP uses a problem-specific interpreter of ground representations of induced clauses. The interpreter is used both for <b>cover</b> <b>testing</b> and bottom clause generation. The Mercury source for this interpreter is generated automatically from the user’s background knowledge using Moose, a Mercury parser generator. Our results include some encouraging results on IMP’s <b>cover</b> <b>testing</b> speed, but overall IMP is still generally {{a little slower}} than ALEPH. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{unilateral}} <b>cover</b> <b>test</b> {{is performed}} {{by having the}} patient focus on an object then covering the fixating eye and observing {{the movement of the}} other eye. If the eye was exotropic, covering the fixating eye will cause an inwards movement; and esotropic if covering the fixating eye will cause an outwards movement. The alternating <b>cover</b> <b>test,</b> or cross <b>cover</b> <b>test</b> is used to detect total deviation (tropia + phoria).|$|E
