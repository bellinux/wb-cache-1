5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and <b>chemical</b> <b>compatibility</b> of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
25|$|From an {{electrical}} {{point of view}} the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual cathode of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually ion-conductivity in liquids. But {{it is also a}} chemical mixture of solvents with acid or alkali additives, which must be non-corrosive (chemically inert) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its expected lifetime. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, <b>chemical</b> <b>compatibility</b> with aluminum, and low cost.

40|$|Strained-layer {{semiconductor}} films offer tremendous potential {{with regards}} to optoelectronic applications for high speed communications, mobile communications, sensing, and novel logic devices. It is an unfortunate reality {{that many of the}} possible film/substrate combinations that could be exploited technologically are off limits because of large differences in lattice parameters, <b>chemical</b> <b>compatibilities,</b> or thermal expansion rates. These mechanical, chemical, and thermal incompatibilities manifest themselves primarily in terms of lattice defects such as dislocations and antiphase boundaries, and in some cases through enhanced surface roughness. An additional limitation, from a production point of view, is money. Device manufacturers as a rule want the cheapest substrate possible. Freeing the heteroepitaxial world of the bonds of (near) lattice matching would vastly expand the types of working devices that could be grown. As a result, a great deal of effort has been expended finding schemes to integrate dissimilar film/substrate materials while preserving the perfection of the film layer. One such scheme receiving significant attention lately is the so-called compliant substrate approach...|$|R

Targeting of intravenous chemotherapy to the peritoneal surface is facilitated by the intraperitoneal heat.

METHODS: We mixed one dose of levalbuterol inhalation solution con-centrate (1. 25 mg/ 0. 5 mL) with one dose of ipratropium bromide (0. 5 mg/ 2. 5 mL), cromolyn sodium (20 mg/ 2 mL), acetylcysteine sodium (1, 000 mg/ 5 mL), or budesonide (0. 5 mg/ 2 mL).

40|$|High-pressure {{multi-hole}} injectors for direct-injection spark-ignition engines {{have shown}} enhanced fuel atomisation and flexibility in fuel targeting by {{selection of the}} number and angle of the nozzle holes. The nozzle internal flow is known to influence the characteristics of spray formation; hence, understanding its mechanisms is essential for improving mixture preparation. However, currently, no data exist for fuel temperatures representative of real engine operation, especially at low-load high-temperature conditions with early injection strategies {{that can lead to}} phase change due to fuel flash-boiling upon injection. This challenge is further complicated by the predicted fuel stocks, which may include new (e. g. bio-derived) components. The physical/chemical properties of such components can differ markedly from gasoline, and {{it is important to have}} the capability to study their effects on in-nozzle flow and spray formation, taking under consideration their different <b>chemical</b> <b>compatibilities</b> with optical materials as well. The current article presents the design and development of a real-size quartz optical nozzle, 200 [*]µm in diameter, suitable for high-temperature applications and also compatible with new fuels such as alcohols. First, the internal geometry of a typical real multi-hole injector was analysed by electron microscopy. Mass flow was measured, and relevant fluid mechanics dimensionless parameters were derived. Laser and mechanical drilling of the quartz nozzle holes were compared. Abrasive flow machining of the optical nozzles was also performed and analysed by microscopy in comparison to the real injector. Initial validation results with a high-speed camera showed successful imaging of microscopic in-nozzle flow and cavitation phenomena, coupled to downstream spray formation, under a variety of conditions including high fuel temperature flash-boiling effects. The current work used gasoline and iso-octane to provide proof-of-concept images of the optical nozzle, and future work will include testing of a range of fuels, some of which will also be bio-derived...|$|R
