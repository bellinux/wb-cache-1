50|$|<b>Camaïeu</b> (also called en <b>camaïeu)</b> is a {{technique}} that employs two or three tints of a single color, other than gray, to create a monochromatic image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called grisaille; when in yellow, cirage.|$|E

50|$|The {{church of}} Saint Jean Baptiste and its ambitious campanile {{are more than}} local landmarks, {{the pride of the}} village and the most famous masterpieces of the late Baroque {{architecture}} of Corsica. The church was built from 1680 and provided with a facade designed by the Milanese architect Domenico Baïna, which was completed about 1707. Baïna also designed the sumptuous campanile that rises in five stages to 45 meters, and is visible far and wide, finished about 1720. The interior frescoes en <b>camaïeu</b> were carried out in the 1880s by Girolamo dela Porta.|$|E
5000|$|The apothecary’s shop of {{the ancient}} sisters' hospital, of the 18th century. In 1700, a rich draper, Etienne Pollo, is {{responsible}} for the founding of Thoissey’s hospital. In 1701, the duke of Maine gave the letters patent for the creation of “L’Hôpital de la Charité”. The apothecary's shop was built between 1731 and 1735. Walnut boiseries on the walls are the work of Jean Noblet, master carpenter. The ceiling was painted by Lugnot on a [...] marouflaged canvas (cf. photo). About 60 faience pots from Nevers decorated with a cobalt blue <b>camaieu</b> were used to collect the substances used by the apothecary, they were placed in niches and Renaissance style sideboards.|$|E

50|$|The estate stood {{within a}} day's ride of Westminster, making it eminently {{suitable}} for an active courtier; there the Cecils entertained Queen Elizabeth {{for three days}} in 1599. John Thorpe's undated plan of Wimbledon manor house's ground floor and forecourts of ca 1609 suggests that they were about twelve acres in extent, divided among eleven separate spaces, featuring plantations, walks, and parterres, laid out asymmetrically on the sloping site. The house was damaged in 1628 by the accidental igniting of gunpowder stored there. The glories of this house after repairs had been effected were concentrated in the long Gallery, one of two in the house, which was richly painted and marbleized, no doubt by Francis Cleyn, who was responsible also for the exterior that was painted en <b>camaieu</b> in tones of yellow and burnt ochre.|$|E

5000|$|Indoors, Neoclassicism made a {{discovery}} of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of Le Antichità di Ercolano (The Antiquities of Herculaneum). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed {{that even the most}} classicizing interiors of the Baroque, or the most [...] "Roman" [...] rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low frieze-like relief or painted in monotones en <b>camaïeu</b> ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or bucrania or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of [...] "Pompeiian red" [...] or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the Goût grec ("Greek style"), not a court style; when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, brought the [...] "Louis XVI" [...] style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until {{around the turn of the}} century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: [...] "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} color in Pucelle's works cannot be {{isolated}} from {{the question of a}} workshop and collaborators behind the manuscript paintings attributed to the artist. This subject has been treated in depth by Kathleen Morand and François Avril, whose research has made it possible to better distinguish the various hands at work in the manuscripts. The minute analysis offered here of the color and techniques employed in the very many miniatures, historiated initials, and drolleries in the actual manuscripts returns to this question by distinguishing a number of technical practices applied on a shared formal basis along with a differentiation of color by manuscript. Analysis of manuscripts attributed to the master point to varied usage of color, line and modeling. This confirms the existence of a group of artists working together on certain works and isolates certain hands while posing the problem of their identification. The present study also puts analysis of color and technical processes to the test as criteria for identifying the hands. Although their diversity, or inversely, their consistency can certainly help to distinguish between the various illuminators involved, such analyses do not allow a definitive position to be taken or propose a reconstitution of the division of labor as Jean Pucelle, as chef d'atelier, might have organized it. The second question pertains to the reasons behind the original and rare choice of grisaille in manuscript painting (sometimes added to full color in the second volume of the Belleville Breviary). The practice of gray monochrome painting or "camaïeu" is obviously {{at the heart of the}} matter. It must be placed at the core of the contemporary practice of the ink and <b>camaïeu</b> "pourtrait" in illuminations, and its correlation with metal and color in precious decorative objects...|$|E
