40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, the {{mathematical}} achievement of American students {{has been a major}} concern. Students in traditionally marginalized communities often are affected more and perform less proficient in mathematics due to issues related to teacher effectiveness. One approach to increase teacher effectiveness has been through collaboration. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the structural and <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> that support high performing collaboration in mathematics. This study not only investigated the supporting structural and <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> that have been identified in the extant literature but it also examined the interaction between these conditions in two high performing cases. The study also provided an opportunity to examine teachers' perception of collaboration and its influence on their teaching. The investigation relied on the frameworks of the structural conditions including duration, coherence, content, active learning, and collective participation and two <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> of teacher efficacy and trust. Using mixed method, the methodology of the study used surveys and interviews to identify the supportive conditions and the interactions between these conditions in two instructive cases of collaboration. The findings revealed six structural themes of time as an important condition of collaboration, focus on teachers' daily classroom goals, focus on teachers' content knowledge, teacher learning through collaboration and participation of teachers of the same grade level. The findings also pointed to high level of collective efficacy and trust as supportive <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions.</b> The significant finding of this study was the new theoretical model, Interdependence Model. This new model includes one additional structural condition of physical proximity, and two additional <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> of focus on students' best interest and culture of high expectation. This new model reflects intense interconnection and interdependence between the structural <b>conditions,</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions.</b> This model shows that the <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> lay the foundation for the development of the structural conditions. More importantly, the Interdependence Model presents that trust is the most critical predictor for the development of the structural conditions. It is hoped that the new theoretical model, which originated from a strengths-based approach, will reinforce the conditions that exemplify high-performing collaboration in school...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with isolation, selection and optimization of <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> {{for the production of}} enzyme xylanase by Asperhillus niger. One hundred and four strains of A. niger were isolated from different soil samples and tested for the production of enzyme. Of all the strains tested, A. niger GCBT- 35 gave maximum production of xylanase. This strain was selected for optimization of <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> in shake flask. Among the four different culture media evaluated, the maximum enzyme production (225 U/ml) was obtained with M- 4. <b>Cultural</b> <b>conditions</b> such as rate of enzyme synthesis (48 h) and pH (4. 5) were optimized. After optimization of the <b>cultural</b> <b>conditions,</b> the parental strain GCBT- 35 was subjected to UV irradiation for 5 - 30 minutes. Ninety-four mutants were isolated by observing the zones of xylan hydrolysis due to xylanase activity in the petriplates. Of all the mutants tested for enzyme production, mutant BRCUV- 45 gave maximum production (319 U/ml) of xylanase. The selected UV mutated strain was further improved after treatment with MNNG (50 - 300 µg/ml) for 10 - 40 min. Seventy-four chemically mutated strains of A. niger were picked up and evaluated for xylanase production in 250 nil shake flask. The mutant A. niger strain GCBTMNNG- 30, being a better producer of xylanase (493 U/ml) was selected for further studies.
