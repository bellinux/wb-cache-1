5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their <b>coastal</b> <b>environment,</b> as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E

25|$|Marine salvage is {{the process}} of {{recovering}} a ship and its cargo after a shipwreck or other maritime casualty. Salvage may encompass towing, re-floating a vessel, or effecting repairs to a ship. Today, protecting the <b>coastal</b> <b>environment</b> from spillage of oil or other contaminants is a high priority. Before the invention of radio, salvage services would be given to a stricken vessel by any ship that happened to be passing by, nowadays most salvage is carried out by specialist salvage firms with dedicated crew and equipment.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{feedback}} is a stabilising mechanism acting to oppose changes to coastal morphology and establish equilibrium. A <b>coastal</b> <b>environment</b> in equilibrium {{is able to}} dissipate or reflect incoming energy without the occurrence of sediment input or output and change to morphology. For example; when a beach in equilibrium erodes during a storm it forms an offshore bar that in turn forces waves to break over it. By doing this the waves {{lose a lot of}} energy and dissipate before reaching the shoreline, significantly reducing further erosion. When the storm calms, the bar is then re-worked back on to the beach.|$|E

25|$|Sedimentary {{budgets are}} a coastal {{management}} tool {{used to analyze}} and describe the different sediment inputs (sources) and outputs (sinks) on the coasts, {{which is used to}} predict morphological change in any particular coastline over time. Within a <b>coastal</b> <b>environment</b> the rate of change of sediment is dependent on the amount of sediment brought into the system versus the amount of sediment that leaves the system. These inputs and outputs of sediment then equate to the total balance of the system and more than often reflect the amounts of erosion or accretion affecting the morphology of the coast.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{are major}} point sources of {{sediment}} {{contribution to the}} coastal sedimentary budget, this being particularly true of coasts with a steep gradient, where rivers directly dump their sediments at the coast. Coasts with a low gradient may lose river sediment to estuaries. Sediment delivery to the shoreline can be very intermittent mostly occurring during floods {{with the increase in}} flow typically creating an increase in sediment supplied to the coast. Some rivers are referred to as ‘large’ because they produce high amounts of sediment for which to nourish the <b>coastal</b> <b>environment.</b> For example, the Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline. This is not always the case with some rivers referred to as ‘small’ because they struggle to supply enough sediment to keep their coastlines from eroding, for example, the Rakaia River South of Banks Peninsula in Canterbury, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>coastal</b> <b>environment</b> is in {{sediment}} deficit, anthropogenic sediment nourishment {{is one way}} {{in which}} a balanced sedimentary budget can be maintained. This type of coastal erosion management has been adopted all over the world in order to preserve and protect. An example of this is at Mount Maunganui beach in the North Island of New Zealand which had been experiencing erosion, resulting in coastal dune retreat of almost 20 metres. When ongoing dredging {{at the entrance to the}} Tauranga Harbour began, it was decided that the sediment removed would be used to re-nourish the Mt. Manganui beach. The sediment was deposited in the nearshore zone promoting beach accretion by offshore berm emplacement. Results show that most of the 80,000m3 of sediment added to the nearshore zone made it to ashore to re-nourish the beach and even out the past sediment deficit. Nourishment of a coast can be regarded as a fast fix option to reversing a sediment deficit; however, it is important that nourishment is on-going in order to ensure the sedimentary budget remains balanced.|$|E

This book explains how the many varied forms of spatial analysis, including mapping, monitoring and modelling, can be applied to a range of <b>coastal</b> <b>environments,</b> such as estuaries, mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs. Presenting approaches to modelling, which draw on recent developments in remote sensing technology, geographical information science and spatial statistics, it provides the analytical tools to map, monitor and explain or predict coastal features. With detailed case studies and accompanying online practical exercises, it is an ideal resource for undergraduate courses in spatial science. Taking a broad view of spatial analysis and covering basic and advanced analytical areas such as spatial data and geostatistics, it is also a useful reference for ecologists, geomorphologists, geographers and modellers interested in understanding <b>coastal</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
