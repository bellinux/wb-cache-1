30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of {{transfer}} payment structure on the financial efficiency of local government. Analyzing the data of financial transfer payment structure, this paper found that the way and structure of transfer payment from central to local government changes obviously. The proportion of tax refund is decreased from 73.7 % in 1995 to 11.3 % in 2012. The proportion of categorical grant and condition grant is increased. Tax refund is no longer the major way of transfer payment from central to local government. After calculating the efficiency of national financial fund by the model of EDA, this paper found that the overall efficiency of China’s financial capital showed a downward trend. Based on the theory of consumer behavior analyzing the financial expenditure, the reason of declining financial funds is analyzed and two hypotheses about the transfer payment structure on financial efficiency is put forward: one is that in the situation of size of transfer payment and tax refund unchanged, increasing the categorical grant while decreasing the condition grant with similar size could make the efficiency of financial funds be lower than the original level. The other is that due to a certain cost needed in local government completing for the <b>central</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the tax refund is transformed into the categorical grant and condition grant, which leads to low financial efficiency of local government. Based on the theoretical analysis, this paper uses the regression method with the panel data and mixed data {{to examine the relationship between}} transfer payment structure and financial efficiency. The empirical results show that tax refund has a significant positive correlation with financial efficiency of local government, which indicates the declining proportion of tax refund the one of reasons that financial efficiency is declining. Moreover, the empirical results has not supported the hypothesis that condition grant has significant difference with categorical grant. The possible reason is that in the appropriation of condition grant, central government pays more attention to fairness rather than efficiency.|$|E

It has been justified that, the strengthening of the tax autonomy of local government is the main objective of the reform in local finances but appropriate taxes are few in number and are with à limited revenue potential. Optimization of the real estate tax has been proposed, including taxation on local incomes from rent as well as local patent tax. The revenue potential of these autonomous local taxes especially in small municipalities is not large, which leads to the necessity of a semi-autonomous parallel local tax on personal incomes, as well as substantial <b>central</b> <b>subsidies</b> i. e. re-allocation of tax revenues across municipalities. ...|$|R

It considers the estimates of GSDP at current factor cost (f. c.) and the 6 components of the indirect taxes and subsidies to derive the estimates of GSDP at m. p. These components are: (1) State indirect taxes, (2) state level subsidies, (3) octroi, (4) states share in <b>Central</b> <b>subsidies,</b> (5) states share in Central excise, and (6) states share in Central customs revenues. It is found that compared to the NSDP at f. c., the GSDP at m. p. was 38 % higher in 1990 - 91 but 44 % higher in 2000 - 01 in Gujarat. On the other hand, at the national level, this difference has declined from 24 % to 23 % during the same period. For various uses of comparing fiscal performance of different state economies, the right concept to use is GSDP at m. p. and not NSDP at f. c., which is apology but apology by credit-rating agencies, RBI, Finance Commissions, etc. This leads to erroneous assessment of needs, biased perception of performance and wrong conclusions on efficiency of different state economies.

40|$|We seek to {{understand}} how the use of Research, Development, and Engineering (R,D&E) metrics can lead to more effective management of R,D&E. This paper combines qualitative and quantitative research {{to understand}} and improve the use of R,D&E metrics. Our research begins with interviews of 43 representative Chief Technical Officers, Chief Executive Offices, and researchers at 10 research-intensive international organizations. These interviews, and an extensive review of the literature, provide qualitative insights. Formal mathematical models attempt to explore these qualitative insights based on more general principles. Our research suggests that metrics-based evaluation and management vary according to the characteristics of the R,D&E activity. For applied projects, we find that project selection can be based on market-outcome metrics when firms use <b>central</b> <b>subsidies</b> to account for short-termism, risk aversion, and scope. With an efficient form of subsidies known as "tin-cupping," the business units have the incentives to choose the projects that are in the firm's best long-term interests. For core-technological development, longer time delays and more risky programs imply that popular R,D&E effectiveness metrics lead researchers to select programs that are not in the firm's long-term interest. Our analyses suggest that firms moderate such market-outcome metrics by placing a larger weight on metrics that attempt to measure research effort more directly. These metrics include standard measures such as publications, citations, patents, citations to patents, and peer review. For basic research, the issues shift to getting the right people and encouraging a breadth of ideas. Unfortunately, metrics that identify the "best people" based on research success lead directly to "not-invented-here" behaviors. Such behaviors result in research empires that are larger than necessary, but lead to fewer ideas. We suggest that firms use "research tourism" metrics, which encourage researchers to take advantage of research spillovers from universities, other industries, and, even, competitors.

In response to this, China is seeking to adjust its energy structure by diversifying its energy supply. As part of this, shale gas development has become an important energy strategy in China in recent years because there are abundant prospective resources of shale gas. However, the related economic and environmental issues associated with shale gas developments are controversial. This thesis discusses shale gas developments in China and the USA. Then it focuses on the economics of shale gas development in China based on an analysis {{the costs and benefits}} of shale gas from the perspectives of (a) the Supply Chain companies (those in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors) (b) the Whole Economy. Specifically, the aims are as set out below. A. To describe and quantify the benefits and costs of an example Chinese shale gas development for the Whole Economy. The benefits and costs include those external to shale gas Supply Chain companies. B. To assess the benefits and costs of an example Chinese shale gas development for the companies operating the shale gas operation. In other words, the boundary of the analysis is the shale gas Supply Chain on its own. The analysis excludes the economic effects of benefits and costs external to the development. C.

The article contains an attempt to evaluate the regional policy directed to rural areas and agriculture, administration structures and the instruments of interaction being at their disposal, and also identification of the main barriers to the absorption of Union means. Among the numerous problems the greatest attention is drawn by: lack of cohesion in the planning system, unclear system of competence of the public administration, arbitrariness of <b>central</b> <b>subsidies,</b> problems with the state deficit making it difficult to programme expenditures for the development of rural areas and agriculture. Barriers to the absorption of Union means are inherent also on the part the beneficients: lack of social activity, lack of cooperation between the particular social actors, lack of qualified personnel in the scope of preparing motions for the upfinancing of projects.

Born out of a recognition of the poor quality of most housing for the working classes and the attendant health and mortality issues associated with overcrowding and poor sanitation and fuelled by the war-time promise of ‘homes fit for heroes to live in’ the agency chosen to deliver that promise was local government; councils constructing houses for rent backed by <b>central</b> state <b>subsidy.</b> In post-World War One (WW 1) Scotland council housing almost immediately became the major provider of new houses, surpassing the number of new private builds as early as 1921 and thereafter out-performing the private sector every year (with the temporary exceptions of 1924 and 1925) until 1978 when the balance shifted back to the private sector which has maintained its dominance ever since. While the move to private build predates the Thatcherite ‘privatisation’ of selling off council houses to sitting tenants, that policy clearly reinforced the trend; whereas in the 1970 s more than half of all homes were rented from a council, by 2011 the social rented sector provided just 24 per cent of homes with councils responsible for less than 13 per cent.
