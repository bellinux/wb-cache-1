50|$|It was {{established}} around 1930's by the Fallas-Gutierrez sugar company when an 18 kilometers railroad was built across, which runs from Adelaida Sugar mill (Fallas) to the Port of Chicola. There was placed a sugar <b>cane</b> <b>loader</b> crane, pulled by bulls, to transfer cane from animal-drawn carriages to railroad wagons. It took {{the name of}} Kilo 9 since the crane was located at the Kilometer mark 9. The first inhabitants were Haitian and Jamaican immigrants {{who worked in the}} sugar cane plantations. During the Castro revolution in 1964, 100 modern houses were built. Electricity arrived in 1965 and new machinery replaced the previous agricultural system including the replacement of the crane by a huge cane processing station powered by electricity. The village was destroyed by hurricane Kate on November 20 1985. Today it is an inhospitable place roamed only by cattle. Nearby villages are Kilo 12, Jucaral, Kilo 8, San Juan, La Teresa, Ceiba.|$|E

40|$|Farm {{machinery}} management {{data were}} collected in Burkina Faso, for the prediction of repair and maintenance costs. Equations were developed to predict repair and maintenance costs of tractors, <b>cane</b> <b>loaders,</b> generators and motorpumps. The analysis of data revealed that tractor repair and maintenance appears a greater burden than predicted by the American and Australian data. Tractor trade-in was not prescribed by the rule of minimum total cost per unit tractor use. Farm machinery and power units were operated {{more than twice as}} long as in the United States. New machine purchase was discouraged by the current sugar prices on the local market...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, strange {{phenomena}} {{occurred in}} the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa: a massive tide of sargassum, brown algae, washed ashore causing considerable damage to the local economy and environment. The sargassum mostly consists of Sargassum Natans and Sargassum Fluitans. Old studies concluded that the sargassum came from the Sargasso Sea, however the most recent massive tide of sargassum (named as golden tide) came from an area north of the Amazon river delta. Texas A&M University of Galveston and the University of Florida developed detection systems in cooperation with NASAs satellite images. With the detection system {{it is possible to}} track, trace and make forecasts of sargassum landings. Hereby it is possible to act {{a few days before the}} sargassum washes ashore, instead of reacting when it landed on the beach already. Most of the problems occur when the massive influxes of sargassum are washed ashore. Currently, the most used harvesting methods on the beach are by use of rakes and wheelbarrows or by using mechanical equipment like a <b>cane</b> <b>loaders</b> and front-end loaders. The beach cleaning methods causes beach erosion and endangers local wildlife. Therefore, harvesting methods at sea are under development. Sargassum is an organic material and can be an useful source for processing. The most used processing methods of sargassum are burying at the beach or using it as a fertiliser. One of the challenges in processing sargassum is working with the unpredictable appearing character of sargassum. The known detection methods have been critically analysed and the most favourable method is developed by Texas A&M University Galveston. This system is applicable on other areas as well and it makes forecasts of sargassum landings. The harvesting methods have also been critically analysed and it can be concluded that the most recommended harvesting method has to be done at sea in combination with a floating barrier. Most of the problems are avoided in this manner. For processing multiple opportunities have been pointed out. Biofuel and bioplastics are having large potential. For the mean time using sargassum as a fertiliser is a su cient solution. The uneven appearances can be solved by drying the sargassum. Finally, an implementation plan is developed for Quintana Roo to overcome the sargassum problems. It is a step-by-step approach which can be conducted by a party who is willing to take the lead. In this approach the detection system of Texas can be used and new harvesting methods have to be developed. For processing, dry facilities have to be built in order to solve the uneven appearances.
