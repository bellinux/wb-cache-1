50|$|The fixed ratio systems usually {{discharge}} between 10% (1/10) and 25% (1/4) of {{the volume}} of each breath overboard. As a result, gas endurance is from 10 times to four times that of open circuit, and depends on breathing rate and depth {{in the same way as}} for open circuit. Oxygen fraction in the loop depends on the discharge ratio, and to a lesser extent on the breathing rate and work rate of the diver. As some gas is recycled after breathing, the oxygen fraction will always be lower than that of the make-up gas, but can closely approximate the make-up gas after a loop flush, so the gas is generally chosen to be breathable at maximum depth, which allows it to be used for open circuit bailout. The loop gas oxygen fraction will increase with depth, as the mass rate of oxygen used metabolically remains almost constant with a change in depth. This is the opposite tendency of what is done in a closed circuit rebreather, where the oxygen partial pressure is <b>controlled</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more or less the same within limits throughout the dive. The fixed ratio system has been used in the DC55 and Halcyon RB80 rebreathers. Passive addition rebreathers with small discharge ratios may become hypoxic near the surface when moderate oxygen fraction supply gas is used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{control method}} of the {{bidirectional}} DC/DC converter for instantaneous regenerative current control {{is described in}} this paper. The general method to control the DC/DC converter is the output voltage control. However, the regenerative current cannot be <b>controlled</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constant with this control method. To improve {{the performance of the}} conventional control method, the DC-link voltage of the inverter is controlled within the tolerance range by the instantaneous boost and buck operations of the bidirectional DC/DC converter. By the proposed control method, the battery current can be <b>controlled</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constant regardless of the motor speed variation. The improved performance of the DC/DC converter controlled by the proposed control method is verified by the experiment and simulation of the system with the inverter and IPMSM(Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) which is operated by the reduced practical speed profile...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pedagogical {{strategies}} are policies for a tutor {{to decide the}} next action when there are multiple actions available. When the content is <b>controlled</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same across experimental conditions, {{there has been little}} evidence that tutorial decisions have an impact on students ’ learning. In this paper, we applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) to induce two sets of pedagogical policies from pre-existing human interaction data. The NormGain set was derived with the goal of enhancing tutorial decisions that contribute to learning while the InvNormGain set was derived with the goal of enhancing those decisions that contribute less or even nothing to learning. The two sets were then tested with human students. Our results show that when the content was <b>controlled</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same, different pedagogical policies did make a difference in learning and more specifically, the NormGain students outperformed their peers. Overall our results suggest that content exposure and practice opportunities can help students to learn even when tutors have poor pedagogical tutorial tactics. However, with effective tutorial tactics, students can learn even more...|$|E
