This type of tracking leads to the breach of a user’s location privacy. Prior solutions to this problem enhances user’s location privacy at the expense of communication Quality of Service(QoS) degradation. In this paper, we propose silent cascade to enhance a user’ location privacy by trading users ’ delay in silent cascade for anonymity. As a result, it avoids the problem of QoS degradation in prior solutions. Furthermore, we abstract silent cascade as a mix-network based formal model, and use this model to evaluate the performance of silent <b>cascade.</b> <b>Study</b> results prove the effectiveness of silent cascade under different types of QoS requirements. Besides, we also derive the optimal configuration of silent cascade to achieves target anonymity within minimum duration of time. and the theoretical upper bound of a silent cascade’s anonymity. ...|$|E

40|$|A linear Euler {{method for}} {{analysing}} unsteady inviscid compressible quasi three- dimensional flows in oscillating cascades is developed. It is applicable to both blade flutter and forced response problems. The method considers linear time harmonic perturbations {{on a steady}} solution to the nonlinear Euler equations {{and it has the}} potential of becoming a computationally very efficient method. The perturbation flow is governed by the linearized Euler equations, which are linear differential equations whose coefficients depend on the steady flow field. To calculate the steady flow field an explicit flow solver, VOLFAP, is used. A grid generator based on the advancing front technique is coupled to the flow solver to provide for solution-adaptive remeshing. The idea of remeshing is especially useful for problems involving shocks, since shocks of any shape can be resolved as accurately as wanted. To discretize and solve the linear Euler equations a pseudo-time time marching Lax- Wendroff scheme is used. The last mesh used in the steady flow analysis is used in the linear unsteady analysis. The mesh is harmonically deformed for problems involving vibrating blades, flutter. Forced response problems are treated by prescribing incoming waves in the nonreflecting boundary conditions. Results for different standard configurations are presented for both flutter and forced response problems. Comparisons with other numerical methods show good agreement. A comparison between 1 D and 2 D nonreflecting boundary conditions show that spurious reflections from 1 D boundary conditions can corrupt a solution severely even if the condition is not close to acoustic resonance. It is known that unsteady nonlinear solvers cannot effectively avoid spurious reflections from the boundaries. With the present method however, one has complete control of such phenomena. In a transonic fan <b>cascade</b> <b>study</b> the present method is found to produce results, for two cases, which qualitatively agree well with results obtained by time-accurate Navier- Stokes simulations...|$|E
40|$|Regime shifts, {{defined as}} a radical and {{persistent}} reconfiguration of an ecosystem following a disturbance, have been acknowledged by scientists as a very {{important aspect of the}} dynamic of ecosystems. However, their consideration in land management planning remains marginal and limited to specific processes and systems. Current research focuses on mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of spatio-temporal data for specific environmental variables. These methods do not fulfill the needs of land managers, who are confronted with a multitude of processes and pressure types and require clear and simple strategies to prevent regime shift or to increase the resilience of their environment. The EU-FP 7 CASCADE project is looking at regime shifts of dryland ecosystems in southern Europe and specifically focuses on rangeland and forest systems which are prone to various land degradation threats. One of the aims of the project is to evaluate the impact of different management practices on the dynamic of the environment in a participatory manner, including a multi-stakeholder evaluation {{of the state of the}} environment and of the management potential. To achieve this objective we have organized several stakeholder meetings and we have compiled a review of management practices using the WOCAT methodology, which enables merging scientific and land users knowledge. We highlight here the main challenges we have encountered in applying the notion of regime shift to real world socio-ecological systems and in translating related concepts such as tipping points, stable states, hysteresis and resilience to land managers, using concrete examples from <b>CASCADE</b> <b>study</b> sites.

Population-based sequencing was performed for 20 of these individuals during the therapy-free follow-up period. The median time of follow-up was 15 months (interquartile range from 10 to 23 months). Of these individuals, 12 showed subsequent evolution at the resistance positions, whereas the virus of 8 people was stable during this period. In the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, the drug-resistant 215 Y or 215 F codons evolved to alternative codons in all six cases, 70 R reverted to the wild-type 70 K in 3 of the 4 individuals, 67 N evolved only in 1 of 4 patients to a wild-type 67 D, 215 S evolved to wild-type 215 T in 1 of 3 patients, 219 N evolved to 219 K in 1 of 2 patients, and one patient with 184 V reversed to the wild-type 184 M. The 181 C variant evolved to the wild-type 181 Y in 1 of 2 individuals. These codon changes were caused by single nucleotide mutations. No evolution was observed for other RT mutations: 41 L, 69 D, 69 N, 190 S, 210 W, 215 L, 215 C, 215 E and 219 Q. In the protease gene, resistance mutations 84 V and 90 M were stable in 2 individuals.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a common}} inflammatory disease and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity worldwide. Social support {{has been found to be}} associated with better self-care behaviors and systemic inflammation in adults as well as in clinical populations. However, little is known about these relationships in patients with COPD. This dissertation is composed of two papers. The purpose of the first paper is to determine the association between social support and self-care behaviors in patients with COPD. The second paper is to examine the association between social support and systemic inflammation in patients with COPD. Methods: The first paper was a longitudinal study using two-years of follow-up data from the CASCADE (COPD Activity: Serotonin Transporter, Cytokines, and Depression) cohort (n= 282). Self-care behaviors included the following: 1) Physical activity (PA) was measured with a validated accelerometer (Stepwatch) over a 7 -day period at baseline, year 1, and year 2; 2) Four yes/no questions on smoking status, participation in pulmonary rehabilitation, and receipt of influenza and/or pneumonia vaccinations; 3) Inhaler/nebulizer medication adherence was based on four questions: carelessness, forgetting, stopping medication when feeling better, and using less of the medication than prescribed when feeling better. Structural social support was measured by self-reported questions on living alone or with others, being partnered, the number of close friends/relatives, and presence of an unpaid caregiver. Functional, or perceived, social support was measured with the Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey (MOSSS). Mixed-effects and logistic regression models were used for the analysis. The second paper was a cross-sectional study using baseline data collected from the <b>CASCADE</b> <b>study.</b> Structural social support was measured by asking whether patients lived alone or with others. Functional social support was measured using the MOSSS total score. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Results: In 282 participants with moderate to very severe COPD, 80 % were men with a mean age of 68 ± 9. In the first paper, participants who lived with others accrued 903 more steps per day than those who lived alone (β= 903, 95 % CI: 373, 1433, p= 0. 001). Higher MOSSS total score (p= 0. 03) and tangible support (p= 0. 004) was associated with lower odds of smoking. The odds of participation in pulmonary rehabilitation was more than 11 times higher if a patient had a spouse or partner as caregiver compared to not having a caregiver (p< 0. 01). Perceived social support was associated with marginally higher odds of pneumonia vaccination (p< 0. 05). There was no significant association between social support and influenza vaccination or adherence with an inhaler or nebulizer medication. In the second paper, in Model 1 (unadjusted), Model 2 (adjusted for age, gender, income, body mass index [BMI], and forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted [FEV 1 % predicted]), and Model 3 (contains all adjustments from Model 2 with addition of physical activity, current smoking status, depression, and anxiety), neither structural (living with others) nor functional social support were associated with TNF-α, IL- 6, or CRP levels. However, physical activity was inversely associated with CRP level (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: We found that the type and level of social support had differing effects on core self-care behaviors in patients with COPD. Living with others had a stronger impact on physical activity than functional social support and was associated with a clinically meaningful increase of over + 900 steps per day compared to living alone. Having a caregiver was associated with more than a tenfold increase in pulmonary rehabilitation participation compared to having no caregiver. Only functional social support had a small beneficial impact on smoking behavior and pneumococcal vaccinations of unclear clinical significance. Neither structural nor functional support were associated with getting an influenza vaccination or adherence to inhaler or nebulizer medications. Finally, there were no association between social support and systemic inflammation. Future studies should measure how other social support dimensions, such as ambivalent relationships, impacts self-care behaviors and inflammatory markers in patients with COPD...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{external}} signals perceived by yeast cells, nutrient availability {{is a condition}} to which these cells show a highly diverse biological response. Diploid cells in response to different nutritional stress conditions shows different developmental outcomes. On nitrogen starvation, cells undergo dimorphic transition whereby a unicellular yeast form transforms to a multicellular pseudohyphal form. While in the complete absence of a nitrogen source and a fermentable carbon source, yeast cells enter into a complex developmental program termed sporulation which culminates in haploid spores. The main objective of this work {{was to understand the}} role played by S. cerevisiaeSUB 1 in starvation-induced meiotic program of diploid cells, decipher its target in sporulation specific gene expression <b>cascade,</b> <b>study</b> the domain architecture of Sub 1 and examine its functional homology to mammalian PC 4. Role of Sub 1 in induction of sporulation and other stress responses in S. cerevisiae In a previous whole-genome screen for mutants with altered sporulation efficiency in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S 288 c strain, SUB 1 locus was identified as a negative regulator of sporulation (Deutschbaueret al., 2002). Moreover, genome-wide gene expression analysis in SK 1 strain had shown that SUB 1 transcript levels are repressed during sporulation (Chu et al., 1998). Many studies in different yeast strain backgrounds implicate more than 1, 000 genesout of 6, 200 genes in yeast genome as being differentially expressed during the sporulation process (Chu et al., 1998; Primiget al., 2000; Deutschbaueret al., 2002). Interestingly, these studies show the number of regulatory genes that negatively affect sporulation is far lower than those that are activators of sporulation and moreover their mechanism of action is poorly studied. S. cerevisiae. SUB 1 is one among negative regulators of sporulation(Deutschbaueret al., 2002). Global transcriptome of diploid yeast cells undergoing sporulation showed SUB 1 transcripts are greatly reduced with time progression (Chu et al., 1998). To understand the role of SUB 1 in sporulation, we generated deletion of both SUB 1 alleles in the diploid S 288 c strain background and compared the kinetics of asci formation in this strain with that of the wild-type. We observed that cells lacking SUB 1 exhibit ~ 5 -fold increase in tetrad asci. Based on Eosin Y and Calcoflour White staining assays, we find no change in spore morphology in the mutant. Thus the increase in sporulation efficiency in sub 1 /sub 1 diploids is not accompanied by formation of defective spores. We validated the reduction in SUB 1 transcript levels during sporulation in wild-type SK 1 strain background. We also examined the Sub 1 protein levels by epitope-tagging of the chromosomal SUB 1 open reading frame and determining protein levels in this strain. We find that consistent with the data on transcript levels, Sub 1 -TAP tagged protein levels too decreased gradually on shift to sporulation medium. We created sub 1 alleles in diploids in the SK 1 strain background and using this strain background we investigated Sub 1 target genes and chose IME 2 (early), SMK 1, SPS 2 (middle), DIT 1, DIT 2 (mid-late) and SPS 100 (late) genes as representative sporulation genes. We observed that sub 1 ∆/sub 1 ∆cells have a significantly elevated expression of middle genes (SPS 2 and SMK 1) that followed normal induction kinetics i. e., 5 hours post transfer to sporulation medium. However, the expression levels or timing for other class of sporulation genes did not change in sub 1 ∆strain as compared with the wild-type. In order to confirm these observations, we also studied the effects of over-expression of SUB 1 from the GAL 1 promoter by transforming the high copy plasmid. This was done in wild-type SK 1 cells and the expression of sporulation genes were analyzed. We observed that expression of SMK 1 and SPS 2 middle sporulation genes was reduced on over-expression of SUB 1. We used the Sub 1 -TAP protein to assess if Sub 1 directly regulates these genes by Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. For these studies, we examined the recruitment of Sub 1 to these loci through the time course of sporulation. In wild-type SK 1 cells, Sub 1 was to bound to middle sporulation genes and this was striking in cells at 5 th hour post-induction of sporulation. These data establish that Sub 1 directly associates with chromatin at these loci co-incident with the time points where expression levels of these changes is altered in cells lacking Sub 1. Furthermore, to assess the role of Sub 1 in other stress responses, such as pseudohyphae formation in response to nitrogen starvation, pheromone-induced agar invasion and secretory stress, we employed a genetic approach. Genetic interaction studies of SUB 1 with RPB 4, a subunit of RNA polymerase with functions in stress response and HOS 2, a subunit of Set 3 complex and a close homolog of mammalian HDAC 3, reported to be involved in sporulation and secretory stress, were performed. Based on sporulation frequency and pseudohyphal formation in the double mutants we conclude that SUB 1 is downstream of both these genes. Moreover, our results from assays of schmoo formation and pheromone-induced agar invasion suggest that SUB 1 functionally interacts with HOS 2. Study of domain architecture of Sub 1 and homology to human PC 4 Comparison of the S. cerevisiae Sub 1 protein with its higher eukaryotic homologs showed that the N-terminal region of yeast Sub 1 (32 - 105 aa) is highly conserved (Knauset al., 1996; Henry et al., 1996) with the 106 - 292 C -terminal amino acids being yeast-specific. We employed deletion analysis to generate partial Sub 1 proteins and used them to understand the roles played by these domains in different phenotypes associated with Sub 1. Our analysis of the localization of various Sub 1 -GFP fusion proteins shows that 146 - 172 aa in the C-terminal domain of Sub 1 confers nuclear localization. Sporulation frequency analysis of the different domains of Sub 1 suggests that both the N and C terminal domains are necessary for sporulation function of Sub 1. The N terminal domain of yeast Sub 1 shares homology with human PC 4 and not surprisingly possesses ssDNA binding ability first attributed to human PC 4 (Kaiser et al., 1995). In order to investigate whether the effects of SUB 1 on kinetics of sporulation require its ssDNA binding function, we generated the sub 1 (Y 66 A) ssDNA binding mutant (Sikorskiet al., 2011) and over-expressed it in the S 288 c genetic background. We assessed sporulation efficiency of sub 1 ∆/sub 1 ∆cells over-expressing sub 1 (Y 66 A) mutant allele as compared to cells over-expressing wild-type SUB 1. Interestingly, cells with over-expression of sub 1 (Y 66 A) have reduced sporulation efficiency that is equivalent to the levels achieved on over-expression of wild type SUB 1. This data suggests that the ssDNA-binding ability of Sub 1 is not important for its role in sporulation. Furthermore, we examined the ability of human PC 4 to contribute to yeast sporulation process by complementation analysis. We observed that over-expression of PC 4 complemented the phenotypes of sub 1 ∆strain, suggesting that the function of Sub 1 /PC 4 family is evolutionarily conserved. Studies on biochemical interactions of Sub 1 with histone proteins Human PC 4 is a chromatin-associated protein, present on metaphase chromosomes (Das et al., 2006). The short C-terminal domain of PC 4 (62 - 87 aa) interacts with core histones H 3 and H 2 B in vitro and in vivo and this interaction mediates chromatin condensation. The homology between S. cerevisiaeSub 1 (32 - 105 aa) and human PC 4 (62 - 127 aa) is in the domain required for their DNA binding properties and coactivator functions, suggesting possible conservation in their interactions. We tested the interactions of yeast Sub 1 with histone proteins by adopting both in vitro and in vivo interaction assays. We find recombinant Sub 1 had strong interactions with rat and yeast histone H 3 in vitro. Moreover,Sub 1 was found to interact with histone H 2 B, but not with H 2 A, in vivo, a binding specificity also shown by human PC 4. Thus, we demonstrate conservation in the interaction of Sub 1 with histone proteins...|$|E

40|$|Using {{survey data}} {{collected}} from enlisted soldiers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) nested in platoons in the U. S. Army, my dissertation examines intervening and moderating mechanisms in the cascading process of supportive leadership. Typically <b>cascading</b> <b>studies</b> focus on influence processes occurring in dyadic settings, neglect to consider boundary conditions, and utilize a group mean approach to analyzing the phenomenon. In my study, however, I find support for a conditional indirect effect of cascading supportive leadership at the group level, such that supportive leadership by groups of upper-level leaders (officers) promotes social cohesion for groups of lower-level leaders (NCOs) under high levels of combat exposure. In turn, lower-level social cohesion is positively linked with supportive leadership by groups of leaders at lower organizational levels. In addition, analyses using within-unit standard deviations of the substantive measures (i. e., strength) indicate that combat exposure strength moderates the relationship between upper-level supportive leadership strength and lower-level social cohesion strength, such that the positive relationship is stronger when combat exposure strength is higher (i. e., when within-unit standard deviation in combat exposure is lower) ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to systematically review the literature to provide estimates of the proportion of chronic HCV-infected persons in the United States (U. S.) completing each step along a proposed HCV treatment cascade: (1) infected with chronic HCV; (2) diagnosed and aware of their infection; (3) with access to outpatient care; (4) HCV RNA confirmed; (5) liver fibrosis staged by biopsy; (6) prescribed HCV treatment; and (7) achieved sustained virologic response (SVR).

40|$|Abstract: The {{role and}} {{function}} of a given protein is dependent on its structure. In recent years, however, numerous studies have highlighted the importance of unstructured, or disordered regions in governing a protein’s function. Disordered proteins {{have been found to}} play important roles in pivotal cellular functions, such as DNA binding and signalling <b>cascades.</b> <b>Studying</b> proteins with extended disordered regions is often problematic as they can be challenging to express, purify and crystallise. This means that interpretable experimental data on protein disorder is hard to generate. As a result, predictive computational tools have been developed with the aim of predicting the level and location of disorder within a protein. Currently, over 60 prediction servers exist, utilizing different methods for classifying disorder and different training sets. Here we review several good performing, publicly available prediction methods, comparing their application and discussing how disorder prediction servers can be used to aid the experimental solution of protein structure. The use of disorder prediction methods allows us to adopt a more targeted approach to experimental studies by accurately identifying the boundaries of ordered protein domains so that they may be investigated separately, thereby increasing the likelihood o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract While {{patterns}} from trophic <b>cascade</b> <b>studies</b> {{have largely}} focused on density-mediated eVects of preda-tors on prey, {{there is increasing}} recognition that behavior-ally mediated indirect eVects of predators on prey can, at least in part, explain trophic cascade patterns. To determine if a relationship exists between predation risk perceived by elk (Cervus elaphus) while browsing and elk position within the landscape, we observed a total of 56 female elk during two summers and 29 female elk during one winter. At a Wne spatial (0 – 187 m) and temporal scale (145 – 300 s), results from our model selection indicated summer vigi-lance levels were greater for females with calves than for females without calves, with vigilance levels greater for all females at closer escape-impediment distances. Winter results also suggested greater female vigilance levels at closer escape-impediment distances, but further indicated an increase in vigilance levels with closer conifer-edge distances. Placed {{within the context of}} other studies, the results were consistent with a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade and provide a potential mechanism to explain the variability in observed woody plant release from browsing in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{clinical}} trials, the management of arrhythmias has evolved {{over the past three}} decades. In the late 1960 s, customary teaching was that ventricular premature depolarizations were dangerous and antiarrhythmic therapy, in hopes of reducing fatal consequences, became common place; however, following clinical trials such as CAST, IMPACT, and SWORD, we learned that, at least in postinfarct patients, arrhythmia suppression may lead to increased rather than reduced mortality. Such trials have led to a marked reduction in therapy of indiscriminate ventricular ectopy and have led to ongoing testing of specific subgroups identified as having par-ticularly high adverse prognostic risk. With the advent of cardiac monitoring and the confirma-tion that ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the most common cause for sudden death, their therapy, too, has evolved and matured, again aided by clinical trials. The ESVEM study prospec-tively examined the role of monitor-guided versus electrophysiologically guided drug therapy of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and confirmed that both approaches may have a role in reducing arrhythmic deaths&mdash;though the specific benefits of each technique remain somewhat unsettled. Both the ESVEM and <b>CASCADE</b> <b>studies</b> suggested that the most effective drugs for ventricu-lar tachyarrhythmias are the class II/III drugs, sotalol and amiodarone, both appearing mor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCascade {{failure is}} an {{interesting}} theme {{on the study of}} complex network and has attracted a lot of researchers. Examples of cascade failure include disease epidemics, traffic congestion, electrical power system blackouts, etc. The most common feature of cascade failures is that a local failure event results in a global failure on a larger scale. A lot of factors are considered as cascade failure reasons such as network interdependency or network topology. The classic literature on cascade failure includes two basic models: percolation cascade and capacity <b>cascade.</b> <b>Studies</b> in capacity <b>cascade</b> are found in some important domains such as power distribution systems. In these systems, if external shocks or excess loads at some nodes are propagated to other connected nodes due to failure, the domino effects often come with disastrous consequences. Thus, how to prevent this type of cascade is an important emerging issue. In this paper, we propose a mechanism of mitigating flow-based cascade failure. We provide rewiring methods in which network is able to self-organize {{in order to reduce the}} damage of cascade failure. Simulation results indicate that adaptive networking may dramatically improve network's robustness against cascade...|$|R
