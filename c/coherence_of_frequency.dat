40|$|Nonlinearities of the {{peripheral}} auditory system generate distortion products which {{present to the}} central auditory system as apparent acoustic stimuli. The frequency and amplitude of distortion products reflect the frequency, phase and amplitude relationship {{of the components of}} a complex stimulus. When the stimulus consists of harmonically-related primaries, the amplitudes of the major distortion products are a function of the relative phase of the presented (primary) tones. We have previously shown (McAnally and Calford, 1990) that the variation of amplitude of the distortion {{as a function of the}} relative phase of a pair of harmonically-related primaries is well modelled as a function of the interaction of the multiple modes of distortion which fall at the same frequency (e. g. difference frequency and cubic difference frequency). A possibility raised by this result is that <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> modulation (that which maintains harmonicity) could be encoded in the amplitude of distortion. This was examined in measurements of both the cochlear microphonic potential (CM) and the responses of auditory nerve fibres in anaesthetized cats. Very small deviations from <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> modulation produced changes in the amplitude of the CM potential at the frequency of distortion. Also the discharges of auditory nerve fibres tuned to the frequency of distortion were found to be modulated at the same frequency as the amplitude changes observed in the CM. There was no variation in distortion amplitude in the CM and no modulation of auditory nerve discharges when primaries were frequency modulated coherently. It is suggested that amplitude modulation of distortion gives the auditory system its demonstrated sensitivity to minor departures from coherence of frequency-modulated, harmonically-related tones...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of all-optical phase-coherent frequency division by 3, {{based on a}} self-phase-locked continuous-wave (cw) optical parametric oscillator (OPO), are investigated theoretically and experimentally. The frequency to be divided is provided by a diode laser master-oscillator power-amplifier system operated at a wavelength of 812 nm and used as the pump source of the OPO. Optical self-phase-locking of the OPO signal and idler waves is achieved by mutual injection locking of the signal wave and the intracavity frequency-doubled idler wave. The OPO process and the second-harmonic generation of the idler wave are simultaneously phase matched through quasi-phase-matching using two periodically poled sections of different period manufactured within the same LiNbO 3 crystal. An optical self-phase-locking range of up to 1 MHz is experimentally observed. The phase <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> division by three is measured via the phase stability of an interference pattern formed by the input and output waves of the OPO. The fractional frequency instability of the divider is measured to be smaller than 7. 6 × 10 - 14 for a measurement time of 10 s (resolution limited). The self-phase-locking characteristics of the cw OPO are theoretically investigated by analytically solving the coupled field equations in the steady-state regime. For the experimental parameters of the OPO, the calculations predict a locking range of 1. 3 MHz and a fractional frequency instability of 1. 6 × 10 - 15, in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Patients with {{laryngeal}} carcinoma often present early due to {{the change}} in their voice. The treatment for T 1 aN 0 M 0 carcinoma varies throughout the world, but whether radiotherapy (RT) or endolaryngeal laser excision is performed both result in excellent local control of the tumour and five year survival rates. There are {{advantages and disadvantages of}} either treatment but there are no appropriately powered randomised controlled trials comparing them. Over recent decades external beam RT has become the more popular choice and this is partly due to a perception of poor voice outcomes from surgical excision. However with the development of technology allowing surgical precision, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) has resulted in low morbidity and good voice outcomes. Objective: This research has three main objectives: a. To describe acoustic parameters of ‘normal’ voice; b. To compare voice outcomes in patients treated with TLM with those treated with radiotherapy for T 1 a SCC of the glottis; c. To investigate longitudinal changes in voice quality in patients undergoing TLM for T 1 a SCC of the glottis. Methods: The research was divided into three main parts. The first part was to analyse the acoustic parameters of ‘normal’ voice. To describe the parameters of ‘normal’ voice, adults with no history of voice disorders who scored zero on the voice questionnaire (Voice Handicap Index - 10) were included. The second part comprised a comparative cohort study of 40 patients with T 1 aN 0 M 0 laryngeal carcinoma, treated with either TLM (20 patients) or RT (20 patients) to compare voice outcomes at least one year following treatment. The third part involved a prospective cohort study of 30 patients with T 1 aN 0 M 0 laryngeal carcinomas who were treated with TLM, comparing voice qualities before and after treatment. All patients were recruited from those attending the regional Head and Neck centre in Aintree University Hospital. The same methodology was adopted for voice recordings for all three parts of the study. Participants were asked to read a phonetically balanced passage and produce a prolonged vowel sound. In a sound proof room the voice recording included simultaneous audio and electrolaryngograph readings. The voice recordings were scored according to the GRBAS voice scale by an experienced rater. Acoustic analysis was performed form the electrolaryngograph recording using the SpeechStudioTM software. Several objective acoustic parameters were calculated from both sustained vowels and connected speech. These include: fundamental frequency (Fx), jitter, shimmer, harmonics to noise ratio (HNR) and normalized noise energy (NNE). In the comparative study of TLM versus RT and the prospective TLM study, patients were asked to complete voice-specific and quality of life questionnaires. The voice-specific questionnaires were the Voice Symptom Scale (VoiSS) and the Voice Handicap Index- 10 (VHI- 10). The quality of life questionnaire adopted was the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQoL) version 4. Results: In the acoustic analysis of sustained vowels in normal speech, females have a statistically significantly higher Fx than males (adjusted p=< 0. 05). There is no other statistically significant difference across the domains for sustained vowels in normal speech. In the analysis of connected speech, Fx is again higher in females (p< 0. 001). There is no statistically significant difference in amplitude (Ax) or contact quotient (Qx). In the comparison of voice post TLM and RT, there is no statistical difference in voice-specific questionnaires between the groups. The UW-QoL 4 found a statistically significantly higher QoL score in the TLM compared with the RT group for appearance (p= 0. 003), recreation (p= 0. 048), chewing (p= 0. 015) and saliva (p= 0. 016), however these are not statistically significant when adjusted for age. Overall for QoL, the RT group have a statistically significantly lower median score compared to TLM in physical function (p= 0. 004) and this remains statistically significant when adjusted for age (p= 0. 036). There is no statistically significant difference for social function (p= 0. 441). There is no statistically significant difference in perceptual rating (GRBAS score) between RT and TLM groups (total mean 5. 49 vs. 5. 12, p= 0. 254). Most domains as part of the acoustic analysis of sustained vowels show no statistically significant difference between RT and TLM. The mean Fx analysis on connective speech is statistically significantly higher in the TLM group (161. 2 Hz vs. 131. 1 Hz, adjusted p= 0. 001). <b>Coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> is statistically significantly higher in the TLM group (48. 6 % vs. 36. 0 %, adjusted p= 0. 027) and pitch irregularity is statistically significantly higher in the RT group (26. 7 % vs. 14. 9 %, adjusted p= 0. 013). There is no statistically significant difference in mean amplitude between the two groups. Coherence of amplitude is statistically significantly higher in the TLM group (adjusted p= 0. 006) and amplitude irregularity is statistically significantly higher in the RT group, (12. 4 % vs. 6. 3 %, adjusted p= 0. 005). There is no statistically significant difference in mean contact quotient (p= 0. 368), coherence (p= 0. 236) or irregularity (p= 0. 125) when comparing TLM and RT. In the comparison of voice pre and post TLM, there is no statistical difference in voice-specific questionnaires between the groups. There is no statistically significant difference in the UW-QOLv 4 domain scores or composite scores in patients pre- and post- TLM. There was no statistically significant difference in mean score for ‘G’,’R’,’B’ and ‘S’ indicators as part of perceptual rating between pre and post TLM patients, although asthenia was statistically significantly lower post-TLM (0. 97 vs. 0. 94, adjusted p= 0. 015). There is no statistically significant difference in any of the domains in the acoustic analysis of sustained vowels pre and post TLM. In the acoustic analysis of connected speech, the mean DFx is statistically significantly higher in the post TLM group (adjusted p= 0. 001). There is no statistically significant difference in the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> or pitch irregularity when comparing pre and post TLM. There is no statistically significant difference in the mean DAx (p= 0. 121), coherence (p= 0. 472) or irregularity of amplitude (p= 0. 184) when comparing pre and post TLM. There is no statistically significant difference in the mean DQx (adjusted p= 0. 904), coherence (adjusted p= 0. 293) or irregularity of the contact quotient (adjusted p= 0. 400) when comparing pre and post TLM. Conclusion: The treatment of T 1 a laryngeal carcinoma with either TLM or RT has been shown to have comparably good local control. There are advantages and disadvantages of both treatments, however TLM is often preferred by patient and clinician as it is a day case procedure, can provide histological clearance and leaves the option to use RT in the future. However voice outcomes of the procedures have been debated with various reports in the literature. There are challenges when comparing the two treatment modalities due to a number of tumour, patient and surgical factors. It {{is not surprising that the}} voice is affected by whatever treatment is performed to treat the glottic carcinoma. This study shows that voice quality is good, however it is measured, for after both TLM and RT...|$|E

40|$|Many current methods on {{structural}} damage identification such as GA algorithms and neural networks technology are often implemented {{based on a}} few measured data {{and a large number}} of simulation data from structural vibration responses. Therefore, to establish an accurate and efficient dynamics model for a structure with different damage is an important precondition, so that plentiful simulation data of structural vibration response can be acquired using the dynamics model of the structure with damage. There are two problems when directly meshing small {{structural damage}} in FEM modeling, i. e., excessive gridding number and unavoidable errors from differently meshing for the same damaged structure.

The present study systematically investigated the normal aging effect in the visual cortex using 3 indices <b>of</b> low <b>frequency</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> resting state BOLD fMRI, i. e., amplitude <b>of</b> low <b>frequency</b> fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC). These 3 resting state measurements were compared with task induced BOLD activation in the visual cortex of 2 groups of 10 young and 10 elderly subjects.

While strong-field studies of HHG have often focused on above-threshold harmonic generation (photon energy above the ionization potential), for VUV frequency combs an understanding of below-threshold harmonic orders and their generation process is crucial. Here we present a new and quantitative study of the harmonics 7 - 13 generated below and near the ionization threshold in xenon gas.

Disorders <b>of</b> cognition-related <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> gamma <b>frequency</b> (30 - 80 Hz) oscillations between cortical areas {{are a major}} functional abnormality in schizophrenic patients. Does a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine or MK- 801 alter properties of cortical gamma oscillations? METHODS: Properties of spontaneously occurring gamma oscillations in the electrocorticogram of the neocortex of freely moving rats (n = 16) were measured before and after subcutaneous administration of a single dose of ketamine (< or = 10 mg/kg), MK- 801 (< or =. 16 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (< or = 1 mg/kg), apomorphine (< or = 1. 6 mg/kg), or vehicle (sodium chloride,. 9 %). RESULTS: The present study gives the first evidence that ketamine and MK- 801, both of which induce NMDAr-dependent functional disconnections, dose-dependently increase the power (200 %- 400 %) of wake-related gamma oscillations in the neocortex. Substances that modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission could also increase the gamma power but to a lesser degree.

Multiunit and compound field potentials evoked by auditory, visual, electrosensory and water displacement stimuli in this weakly electric fish are recorded with multiple semimicroelectrodes placed in many tracks and depths in or near area dorsalis telencephali, pars medialis (Dm). Most responsive loci are unimodal; some respond to two or more modalities. Each modality dominates a circumscribed area, chiefly separate. Auditory and electrical responses cluster in the dorsal 500 m of rostral and caudolateral Dm, respectively. Two auditory subdivisions underline specialization of this sense. Mechanoreception occupies a caudal area overlapping electroreception but centered 500 m deeper. Visual responses scatter widely through ventral areas. Auditory, electrosensory and mechanosensory responses are dominated by a negative wave within the first 50 ms, followed by 15 - 55 Hz oscillations and a slow positive wave with multiunit spikes lasting from 200 - 500 ms. Stimuli can induce shifts in <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>frequency</b> bands between neighboring loci.

40|$|Sea level {{observations}} from tide-gauge records {{located at the}} Adriatic coasts are analysed. The estimated sea level trends show variability in time and space. Spatial variability is assessed by estimating the differential trends by reference to Trieste. For many of the stations the differential trends become smaller than the corresponding error bars. This indicates that the land, atmospheric and oceanic contributors to sea level change are, at long scales, uniform in the basin. Observed trends in the longer records differ significantly for the periods before 1960 and after 1960. Atmospheric forcing {{has been a significant}} contribution in sea level variability for the period 1960 onwards. The atmospheric trends account for − 0. 8 mm/year for the period 1960 – 2000. No significant atmospheric trends appear to be present at the period 1900 – 1960. Changes in the atmospheric forcing alone are not capable of explaining fully the difference in the sea level trends for the periods before and after 1960. Steric trends for the period 1960 – 2000 have also been identified. Their magnitude depends on the depth used for their estimation. Steric trends range between − 0. 4 mm/year for the upper 100 m to − 2. 4 mm/year for the whole water column. The residual sea level after the removal of atmospheric and steric effects ranges between 2 and 3. 4 mm/year at various stations with an associated error bar of 1 mm/year.

To this end, work has been undertaken {{in the design and}} fabrication of HC-PCF, in the generation of Raman comb with a compact set-up and finally in an experimental demonstration <b>of</b> the mutual <b>coherence</b> between the comb spectral components. Here, the well-established photonic bandgap (PBG) HC-PCF is further developed. Surface mode spectral positions are controlled by chemical etching technique, and a single piece of fibre with two robust bandgaps is fabricated. Furthermore, the second established class of HC-PCF; namely large-pitch Kagome-lattice HC-PCF, has experienced challenging developments. This led to the fabrication of a hypocycloid-core seven-cell Kagome HC-PCF with comparable attenuation value to that of PBG HC-PCF while offering much larger bandwidth. Using the fabricated HC-PCF, different Raman frequency comb systems are developed. In addition to the previously-generated multi-octave Raman frequency comb from a large 1064 nm Nd:YAG Q-switch laser, several more compact version of Raman comb sources have been developed, including one whose lines lay in the visible and UV for applications in forensics and biomedicine. The Raman frequency comb generated inside a length of hydrogen-filled HC-PCF is further investigated by studying the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> the Raman lines. Despite of vacuum-fluctuation-initiation, it is demonstrated that the comb has self- and mutualcoherence properties within each single shot, bringing thus the possibility of generating attosecond pulses with non-classical properties.

The mixed-eccentricity fault is studied because it generalizes better the case encountered in any machine. IM inductances are calculated by using the modified winding function and including space harmonics of winding functions. It is also analytically detailed the genesis of the eccentricity signatures allowing the diagnosis. <b>Coherence</b> <b>of</b> simulated and experimental results in term <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> content proves a validity of the study...|$|R

Impact testing become famous due to their advantages for instances; fast, compatible for measurements {{in the field and}} relatively inexpensive. Even though these methods are fast and convenient, many important consideration should be take note during the measurement in order to get an accurate result. For this paper, hammer tip selection become the research issue. The thin sheet plate with different materials (Aluminum alloy; AA 7075 & AA 6061) joined by friction stir welding (FSW) will be used as a specimen. Four types of hammer tip used in this study; hard, medium, soft and super soft tip. The effect of hammer tip towards the shape <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> and <b>frequency</b> response function for ranging between 0 to 1000 Hz will be discussed further. From this experiment, it was found that medium tip chosen as the most compatible tip for thin plate joined by FSW...|$|R
40|$|The {{sound field}} deep within an {{acoustic}} shadow region is less well understood than that outside the shadow region. Signal levels are substantially lower within the shadow, but beamforming difficulties arise {{for other reasons}} such as loss <b>of</b> spatial <b>coherence.</b> Based on analysis of JAPE- 91 data, and other data, three types of characteristic signals within acoustic shadow regions are identified. These signal types may correspond to different, intermittent signal propagation conditions. Detection and classification algorithms might {{take advantage of the}} signal characteristics. Frequency coherence is also discussed. The extent <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> across <b>frequencies</b> is shown to be limited, causing difficulties for source classification based on harmonic amplitude relationships. Discussions emphasize short-term characteristics on the order of one second. A video presentation on frequency coherence shows the similarity, in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, between the received signal from a stable set of harmonics generated by a loudspeaker and that received from a helicopter hovering behind a hill...|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] moments of mode amplitudes at fixed frequency {{as a function of}} separations in mode number, time, and horizontal distance are investigated using mode-based transport equations and Monte Carlo simulation. These second moments are used to study full-field acoustic coherence, including depth separations. Calculations for low-order modes between 50 and 250 Hz are presented using a deep-water Philippine Sea environment. Comparisons between Monte Carlo simulations and transport theory for time and depth <b>coherence</b> at <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> 75 and 250 Hz and for ranges up to 500 km show good agreement. The theory is used to examine the accuracy of the adiabatic and quadratic lag approximations, and the range and <b>frequency</b> scaling <b>of</b> <b>coherence.</b> It is found that while temporal coherence has a dominant adiabatic component, horizontal and vertical coherence have more equal contributions from coupling and adiabatic effects. In addition, the quadratic lag approximation is shown to be most accurate at higher frequencies and longer ranges. Last the range and frequency scalings are found {{to be sensitive to the}} functional form of the exponential decay <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> with lag, but temporal and horizontal coherence show scalings that fall quite close to the well-known inverse frequency and inverse square root range laws.
