50|$|Philatelic forgery is the {{creation}} of false postage stamps that are designed to <b>look</b> <b>genuine.</b> Because of their wide publication, stamps are a powerful tool of propaganda.

5000|$|The artists they {{employed}} performed so {{well that}} immense quantities of these <b>counterfeits</b> <b>which</b> issued from the British government in New York, were circulated among the inhabitants of all the states, before the fraud was detected.

Instead of walking in the park we'll hunt up Willing Square, and we'll take the keys with us." ...|$|R

50|$|Flynn {{began his}} career as a Manhattan plumber. His first law {{enforcement}} job was as an agent in the United States Secret Service.

50|$|The case also {{highlights}} {{the threat of}} cyber attacks to both government and private institutions by cyber criminals using real bank codes to make orders <b>look</b> <b>genuine.</b> SWIFT has advised banks using the SWIFT Alliance Access system to strengthen their cyber security posture and ensure they are following SWIFT security guidelines.

60|$|I {{suppose they}} need not be very {{apprehensive}} of <b>counterfeits,</b> <b>which</b> {{it will be difficult}} to make so as not to be discovered; for it is plain that those bad halfpence called raps are so easily distinguished, even from the most worn genuine halfpenny, that nobody will now take them for a farthing, although under the great present want of change.|$|R

50|$|Later, Bernard {{calls at}} Hacker's flat and is greeted by Annie. The rosewater jar {{is on display}} and Bernard remarks upon it. He {{is not the first}} to enquire about it: Jenny Goodwin, a friend of Annie who works as a {{journalist}} for The Guardian, has also seen it and asked its value. When Annie told her that it was around £50, Jenny thought it <b>looked</b> <b>genuine</b> and asked if she could ring the Qumrani embassy to obtain its real value — and Annie agreed.|$|R
60|$|He {{wiped away}} the damp that had {{gathered}} on his forehead, reasoned with {{himself for a}} little while, and resolved to shake his mind free of the ghastly <b>counterfeit</b> <b>which</b> still clung to it by forcing himself to confront, {{if it was only}} for a moment, the solemn reality. Without allowing himself an instant to hesitate, he parted the curtains {{at the foot of the}} bed, and looked through.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} illegal patent acts {{can be handled}} by {{administrative}} authorities - ordinary infringement complaints regarding the making/importation, use, and sale/offering for sale of patented articles; and patent <b>counterfeiting</b> (<b>which</b> encompasses several acts similar to false marking).

40|$|Not {{long ago}} there {{appeared}} in the newspapers an Associated Press photograph of a happily smiling boy holding {{in front of him}} a huge loving-cup. It was a pleasing picture because it <b>looked</b> <b>genuine.</b> The boy was straightforwardly posing to be photographed, not taking part in what Al Smith called 2 ̆ 2 baloney, 2 ̆ 2 a picture ostensibly showing the actual bestowal of an award, but artificially posed afterward, with people looking a little foolish because this was not the real thing, and most people are not good actors...|$|R
5000|$|The 1990s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} in the collectability of Zemaitis' guitars {{and the appearance of}} forgeries. These forgeries in [...] "new" [...] and [...] "second hand" [...] guise at first glance may <b>look</b> <b>genuine</b> but they will not sound like a true Zemaitis due to the use of second-rate materials. During his 39 years of production, Zemaitis had a policy of never making any two guitars the same, {{while at the same time}} limiting himself to the production of only ten guitars a year to ensure the quality of each individual model.|$|R

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a <b>counterfeit,</b> <b>which</b> includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|R
