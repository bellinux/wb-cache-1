5|$|<b>Covenant</b> {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the <b>covenant</b> of works and <b>covenant</b> of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the <b>covenant</b> of works (sometimes called the <b>covenant</b> of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the <b>covenant</b> of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the <b>covenant</b> of grace. This <b>covenant</b> allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the <b>covenant</b> of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Covenant</b> army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn, the <b>Covenant</b> are a theocratic collection of alien {{species that are}} religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it. The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn {{are some of the}} earliest encounters with the <b>Covenant,</b> and the characters other than Master Chief were unaware of their existence.|$|E
5|$|After {{repelling}} a <b>Covenant</b> counterattack on the Forerunner facility, the Spirit of Fire {{travels to}} Arcadia, where the <b>Covenant</b> has begun raiding local cities and slaughtering civilians. Forge contacts the local Spartan special forces and assists with the evacuation process. The <b>Covenant</b> builds a giant energy shield {{to hide the}} construction of a gigantic Scarab super-weapon, but the UNSC forces use experimental equipment to break through. The Scarab is destroyed, but the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and escapes the planet.|$|E

40|$|We examine {{types of}} {{financial}} <b>covenants</b> {{and how they}} are used in Japanese loan markets. Since previous literature on <b>covenants</b> focused on US firms, little is known about financial <b>covenants</b> in the so-called bank-oriented countries. We use a hand-collected dataset to explore the (1) types of financial <b>covenants</b> and (2) determinants of the use and strictness of financial <b>covenants.</b> Our binominal regression analysis shows that financial factors such as profitability, leverage, and interest rates affect the use of financial <b>covenants.</b> Most interestingly, we find that factors specific to Japan, dependence on the main bank and foreign shareholder ownership, also affect the use of financial <b>covenants.</b> Furthermore, we present that the borrower’s leverage is a key determinant for the strictness of financial <b>covenants...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the audio}} {{commentary}} for Alien: <b>Covenant,</b> Scott confirmed that {{a sequel to}} Alien: <b>Covenant,</b> tentatively referred to as Alien: <b>Covenant</b> 2, is being written by John Logan, with Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Danny McBride reprising their roles. Scott also confirmed that the film will cap his prequel series, leading directly into the events of Alien.|$|E
5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the <b>covenant.</b> Old Testament <b>covenant</b> signs include the rainbow which appeared following a <b>covenant</b> made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's <b>covenant</b> with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E
50|$|Negative <b>covenants</b> are clauses in debt {{contracts}} that limit or prohibit corporate actions (e.g. sale of assets, payment of dividends) that could impair {{the position of}} creditors. Negative <b>covenants</b> may be continuous or incurrence-based. Violations of negative <b>covenants</b> are rare compared to violations of affirmative <b>covenants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Part II of this Comment {{will begin}} by {{examining}} the history of racially restrictive <b>covenants,</b> specifically the nature of <b>covenants</b> {{and the role of}} the federal government in both spreading and hindering the usage of such <b>covenants.</b> Part III will discuss the legal underpinnings of what makes such <b>covenants</b> unenforceable in Washington, and the best processes an attorney can use to remove them. Part IV will discuss a recent case that has significantly altered the collateral consequences of attempting to destroy racially restrictive <b>covenants</b> upon other associated <b>covenants.</b> As a result, those seeking to retain the benefits of other <b>covenants</b> associated with the land should no longer fear that an entire set of beneficial <b>covenants</b> will be invalidated due to a specific challenge against a racially restrictive provision. Although the Washington Supreme Court has made this abundantly clear in the case of textually separate <b>covenants,</b> it has left open the question of multiple restrictions that are not textually distinct. Part V provides an analysis of Washington courts 2 ̆ 7 logic and prevailing policy, and that of other jurisdictions that have tackled this issue, and Part V also argues that Washington courts would likely allow the racially restrictive portions of <b>covenants</b> to be excised from a document without endangering affiliated <b>covenants,</b> regardless of how the <b>covenants</b> are structured...|$|R

40|$|Conservation <b>covenants</b> and {{easements}} {{have become}} essential tools to secure biodiversity outcomes on private land, and {{to assist in}} meeting international protection targets. In Australia, the number and spatial area of conservation <b>covenants</b> has grown significantly in the past decade. Yet {{there has been little}} research or detailed policy analysis of conservation <b>covenanting</b> in Australia. We sought to determine how conservation <b>covenanting</b> agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on <b>covenanted</b> properties, and factors inhibiting or contributing to measuring these outcomes. In addition, we also investigated the drivers and constraints associated with actually delivering the biodiversity outcomes, drawing on detailed input from <b>covenanting</b> programs. Although all conservation <b>covenanting</b> programs had the broad aim of maintaining or improving biodiversity in their <b>covenants</b> in the long term, the specific stated objectives of conservation <b>covenanting</b> programs varied. Programs undertook monitoring and evaluation in different ways and at different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it was difficult to determine the extent Australian conservation <b>covenanting</b> agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on <b>covenanted</b> properties on a national scale. Lack of time available to covenantors to undertake management {{was one of the biggest}} impediments to achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes. A lack of financial resources and human capital to monitor, knowing what to monitor, inconsistent monitoring methodologies, a lack of benchmark data, and length of time to achieve outcomes were all considered potential barriers to monitoring the biodiversity conservation outcomes of conservation <b>covenants...</b>|$|R

40|$|Though <b>covenants</b> {{are usually}} {{considered}} the private sector’s alternative to zoning, governments also use <b>covenants</b> to control land use. Governments choose between zoning and <b>covenants,</b> and this choice illuminates the legal {{differences between the}} two tools. <b>Covenants</b> and zoning are not distinguished by the substantive restrictions each tool can impose on land use. Rather, a critical distinction between the two is that governments use the customizability of <b>covenants,</b> as tools of private law, to limit citizen enforcement of the covenants’ land use provisions. Zoning, by contrast, allows for citizen enforcement. Zoning also requires greater public participation and involves different amendment procedures...|$|R

500|$|Although {{they were}} {{previously}} rare, racially restrictive <b>covenants</b> among property owners that outlawed the purchase, lease, or occupation of their properties by African Americans became common in Chicago in the 1920s, following the Great Migration.
