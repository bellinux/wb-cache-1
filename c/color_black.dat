25|$|The Knicks updated their 'New Look Logo', {{this time}} {{eliminating}} the <b>color</b> <b>black</b> from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, {{but for the}} 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their 'Championship Era' uniforms. A more subtle and bolder 'New York' script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase Once A Knick, Always A Knick is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, {{an updated version of}} their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Various breeds {{are often}} mistaken for Vizslas, and Vizslas are often mistaken for other breeds. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks {{are some of}} the most {{commonly}} confused breeds. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas. The nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat <b>color.</b> <b>Black,</b> brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.|$|E

And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E

500|$|The DVD {{was shot}} in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 on a single sided, double layered disc, with the image being {{enhanced}} for 16×9 televisions. The black-and-white visuals had mixed a lot of visual styles according to Jacobson, and had grains and erratic focus. The non-concert color sequences followed the same style, but the performance sequences were in high definition. Backgrounds were dark and Jacobson noted that the <b>color</b> <b>black</b> appeared taut and full, while the few low-light bits came across well. The 5.1 surround sound was mostly utilized during the live performance sequences. The live CD consisted of two pre-recorded tracks, [...] "The Beast Within" [...] and [...] "Hollywood". There are 12deleted scenes, spanning a total of 15minutes and 38seconds; scenes include Madonna on a bike, working with vocal coach Joan Leder, affinity for French and comical sequences featuring Price and musician Steve Sidelnyk.

2500|$|To {{create the}} image Fitzpatrick made a paper {{negative}} {{on a piece}} of equipment called a grant.

2500|$|In Spanish, [...] (feminine [...] ) is most {{commonly}} used for the <b>color</b> <b>black,</b> {{but it can also}} be used to describe people with dark-colored skin. In Spain, Mexico and almost all of Latin America, negro (lower-cased, as ethnonyms are generally not capitalized in Romance languages) means 'black person'. As in English, this Spanish word is often used figuratively and negatively, to mean 'irregular' or 'undesirable', as in [...] ('black market'). However, in Spanish-speaking countries where there are fewer people of West African slave origin, such as Argentina and Uruguay, negro and negra are commonly used to refer to partners, close friends or people in general, independent of skin color. In Venezuela the word negro is similarly used, despite its large West African slave-descended population percentage.|$|E

2500|$|In colonial Virginia the {{majority}} of free people of color were descended from marriages or relationships of white men (servants or free) and black women (slave, servant or free), reflecting the fluid relationships among working people.
