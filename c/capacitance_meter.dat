These timber frame elements are affected by their moisture content and by the passage of time.

40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a low cost, highly accurate low capacitance measurement system that can be used over a range of 0 – 400 pF with a resolution of 1 pF. The range of capacitance may be easily altered by a simple resistance or capacitance variation of the measurement circuit. This capacitance measurement system uses quad two-input NAND Schmitt trigger circuit CD 4093 B with hysteresis for the measurement and this system is integrated with PIC 18 F 2550 microcontroller for data acquisition purpose. The microcontroller interacts with software developed in the PC end through USB architecture and an attractive graphical user interface (GUI) based system is developed in the PC end to provide the user with real time, online display of capacitance under measurement. The system uses a differential mode of capacitance measurement, with reference to a trimmer capacitance, that effectively compensates lead capacitances, a notorious error encountered in usual low capacitance measurements. The hysteresis provided in the Schmitt-trigger circuits enable reliable operation of the system by greatly minimizing the possibility of false triggering because of stray interferences, usually regarded as another source of significant error. The real life testing of the proposed system showed that our measurements could produce highly accurate capacitance measurements, when compared to cutting edge, high end digital <b>capacitance</b> <b>meters.</b> Keywords—Capacitance measurement, NAND Schmitt trigger, microcontroller, GUI, lead compensation, hysteresis...|$|R

Development of a cost-effective multiphase flow meter to determine the individual phase flow rates of oil, water and gas was experimentally investigated by means of low cost, simple and non-intrusive commercially available sensors. Features from absolute pressure, differential pressure (axial), gamma densitometer, conductivity and <b>capacitance</b> <b>meters,</b> in combination with pattern recognition techniques were used to detect shifts in flow conditions, such as flow structure, pressure and salinity changes and measured multiphase flow parameters simultaneously {{without the need for}} preconditioning or prior knowledge of either phase. The experiments were carried out at the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL) Multiphase facility. Data was sampled at 250 Hz across a wide spectrum of flow conditions. Fluids used were nitrogen gas, oil (Forties and Beryl crude oil – D 80, 33 o API gravity) and water (salinity levels of 50 and 100 g/l MgSO 4). The sensor spool piece was horizontally mounted on a 4 -inch (102 mm) pipe, and the database was obtained from two different locations on the flow loop. The ability to learn from ‘experience’ is a feature of neural networks. The use of neural networks allows re-calibration of the measuring system on line through a retraining process when new information becomes available. Some benefits and capabilities of intelligent multiphase flow systems include:  Reduction in the physical size of installations.  Sensor fusion by merging the operating envelopes of different sensors employed provided even better results.  Monitoring of flow conditions, not just flow rate but also composition of components.  Using conventional sensors within the system will present the industry with a much lower cost multiphase meter, and better reliability.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this dissertation, we present the first {{experimental}} validation process of EMM for measuring the performance-based flexure width of a pair of MEMS devices through capacitance sensing. We define the performance-based flexure width as the width that the model must have such that the performance of the model matches the performance of the true device. We validate EMM’s practicality, precision, repeatability, and ability to create experimentally accurate models. ^ We create the first EMM test and validation process. The capacitance measurement uncertainty of our <b>capacitance</b> <b>metering</b> system is about 20 aF. Our present design and equipment prototype setup yields a width measurement uncertainty on the order of 1 nm, which is about an order of magnitude better than what we are able to achieve using SEM. The ultimate of EMM uncertainty has yet to be explored. EMM theory suggests that uncertainty can be further improved by increasing deflection, improving the precision of applied voltage, reducing parasitic capacitance, improving the precision of capacitance, reducing the overall size of the device, or optimizing the design parameters. ^ Our validation procedure includes using the conventional SEM to visually measure the width of flexures having coarse sidewalls at various axial locations. Human error and subjectivity are associated with each SEM measurement in determining the edge location of the coarse sidewalls. In fact, every time SEM measurements are made, the result varies. SEM measurements are good for inspecting local geometry details. However, SEM cannot be used to measure the performance-based width. That is, the average width obtained by SEM cannot be used for bending models because stiffness is nonlinear in width. Moreover, width varies along the thickness of the flexure, which cannot be measured by SEM. Since there are no standards for measuring width and since SEM does not provide complete validation, we instead use SEM as a bounding validation method. That is, the direction and magnitude of the measurements are comparable. For example, if the width measured by SEM is larger than layout width, then the performance-based width measured by EMM is larger as well, and about the same order of magnitude. In addition, the performance-based width measured by EMM lies within the estimated bounded range of minimum and maximum width measured by SEM. ^ In the second part of this dissertation, we modify the original EMM theory for geometry from measuring flexure width (EMM 1) to measuring gap stop (EMM 2). We present the first experimental validation process of EMM 2. Compared to EMM 1, EMM 2 reduces the number of devices to one, reduces thermal vibrations through contact, and eliminates the sensitivities to non-ideal geometries and compliant bulk material. Our results validate the EMM 2 in terms of its practicality, precision, and repeatability, and also suggest its accuracy though bounding analysis from SEM measurements. ^ The capacitance measurement uncertainties of the probing and wire bonding <b>capacitance</b> <b>metering</b> systems are about 20 aF and 80 aF, respectively. With our current design and system configuration, we achieve a gap measurement uncertainty on the order of 1 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Our results are better than what we were able to achieve using our available SEM. The ultimate of EMM 2 uncertainty has yet to be explored. EMM 2 theory suggests that uncertainty can be further improved by reducing parasitic capacitance, improving the precision of capacitance, or optimizing design parameters. ^ In the third part of this dissertation, we present how to extend the results of EMM 2 measurements of gap to immediately extract measurements of displacement, force, and stiffness without any further calibration efforts. Measurements of displacement, force, and stiffness are based on accepted first principles: the comb drive’s linear relationship between capacitance and displacement, the relationship between stored potential energy and electrostatic force, and the linear force-displacement for folded flexure with small deflection. Our results validate EMM 2 ’s practicality, precision, and repeatability for measuring displacement, force, and stiffness, and also suggest its ability to create experimentally accurate models.

The {{first section of}} this work is principally aimed at producing resistance and <b>capacitance</b> type <b>meter</b> species correction data for a commercially popular species of Tasmanian Eaucalypt, Eaucalyptus delegatensis. The resistance type meter correction data obtained deviate from those values given in the Australian Standard. Differences in resistance meter electrode placement {{are assumed to be}} the cause of the deviations. Regression trendlines obtained for the capacitance-type moisture meters were shown to have a lesser degree of accuracy than those for the resistance-type moisture meters due to the effects of density. The practice of measuring the average moisture content at a depth of 115 th of the thickness of a board using insulated probes in conjunction with resistance-type moisture meters was reinforced. The second part of this project involved work on a solar kiln situated at Kelly's Timber - Dunally. The purpose of the work was to try and improve the drying efficiency of the kiln and monitor it's progress throughout the drying process. Three drying trials were performed. A full schedule was provided for one of the trials where green sawn timber was fully dried to EMC. The success of the schedule was tainted by the poor quality of the timber before the drying process began. Air flow was improved throughout the kiln by the use of appropriate baffling and racking of the timber as recommended by the author. The temperature distribution and humidity control inside the kiln was found to be satisfactory.
