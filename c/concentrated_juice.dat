25|$|Eiswein (ice wine) wine is made grapes that freeze {{naturally}} on {{the vine}} and have to reach the same potential alcohol level as Beerenauslese. The grapes are harvested and pressed in the frozen state. The ice stays in the press during pressing and hence a <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> flows off the press leading to higher potential alcohol levels, which in turn generally result in sweet wines due to the high potential alcohol. The taste differs from the other high-level wines since Botrytis infection is usually lower, ideally completely absent.|$|E

50|$|Cryoextraction is {{the process}} by which grapes are frozen with {{refrigeration}} and pressed. Winemakers subject grapes to temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (or -7 degrees Celsius), and press them while still frozen. Ice crystals remain in the press, while <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> flows out. The resulting wine resembles ice wine. The process of freeze distillation is similar in its concentrating effects, although it occurs after fermentation.|$|E

50|$|The {{heatwave}} greatly {{accelerated the}} ripening of grapes; also, the heat dehydrated the grapes, making for more <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice.</b> By mid-August, the grapes in certain vineyards had already reached their optimal sugar content, possibly resulting in 12.0°-12.5° wines (see alcoholic degree). Because of that, {{and also of}} the impending change to rainy weather, the harvest was started much earlier than usual (e.g. in mid-August for areas that are normally harvested in September).|$|E
50|$|The <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> {{is held in}} a coldwall {{tank and}} is stored at or below 35 °F to prevent {{browning}} and development of undesired flavors. Next, {{a small amount of}} fresh juice is added to the <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> to restore natural and fresh flavors of orange juice that have been lost through the concentration process. Specific cold-pressed orange oils are used to restore the lost aroma and volatile flavors. After the addition of fresh juice, the brix content is reduced to 42 °F. The fresh juice is referred to as “cut-back” in the industry and attributes to 7-10% of the total juice. Orange peel oil is also added if the oil content is below the required level. The concentrate is then further cooled in a continuous cooler or coldwall tank to 20 to 25 °F. The concentrate is canned using steam injection methods to sterilize the lid and develop a vacuum in the can. The cans then undergo final freezing where they are conveyed on a perforated belt in an air blast at -40 °F. After freezing, the product is stored at 0 °F in a refrigerated warehouse.|$|E

40|$|Extended AbstractsIn {{the context}} of a healthy diet, fruits {{contribute}} to a decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. They are considered to have multiple beneficial health effects and are {{an essential part of the}} Mediterranean Diet. Orange in particular, is broadly consumed worldwide by different age groups, but mainly as juice. Food composition databases (FCDB) are resources providing detailed information on the nutritional composition of foods, usually from a particular country. The aim of the study was to determine the nutritional composition of four samples of commercial orange juices (one nectar, and three <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices)</b> and to contribute for the update of Portuguese FCDB. The orange juices were acquired in local supermarkets. Packages of the analysed samples were randomly chosen and corresponded to different batches. According to the label the <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> were 100 % orange juice (juice and pulp). The content of water, ash, total protein, total fat, total dietary fibre and sugars were determined. The energy value (kJ/kcal) was calculated. Water was the major constituent in the analysed samples and varied between 88. 6 ± 0. 0 g/ 100 g of edible portion (nectar), and 93. 0 ± 0. 0 g/ 100 g of edible portion (<b>concentrated</b> <b>juices).</b> Regarding the total protein and total fat contents, the lowest value was observed in the nectar, and the highest values in the <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices.</b> The present study will contribute with new and reliable data for inclusion in the Portuguese FCDB. Food composition data are important in many fields, namely government nutrition policies, public health and education, and for the food manufacturing industry.

50|$|After {{the juice}} is filtered, {{it may be}} {{concentrated}} in evaporators, which {{reduce the size of}} juice by a factor of 5, making it easier to transport and increasing its expiration date. Juices are concentrated by heating under a vacuum to remove water, and then cooling to around 13 degrees Celsius. About two thirds of the water in a juice is removed. The juice is then later reconstituted, in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process. Juices can also be sold in a concentrated state, in which the consumer adds water to the <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> as preparation.|$|E

5000|$|Wide {{perspectives}} for pumpable ice usage open up for {{the production}} of special wines reminiscent of [...] "ice wine" [...] (German Eiswein). In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, pumpable ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the grapes. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the pumpable ice machine. The juice is pumped through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice.</b> Liquid ice returns to the accumulation tank, {{in which there is a}} natural (according to Archimedes law) separation of ice and juice. The cycle is repeated many times until the sugar concentration reaches 50-52°Brix. Then a process of fermentation takes place, resulting in this alcoholic drink.|$|E

5000|$|Catechol {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1839 by Edgar Hugo Emil Reinsch (1809 - 1884) by distilling {{it from the}} solid tannic preparation catechin, which is the residuum of catechu, the boiled or <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f). Upon heating catechin above its decomposition point, a substance that Reinsch first named Brenz-Katechusäure (burned catechu acid) sublimated as a white efflorescence. This was a thermal decomposition product of the flavanols in catechin. In 1841, both Wackenroder and Zwenger independently rediscovered catechol; in reporting on their findings, Philosophical Magazine coined the name pyrocatechin. [...] By 1852, Erdmann realized that catechol was benzene with two oxygen atoms added to it; in 1867, August Kekulé realized that catechol was a diol of benzene, so by 1868, catechol was listed as pyrocatechol. [...] In 1879, the Journal of the Chemical Society recommended that catechol be called [...] "catechol", and in the following year, it was listed as such.|$|E
5000|$|Phthalates is a {{chemical}} added to plastics {{used for the}} purpose of strengthening plastic’s flexibility, durability, longevity and transparency. In 2011 there was a discovery of phthalates inside sold Canadian beverages. It was surprisingly found in processed food items such as <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> beverages, tea drinks, and other food supplements. This low cost substance had replaced regular food additives, which would normally be an emulsifier for the contents inside the drinks to generate a more attractive and natural appearance. Over-consumption of these harmful compounds can lead to very serious negative health effects such as endocrine disruption, malformation of reproductive organs, infertility and abnormal neurodevelopment. It is important to know that the maximum daily intake for this chemical is 0.05 mg/kg/day for a 70 kg body weight individual. Fortunately, the study has shown that some beverages contain insufficient amount of phthalates levels that will not exceed the daily limit. In high concentrations, it could modify the product's appearance significantly as well.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} the {{state-owned}} Al Ahram Beverages Company was privatized in 1997 all noble grapes {{that had previously been}} planted by its subsidiary, Gianaclis Vineyards, were lost. This meant that grapes had to be imported, mainly from Lebanon. This coincided with a boom in the tourism industry which meant wineries had to produce cheap wine in large quantities to meet the surging demand from Western tourists. Due to the lack of locally produced wine grapes wineries imported <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> from Europe which would be diluted with water and fermented, contributing to the negative reputation of Egyptian wine. The Gianaclis Vineyards started planting vines again in 2004 in Alexandria and Luxor. By 2010 only 2% of their wines were made with Lebanese grapes, with Egyptian grapes used for the remainder of their production. The industry has in recent years started experimenting with international varieties to find grapes that are suited for the Egyptian climate. The main varieties used in red wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Grenache, Bobal and Tempranillo, while Viognier, Chardonnay and Muscat are used for white wines.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{reverse osmosis}} and vacuum-evaporation {{technologies}} {{are used to}} concentrate juices and other food liquids. In commercial operations, juice is normally concentrated by evaporation. Since 1962, the Thermally Accelerated Short Time Evaporator (TASTE) has been widely used. TASTE evaporators are efficient, sanitary, easy to clean, of high capacity, simple to operate, and of relatively low cost. On the other hand, there is some heat damage to the product caused by the high-temperature steam treatment. This treatment results in product quality and aroma losses. Because of the low value of the film coefficient between steam and treated juice, heat transfer between them is very inefficient. It leads to the cumbersome construction of TASTE plants. The alternative is to concentrate juice and food liquid by a cooling and freezing process. In this case crystals of pure water are removed from the juice, wine, or beer by crystallization. The aroma, color, and flavor remain in the concentrated medium. The quality of freeze-concentrated products cannot be achieved by any other technology. The main advantages in comparison with other freezing techniques are low energy expenditure and the possibility to tune {{the rate of the}} phase change from liquid to solid ice, which in turn increases the production of pure water ice crystals and simplifies the separation of <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> or food liquid and ice crystals.|$|E
