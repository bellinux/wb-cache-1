50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor {{are similar to}} those of neurosteroids. Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing GABA function and in turn have effects on mood and other functions. Many benzodiazepines (diazepam, medazepam, estazolam, temazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam) potently inhibit the enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurosteroids. The tetrahydroxazole ring that <b>cloxazolam</b> and oxazolam have decreases the inhibitory potency of benzodiazepines on neurosteroids. Thus there could be subtle differences between <b>cloxazolam</b> and other benzodiazepines. However, because the parent prodrugs of <b>cloxazolam</b> and oxazolam were tested rather than the active metabolites, this is purely speculative.|$|E
50|$|Delorazepam, {{also known}} as chlordesmethyldiazepam and nordiclazepam, is a drug which is a {{benzodiazepine}} and a derivative of desmethyldiazepam. It is marketed in Italy, where it is available under the trade name EN and Dadumir. Delorazepam (chlordesmethyldiazepam) is also an active metabolite of the benzodiazepine drugs diclazepam and <b>cloxazolam.</b> Adverse effects may include hangover type effects, drowsiness, behavioural impairments and short-term memory impairments. Similar to other benzodiazepines delorazepam has anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{liquid chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry method {{was developed and}} validated for simultaneous detection of benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-like hypnotics and some metabolites (7 -aminoflunitrazepam, alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, chlordiazepoxide, chlornordiazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, clotiazepam, <b>cloxazolam,</b> diazepam, ethylloflazepate, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, N-desmethylflunitrazepam, nitrazepam, N-methylclonazepam (internal standard), nordiazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) in urine and whole blood. Sample preparation was performed on a mixed-mode cation exchange solid phase extraction cartridge. Electrospray ionization {{was found to be}} more efficient than atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The use of a mobile phase of high pH resulted in higher retention and higher electrospray ionization signals than the conventional low pH mobile phases. Considering the benefits of a high pH mobile phase on both chromatography and mass spectrometry, its use should be encouraged. In the final method, gradient elution with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 9) and methanol was performed on a small particle column (Acquity C 18, 1. 7 μm, 2. 1 mm × 50 mm).

40|$|A rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific LC-MS/MS method {{was developed and}} validated for quantifying chlordesmethyldiazepam (CDDZ or delorazepam), the active metabolite of <b>cloxazolam,</b> in human plasma. In the analytical assay, bromazepam (internal standard) and CDDZ were extracted using a liquid-liquid extraction (diethyl-ether/hexane, 80 / 20, v/v) procedure. The LC-MS/MS method on a RP-C 18 column had an overall run time of 5. 0 min and was linear (1 /x weighted) over the range 0. 5 - 50 ng/mL (R > 0. 999). The between-run precision was 8. 0 % (1. 5 ng/mL), 7. 6 % (9 ng/mL), 7. 4 % (40 ng/mL), and 10. 9 % at the low limit of quantification-LLOQ (0. 500 ng/mL). The between-run accuracies were 0. 1, - 1. 5, - 2. 7 and 8. 7 % for the above mentioned concentrations, respectively. All current bioanalytical method validation requirements (FDA and ANVISA) were achieved and it {{was applied to the}} bioequivalence study (Cloxazolam-test, Eurofarma Lab. Ltda and Olcadil (R) -reference, Novartis Biociencias S/A). The relative bioavailability between both formulations was assessed by calculating individual test/reference ratios for Cmax, AUClast and AUCO-inf. The pharmacokinetic profiles indicated bioequivalence since all ratios were as proposed by FDA and ANVISA. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A liquid chromatography-tandem mass {{spectrometry}} method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous quantification of 26 benzodiazepines and metabolites, zolpidem and zopiclone, in blood, urine, and hair. Drugs were extracted from all matrices by liquid-liquid extraction with 1 -chlorobutane. Chromatography was achieved using a XTerra MS C 18 column eluted {{with a mixture of}} methanol and formate buffer. Data were acquired using positive electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring using one precursor ion/product ion transition per compound. Quantification was performed using 13 deuterated analogues. Further confirmation of the identity of the compounds was achieved through a second injection of positive samples, monitoring two transitions per compound. The limits of quantification for all benzodiazepines ranged from 1 to 2 ng/mL in blood, 10 to 25 ng/mL in urine, and 0. 5 to 10 pg/mg in hair. Linearity was observed from the limit of quantification of each compound to 200 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 pg/mg for blood, urine, and hair, respectively (r 2 > 0. 99). Precision for quality control samples, spiked at three concentrations, was calculated (CV < 20 % in most cases). Extraction recoveries for the three matrices ranged from 25. 1 to 103. 8 %, except for one compound (<b>cloxazolam</b> in urine). Ion suppression was studied for all matrices. The validated assay was applied to authentic blood, urine, and hair samples from forensic cases. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, <b>cloxazolam,</b> clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
