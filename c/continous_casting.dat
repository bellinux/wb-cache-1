40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main {{results of a}} study aimed at evaluating the effects of failures on the performance indexes of a <b>continous</b> <b>casting</b> plant that produces hot rolled bars. The analysis took into consideration the various steps of the process from charging electric arc furnaces to cutting and transferring blooms to the cooling beds. A large amount of data was available for the parameters of interest for the study: this {{made it possible to}} make simulation model of the plant and to perform an appropriate statistical analysis of input-output data to validate it. Eventually, the model allowed determining the effects on the production capacity of innovative technologies for failure reduction and of new maintenance policie...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} for rheologic {{behaviors of}} semisolid <b>continous</b> <b>casting</b> billets of A 356 alloy in semisolid {{state has been}} carried out with a multifunctional rheometer. The results show that the deformation rate increases with loading time, the maximum strain reaches 120 % (which is one time larger than that of traditional casting billet) and the strain can be rapidly eliminated to 10 % after unloading. Moreover, there is a critic stress for billet deformation even in semisolid state, which is named as critic shear stress. This stress increases with the decreasing of heating time. The rheologic behaviors can be expressed by five elements mechanical model and can be modified with the increasing of heating time...|$|E
40|$|Hot crack is one {{of common}} defects in castings, which often results in failure of castings. This work studies the {{formation}} of hot cracks during cold crucible <b>continous</b> <b>casting</b> by means of experiments and thoretical analysis. The {{results show that the}} hot crack occurs on the surface and in the circumference of ingots, where the solidified shell and solidification front meet each other. The tendency of hot cracking decreases with the increase of withdrawal velocities in some extent. The hot crack is caused mainly by friction force between the shell and the crucible inner wall, and it takes place when the stress resulting from friction exceeds the tensile strength of the shell. The factors affecting the hot cracks are analyzed and verified. In order to decrease the tendency of hot cracks, technical parameters should be optimized...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{concerns}} {{about the importance of}} the cast surfaces, surface phenomenon such as the formation of the oscillation marks and exudation and related defects including cracks and segregation that happened during the continuous casting. All of the investigated materials were collected during the plant trials while an in-depth analysis on these materials was performed at the laboratory scale with certain explanations supported by the schematic and theoretical models. The work consists on different material classes such as steels and phosphor bronzes with a focus on the surface defects and their improvements. In order to facilitate the theoretical analysis which could be capable of explaining the suggested phenomenon in the thesis, a reduced model is developed which required lesser computational resources with lesser convergence problems.
