40|$|Rapid {{technological}} progress {{in recent years}} has exacerbated the problems that arise in measuring price changes and, consequently, economic magnitudes at constant prices when changes in the quality of products occur. A natural means of tackling these measurement problems is to use hedonic price indices. This survey focuses on the use of hedonic methodology and its implications for the construction of deflators for significant National Accounts aggregates. It thus describes what hedonic methodology involves and analyses the various hedonic studies existing in the literature and the use made of hedonic methodology by different public statistics offices in the <b>computers</b> and <b>related</b> <b>equipment,</b> cars, and housing sectors. Finally, the implications of the use of these hedonic techniques for the estimation in real terms of macroeconomic magnitudes are reviewed.

40|$|The {{perception}} is widely {{held that the}} growth of the digital economy 1 is unprecedented and has been a major contributor to recent economic growth, the booming stock market, and the revival of productivity.

Because the economic data do not tell an unambiguous story about the digital economy, knowledgeable observers disagree about the importance of infor-mation technology (IT) and electronic commerce in the economy.

40|$|The paper links finance {{theory to}} labor {{economics}} and political {{economy in the}} context of migration and immigration policy. Most research treating the impact of immigration has focused on the consequences for employees as measured by wages, earnings, and employment. Less is known about the impact on employers. We lack answers to basic questions concerning the quantitative impact of immigrants on employer profit, and which employers are most likely to gain (suffer) increased (reduced) profits as a result of immigration. Using event study analysis, I measure the impact of immigration policy on the profit of employers and shareholders, particularly in those industries with high needs for skilled immigrants. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) of 1998 nearly doubled the available number of H- 1 B visas for skilled foreign workers in FY 1999. It {{was the first time that}} the U. S. government raised the annual cap of H- 1 B visa since 1990. I focus on this bill and analyze whether and by how much its passage increased shareholders' profit. The empirical results show that employers and shareholders in the top H- 1 B visa user industries enjoyed significant and positive returns with the passage of the ACWIA of 1998. Shareholders in high-tech industries (the top users of H- 1 B visa, 80 % of total) such as <b>Computers</b> and <b>related</b> <b>equipment,</b> and <b>Computer</b> and data processing services gained, respectively, an average 21. 54 % (15. 88 if weighted) and 22. 77 % (18. 11 if weighted) in cumulative excess returns in the month after the Act was passed, while industries with little need for H- 1 B visas experienced no significant changes in cumulative excess returns.
