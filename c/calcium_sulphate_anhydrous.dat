The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the efficacy and radiological quality of healing, the time to healing, the functional outcomes and the complications following curettage and grafting using an injectable aqueous <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (BonePlast; Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA) as the sole grafting strategy. METHODS: The procedure of curettage and grafting with an aqueous solution of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was undertaken. The patients were regularly reviewed clinically and radiologically for a minimum of 12 months (range: 12 - 85 months). Forty-six procedures in 46 patients were reviewed. Radiological outcomes of healing were established and functional outcomes were obtained from each patient at annual follow-up review. RESULTS: A complete response was seen in 38 patients (83 %) at a median of 6 months following the procedure (range: 1 - 24 months). Seven patients (15 %) displayed only a partial response after a median of 13 months post-surgery (range: 12 - 53 months). There was one non-response to treatment (2 %) after 40 months of follow-up. The mean functional score was 99 %.
