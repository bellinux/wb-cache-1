Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen.

[...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them about their experiences.

40|$|South Africa's {{decade of}} {{democracy}} inevitably {{gave rise to}} a transformed South Africa. She enjoys international status in the world {{and is one of the}} foremost countries in Africa. This status requires communication to engender good relations. Language is one of the key issues facing South Africa. There are eleven official languages in South Africa alone and a host of other languages in the world. English plays a very important role. It has become the lingua franca for South Africans. This qualitative case study investigated how English how English was taught to primary school pupils. Five teacher-trainees were observed and the lessons they delivered were captured on video camera. The trainees and the pupils have as their mother tongue, Xhosa. The researcher used purposeful sampling when selecting the teacher-trainees. The schools chosen were in close proximity to the college where the trainees lodged. This was convenient and economical. The purpose of the study was to establish how orientated the trainees were towards the communicative approach, the recommended approach by the Collegiate of Education, an arm of the University of Transkei. All colleges of education in the former Transkei fell under the jurisdiction of that Collegiate. Another factor was the transformation and its impact in the classroom. This study addressed the following issues. * Colleges of Education in transition * General educational transformation * State of feeder schools * Culture of learning and teaching The literature study included current changes in education that appeared in newspapers of the day. The paradigm shift from the apartheid system to present day was examined in this qualitative research. The focus of this empirical study was on the method of teaching English adopted by the teacher-trainees. Left to their own resources, the trainees delivered lessons. The data obtained from these lessons were analysed and interpreted using an evaluation sheet. There was clear indication that the lessons generally were teacher-centred. There was a lack of healthy communication in the classrooms. The passive pupils responded to questions posed by the trainees. The pupils were not given much <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> freely <b>to</b> the trainees or even among themselves, though they were seated in groups and groupwork was indicated [...] Emerging out of these findings are implications for all concerned : the prospective and present teachers; tertiary teacher training institutions; and the Department of Education.

40|$|Turning {{points are}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} key factors that can influence not only the formation of negative images but also their perpetuation or elimination in a conflict society. As a result, the examination and analysis of potential negative and/or positive turning points for a specific conflict are of central importance since they can reveal a great deal of both the already existing images and the possible shifts in these images. In the present study, a negative and a positive turning point in the Cyprus Conflict were chosen to be examined. The violent incidents in the Green Line in 1996 are described as one of the worst episodes since the partition of the island. They caused the lives of at least three people, whereas many others were seriously injured. Inevitably, it led to the escalation of the conflict. On the other hand, the opening of the checkpoints in 2003 is characterized as the first serious attempt for the resolution of the conflict. For the first time after thirty years, they had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> meet and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the 'other' by visiting their places of origin. This thesis examines the negative or positive impact of turning points on the change of images in the case of Cyprus Conflict. The data were derived from citizens' narratives published as articles in the press. Content analysis was used for their analysis, whereas a coding schema was created for the depiction of the potential changes in the images. The results of the research suggest that positive turning points lead to positively changing in the images that each party holds for the 'other' and, respectively, negative turning points lead to the negatively changing in the images that each party holds for the 'other'...|$|R

Chinese proletariat was young and numerically weak in the 1920 s. These workers nevertheless played a decisive role in the great strike wave culminating in the mid- 1920 s. Western scholars have provided conflicting narratives of the Chinese labour, but they mainly worked within the same paradigm of social class, with emphasis on workers’ socio-economic and cultural lives as precondition of their emergence as a political force. This paper looks at a different dimension of Chinese labour movement through examination of workers’ activism and militancy in the context of Communist and nationalist movements. More specifically, it explores the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ’s propaganda and educational work as a key component of Communist labour unions’ organizational and mobilization strategy. This paper will first look at Shanghai workers’ anti-imperialist strike in 1919 as stimulation to left-wing May Fourth intellectuals’ embrace of Marxism and identification with workers. Then it traces the mass education campaign popular {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century as the prelude of the CCP’s education drive among workers. Further, two main components of CCP’s mobilization strategies—labour periodicals and workers’ school [...] will be discussed to show their contributions to workers’ unionization and militancy. Little work has been done on this theme both in China and in the West. Finally, this paper tries to shed light on the relation between intellectuals and workers in reference to Lenin and Gramsci’s theories on the issue...|$|R
