There exists many <b>cognitive</b> <b>models,</b> each of which attempts to model a specific class of human behaviour. One major effect of stress {{is the cause of}} errors, both physical and cognitive. In order to model the effects of stress, two <b>cognitive</b> <b>models,</b> a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> of human errors and a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> of process control operators are examined in detail. In this thesis, the basic functions of the human cognitive system, its organization and a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> of error commission are first examined. The behaviour of a process control operator and a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> of the behaviour of the operator are then discussed. The known effects of stress on the process control operator's behaviour are described and {{a framework}} for modelling the behaviour of process control operators under stress is proposed. The inadequacies associated with existing <b>cognitive</b> <b>models</b> for process control operators are explained and a modified <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> is proposed, which takes into account the <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> of error.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of three <b>cognitive</b> <b>models,</b> one developed by content experts and two generated from student verbal reports for explaining examinee performance on a Grade 3 diagnostic mathematics test. For this study, the items were developed to directly measure the attributes in the <b>cognitive</b> <b>model.</b> The performance of each <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> was evaluated by examining its fit to different data samples: verbal report, total, high-, moderate-, and low ability using the Hierarchy Consistency Index (HCI; Cui, 2009) a model-data fit index. This study utilized cognitive diagnostic assessments developed under the framework of construct-centered test design and analyzed using the Attribute Hierarchy Method (AHM: Gierl, Wang, & Zhou, 2008; Leighton, Gierl, & Hunka, 2004).

We studied two theoretical frameworks that differed in their assumptions about the composition of the latent generating state.

We used a simulation-based approach to compare recovery of latent data-generating states in neurally-informed versus neurally-uninformed <b>cognitive</b> <b>models.</b> We found that neurally-informed <b>cognitive</b> <b>models</b> were more reliably recovered under a discrete state representation than a continuous dimension representation for medium effect sizes, although recovery was difficult for small sample sizes and moderate noise in neural data. Recovery improved for both representations when a larger effect size differentiated the latent states. We conclude that neural data aids the identification of latent states in <b>cognitive</b> <b>models,</b> but different frameworks for quantitatively informing <b>cognitive</b> <b>models</b> with neural information have different model recovery efficiencies.

5000|$|Thought {{processes}} are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, {{and the two}} hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought. The brain {{is divided into two}} hemispheres and a thick bundle of nerve fibres enable these two halves to communicate with each other. In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution. In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, L. Bruce Archer proposed [...] "that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their mind's eye, manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system.
