5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they <b>could</b> <b>continue</b> to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans <b>could</b> <b>continue</b> to live.|$|E

5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances <b>could</b> <b>continue</b> after Indian independence.

At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E
