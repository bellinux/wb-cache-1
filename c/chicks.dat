5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the <b>chicks</b> leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial <b>chicks</b> are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the <b>chicks</b> are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>chicks</b> hatch, {{the birds}} will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the <b>chicks</b> up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the <b>chicks</b> are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the <b>chicks</b> are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the <b>chicks</b> during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the <b>chicks</b> up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. <b>Chicks</b> receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven <b>chicks</b> receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no <b>chicks</b> are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the <b>chicks</b> will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism by}} which the 11 cell adhe-sion molecule mediates neurite outgrowth has been ex-amined.

These findings suggest that Ll-like molecules support neurite outgrowth via a “homophilic ” binding mechanism...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reactivation}} {{of chicken}} erythrocyte nuclei in chick-mammalian heterokaryons {{resulted in the}} activation of <b>chick</b> globin gene expression. However, the level of <b>chick</b> globin synthesis was dependent on the mammalian parental cell type. The level of globin synthesis was high in <b>chick</b> erythrocyte-rat L 6 myoblast heterokaryons but was 10 -fold lower in <b>chick</b> erythrocyte-mouse A 9 cell heterokaryons. Heterokaryons between <b>chick</b> erythrocytes and a hybrid cell line between L 6 and A 9 expressed <b>chick</b> globin at a level {{similar to that of}} A 9 heterokaryons. Erythrocyte nuclei reactivated in murine NA neuroblastoma, 3 T 3, BHK and NRK cells, or in chicken fibroblasts expressed < 5 % <b>chick</b> globin compared with the <b>chick</b> erythrocyte-L 6 myoblast heterokaryons. The amount of globin expressed in heterokaryons correlated with globin mRNA levels. Hemin increased beta globin synthesis two- to threefold in <b>chick</b> erythrocyte-NA neuroblastoma heterokaryons; however, total globin synthesis was still < 10 % that of L 6 heterokaryons. Distinct from the variability in globin expression, <b>chick</b> erythrocyte heterokaryons synthesized <b>chick</b> constitutive polypeptides in similar amounts independent of the mammalian parental cell type. ~ 40 constitutive <b>chick</b> polypeptides were detected in heterokaryons after immunopurificatio...|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film publication, <b>Chick</b> Hewes (Lytell) decides to go straight after being released from Sing Sing, and is anxious to keep his younger brother Benny (Hughes) and his young wife from a life of crime. <b>Chick</b> gets a job, but loses it when he is hounded by the police.

5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The <b>chicks</b> hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough <b>chicks</b> are almost naked, but the <b>chicks</b> of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down.

5|$|<b>Chicks</b> hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. <b>Chicks</b> defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older <b>chicks</b> are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter.

5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of <b>chicks</b> in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood <b>chicks</b> and somewhat less than 40% of second brood <b>chicks.</b> The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, <b>chicks</b> are fed by their mother {{to a greater or}} lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live <b>chicks</b> hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chicks</b> are fed by {{the parents}} for several days after fledging. The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two <b>chicks</b> each.|$|E
5|$|The egg size is {{independent}} of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy <b>chicks</b> are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched <b>chicks</b> for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The <b>chicks</b> fledge 31–41days after hatching.|$|E

5|$|The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey <b>chicks</b> that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the <b>chicks</b> for three months, and the <b>chicks</b> remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young <b>chicks</b> are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. <b>Chicks</b> leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the <b>chicks</b> sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which <b>chicks</b> fledge varies dramatically. The <b>chicks</b> of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their <b>chicks</b> away from the nest at an early age. In most species, <b>chicks</b> leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross <b>chicks</b> leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. <b>Chicks</b> may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, the <b>chicks</b> are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the <b>chicks</b> {{begin to}} move around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. <b>Chicks</b> are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to <b>chicks</b> than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
40|$|Inactive nuclei of <b>chick</b> {{erythrocyte}} resume RNA synthesis {{and increase}} in volume and dry mass in heterokaryons made by virus-induced fusion of human tumor cells (HeLa) with <b>chick</b> erythrocytes.

5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the <b>chicks</b> form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} <b>chicks.</b> A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for <b>chicks</b> to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial <b>chicks</b> are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the <b>chicks,</b> often bringing large prey items. When the <b>chicks</b> reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their <b>chicks.</b> As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, <b>chicks</b> spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. <b>Chicks</b> of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the <b>chicks</b> does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size.
