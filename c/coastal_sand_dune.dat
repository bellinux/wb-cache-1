30|$|As {{detailed}} by {{the records}} of Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the number of sake breweries in the coastal areas around Tokyo Bay during Japan’s Taisho era (1912 – 1926) was 5 – 10 times higher than at present (Suzuki 1997). A freshwater layer forms under <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> {{and it is this}} water that is used in sake brewing. Chiba Prefecture’s Tokyo Bayside, near the Japanese capitol, is formed on <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> This area flourished in ship transportation in the Edo era (1603 – 1868), and there were many sake breweries there. The sake brewing conducted there used the water from the freshwater layer in its brewing processes, making use of an ecosystem service. The term “ecosystem service” means the benefits that human beings receive from the bounty of nature. Sake breweries have been supporting this region for a few hundred years, and brewing has received the natural benefits of the <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> (terrain, soil, water quality, etc.). However, because these areas faced Tokyo, there has been extensive infrastructure maintenance and coastal development since the high economic growth period of the 1960 s. The <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> of Tokyo Bayside have been affected by urban development, and most of the sake breweries have closed.|$|R

50|$|Coastal {{residential}} and commercial development and roadway construction have fragmented and destroyed habitat used by this species. Hurricanes, tropical storms, and dune use by pedestrians have also damaged or destroyed sand dunes and related habitats. Stalking by domestic and wild cats, {{as well as other}} animals, plus competition from other rodents have also contributed to Alabama beach mouse declines.The Alabama beach mouse is one of several subspecies of old field mice living only in <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> areas. These small light-colored mice burrow and nest in dunes and are primarily active at night. They eat various plant seeds and insects.

50|$|Uniola paniculata or sea oats, {{also known}} as seaside oats, araña, and arroz de costa, is a tall {{subtropical}} grass that {{is an important component}} of <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> and beach plant communities in the southeastern United States, eastern Mexico and some Caribbean islands. Its large seed heads that turn golden brown in late summer give the plant its common name. Its tall leaves trap wind-blown sand and promote sand dune growth, while its deep roots and extensive rhizomes act to stabilize them, so the plant helps protect beaches and property from damage due to high winds, storm surges and tides. It also provides food and habitat for birds, small animals and insects.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} soils and plant covers was {{conducted}} on the coastal plains of the western province of Saudi Arabia to clarify the relationships between the soil properties and the plant cover type. A belt transect of 80 m in length was established across each study area. Four mixed plant communities dominated by species such as: Tamarix nilotica in coastal sabkha, Saliconrnia qassimensis in <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> Aerva lanata in sand plains, and Bassia muricata in wadis areas were recognized. Soil types at the study area were determined to be sandy immature soil and peat lamina soil. Their horizon sequences were described as surface, subsurface and bottom layers, indicating layers of leaf litter, peat lamina and parent material, respectively. Coastal sabkha and <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> were characterized by a relatively high calcium concentration in the soil horizons and tendency for podzolization in the volcanic deposit layer. The subsurface layers in coastal sabkha and <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> were characterized by some peat lamina accumulation because of the high groundwater table, volcanic deposits in the soil profile and the strong influence of sea salt on the soil chemistry. The roots in the coastal sabkha and <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> were distributed more shallowly than those in the sand plains and wadi areas, thus avoiding the high water table level as well as the influence of seawater in the soil. Generally, the salt marsh showed high sodium concentration and base saturation, indicating that this area was directly affected by seawater. Recently, the periphery of the plant covers on the <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> has been declining because inundation caused by ground subsidenc...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a 6 -year research project to investigate the radioecology of temperate <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> Samples (n = 617) of soil, water and biota were collected from the Drigg <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> (West Cumbria, UK) between February 2005 and October 2007. Biota groups sampled included amphibians, birds, invertebrates, mammals, reptiles, plants (including lichens and mosses) and fungi. All samples were analysed for 40 K, 137 Cs and 241 Am. A sub-set of samples (n = 26) was analysed for 90 Sr, 99 Tc, 238 Pu and 239 + 240 Pu. Additional soil analyses included soil moisture, bulk density, pH, organic matter content, carbonate content and cation concentrations (Ca 2 +, K+, Na+ & Mg 2 +). The application of three publicly-available environmental radiation protection models (ERICA, R&D 128 /Sp 1 a & RESRAD-BIOTA) to an assessment of ionising radiation impacts at the Drigg <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> site was evaluated. Soil activity concentration data were used as input data and model results compared with measured activity concentrations in <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> biota. Radionuclide concentration ratios (CRs) were identified as an important source of variation in model predictions. For <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> small mammals, Am, Cs and Pu CRs were found to be 1 – 2 orders of magnitude lower than those for small mammals in other terrestrial ecosystems. For reptiles, the variability could be attributed to the paucity of data on transfer to this vertebrate group. Through literature review, mining of unpublished data sets and analysis of samples collected from the Drigg <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> CR databases were developed for reptiles (across a range of ecosystem types) and for <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> biota. Analysis of <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> soil data suggested that both sea-to-land transfer and the transport of sand grains in saltation influence the soil activity concentrations in <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> The low CRs for <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> biota may be due to low bioavailability of particulate-bound radionuclides.

50|$|Because {{sand dunes}} and beaches are {{extremely}} popular for outdoor recreation, {{the success of}} restoration and dune management depends {{a great deal on}} the information available and understanding of the public. This is important because not all aspects of sand dune management are obvious or important to the public if they do not understand why management is necessary e.g. stabilization. There are many ways in which information can be provided to the public including the erection of panels at entrances to dune walkways, leaflets, brochures, maps and council workers who can talk to the public about the importance of protecting sand dunes. Figure five shows a photo of a panel put up at Spencer Park by the Christchurch City Council indicating that people should not walk on the area, as it is an area for sand dune restoration. It needs to be re-iterated that sand dune restoration and protection is in the public’s best interest as the loss of sediment on any coast line leads to the erosion of beaches, which in turn leads to a loss of recreational value of many coastlines. The public needs {{to be aware of the}} role that sand dunes play in coastal protection, because without public support, <b>coastal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> management is virtually impossible.|$|E
