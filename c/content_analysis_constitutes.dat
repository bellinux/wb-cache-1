The item content is evaluated for its specific usefulness for measuring self-regulation of obesity patients. Qualitative facet analysis (QFA), an application of Guttmann’s Facet Theory, is used to investigate whether item content sufficiently covers the intended content area. This form of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>constitutes</b> a systematic, effective and critical tool for improving the content validity of questionnaires. It discovers topics that are underrepresented or overrepresented. The method offers a way to clarify the relationship between concrete item phrases and the desired content as defined by construct and theory. It allows the researcher to improve his or her understanding of the items as a stimulus and of the similarities of items, and allows the formulation of a possible structure for confirmative factor analysis.

40|$|The {{transition}} from a locally planned economy to a global knowledge economy in Russia features several conflicts between {{the old and the}} new. At the center of Russian restructuring stands the young talented. Considering the significance of talent for economic growth it is important to explore how talent is understood and managed by different Russian types of organizations. A group of experts (N = 46) were therefore selected {{to participate in the study}} representing government, business, and education. Data were gathered by means of semi-structured interviews on location in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Russia. The study was descriptive in nature and a straightforward qualitative <b>content</b> <b>analysis,</b> as <b>constituted</b> by the categorization of data, was employed. Results showed that all stakeholders identified talent as both high-achieving and creative. They also recognized structural difficulties in implementing talent support. Also, different groups had different understandings of the nature and societal purpose of talent. This article is concluded with focusing issues, derived from the data analysis, important to consider when establishing talent-dependent organizations or businesses in current Russia.

40|$|Individuals {{with special}} needs require support in {{acquiring}} various academic and social skills and mathematical skills {{are one of the}} most important skills in which individuals {{with special needs}} need to acquire in order to maintain their daily lives. Current approaches in education emphasize the importance of integrating technology into special education classrooms in order to increase achievement and facilitate learning and various technological tools are used in teaching mathematics to individuals with special needs. Therefore, special education teachers need to be competent in using technology in teaching mathematics and aim of this study is to determine the views and recommendations of special education teachers on technology use in teaching mathematics to students with special needs. Qualitative research method was used in the study. A total number of 15 special education teachers working at special education institutions in North Cyprus participated in the study. A semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was used to collect the data. Data of the study were analyzed using <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> method through <b>constituting</b> themes based on the answers of special education teachers.

40|$|Purpose of the article: The present {{manuscript}} summarizes {{benefits of}} the use of computer-based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> in a generation phase of foresight initiatives. Possible advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> for the foresight projects are discussed as well. Methodology/methods: In order to specify the benefits and identify the limitations of the <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> within the foresight, results of the generation phase of a particular foresight project performed without and subsequently with the use of computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool were compared by two proposed measurements. Scientific aim: The generation phase of the foresight is the most demanding part in terms of analysis duration, costs and resources due to a significant amount of reviewed text. In addition, the conclusions of the foresight evaluation are dependent on personal views and perceptions of the foresight analysts as the evaluation is based merely on reading. The <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> may partially or even fully replace the reading and provide an important benchmark. Findings: The use of computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool significantly reduced time to conduct the foresight generation phase. The <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool showed very similar results as compared to the evaluation performed by the standard reading. Only ten % of results were not revealed by the use of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool. On the other hand, several new topics were identified by means of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool that were missed by the reading. Conclusions: The results of two measurements should be subjected to further testing within more foresight projects to validate them. The computer based <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> tool provides valuable benchmark to the foresight analysts and partially substitute the reading. However, a complete replacement of the reading is not recommended, as deep understanding to weak signals interpretation is essential for the foresight...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{additional}} data regarding the reliability and validity of a previously developed Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> Scale (Seegmiller 2 ̆ 6 Epperson, 1987). The stability of Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores was investigated by obtaining two 5 -minute tape-recorded verbal samples from undergraduate student volunteers on separate occasions, approximately five weeks apart. Verbal samples were transcribed and analyzed to yield Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores. The resulting test-retest reliability coefficient was relatively low, yet statistically significant.;Three different methods were used to evaluate the validity of Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores. First, subjects 2 ̆ 7 verbal <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores were correlated with the scores they obtained on the Thinking/Feeling Scale of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and a significant correlation was obtained. Second, subjects 2 ̆ 7 <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores were correlated with the scores they obtained on the Thinking and Feeling Scales of the Singer-Loomis Inventory of Personality. The relationship between <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> scores and SLIP thinking/feeling preference scores was not statistically significant. However, a significant relationship was observed between subjects 2 ̆ 7 use of feeling verbs and their thinking/feeling preferences as assessed by the SLIP.;Finally, the relationship between Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> scores and counseling style preferences was investigated. It was hypothesized that thinkers would express a preference for a cognitive, problem-solving approach to counseling, whereas feelers would be more attracted to counseling that focused on feelings and emotions. To test this hypothesis, subjects viewed and evaluated two counseling style videotapes. The predicted relationship between <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> thinking/feeling preferences and counseling style preferences was not observed.;Considered together, the results of this study did not provide strong evidence either for, or against the reliability and validity of the Thinking/Feeling <b>Content</b> <b>Analysis</b> Scale.
