5|$|The Sector General series {{began as}} short stories {{published}} in New Worlds from 1957 onwards. Originally White intended {{to end the}} series with Star Healer (1985), by which time the central characters had reached the top levels in their careers, but Ballantine Books persuaded him to continue. He extended the stories' range by introducing new central characters beginning with <b>Code</b> <b>Blue</b> - Emergency (1987), and The Genocidal Healer (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues of guilt and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones.|$|E

He tells her that he understands what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a <b>code</b> <b>blue,</b> signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|The Mk. XIV was {{theoretically}} less {{accurate than}} the contemporary Norden bombsight but was smaller, easier to use, faster-acting and {{better suited to}} night bombing. It equipped {{the majority of the}} RAF bomber fleet during the war; small numbers of Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sights and Low Level Bombsight, Mark IIIs were used in specialist roles. A post-war upgrade, the T-4, also known by its rainbow <b>code</b> <b>Blue</b> Devil, connected directly to the Navigation and Bombing System to automate the setting of windspeed and direction and further increase accuracy.

Metro-North has assigned it the color <b>code</b> <b>blue,</b> used as trim on station signs and spot color on printed timetables.
