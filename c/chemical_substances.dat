5|$|Onions are {{cultivated}} {{and used}} around the world. As a food item, {{they are usually}} served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys.

5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and <b>chemical</b> <b>substances,</b> {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> {{which can}} be absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, and stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals. It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Japan {{has a large}} {{industrial}} capacity, and is {{home to some of}} the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, <b>chemical</b> <b>substances,</b> textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China. , Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Some 20 million people, around 17 per cent of the population, were below the poverty line in 2007. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|Siddiqui is {{credited}} for pioneering {{the isolation of}} unique chemical compounds from the Neem (Azadirachta indica), Rauwolfia, and various other flora. As the founder director of H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry, he revolutionised the research on pharmacology of various domestic plants found in South Asia to extract novel <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> of medicinal importance. During his career, Siddiqui published more than 300 research papers and obtained 40 patents mainly {{from the field of}} natural product chemistry. In addition to his scientific talents, Siddiqui was also an avid painter, a poet, and a great connoisseur of Western music. His paintings were exhibited in the United States, Germany, India, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> {{management in}} three U. S. manufacturing sectors from 1991 to 2008. Decomposition analysis applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index {{is used to}} analyze changes in toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> emissions by the following five factors: cleaner production, end-of-pipe treatment, transfer for further management, mixing of intermediate materials, and production scale. Based on our results, the chemical manufacturing sector reduced toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> emissions mainly via end-of-pipe treatment. In the meantime, transfer for further management contributed to the reduction of toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> emissions in the fabricated metal industry. This occurred because the environmental business market expanded in the 1990 s, and the infrastructure for the recycling of metal and other wastes became more efficient. Cleaner production is the main contributor to toxic chemical reduction in the electrical product industry. This implies that the electrical product industry is successful in developing a more environmentally friendly product design and production process. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

Other <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium chloride) and refined sugar (sucrose).
