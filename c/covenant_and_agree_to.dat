On the execution of these presents, I, Lobengula, King of Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and other adjoining territories, in exercise of my sovereign powers, and in the presence and with the consent of my council of indunas, do hereby grant and assign unto the said grantees, their heirs, representatives, and assigns, jointly and severally, the complete and exclusive charge over all metals and minerals situated and contained in my kingdoms, principalities, and dominions, together with full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure the same, and to hold, collect, and enjoy the profits and revenues, if any, derivable from the said metals and minerals, subject to the aforesaid payment; and whereas I have been much molested of late by divers persons seeking and desiring to obtain grants and concessions of land and mining rights in my territories, I do hereby authorise the said grantees, their heirs, representatives and assigns, to take all necessary and lawful steps to exclude from my kingdom, principalities, and dominions all persons seeking land, metals, minerals, or mining rights therein, and I do hereby undertake to render them all such needful assistance as they may from time to time require for the exclusion of such persons, and to grant no concessions of land or mining rights from and after this date without their consent and concurrence; provided that, if at any time the said monthly payment of one hundred pounds shall be in arrear for a period of three months, then this grant shall cease and determine from the date of the last-made payment; and further provided that nothing contained in these presents shall extend to or affect a grant made by me of certain mining rights in a portion of my territory south of the Ramaquaban River, which grant is commonly known as the Tati Concession.|$|E
50|$|In response, the Half-Way Covenant {{provided}} a partial church membership {{for the children}} and grandchildren of church members. Those who accepted the <b>Covenant</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> follow the creed within the church could participate in the Lord's supper. Crucially, the half-way covenant provided that the children of holders of the covenant could be baptized in the church. These partial members, however, couldn't accept communion or vote.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold. The Chancery {{prisoner}} {{had been there}} {{long enough to have}} lost his friends, fortune, home, and happiness, and to have acquired the right of having a room to himself. As he laboured, however, under the inconvenience of often wanting a morsel of bread, he eagerly listened to Mr. Pickwick's proposal to rent the apartment, <b>and</b> readily <b>covenanted</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> yield him up the sole and undisturbed possession thereof, in consideration of the weekly payment of twenty shillings; from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be chummed upon it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1722, Virginia Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood had {{arranged}} the Treaty of Albany with the (then) Five Nations. [...] That treaty renewed the <b>Covenant</b> Chain <b>and</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> recognize the Blue Ridge Mountains as the demarcation between the Virginia Colony and the Five Nations (who {{that same year}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Six Nations" [...] with the addition of the Tuscarora).|$|R
5000|$|Goff {{acquired}} such fame as {{an advocate}} of reforms {{in the interest of}} women that her reputation as an author was lost sight of, but was recalled by her suit against T. B. Peterson & Bro., of Philadelphia, for US$135 and the interest on that sum. Goff alleged in her complaint that she wrote a story entitled Who Cares? and that when she turned the manuscript over to Peterson & Brother, she took their word that it would make 300 pages, <b>and</b> she <b>covenanted</b> <b>and</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> pay therefor the sum of $1.33 and 1/3 cent per stereotyped page. That was $400. After it was published, she claimed that it only came to 198 pages, and that the publisher would not return the difference. Further than this, although set forth as a cause of action, the story is about a poor erring girl, a Magdalen, who finds it very hard to lead a reformed life. Everybody's hand is raised, not to help her, but to push her back into the mud again. Peterson & Brother issued a circular to the newspapers saying that the story was [...] "an autobiography {{in the form of a}} novel". Goff wrote back to have it turned end for end, [...] "A novel in the form of an autobiography". But they went ahead, and Goff was wroth because it was advertised that this was the story of her life. She thought of beginning suit against Peterson & Brother in Pennsylvania, for libel, with large damages. There was one more issue: she wanted it published anonymously, and got Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler to write an introduction. But the publisher printed her name on the title page, and she didn't like that.|$|R
50|$|In 1721 and 1722, Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia {{concluded}} a new Treaty at Albany with the Iroquois, renewing the <b>Covenant</b> Chain <b>and</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>to</b> recognize the Blue Ridge as the demarcation between Virginia Colony and the Iroquois. But, as European settlers {{began to move}} beyond the Blue Ridge and into the Shenandoah Valley in the 1730s, the Iroquois objected. Virginia officials told them that the demarcation was to prevent the Iroquois from trespassing east of the Blue Ridge, but it did not prevent English from expanding west. Tensions increased over the next decades, and the Iroquois {{were on the verge of}} going to war with the Virginia Colony. In 1743, Governor Gooch paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley that was claimed by the Iroquois. The following year at the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois sold Virginia all their remaining claims in the Shenandoah Valley for 200 pounds in gold.|$|R
