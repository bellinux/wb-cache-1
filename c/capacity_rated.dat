40|$|An entropy {{theory is}} {{formulated}} for deriving infiltration equations for potential <b>rate</b> (or <b>capacity)</b> of infiltration in unsaturated soils. The theory {{is comprised of}} five parts: (1) Tsallis entropy, (2) principle of maximum entropy (POME), (3) specification {{of information on the}} potential rate of infiltration in terms of constraint, (4) maximization of entropy in accordance with POME, and (5) derivation of the probability distribution of infiltration and its maximum entropy. The theory is illustrated with the derivation of six infiltration equations commonly used in hydrology, watershed management, and agricultural irrigation, including Horton, Kostiakov, Philip two-term, Green-Ampt, Overton, and Holtan, and the determination of the least biased probability distributions underlying these infiltration equations and the entropies thereof. The theory leads to the expression of parameters of the derived infiltration equations in terms of three measureable quantities: initial infiltration <b>capacity</b> (potential <b>rate),</b> steady infiltration rate, and soil moisture retention capacity. In this sense, these derived equations are rendered nonparametric. With parameters thus obtained, infiltration <b>capacity</b> <b>rates</b> are computed using these six infiltration equations and are compared with field experimental observations reported in the hydrologic literature as well as the <b>capacity</b> <b>rates</b> computed using parameters of these equations obtained by calibration. It is found that infiltration <b>capacity</b> <b>rates</b> are computed using parameter values yielded by the entropy theory are in reasonable agreement with observed as well as calibrated infiltration <b>capacity</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

The approved design adhered to the models of vessels built at Middle Atlantic ports, which {{was referred to as}} “Cod’s head and mackerel tail” design, that featured maximum beam foreword of the center of a hull, and tapering to a square stern assembly. Constellation had significant deadrise and sharp raking bow and stern sections below the load waterline. Humphreys' frigates sailed well in light or heavy seas in a weatherly manner despite their square-sail rig. The frigates had architectural elements of a French class of razee frigates that were unlike the more burdensome designs of Royal Navy warships.

In contrast, if the passenger <b>capacity</b> utilization <b>rate</b> of the train is reduced from 40. 00 %, the efficiencies of its traction energy cost and passenger transport both decrease obviously and such decreases are evidently affected by its target speed.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the above results, the high {{reversible}} <b>capacity,</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, and excellent cycling life of the LiMn 2 O 4 porous hollow nanofibers are due to the novel porous hollow structure. Firstly, the porous nanostructure can provide more reaction sites for the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ and shorten the diffusion path for Li+, leading to the better rate capability [31, 32]. Secondly, the hollow structure with high crystallinity possesses a high structural stability. The manganese could not be dissolved easily from the spinel phase because of the robust structure. Thirdly, the hollow structure could effectively relieve the structural strain and volume change which can be much more helpful for its long-term circulation. All of them contribute to the high reversible <b>capacity,</b> <b>rate</b> capability, and good cycle performance of porous hollow LiMn 2 O 4 nanofibers as the cathode for LIBs.|$|R
