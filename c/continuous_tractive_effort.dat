500|$|The {{heavy loads}} of coal on BM drove GE's design choices on the E60C. GE chose a six-axle (C-C) design, with [...] wheels {{instead of the}} {{standard}} [...] wheels. This was necessary because of the locomotive's 85:21 gearing. With this gearing a maximum speed of [...] was possible, although the standard operating speed on the BM was [...] Thyristor rectifiers step down the high-voltage AC to provide DC power {{at a much lower}} voltage to six GE780 traction motors, one per axle.

50|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> curves {{often have}} graphs of rolling {{resistance}} superimposed on them—the {{intersection of the}} rolling resistance graph and <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> graph gives the maximum velocity (when net <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is zero).|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the work – {{research}} on <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of tractor „zetor forterra 125 “. 	The course of the research – dynamometer was designed and constructed for <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> measuring. <b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of the tractor „zetor forterra 125 “ researched using by methodology. The study was evaluated different types of surface (meadow, gravel, asphalt), and diferent preasure of the tires (low, medium, high). Also determinined the rear and two axels of <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> values. 	The results – the investigation found that the rear whlees <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> values was the grass by 29 kN, on the gravel 18 kN, on the asphalt 18 kN. As well as found that front wheel drive tractor <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> increases on the grass by 35, 6 %, on the gravel 51, 4 %, on the asphalt 49, 4 %. The largest <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> values of tractor were determined when the torque transmitted to both drive axels. Also found, when tire pressure was (1, 3, 1, 9 atm) on the soft ground <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> was higher than hard surface (asphalt) ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{new engine}} {{is capable of}} {{producing}} 4,600hp, but only 4,400 tractive horsepower. With a new computer software for the on-board computer and one inverter per axle (or [...] "P6"; EMD named it [...] "Individual Axle Control") - unlike most of previous EMD locomotives that use one inverter per truck, the SD70ACe-T4 is capable of generating 200,000lbf. (889.64kN.) of starting tractive effort, and 175,000lbf. (778.75kN.) of <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b> Meanwhile, its dynamic braking effort is as much as 105,000lbf. (467.25kN.) The amount of starting tractive effort is {{equal to that of}} the 6,000hp SD90MAC-H while, on the other hand, its <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is higher than that of the SD90MAC-H (175,000lbf. vs. 165,000lbf.). Due to the [...] "Individual Axle Control", the locomotive will have improved reliability performance and maintenance. The units are also equipped with [...] "radial bogies" [...] which offer increased adhesion and better ride quality.|$|E
2500|$|The SD70ACe is the {{successor}} to the older SD70MAC. Built from 2004 to 2014 in the United States, the SD70ACe was originally designed to comply with EPA Tier 2 locomotive emissions regulations. Beginning in 2012, newly built SD70ACe's were EPA Tier 3 compliant. SD70ACes are equipped with EMD's 16-710-G3C-T2 prime mover, rated at later Tier 3 models are rated at [...] They are rated at [...] <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> ( [...] starting).

2500|$|The SD70M is {{equipped}} with D90TR DC traction motors and the 710G3B prime mover. They are capable of generating [...] of <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b> From mid-2000, the SD70M was produced with SD45-style flared radiators allowing for the larger radiator cores needed for split-cooling. Split-cooling is a feature that separates the coolant circuit for the prime mover and the circuit for the air pumps and turbocharger. [...] There are two versions of this radiator: the older version has two large radiator panels on each side, and the newer version has four square panels on each side. [...] This modification was made {{in response to the}} enactment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Tier 1 environmental regulations. Also the truck was replace with HTCR-4, instead of HTCR-I on former model.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{tractive}} effort: Maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{is defined}} as the highest tractive force that can be generated under any condition that is not injurious to the vehicle or machine. In most cases, maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is developed at low speed and may be the same as the starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calculated in {{the usual}} way (assuming equal <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> from the two engines and mean {{effective}} pressure adding up to 0.85 times boiler pressure) the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> was 135,200 lb in compound; in the US, compound Mallets were credited with 20% more <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> in simple mode, or 162,200 lb for the Virginian locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Its 105 lt 13 lcwt kg {{adhesive}} weight and the SAR's ultra-conservative practice of reporting a Mallet's <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> at only 50% of boiler pressure {{resulted in a}} much lower than actual starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 48370 lbf kN. The Class MH was almost certainly capable of exerting more than 60000 lbf kN <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> at starting.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{locomotive}} {{was equipped}} with two MAN L12V18/21A diesel engines, each set to produce 1000hp (750kW) at 1445 rpm. [...] This conservative rating was partly because NBL was very inexperienced at constructing diesel locomotives and partly because the Voith L306r three speed transmissions {{available at the time}} were not able to accept more. [...] MAN had refined the engine design to produce [...] at around the time the D600 order was placed with NBL. [...] The A1A-A1A wheel arrangement likewise came about because the BTC-mandated heavyweight construction required 6 axles to keep to a 20-ton axle loading, but NBL could not work out how to create a pivotless bogie and driving arrangement for C-C wheel arrangement. [...] There were no C-C diesel-hydraulic locomotives to use as a template in mid-1955. [...] The arrangement produced a <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 39,600lbf (176kN) at 12.6mph (20.3km/h). [...] Unusually for a British diesel locomotive, the D600s had spoked wheels. [...] They could work in multiple with each other or up to two D6300 locomotives using the orange square coupling code.|$|E
50|$|The MK5000C {{generated}} 118000 lbf kN of <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> {{and produced}} around 35% adhesion on dry rail.|$|E
50|$|British railway {{companies}} {{have been reluctant to}} disclose figures for drawbar horsepower and have usually relied on <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|The numbers 28 and 36 {{designate}} the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (pulling force) of the locomotives {{in thousands}} of pounds. The <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of K-28s is rated at 27500 lbf kN, and the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of a K-36 is a 36200 lbf kN. The weight of a K-28 with a full tender is 254500 lb, and a K-36 weighs 286600 lb with a full tender.|$|R
50|$|For other {{numbers and}} {{combinations}} of cylinders, including double and triple expansion engines the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{can be estimated}} by adding the <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> due to the individual cylinders at their respective pressures and cylinder strokes.|$|R
50|$|Slip (also {{known as}} creep) is {{normally}} roughly {{directly proportional to}} <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b> An exception is if the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{and is no longer}} linear. With a little higher applied <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> the wheel spins out of control and the adhesion drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye—the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{having a}} {{hydrodynamic}} coupling, hydrodynamic torque multiplier or electric motor {{as part of}} the power transmission system may also have a maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> rating, which is the highest tractive force that can be produced {{for a short period of}} time without causing component harm. The period of time for which the maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> may be safely generated is usually limited by thermal considerations. such as temperature rise in a traction motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the graph is shown at right. The line AB shows {{operation}} at the maximum tractive effort, the line BC shows <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> that is inversely proportional to speed (constant power).|$|E
5000|$|... {{tractive}} effort inversely varies with speed {{at any given}} level of available power. <b>Continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is often shown in graph form at a range of speeds {{as part of a}} {{tractive effort}} curve.|$|E
50|$|During 1218's {{excursion}} career, it was {{the most}} powerful operational steam locomotive in the world, with a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 125,897 lbf kN, well above the next-strongest-pulling operational steam locomotive (Union Pacific 3985, with a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 97350 lbf kN). Unlike diesel-electric locomotives of similar high <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (for starting heavy trains) but typical for a steam locomotive, it could easily run at 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) and more.|$|R
50|$|Starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{calculated}} in {{the usual}} way (85% mean effective pressure) comes out 76,400 lbf kN, but the engine used 70% limited cutoff (presumably to increase port openings at short cutoff) so the railroad claimed a correspondingly lower <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{the figure}} often quoted when {{comparing}} {{the powers of}} steam locomotives, but is misleading because <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> shows the ability to start a train, not the ability to haul it. Possibly the highest <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> ever claimed was for the Virginian Railway's 2-8-8-8-4 Triplex locomotive, which in simple expansion mode had a calculated starting T.E. of 199,560 lbf (887.7 kN) [...] - [...] but the boiler could not produce enough steam to haul at speeds over 5 mph (8 km/h).|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{over the}} pre-rebuilt {{locomotives}} which were realised in the Class 39-000 include microprocessor control, 26% more maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> and 15% more tractive horse-power, and a Knorr-Bremse electronic brake rack (EBR) {{to replace the}} old pneumatic braking controls.|$|E
50|$|The F7 {{differed}} from the F3 primarily in internal equipment (mostly electrical) and some external features. Its <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> rating was 20% higher (e.g. 40000 lb for an F7 with 65 mph gearing, compared to 32500 lb for an F3 with the same gearing.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{classified}} as a Box-Cab model 0440-E-166-4-GE-228-A by General Electric, delivered new to the Canadian Northern Railway. Each unit weighed 174,000 lbs kg. They had a B+B wheel arrangement, a maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 19,600 lbf kN, capable of operating at a maximum safe speed of 55 mph [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} {{diesel-electric locomotives}} offer a starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of [...] for EMD F40PH-2 and [...] for MPI M36PH-3C; in comparison, the six-car KISS EMU has a starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of , meaning {{the acceleration of}} the EMU should be substantially better than current trains.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the boiler}} {{pressure}} {{was set to}} blow off at , which gave the engine a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 53750 lbf kN at 50% of boiler pressure. The setting was later reduced to , which reduced the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> to 48370 lbf kN at 50% of boiler pressure.|$|R
50|$|Drawbar pull is a {{function}} of velocity, and in general decreases as the speed of the vehicle increases (due both to increasing resistance and decreasing transmission gear ratios). Drawbar pull is the difference between <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> available and <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> required to overcome resistance at a specified speed.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{locomotives}} (type Bo′Bo′ {{according to}} UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements) shall provide a <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{of more than}} 240 kN, freight locomotives (Co′Co′) more than 480 kN and all weather adhesion shall be at least 33%.Passenger locomotives shall be equipped to provide head end power (HEP) to the train.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous {{tractive}} effort: <b>Continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is the {{tractive force}} {{that can be}} maintained indefinitely, as distinct from the higher tractive effort that can be maintained for a limited period {{of time before the}} power transmission system overheats. Due to the relationship between power (P), velocity (v) and force (F), described as: ...|$|E
50|$|Compared to the, on average, thirty-year-old {{existing}} TFR {{diesel-electric locomotive}} fleet at the time, the Class 43-000 also offered a greater <b>continuous</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{and a higher}} adhesion capability, allowing {{the same amount of}} freight to be hauled with fewer locomotives by replacing four of the older locomotives with three of the new models.|$|E
50|$|Freight {{locomotives}} {{are designed}} to produce higher maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> than passenger units of equivalent power, necessitated by the much higher weight that is typical of a freight train. In modern locomotives, the gearing between the traction motors and axles is selected to suit the type of service in which the unit will be operated. As traction motors have a maximum speed at which they can rotate without incurring damage, gearing for higher <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{at the expense of}} top speed. Conversely, the gearing used with passenger locomotives favors speed over maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
50|$|Within two years, the CSAR {{would be}} {{transformed}} by P.A. Hyde, its first Chief Locomotive Superintendent, who introduced these 4-6-2 Pacifics with an adhesive weight of 39 tons and a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 22170 lbf kN, the Class 10 4-6-2 Pacifics with an adhesive weight of 46 tons and a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 24470 lbf kN and the Class 11 2-8-2 Mikados with an adhesive weight of 62 tons and a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 30780 lbf kN.
