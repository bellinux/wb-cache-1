Φ is {{often associated with}} the real contact area S, which can be monitored independently by, for example, optical or acoustic methods (Dieterich and Kilgore 1994; 1996; Nagata et al. 2008; 2012). The exponential form of the constitutive law implies that the physical mechanism behind it is a thermally activated <b>creep</b> <b>driven</b> by very high shear stresses at the real contacts of an imperfectly welded interface (Heslot et al. 1994; Nakatani 2001). Macroscopically, Φ in Equation 1 can be regarded as an extension of classical frictional strength because Φ is the shear stress required to move the interface at a reference velocity V∗, noticing that a larger applied shear stress τ is required for a larger Φ. Smaller a means higher sensitivity of slip velocity to the applied stress, which makes the behavior closer to the traditional strictly threshold-type friction. Throughout this paper, we call Φ either state or strength, depending on the context.|$|R

Two base geometries are investigated consisting of a previously proposed curved-straight channel and a newly developed double-curved channel with no straight sections. Use of the S-model kinetic equations enables investigation with realistic values of the Prandtl number and viscosity index for argon and nitrogen as well as for Maxwell molecules. For each gas, the pumping performance and flow structure of each base geometry are investigated for three channel aspect ratios and an array of Knudsen numbers finely spaced between 0. 1 and 2. 0 to allow performance extrema to be identified. The influence of Prandtl number is found to be significant with increased maximum mass flow rates for argon and nitrogen. The impact of viscosity index is found to be comparatively minor. The double-curved geometry is found to generate over twice the mass flow rate. Both geometries are also tested in pumping array configurations involving multiple sections with the newly introduced geometry again providing superior performance...|$|R
40|$|Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR) {{is known}} to be a serious problem for {{concrete}} worldwide, especially in high humidity and high temperature regions. ASR is a slow process that develops over years to decades and it is influenced by changes in environmental and loading conditions of the structure. The problem becomes even more complicated if one recognizes that other phenomena like creep and shrinkage are coupled with ASR. This results in synergistic mechanisms that can not be easily understood without a comprehensive computational model. In this paper, coupling between creep, shrinkage and ASR is modeled within the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) framework. In order to achieve this, a multi-physics formulation is used to compute the evolution of temperature, humidity, cement hydration, and ASR in both space and time, which is then used within physics-based formulations of cracking, creep and shrinkage. The overall model is calibrated and validated on the basis of experimental data available in the literature. Results show that even during free expansions (zero macroscopic stress), a significant degree of coupling exists because ASR induced expansions are relaxed by meso-scale <b>creep</b> <b>driven</b> by self-equilibriated stresses at the meso-scale. This explains and highlights the importance of considering ASR and other time dependent aging and deterioration phenomena at an appropriate length scale in coupled modeling approaches...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn many applications, large shear stresses develop at interfaces between dissimilar materials during thermo-mechanical excursions, {{when there is}} {{a significant difference in the}} coefficient of thermal expansion between them. When the system is elevated to a high homologous temperature for one of the adjoining materials, the applied shear stress may allow the interface to slide without debonding by a diffusionally accommodated mechanism, thereby allowing relative dimensional changes to occur. The purpose of this dissertation is to establish the kinetics and mechanism of interfacial creep and to evaluate its impact on thin film structures used in microelectronic devices. Studies of interfacial creep kinetics were based on diffusion-bonded interfaces in Si-Al-Si sandwich specimens, which were loaded in a double-shear configuration with the interfaces being subjected to a nominal shear stress during creep tests. In some tests, a normal stress was superimposed on the applied shear stress to articulate the role of the normal stresses, which are often present at interfaces. It was found that in agreement with previous results, the interface crept by interfacial diffusion-controlled diffusional <b>creep</b> <b>driven</b> by the applied shear stress, with the applied normal compressive stress resulting in a threshold behavior below which no creep occurred. The effect of interfacial roughness was also evaluated and the results showed that the interfacial creep rate decreased for specimens with larger interfacial roughness. The impact of interfacial creep in interconnect structures in microelectronic devices were observed via atomic force microscopy for (a) stand-alone thin film Cu lines on Si and (b) Cu lines embedded in a low k dielectric on Si substrates. Following thermal cycling, changes were observed in the in-plane Cu line dimensions, as well as the out-of plane step height between Cu and dielectric in single layer structures. Both effects were attributed to interfacial diffusion-controlled interface sliding. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{models of}} metasomatic flow {{do not allow}} for the effect that {{reaction}} has on the flow patterns. Instead, {{it is assumed that}} the volatiles produced are negligible in volume compared to those infiltrated and that reaction does not modify permeability. This is clearly unlikely to be true for infiltration-driven decarbonation reactions. The rates of porosity creation by reaction and porosity loss by creep have been calculated for a representative volume of calcite –quartz-wollastonite marble, and it is found that, even for a weak calcite matrix, the rate of porosity generation by reaction is likely to outstrip the collapse of porosity, as long as the system is out of equilibrium. We have applied a self-consistent 1 D finite-difference model to the reaction of calcite + quartz to wollastonite in a 10 m thick marble, in response to influx of H 2 O rich fluid, with fixed boundary conditions. The model allows us to evaluate the effect of reaction on the porosity structure and fluid pressure variation across the layer, from which local Darcy fluxes can be evaluated. The progress of reaction that we model is constrained by hydrological considerations, with the requisite parameters recalculated as reaction progresses, assuming creep compaction of rock under the stress difference between lithostatic and fluid pressures. We fnd that the volume of fluid realised by decarbonation, driven by influx of H 20, is sufficient to create a back-flow, so that further advancement of the reaction front is only possible as a result of diffusion of water against the Darcy flux. The effect of <b>creep</b> <b>driven</b> by differences between fluid pressure and lithostatic pressure is to reduce the permeability of the layer and especially reduce the secondary porosity developed in the zone at and behind the advancing reaction front. We predict that in a 3 D situation, the porous zone of reacted marble becomes a conduit for layer-parallel flow, and the secondary porosity is infilled by calc-silicate minerals due to silica metasomatism. ...|$|R

The deformation mechanisms controlling whether fast slip or slow creep occurs, however, remain unclear. Here, we present evidence that pressure solution <b>creep</b> (fluid-assisted stress <b>driven</b> mass transfer) is an important deformation mechanism in megathrust faults. We quantify megathrust strength using a laboratory-constrained microphysical model for fault friction, involving viscous pressure solution and frictional sliding. We find that at plate-boundary deformation rates, aseismic, frictional–viscous flow is the preferred deformation mechanism at temperatures above 100 [*]°C. The model thus predicts aseismic creep at temperatures much cooler than the onset of crystal plasticity, unless a boundary condition changes. Within this model framework, earthquakes may nucleate when a local increase in strain rate triggers velocity-weakening slip, and we speculate that slip area and event magnitude increase with increasing spacing of strong, topographically derived irregularities in the subduction interface...|$|R

Dielectric {{elastomers}} (DEs) {{have attracted}} significant attention {{in recent years}} and have been found to provide excellent overall performance in actuation-based application. This thesis will introduce the fundamentals of DEs, derive the field and finite element equations for simulating its deformation, and then focus on numerically studying electromechanical instabilities, in particular electrostatically <b>driven</b> <b>creep</b> and the effect of pre-stretch on surface (creasing) instabilities. First, a nonlinear, dynamic finite element model coupled with a finite deformation viscoelastic constitutive law is utilized to study the inhomogeneous deformation and instabilities resulting from the application of a constant voltage to dielectric elastomers. Theoretical studies are performed of two problems that have been experimentally observed, i. e. electromechanical snap-through instability and bursting drops in a dielectric elastomer. In general, increasing the viscoelastic relaxation time leads to an increase in time needed to nucleate the electromechanical instability. However, it is found that the time needed to nucleate the instability of these two cases scales with the relaxation time. Second, the effect of pre-stretch on the performance of dielectric elastomers is studied. Two cases are studied, the electromechanical snap-through instability under equibiaxial pre-stress, and a strip under uniaxial pre-stretch. It is found that prestress markedly increases the stability of the elastomers, while pre-stretch increases the critical field for electro-creasing instability. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

However, JE(20 T) in Bi- 2212 wires of several meters length, {{as well as}} longer pieces wound in coils, rarely exceeds 200 A/mm 2. Moreover, long-length wires often exhibit signs of Bi- 2212 leakage after melt processing that are rarely found in short, open-end samples. We studied the length dependence of JE of state-of-the-art powder-in-tube (PIT) Bi- 2212 wires and gases released by them during melt processing using mass spectroscopy, confirming that JE degradation with length is due to wire swelling produced by high internal gas pressures at elevated temperatures [1, 2]. We further modeled the gas transport in Bi- 2212 wires and examined the wire expansion at critical stages of the melt processing of as-drawn PIT wires and the wires that received a degassing treatment or a cold-densification treatment before melt processing. These investigations showed that internal gas pressure in long-length wires <b>drives</b> <b>creep</b> of the Ag sheath during the heat treatment, causing wire to expand, lowering the density of Bi- 2212 filaments, and therefore degrading the wire JE; the creep rupture of silver sheath naturally leads to the leakage of Bi- 2212 liquid.

40|$|The {{underestimation}} of {{the size}} of recent megathrust earthquakes illustrates our limited understanding of their spatiotemporal occurrence and governing physics. To unravel their relation to associated subduction dynamics and long-term deformation, we developed a 2 -D continuum viscoelastoplastic model that uses an Eulerian-Lagrangian finite difference framework with similar on- and off-fault physics. We extend the validation of this numerical tool to a realistic subduction zone setting that resembles Southern Chile. The resulting quasi-periodic pattern of quasi-characteristic M 8 –M 9 megathrust events compares quantitatively with observed recurrence and earthquake source parameters, albeit at very slow coseismic speeds. Without any data fitting, surface displacements agree with GPS data recorded before and during the 2010 M 8. 8 Maule earthquake, including the presence of a second-order flexural bulge. These surface displacements show cycle-to-cycle variations of slip deficits, which overall accommodate ∼ 5 % of permanent internal shortening. We find that thermally (and stress) <b>driven</b> <b>creep</b> governs a spontaneous conditionally stable downdip transition zone between temperatures of ∼ 350 °C and ∼ 450 °C. Ruptures initiate above it (and below the forearc Moho), propagate within it, interspersed by small intermittent events, and arrest below it as ductile shearing relaxes stresses. Ruptures typically propagate upward along lithological boundaries and widen as pressures drop. The main thrust is constrained to be weak due to fluid-induced weakening required to sustain regular subduction and to generate events with natural characteristics (fluid pressures of ∼ 75 – 99 % of solid pressures). The agreement with a range of seismological, geodetic, and geological observations demonstrates the validity and strength of this physically consistent seismo-thermo-mechanical approach...|$|R

The differential drives are each rated at 295 rad/sec (2800 rpm) input speed, 450 N-m (4, 000 in-lbf) output torque. The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf). The Dual Input Differential Roller-Gear Drive (DC- 700) has a planetary roller-gear {{system with a}} reduction ratio (one input driving the output with the second input fixed) of 29. 23 : 1. The Dual Input Differential Roller Drive (DC- 500) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of approximately 24 : 1. Each of the differential drives features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed. Its single roller cluster consists of a sun, five first and five second row planets, a roller cage or spider and a ring. Outputs are taken from both the roller cage and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two differential drives, the Differential Roller Drive had better linearity and less cogging than did the Differential Roller-Gear Drive, but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the Differential Roller Drive assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the Differential Roller-Gear Drive and 86 % for the Differential Roller Drive. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller <b>creep.</b> This <b>drive</b> was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the Differential Roller Drive. Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction. The initial preload level setting was low so roller slip was encountered at higher torques during testing...|$|R
40|$|Creep in {{the crust}} and mantle is {{commonly}} considered a steady-state process. This view prevails {{despite the fact}} that earthquakes do not represent steady-state and {{at the base of the}} seismogenic zone, for example, the stresses that <b>drive</b> <b>creep</b> must vary with the earthquake cycle. The contribution of transient versus steady-state behavior is not easy to determine from naturally-deformed brittle or plastic rocks and our view of steady-state depends on whether we consider geological or shorter time-scales. Perhaps we avoid a non steady-state picture because we lack appropriate descriptive or quantitative tools. The aim of the 2010 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in rock deformation is to explore what we know about non steady-state deformation and how we might advance our understanding through geological and geophysical field investigations, laboratory experiments and modeling. This will require an appraisal of the applicability of steady-state concepts as well as an exploration of transient behavior, in which processes and physical properties cycle between different states as might be the case during earthquake cycles, and transitions in behavior, where finite strain or changing environmental conditions lead to changes in processes and properties. Conference sessions will cover seven broad and interlinked topics. (1) What is steady state?; an appraisal of applicability of the steady-state concept in rock deformation. (2) Seismogenic Faulting and Brittle Fault Rocks; where transience in rates and conditions are accepted but not fully understood. (3) Episodic Creep During the Seismic Cycle; with a focus on processes in areas adjacent to the base of the seismogenic zone. (4) Creep in Zones of Stress and Temperature Cycling; considering deformation in real-world complex systems (5) Deformation, Metamorphism, and Fluids; exploring the interaction of diagenesis/metamorphism and thermal instabilities with deformation. (6) Mechanism and Microstructure Transitions During Deformation; quantifying evolution as a function of strain and associated with changes in deformation kinematics or conditions. (7) Mechanism and Microstructure Transitions Related to Mantle Geophysics; with a focus on the link between mechanisms affecting processes on geological time-scales on the time-scales associated with seismic wave propagation. The GRC on Rock Deformation aims to bring together researchers with diverse expertise, and to shape the scientific debate and provide inspiration for young researchers to fill the still extensive gaps in our knowledge of how the Earth deforms. The processes that will be discussed have wide applications in both basic and applied research. A key issue, of fundamental importance to our understanding of the Earth, for discussion at this meeting will be the transition from time-dependent (and distributed) rock deformation, including both high temperature creep and brittle creep, to episodic (and more localized) events. Such transitions have both a scientific and a socio-economic impact since they control the precursory phases of important geohazards such as earthquake rupture and volcanic eruptions, and also influence effective recovery of hydrocarbon and geothermal energy resources, and the integrity of long-term storage facilities for hazardous waste...|$|R
