40|$|Purpose The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} correction factors, math formula for a PTW- 31016 ionization chamber on field sizes from 0. 5 cm × 0. 5 cm to 2 cm × 2 cm for both flattened (FF) and flattened filter-free (FFF) beams produced in a TrueBeam clinical accelerator. The secondary objective was the determination of field output factors, math formula over this range of field sizes using both Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and measurements. Methods math formula for the PTW- 31016 chamber were calculated by MC simulation for field sizes of 0. 5 cm × 0. 5 cm, 1 cm × 1 cm, and 2 cm × 2 cm. MC simulations were performed with the PENELOPE code system for the 10 MV FFF Particle Space File from a TrueBeam linear accelerator (LINAC) provided by the manufacturer (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA). Simulations were repeated taking into account chamber manufacturing tolerances and accelerator jaw positioning in order to assess the uncertainty of the <b>calculated</b> <b>correction</b> factors. Output ratios were measured on square fields ranging from 0. 5 cm × 0. 5 cm to 10 cm × 10 cm for 6 MV and 10 MV FF and FFF beams produced by a TrueBeam using a PTW- 31016 ionization chamber; a Sun Nuclear Edge detector (SunNuclear Corp., Melbourne, FL, USA) and TLD– 700 R (Harshaw, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The moment distribution, necessary for correction of the spine, is supposed to be opposite to the moments caused by the gravitation force.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} {{to carry out}} the correction of analytical results affected by systematic errors due to the matrix effect is proposed. Two types of external calibrations must be established with the purpose to estimate the matrix effect: solvent calibration (SC) and matrix-matched calibration (MC).

40|$|Copyright © 2014 Nature Publishing GroupRegional {{temperature}} {{change over the}} twentieth century has been strongly influenced by aerosol forcing [1, 2]. The aerosol effect {{is also expected to}} be pronounced on regional precipitation change [3]. Changes in historical precipitation—for the global mean and land mean of certain regions—should be more sensitive to spatially heterogeneous aerosol forcing than greenhouse gas forcing [4, 5, 6, 7]. Here, we investigate whether regional precipitation and temperature respond predictably to a significant strengthening in mid-twentieth-century Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude (NHML) aerosol forcing. Using the latest climate model experiments, we find that observed regional {{temperature change}}s and observed Northern Hemisphere tropical land precipitation changes are consistent with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [8] aerosol forcing estimate, but observed NHML land precipitation changes show little evidence of an aerosol response. This may be a result of changes in precipitation measurement practice that increased observed precipitation totals {{at the same time that}} aerosol forcing was expected to reduce them [9]. Investigating this inconsistency, we calculate the required increase in early-twentieth-century observed NHML land precipitation to bring this result in line with aerosol forcing. Biases greater than this <b>calculated</b> <b>correction</b> have been identified in countries within the NHML region previously, notably the former Soviet Union [9, 10].
