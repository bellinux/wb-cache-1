50|$|During World War II, Binangonan {{was one of}} the {{evacuation}} centers for the residents of Manila and neighboring suburbs. People hid in the mountains and in Talim Island. The war brought untold difficulties and sufferings. Schools were temporarily closed; professionals turned to fishing, buy and sell for living. Many died of starvation, malnutrition and diseases while others survived by eating camote tops, papaya, corn, coconut and vegetables. Several people were killed when the Japanese machine- gunned the Rizal Cement Factory.Months after the Japanese occupied the town, Faustino Antiporda organized Bantay Sunog, a brigade tasked in maintaining peace and order by providing volunteer males as nightly guards against looters and trouble makers. At that time, Col. Augustin Marking was recruiting members for his guerrilla unit. Thus, the brigade became the local guerillas secretly affiliated with Markingâ€™s group.Major Teofilo Cenido was appointed mayor of the provost marshal of military police. Weapons available then were one Springfield Rifle and five Granadora from five USAFFE soldiers who escaped from Bataan.In 1942, Japanese troop, guided by two Filipinas, landed in Matikiw and inspected the Rizal Cement Factory. Resisting local guerillas were killed by the invaders. Filipino reinforcement retaliated by wiping out the entire Japanese troop. Dead soldiers, initially buried in the factory, were dug up and fed to the kiln. Even Japanese vessels were sunk in the lake to hide the massacre.Because of this, the Japanese held sona or the screening of all males in the town. The Japanese Kempetai punished suspected guerillas. In spite of the brutal torture inflicted on them, the Filipinos did not betray the guerrilla organization.Talim Island was also subjected to Japanese sona. On August 7, 1942, bombs were dropped in the neighboring towns killing four in Janosa and claiming a number of casualties in Cardona. Suspected guerillas were brought to Sta. Cruz, Laguna. Even the parish priest at that time, a Columbian Fr. Martin Strong, was held in Los Banos concentration <b>camp.Late</b> in 1944, the Makapilis identified mostly as Kapampangan's, a group of pro-Japanese Filipinos, occupied the convent and served as Japanese interpreters. They were instruments in the cruelties suffered by the Filipinos.|$|E
