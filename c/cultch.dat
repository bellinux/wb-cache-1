40|$|In India, edible oyster (Crassostrea madrasensis) {{farming is}} being practised by several farmers in central Kerala {{employing}} the rack and ren method in the estuaries and backwaters. However, farmed oysters {{do not find}} ready marketability due to the high labour costs involved in handling and shucking. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin, Kerala, has developed the hatchery technology for edible oyster spat production, both <b>cultched</b> and cultchless. Nevertheless, these have not been commercialised {{due to the fact}} that spat collection from wild is still the most feasible option in oyster farming. The aim of the present study was to produce cultchless spat in the farm site itself and rear it to commercial size for harvesting uniform sized regular, rounded single oysters...|$|R
40|$|Although {{oyster culture}} {{dates back to}} First century B. C., the {{development}} of hatchery techniques {{for the production of}} oyster seed on a year round basis is a recent innovation. Since early 1950 s attempts for large scale production of oyster seed have been initiated. Loosanoff and Davis (1952), Dupuy et al. (1977) and AQUACOP (1977) have successfully produced seed of the oysters Ostrea edulis, Crassostrea virginica and Crassostrea gigas. Nayar et al. (1984) have successfully accomplished the production of seed of C. madrasensis oh a large scale at the molluscan hatchery laboratory of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute at Tuticorin. At this hatchery <b>cultched</b> as well as free or cultchless spat are produced. The production of oyster seed by hatchery techniques is accomplished in six phases of operations viz., (1) Conditioning adult oysters for maturation of gonads (2) Induced spawning (3) Larval rearing (4) Culture of algal food (5) Preparation of spat collectors and (6) Setting of spat. These six functions although interrelated are independent phases of operation and easy to follow and implement...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{variations}} in salinity, temperature and pH were studied {{in relation to}} settlement of meroplanktonic oyster larvae on <b>cultches</b> in Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary along the southwest coast of India. A strong correlation between monthly pH values and oyster spat density (P= 0. 002) was evident. When the pH values in the estuary were low, the spat settlement density was poor (4. 5 /cultch), which was {{nearly half of the}} value (7. 8 /cultch) when the pH was alkaline. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of extremes of temperature (20 to 35 oC) and pH (6. 5 to 8. 5) on metamorphosis and survival of oyster larvae. In pH 6. 5 there was 100 % mortality and complete dissolution of dead shells in 24 h. Survival was highest (81 %) in the control temperature of 27 oC and less than 50 % in 25 and 20 oC. Treatment-wise differences in survival were significant (P< 0. 01). Study indicated that, if the pH drops below 7. 0 during the meroplanktonic phase of oyster, recruitment will be affected and therefore oyster spat densities can be used as an indicator for acidification in tropical estuaries...|$|R
50|$|Productivity of the Pacific oyster can be {{discussed}} {{as the amount}} of meat produced in relation to the amount of seed planted on <b>cultch.</b> The productivity of a farm also depends on the interaction of biotic factors, such as mortality, growth, and oyster size, as well as the quality of the seed and the growing technique used (off bottom, bottom, suspended or floating culture). The main causes of mortality in the Pacific oystere are: natural mortality (age), predators, disease, environmental conditions (ice, freak winds), competition for space (crowding of <b>cultch),</b> silting (sediment runoff from land) and cluster separation (process of breaking up clusters of oysters to into as many individual oysters as possible).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Oysters are a {{culturally}} and economically valuable {{source of food}} and often promoted as an environmentally sustainable food choice. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) provides a standardized means of assessing the environmental costs of a product but has not previously been applied to oyster production. This thesis develops and applies an LCA for a production system in the Pacific North West (PNW), where oyster farming represents {{a major part of}} aquaculture production. Contemporary PNW oyster production typically consists of a hatchery, Floating Upweller System (FLUPSY), grow-out, and processing subsystems. LCA was used to quantify a suite of global scale resource depletion and environmental impacts of single-seed oyster aquaculture (individually grown instead of <b>cultched),</b> from cradle to retail-gate, using five different impacts categories: global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), marine eutrophication potential (MEP), human toxicity potential (HTP), and cumulative energy demand (CED). Two varieties of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were analyzed using a functional unit (FU) of one dozen live oysters on the half shell: beach-grown oysters (trade name Classic Pacifics) and tide-tumbled oysters (trade name Shigokus). Results show electricity and fuel as the dominant contributors to impacts, with infrastructure, water use, and chemicals as minimal contributors. The contribution of each subsystem to total resource demand varied with each impact category. Production of Shigokus had slightly higher impacts overall, due to higher material use during the grow-out phase compared to Classic Pacifics, even though they have a higher survival rate. As a non-intensive and non-fed system, oyster aquaculture overall had low values per each impact category, confirming claims that they are a low environmental impact food choice...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the global}} Pacific oyster spat supply comes from the wild, but some is now {{produced}} by hatchery methods. The seed from the wild can either be collected by the removal of seaweed from beaches or by hanging shell (<b>cultch</b> in suspension from long lines in the open water. The movement towards hatchery-reared spat is important, as wild seed is susceptible to changeable environmental conditions, such as toxic algal blooms, which can halt the supply of seed from that region. In addition, several pests have been noted as considerable dangers to oyster seed. The Japanese oyster drill (Ocenebra japonica), flatworm (Pseudostylochus osterophagus), and parasitic copepod (Mytlilcola orientalis) have been introduced accidentally to aquaculture areas, and have had serious impacts on oyster production, particularly in British Columbia and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Pacific oysters have a pelagic veliger {{larval stage}} which lasts from 14-18 days. In the hatcheries, they are kept at {{temperatures}} of 25-28 ¬∞C with an optimum salinity between 20 and 25%. Early-stage veligers (<120 nm shell length) are fed daily with flagellate algae species (Isochrysis galbana or Pavlova lutherii) along with diatom species (either Chaetoceros calcitrans or Thalassiosira pseudonana). The larvae {{are close to}} a settlement stage when dark eye spots and a foot develop. During this time, settlement materials (<b>cultch),</b> such as roughed PVC sheets, fluted PVC pipes, or shells, are placed into the tanks to encourage the larvae to attach and settle. It is common, however, particularly on the US West Coast, for the mature larvae to be packed and shipped to oyster farms, where the farmers set the oysters themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} method the spat or seed {{are placed in}} a <b>cultch</b> within an {{artificial}} maturation tank. The maturation tank may be fed with water that has been especially prepared {{for the purpose of}} accelerating the growth rate of the oysters. In particular the temperature and salinity of the water may be altered somewhat from nearby ocean water. The carbonate minerals calcite and aragonite in the water may help oysters develop their shells faster and may also be included in the water processing prior to introduction to the tanks. This latter cultivation technique may be the least susceptible to predators and poaching, but is the most expensive to build and to operate. [...] The Pacific oyster C. gigas is the species most commonly used with this type of farming.|$|E

50|$|Olympia oysters are {{the only}} native oyster to the West Coast of North America.¬†The {{establishment}} of a commercial fishery in the 1860s confirms a historical population within Netarts bay, with evidence of harvesting along the West Coast of North America by humans going back 4000 years. Due to over harvesting, increased consumption, and the export of adult oysters to San Francisco Bay, oyster populations declined in the late 1800s and the commercial fishery collapsed. The last known naturally occurring population of Olympia oysters in Netarts was surveyed in 1954. Subsequent field surveys in 1979 and 1992 {{did not find any}} Olympia oysters within the bay. Potential factors preventing population recovery post fishery collapse include: habitat degradation, sedimentation by increased motorized boat use, suffocation by burrowing shrimp, pollution, predation by invasive¬†Japanese oyster drill¬†and parasitism by non-native flat worm After their 1992 survey, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began a large scale restoration attempt in Netarts, setting out 9 million spat between 1993-1998. Olympia oyster populations did not return to historical levels, but surveys in 2004 detected low populations of transplanted oysters in the bay. Anecdotal observations from residents also suggest small pockets of naturally occurring oysters subsist in the southwest corner of the bay. Juvenile oysters planted on adult oyster shell as substrate demonstrated that Olympia oysters can grow and reproduce in the bay. Small scale, investigative restoration projects run by The Nature Conservancy were undertaken in 2005 and 2006 to rebuild populations of Olympia oysters in Netarts Bay by adding shell <b>cultch</b> with set Olympia oysters to the bay in hopes of increasing settlement substrate and broodstock. Early monitoring of these sites found reproductive tissue and brooded larvae in adults and recruitment of larvae on shell substrate, but monitoring of the site ceased in 2007. Restoration interests are driven by culinary interest in Olympia oysters, the potential economic benefits of a commercial fishery, and the significant ecosystem services that Olympia oysters provide, including filtering the water and providing substrate for other organisms.|$|E

Concerns about unsustainable exploitation led to introduction of legislation that directed the oyster industry to aquaculture in 1884.

Half of the reef 2 ÃÜ 7 s veneer was the fresh oyster shell and the other half was mined material. Experimental trays were deployed on top of the sediment along the leeward reef base and sampled quarterly to test the hypothesis that fresh shell is the preferential <b>cultch</b> material of the Eastern Oyster, Crassostrea virginica, promoting more oyster and epifaunal community development than the mined material. Monthly field observations along the reef face monitored the oyster community development on both substrates. The unanticipated influence of the reef 2 ÃÜ 7 s presence on the local current flows resulted in significant sediment loading on the reef. The sediment inundated and smothered the experimental trays {{over the course of the}} study, thereby converting the trays from hard substrate to soft bottom habitats. Any influence the different substrates might have had on community development was overwhelmed by sediment burial.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Presentation date: 1981 - 09 - 29 A {{series of}} {{factorial}} experiments were conducted using eyed oyster larvae (Crassostrea gigas) reared at a commercial hatchery in Netarts, Oregon. The {{objectives of the}} study were to obtain the highest percentage of setting larvae and the best survival of the spat. Experiments on the combined effects of temperature and salinity indicated that temperature had a highly significant effect on the setting of Pacific oyster larvae. For temperatures ranging from 15 ¬∞- 30 ¬∞C, the percentage of larvae setting during a 48 -hour period increased as temperature increased. There {{was no significant difference in}} setting for salinities ranging from 15 - 30 ppt. In one setting experiment with Kumomoto larvae (a different variety of C. gigas), the differences among the sixteen combinations of temperature and salinity were statistically insignificant. Feeding larvae 120, 000 cells per milliliter of the alga Pseudoisochrysis paradoxa did not significantly improve setting during a 48 -hour period, and in one experiment temperature and feeding interacted to the detriment of setting. There was no significant difference in the percentages of attaching larvae when oyster, cockle, or butter clam shells were used as substrates. Dipping oyster or butter clam shells in an aqueous extract of oyster tissue improved setting, but the presence of the extract did not improve setting on razor or littleneck clam shells. Storing eyed larvae at 5 ¬∞C for several days before setting them appeared to increase the percentage of attaching larvae. The best temperature for setting stored larvae was 25 ¬∞C. Oyster larvae that attached to shell <b>cultch</b> during the setting experiments were held in a tank of raw seawater in the laboratory. After eight to nine months, the percentages of surviving spat were calculated. Survival was poor for larvae set at 15 ¬∞C, and there was some evidence of higher mortality among larvae stored for several days before being set. Because of the laboratory conditions, these studies may not have provided a realistic measure of spat survival under natural conditions, and field studies should be carried out to confirm these results...|$|E
