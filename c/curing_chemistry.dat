The molecular structures of the polymers produced were characterized and especially MALDI-ToF-MS yielded important information on the end-groups and other functional groups which are crucial for the <b>curing</b> <b>chemistry</b> of these resins. One special type of copolycarbonate in this study carried pendent vinyl groups, introduced by copolymerization of CHO and CO 2 with 4 -vinylcyclohexene oxide (VCHO). This copolycarbonate was first casted from solution, after which the polymer film was successfully cured with a trithiol compound by UV- or thermally induced radical <b>curing</b> <b>chemistry.</b> These cured coatings showed a good acetone resistance (= 75 double rubs) and reversed impact toughness. A powder coating evaluation of this CHO/VCHO-based copolycarbonate showed excellent processability, high pencil hardness (6 - 8 H), value zero in a Gitterschnitt test on aluminum, reasonable appearance in a ‘PCI-smoothness test’ (value 2 – 3) and good acetone resistance (= 75 double rubs). Most probably due to a too high Tg (85 – 104 °C) of the cured coating the reverse impact resistance was poor. A similar powder coating evaluation of a poly(ester-co-carbonate) based on CHO, PA and CO 2 showed less promising results due to poor flow properties and foaming above 140 °C.

Tannin–aldehyde and base-catalyzed autocondensed tannin resins were synthesized and characterized for molecular weight distribution, cure kinetics and <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry</b> by means of GPC, DMA and 13 C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy and solvent stability tests. The resins performance as wood adhesives was further established from lap-shear tests and microscopic observation of the bondline. Resins prepared with highly reactive aldehydes, such as formaldehyde or glyoxal, exhibited a significant extent of hetero-condensation reactions, fast cure kinetics, a high storage modulus and good solvent stability of the stage C-resin. In contrast, resins prepared with bulky aldehydes of low reactivity, such as citral, were dominated by autocondensation reactions, and exhibited slower cure kinetics, a lower storage modulus and solvent-stability of the stage C-resin, alike those neat autocondensed tannin resins. However, all resin systems fulfilled the standard requirements for wood adhesive bonding for interior applications.

40|$|Abstract. Waterproofing and {{breathable}} {{properties of}} newly developed polyurethane (PU) primers were investigated. Waterproofing performances were tested by water impermeability and water absorption. Breathability was tested by water vapor transmission. The {{results show that}} PU primer forms a waterproofing coating layer on the mortar surface and exhibits excellent breathable properties. The one-component water emulsifiable PU primer increases the water impermeability pressure of mortar specimens more than 30 %, while using two-component PU primer, the increase can reach more than 100 %. In addition, the coated mortar with PU primer shows much lower water absorption than bare mortar. The water-vapor transmission rates of water emulsifiable PU primer and two-component PU primer are about 1. 0 g/(m 2 ·h) and 0. 5 g/(m 2 ·h) respectively, which proves the excellent breathability of both PU primers.

40|$|Fourteen ether-containing, {{aromatic}} dianhydrides {{have been}} synthesized from N-phenyl- 3 or 4 -nitrophthalimide and various bisphenols. The process involves nucleophilic displacement of activated nitro groups with bisphenolate ions. Ether-containing dianhydrides were indefinitely stable {{in the presence}} of atmospheric moisture. One-step, high temperature solution polymerization of the ether-containing dianhydrides with m-phenylene diamine, 4, 4 '-oxydianiline and 1, 3 -bis(4 -aminophenoxy) benzene afforded 42 polyetherimides. The polyetherimides were all soluble in m-cresol except two which were found to be crystalline. The glass transition temperatures of the polyetherimides ranged from 178 to 277 C. Soluble polybenzimidazopyrrolones containing ether groups were also prepared from the same ether-containing dianhydrides and aromatic tetraamines by one-step solution polymerization. Using low molecular weight polyetherimides, various thermoset resin systems were developed and tested as matrices for fiber-reinforced composites.

This is of particular importance to NASA Langley Research Center because polyimides were proposed {{for use in the}} High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) program. Understanding the cure chemistry behind the polyimides would allow for intelligent processing of the composites made from their use. This work has led to two publications in peer-reviewed journals and a patent. The journal articles are listed as Appendix A which is on the instrument design of {{the research}} and Appendix B which is on the cure chemistry. Also, a patent has been awarded for the instrumental design developed under this grant which is given as Appendix C. There has been a significant amount of research directed at developing methods for monitoring cure reactions in real-time within the autoclave. The various research efforts can be categorized as methods providing either direct chemical bonding information or methods that provide indirect chemical bonding information. Methods falling into the latter category are fluorescence, dielectric loss, ultrasonic and similar type methods. Correlation of such measurements with the underlying chemistry is often quite difficult since these techniques do not allow monitoring of the <b>curing</b> <b>chemistry</b> which is ultimately responsible for material properties. Direct methods such as vibrational spectroscopy, however, can often be easily correlated with the underlying chemistry of a reaction.

Existing self-healing chemistries {{are limited by}} relatively weak chemical bonding between the matrix and the healing material, temperature stability, and side reactions that degrade the active components. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} a two-part system that incorporates a healing chemistry similar to the matrix <b>curing</b> <b>chemistry,</b> enabling chemical bonding between the healed material and the matrix material. Amine-containing microcapsules are synthesized by interfacial polymerization of a polyurea about a droplet of amine by means of suspension polymerization. Capsules are subsequently isolated and analyzed for content, and shown to contain reactive amine. The microcapsules containing reactive amine are employed in concert with microcapsules containing epoxy resin to recover fracture toughness in a cured epoxy. Both capsule types are dispersed in an epoxy resin and the resin is chemically cured. Mechanical load is applied to propagate a crack and rupture microcapsules contained within the cured resin. The average peak load at failure in a virgin specimen is recorded, and compared to the average peak load at failure in the same specimen after a healing period. Recovery of fracture toughness is limited to 15 % for specimens healed at temperatures of 50 oC and below, whereas healing efficiencies of up to 60 % are observed for specimens healed at temperatures above 80 oC. Control specimens where amine was not present failed to recover. Microcapsules containing isocyanate are also prepared by means of interfacial polyurea condensation. These capsules are also isolated and analyzed for content, and shown to contain reactive isocyanate. No healing was observed with these capsules, however, due to problems with bonding and long-term stability. With refinement, the isocyanate system is projected for use in polyurethane matrix materials where a moisture-cure could promote the healing reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} curing {{epoxides}} with amines {{has been for}} many years a route to obtain many useful materials, from everyday substances such as adhesives right through to thermoset resins used in advanced composite manufacture. This work will try to highlight how a combination of chemical and numerical techniques come together to aid the further understanding, of what is an extremely complex reaction. Chapter 1 (a) is a general review of epoxy resin <b>curing</b> <b>chemistry,</b> paying particular attention as to how {{our understanding of the}} process has developed over several decades, and highlights the various techniques used to study the reaction. Chapter 1 (b) describes the experimental approach taken in this work, namely that of using model reactants in combination with radiochemical techniques in order to gain kinetic information about cure reactions. In Chapter 2 the development of the various kinetic models is discussed. It is first described how, and on what basis, various aspects of the cure chemistry are incorporated into the model. One then goes on to describe the numerical analysis applied to the rate equations, and how this is incorporated within the model. The results of the two major aspects of the work are divided into two distinct areas. The first (Chapter 3) deals with the modelling of those reactions using a low initial concentration of primary amine (usually < 0. 6 M). These systems are devoid of many of the complicating features of cure reactions, and are shown to be modelled to a high degree of accuracy. In essence they are ideal systems, and ones which the initial model (KINET 31) used in this study is able to describe. Chapter 3 also describes some studies carried using aromatic diamines, and the modelling performed of these reactions. Chapter 4 on the other hand deals with those reactions which used high initial amine concentrations. By contrast the standard of modelling shown here with KINET 31 was much poorer. It is then described how various physical aspects of the cure reaction are investigated in an attempt to highlight the model's inadequacy. It is eventually shown how H-bonding of species, and the formation of pre-complexes, can play a very significant role in cure reactions. When the model is adapted to take these interactions into account a significant improvement is noted (KINET 31 H). Finally Chapter 5 deals with another interesting aspect of cure reactions, namely that of accelerators. With the model now taking into account the formation of the most are. significant pre-complexes, the reactivities of various -OH type accelerators are investigated...|$|E

An introduction is given in chapter one into the general chemistry of adhesives and their analysis, with particular emphasis on anaerobic adhesives and the crucial role played by transition metals in the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry.</b> In order to elucidate the role played by tertiary amines and saccahrin in anaerobic adhesives, polarography was used to monitor the concentrations of various transition metal species in the presence of selected cure components. In addition, cyclic voltammetry was used to measure the oxidation potentials of anaerobic adhesive accelerators at a range of pH values. A polarographic study of the reactions of elemental copper and iron in the presence of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinoline based cure systems was carried out in chapter three. The ability of iron and copper ions to decompose cumene hydroperoxide, and the influence of anaerobic adhesive accelerators on these reactions, was also studied. In chapter four, a brief introduction is given into the autoxidation of N-phenyl- 2 - propyl- 3, 5 -diethyl-l, 2 -dihydropyridine (DHP) and its potential as an initiator in rapid curing, surface insensitive one-part adhesives. A variety of analytical techniques were then used, including spectrophotometry and an enzyme-based biosensor, to conclusively prove that hydrogen peroxide is generated in the autoxidation of DHP.

40|$|Epoxy {{thermosets}} {{are important}} engineering materials with applications in coating, adhesives, packaging and as structural components {{in a variety}} of advanced engineering products. The ultimate performance of polymer critically depends upon the details of the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry</b> used to produce the thermoset. In order to better understand and monitor the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry,</b> quantitative analysis of the FT-IR response has been developed for describing the epoxy-amine curing reaction as well as monitoring the hydrogen bonding that occurs in these systems The FT-IR analysis includes (i) quantitative deconvolution of complex peaks into individual spectral contributions, (ii) peak identification via DFT analysis and (iii) appropriate baseline correction. These FT-IR analysis methods were utilized to resolve spectral complexity in epoxy-amine thermoset resin systems. Using the quantitative FT-IR tools described above, the hydrogen bonding of amine and hydroxyl groups was determined for (i) the self association and inter-association of N-methylaniline (NmA) and isopropanol and (ii) the reaction with a series of hydrogen bonding acceptors, including toluene, triethylamine, epoxy butane and dipropylether that represent ð-bond, electron pair on amine, epoxide and ether groups. Simple mass-action equilibrium models of the amine and hydroxyl group hydrogen bonding were developed, where both the extinction coefficient and equilibrium constants were determined from the data. However, this simple analysis was only valid for dilute concentrations, where an unexpected maximum in the free hydrogen as measured by FT-IR vs. total amount of NmA or isopropanol was observed. It was postulated that a phase transition occurs at high NmA or isopropanol concentrations. The epoxy-amine reaction kinetics was studied using quantitative FT-IR. First, the reaction kinetics of a monoepoxide with a monoamine was studied, where reaction kinetics was followed by (i) HPLC analysis and (ii) then compared with FT-IR analysis. Subsequently, quantitative FT-IR was applied to the thermoset system of a digylcidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy cured with aniline, where multiple absorbance profiles for the different vibrational peaks enabled self-consistent determination of the various reacting species. This analysis demonstrates the power of quantitative FT-IR analysis to follow detailed reaction kinetics in thermoset systems. The effect of temperature on the FT-IR spectra was measured for the fully cured Epon 825 -aniline system, where the hydrogen bonding peaks exhibited significant changes in temperature dependence of the absorbance near the Tg of 95 C. Finally relaxation of fully cured polymer was examined by observing the absorbance evolution following a temperature jump. In summary, quantitative FT-IR analysis provides valuable information on the chemical kinetics in curing thermoset systems as well as changes {{in the structure of the}} resulting glassy thermoset with temperature and sub-Tg thermal annealing. ...|$|R

The present work considers further the effect of cut-strip size, packing density and mode of orientation on <b>cured</b> leaf <b>chemistry</b> (starch, reducing sugars, and total alkaloids) and leaf quality. Results showed that <b>cured</b> leaf <b>chemistry</b> of 15. 2 × 22. 9 cm cut-strip more closely matched properties of whole leaf than pieces 15. 2 × 15. 2 cm or smaller. Starch contents were significantly higher for the smaller cut-strip sizes, perhaps due to edge drying effects, while alkaloids were significantly lower. Within the range of 194 to 292 kg/m, packing density had little effect on leaf chemistry, with the exception that reducing sugars were slightly lower for the higher packing densities. This could be due to a longer time for the drying front to move through the more tightly packed tobacco, and hence more respiratory loss of sugars. Government grades and average market prices of cured strips were essentially unaffected over the range of strip sizes or packing densities tested. Based on airflow resistance measurements and observed drying characteristics, vertical orientation of strips was far superior to horizontal orientation, both with vertical airflow through the tobacco. The higher packing density reduced specific energy use (kWh/kg green tobacco) by as much as 22 %, indicating potential energy savings for cut-strip over whole leaf curing...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the attitude of the scientific community towards reliability in electronic packages, with emphasis on the prevailing mechanisms for package failure under highly stressed environmental conditioning. Once this failure mechanism is fully developed, approaches to the resolution can be more rigorously applied. Overall, the predominant evidence points to moisture, both diffusivity and equilibrium weight gain, as the key factor in reduced reliability performance. Other fundamental polymer properties are important, but generally, methods are well established for adjusting these parameters. Moisture uptake is somewhat inherent to a particular chemistry type and this can direct the use of resin systems that are more suited to particularly moist environments. Epoxy resin systems, while pervasive in the electronics industry, do have limitations under humid environmental test conditions. Cyanate ester resin chemistry is claimed to have low moisture uptake by virtue of a non-hydrophilic cure mechanism. However, certain aspects of the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry</b> and side reactions with water can result in misleading predictions on humid environment performance. Siloxane-based materials present an attractive solution to many moisture related issues. Traditional condensation and addition cure silicone systems have, thus, found widespread use as packaging adhesives and encapsulants.

Spectral analysis of IR radiation emitted at the cure temperature from thin films of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) and 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) curing agent with and without GO allowed the cure kinetics of the interphase between the bulk resin and GO to be monitored in real time, by measuring both the consumption of primary (1 °) amine and epoxy groups, formation of ether {{groups as well as}} computing the profiles for formation of secondary (2 °) and tertiary (3 °) amines. OD was isolated from as-produced GO (aGO) by a simple autoclave method to give OD-free autoclaved GO (acGO). It has been found that the presence of OD on the GO prevents active sites on GO surfaces fully catalysing and participating in the reaction of DGEBA with DDM, which results in slower reaction and a lower crosslink density of the three-dimensional networks in the aGO-resin interphase compared to the acGO-resin interphase. We also determined that OD itself promoted DGEBA homopolymerization.

Products are available in a variety of forms, from paste-like materials to flowable adhesives. Both single- and multi-component versions are available, each with several different <b>cure</b> <b>chemistries.</b> The commercial importance of silicone sealants and adhesives is based on their unique combination of properties that permit them to satisfy important needs in a broad variety of markets. These properties include excellent weather and thermal stability, ozone and oxidation resistance, extreme low temperature flexibility, high gas permeability, good electrical properties, physiological inertness and curability by a variety of methods at both elevated and ambient temperatures. Because of their low surface energy, they wet most substrates, even under difficult conditions, and when formulated with suitable adhesion promoters, they exhibit very good adhesion.

A qualitative list of the features of siloxane polymers that contribute to the unique combination of properties of silicone sealants and adhesives relevant in construction applications is given in Table 1. Almost all these inherent attributes are a consequence of four fundamental aspects: the low intermolecular forces between dialkylsiloxane molecules, the dipolar nature and the strength of the siloxane bond and the flexibility of the siloxane backbone.

The organic acids used readily form complexes with these substrates, with saccharin having a better affimty for the copper substrate and maleic acid producing a better result on the iron containing substrate. The complexes formed between the organic acids and the tertiary amines depend on the position of the substituted group, with only the para-substituted amine forming a salt at the metal interface. The copper substrate was further modified with functionalised thiols and analysed, with respect to the effect these thiols produce on the corrosion resistance of the underlying substrate XPS combined with electrochemistry was used to study polycrystalline copper modified with functionalised thiols, HS- (CH 2) n-X, where X = COOH and OH The influence that chain length and immersion time had on monolayer formation was investigated, concluding that the longer chain carboxylic functionalised thiols lead to significantly better corrosion resistance for the time limits investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation was to develop an intrinsic UV and luminescence cure monitoring technique and to provide insight in understanding the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry</b> of polycyanate resins. UV-visible spectrum of a bisphenol A dicyanate ester (BPADCY) monomer during the cure reaction supported that the cyclotrimerization of cyanate esters to form triazine rings is the principal reaction. ^ A very strong luminescence emission was found during the cure reaction of BPADCY monomer. As the cure reaction proceeded, the fluorescence emission intensity around 420 nm first increased and then decreased accompanied by a small bathochromic shift. Eleven cure related model compounds representing reactants, intermediates and products were chosen, and their UV-Visible and fluorescence behaviors were characterized in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence behavior during cyclotrimerization of a monofunctional cyanate ester was also characterized. The model compound study indicated that the aromatic substituted triazines formed during the cure reaction and their inner filter effect {{were responsible for the}} emission around 420 nm and the observed trend in intensity. Fluorescence emission intensity of polycyanate resins heavily depended upon the measurement temperatures. Both bisphenol A as an impurity in monomer and cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalysts did not interfere with the emission at 420 nm. In situ fluorescence characterization was attempted for the cure reaction of cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalyzed BPADCY system. The phosphorescence emission wavelength of polycyanate resins appeared at about 20 nm longer than that of fluorescence. Phosphorescence lifetime was found to be about 20 ms at room temperature and remained relatively unchanged throughout the cure reaction. ^ FTIR in situ cure kinetics of BPADCY monomer indicated that the cure reaction in air was a little faster than in argon. A linear relationship was found between the consumption rate of cyanate ester groups and the formation rate of substituted triazine rings. ...|$|R
5000|$|Condensation curing {{systems can}} be one-part or two-part systems. [...] In one-part or RTV (room-temperature vulcanizing) system, a {{cross-linker}} exposed to ambient humidity (i.e., water) experiences a hydrolysis step and is left with a hydroxyl or silanol group. The silanol condenses further with another hydrolyzable group on the polymer or cross-linker and continues until the system is fully cured. Such a system will cure on its own at room temperature and (unlike the platinum-based addition cure system) is not easily inhibited by contact with other chemicals, though the process may be affected by contact with some plastics or metals and may not take place at all if placed in contact with already-cured silicone compounds. The crosslinkers used in condensation cure systems are typically alkoxy, acetoxy or oxime silanes such as methyl trimethoxy silane for alkoxy-curing systems and methyl triacetoxysilane for acetoxy-curing systems. In many cases an additional condensation catalyst is added to fully cure the RTV system and achieve a tack-free surface. Organotitanate catalysts such as tetraalkoxy titanates or chelated titanates are used in alkoxy-cured systems. Tin catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) {{can be used in}} oxime and acetoxy-cured systems. Acetoxy tin condensation {{is one of the oldest}} <b>cure</b> <b>chemistries</b> used for <b>curing</b> silicone rubber, and is the one used in household bathroom caulk. The smell of vinegar in the form of acetic acid is the usual indicator that the curing reaction is taking place. Non-acid-producing formulations also exist which have a shorter shelf-life, however, and reduced adhesion when finally cured. [...] Two-part condensation systems package the cross-linker and condensation catalyst together in one part while the polymer and any fillers or pigments are in the second part. Mixing of the two parts causes the curing to take place.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{application}} of modern electroanalytical techniques to the determination of analytes in complex media. The recent large increase in publications applying electroanalytical techniques to environmental, pharmaceutical and clinical applications is discussed in Chapter 1, including a discussion of electrode materials and their applications, the use of modified electrodes to improve selectivity and reduce electrode passivation, in addition to an overview of the use of electrochemical detection in flowing solution analysis. Chapter 2 describes the use of polarography at a dropping mercury electrode to investigate the <b>cure</b> <b>chemistry</b> o f anaerobic adhesives. The influence of transition metal ions, in the presence of accelerators, on the catalytic decomposition of the free radical initiators /-Butyl perbenzoate, /-Butyl hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide is discussed. The determination of clenbuterol in bovine urine is discussed in Chapter 3. The electrochemical characteristics of the | 3 -agonist were investigated at a bare carbon paste electrode. The application of a thin Nafion film to the electrode surface permitted accumulation o f clenbuterol onto the electrode surface {{while at the same time}} selectively excluding anionic interferences present in the urine sample. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to detect low levels of clenbuterol in urine. Amperometric and voltammetric detection coupled to capillary electrophoresis, applied to the determination of anionic phenolic acids in beer and wine, is outlined in Chapter 4. The passivation of the carbon fibre working electrode by the large concentration of neutral molecules present in the sample was overcome by injecting a large volume of diluted sample into the capillary, reversing the polarity to remove cations and neutral molecules from the capillary, and separating the remaining anions under normal conditions. Hydrodynamic voltammetry obtained amperometrically by the step-wise increase in potential were compared to voltammetric detection in the production of i-E curves for analyte identification. Conclusions drawn from the work carried out in the thesis and suggestions for future research are outlined in Chapter 5...|$|R
40|$|The basic <b>chemistry,</b> <b>cure</b> processes, properties, and {{applications}} of high temperature resins known as polyimides are surveyed. Condensation aromatic polymides are prepared by reacting aromatic diamines with aromatic dianhydrides, aromatic tetracarboxylic acids, or with dialkyl esters of aromatic tetracarboxylic acids, {{depending on the}} intended end use. The first is for coatings or films while the latter two {{are more suitable for}} polyimide matrix resins. Prepreg solutions are made by dissolving reactants in an aprotic solvent, and advances in the addition of a diamine on the double bond and radical polymerization of the double bond are noted to have yielded a final cure product with void-free characteristics. Attention is given to properties of the Skybond, Pyralin, and NR- 150 B polyimide prepreg materials and characteristics of aging in the NP- 150 polyimides. Finally, features of the NASA-developed PMR polyimides are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Part 2 of a {{study on}} comparative handling and curing characteristics of cut-strip vs. whole leaf tobacco. Part 1 considered the effect of leaf size (cut-strip size vs. whole leaf), packing density and mode of leaf orientation on <b>cured</b> leaf <b>chemistry</b> and leaf quality; whereas, the present study considers further the effect of leaf form, two yellowing times and two drying potentials during yellowing. Results showed that leaf chemistry and quality were quite similar for cut-strip (15. 2 × 22. 9 cm) and whole leaf. Insignificant differences were noted for cured leaf starch and sugars, although slightly lower levels of alkaloids (significant at the 0. 01 level) were observed for cut strip. Curing treatments significantly affected leaf chemistry. Increased yellowing time resulted in lower levels of starch {{and higher levels of}} sugar. Sugars were also higher for tobacco yellowed under the higher drying potential. The two forms of leaf responded similarly to different curing schedules (i. e. no interaction of leaf form with schedule). Also, government grade and price data were essentially unaffected by leaf form or curing schedule over the range of variables tested. Cured leaf starch was abnormally high on the average for both leaf forms. Interestingly, starch levels were lower when intact tobacco was bulk-cured in racks rather than box cured (6. 35 % vs. 9. 02 %). Since curing schedules were similar, air velocity in the two curing methods might be a factor. Also the cured leaf starch content was about 56 % lower for tobacco produced at the Oxford Tobacco Research Station (in a secondary study) than at the Central Crops Research Station. It is postulated that carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism during growth and maturation might be affected by excess rainfall events and/or nitrogen availability, with subsequent effects on starch-to-sugar conversion during curing...|$|R
40|$|Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) was <b>cured</b> through click <b>chemistry</b> by {{reaction}} of the azide group with bispropargyl succinate (BPS) through a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction to form 1, 2, 3 -triazole network. The properties of GAP-based triazole networks are compared with the urethane cured GAP-systems. The glass transition temperature (T-g), tensile strength, and modulus of the system increased with crosslink density, controlled by the azide to propargyl ratio. The triazole incorporation has a higher T-g {{in comparison to the}} GAP-urethane system (T-g- 20 degrees C) and the networks exhibit biphasic transitions at 61 and 88 degrees C. The triazole curing was studied using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the related kinetic parameters were helpful for predicting the cure profile at a given temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) -based theoretical calculations implied marginal preference for 1, 5 -addition over 1, 4 -addition for the cycloaddition between azide and propargyl group. Thermogravimetic analysis (TG) showed better thermal stability for the GAP-triazole and the mechanism of decomposition was elucidated using pyrolysis GC-MS studies. The higher heat of exothermic decomposition of triazole adduct (418 kJmol(- 1)) against that of azide (317 kJmol(- 1)) and better mechanical properties of the GAP-triazole renders it a better propellant binder than the GAP-urethane system...|$|R
